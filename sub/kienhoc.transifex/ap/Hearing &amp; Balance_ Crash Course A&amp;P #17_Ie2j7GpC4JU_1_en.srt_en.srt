1
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:07,299
Hello!

2
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:10,779
I’d like you to think about how I’m doing
this right now.

3
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:14,559
Not why I’m doing it, because of course,
I’m doing it because I like music and I

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,690
like science and I like to do both those things
at the same time.

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,760
But how can I play music? How can I be hearing
it right now?

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,740
And how can I walk around and play my guitar
at the same time without falling on my face?

7
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:29,219
And what is even sound anyway?

8
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:32,099
These are all good questions. Let’s start
with the last one, first.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,380
The basic answer to “What is sound?” goes
like this:

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,320
Sounds create vibrations in the air that beat
against the eardrum, which pushes a series

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,649
of tiny bones that move internal fluid against
a membrane that triggers tiny hair cells -- which

12
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,629
aren’t actually hairs -- that stimulate
neurons, which in turn send action potentials

13
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,719
to the brain, which interprets them as sound.

14
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:53,189
But there’s a lot more to our ears than
allowing us to experience the pleasure of

15
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:54,909
birdsong, or the pain of grindcore.

16
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:59,619
The ear’s often overlooked, but even more
vital role is maintaining your equilibrium,

17
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:03,339
and without THAT, you wouldn’t be able to
dance or strut or even stand up.

18
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,579
And you definitely could not do this!

19
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:08,239
At least not without throwing up.

20
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,899
In order to really get to the nitty-gritty
of how your ears pick up sound, you’ve got

21
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:23,530
to understand how sound works.

22
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:28,319
The key to sound transmission is vibration.
When I talk, my vocal folds vibrate. When

23
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,530
I slap this table top, or strum a guitar,
those vibrations cause air particles to vibrate

24
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,090
too, initiating sound waves that carry the
vibration through the air.

25
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,930
So this, sounds different than this, because
different vibrating objects produce differently

26
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,140
shaped sound waves.

27
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,560
A sound’s frequency is the number of waves
that pass a certain point at a given time.

28
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,049
A high-pitched noise is the result of shorter
waves moving in and out more quickly, while

29
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,109
fewer, slower fluctuations result in a lower
pitch.

30
00:01:55,108 --> 00:01:58,618
How loud a sound registers depends on the
wave’s amplitude, or the difference between

31
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,998
the high and low pressures created in the
air by that sound wave.

32
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:06,098
Now, in order for you to pick up and identify
sounds from beeping to barking to Beyonce,

33
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:09,419
sound waves have to reach the part of the
ear where those frequencies and air-pressure

34
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:14,379
fluctuations can register and be converted
into signals that the brain can understand.

35
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:17,439
So once again, it all boils down to action
potentials.

36
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,199
But, how does sound get in there?

37
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:26,179
Your ear is divided into three major areas:
the external, middle, and inner ear. The external

38
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,760
and middle ear are only involved with hearing,
while the complex hidden inner is key to both

39
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,669
hearing and maintaining your equilibrium.

40
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:38,099
So the pinna, or auricle, is the part that you can see,
and wiggle, and grab, or festoon with an earring.

41
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:42,010
It’s made up of elastic cartilage covered
in skin, and its main function is to catch

42
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:44,699
sound waves, and pass them along deeper into
the ear.

43
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:49,419
Once a sound is caught, it’s funneled down
into the external acoustic meatus, or auditory

44
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,488
canal, and toward your middle and inner ear.

45
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:57,090
Sound waves traveling down the auditory canal
eventually collide with the tympanic membrane,

46
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,289
which you probably know as the eardrum.

47
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:03,848
This ultra-sensitive, translucent, and slightly
cone-shaped membrane of connective tissue

48
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:06,988
is the boundary between the external and middle
ear.

49
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:11,158
When the sweet sound waves of your favorite
jam collide with the eardrum, they push it

50
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:16,859
back and forth, making it vibrate so it can pass those
vibrations along to the tiny bones in the middle ear.

51
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,080
Now, the middle ear, also called the tympanic
cavity, is the relay station between the outer

52
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,019
and inner ear. Its main job is to amplify
those sound waves so that they’re stronger

53
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:26,739
when they enter the inner ear.

54
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:30,778
And it’s gotta amplify them, because the
inner ear moves sound through a special fluid,

55
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,419
not through air -- and if you’ve ever gone
swimming you know that moving through a liquid

56
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,640
can be a lot harder than moving through air.

57
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,658
The tympanic cavity focuses the pressure of
sound waves so that they’re strong enough

58
00:03:40,658 --> 00:03:42,468
to move the fluid in the inner ear.

59
00:03:42,468 --> 00:03:47,090
And it does this using the auditory ossicles
-- a trio of the smallest, and most awesomely

60
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,450
named bones in the human body: the malleus,
incus, and stapes, commonly known as the hammer,

61
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:54,188
anvil, and stirrup.

62
00:03:54,188 --> 00:03:57,688
One end of the malleus connects to the inner
eardrum and moves back and forth when the

63
00:03:57,688 --> 00:03:58,628
drum vibrates.

64
00:03:58,628 --> 00:04:02,699
The other end is attached to the incus, which
is also connected to the stapes.

65
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:07,108
Together they form a kind of chain that conducts
eardrum vibrations over to another membrane

66
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:12,609
-- the superior oval window -- where they
set that fluid in the inner ear into motion.

67
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:18,129
The inner ear is where things get a little complicated,
but interesting and also kind of mysterious.

68
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:21,968
With some of the most complicated anatomy
in your entire body, it’s no wonder it’s

69
00:04:21,968 --> 00:04:23,478
known as the labyrinth.

70
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:28,798
This tiny, complex maze of structures is safely
buried deep inside your head, because it’s

71
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,960
got two really important jobs to do:

72
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,899
One, turn those physical vibrations into electrical
impulses the brain can identify as sounds.

73
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:42,370
And two: help maintain your equilibrium so
you are continually aware of which way is

74
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,780
up and down, which seems like a simple thing,
but it is very important.

75
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:51,198
To do this, the labyrinth actually needs two
layers -- the bony labyrinth, which is the

76
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,430
big fluid-filled system of wavy wormholes
-- and the membranous labyrinth, a continuous

77
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:01,519
series of sacs and ducts inside the bony labyrinth
that basically follows its shape.

78
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,180
Now, the hearing function of the labyrinth
is housed in the easy-to-spot structure that’s

79
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,400
shaped like a snail’s shell, the cochlea.

80
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:10,979
If you could unspool this little snail shell,
and cut it in a cross-section, you’d see

81
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,750
that the cochlea consists of three main chambers
that run all the way through it, separated

82
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,139
by sensitive membranes.

83
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:21,019
The most important one -- at least for our
purposes -- is the basilar membrane, a stiff

84
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:24,918
band of tissue that runs alongside that middle,
fluid-filled chamber.

85
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:29,168
It’s capable of reading every single sound within
the range of human hearing -- and communicating

86
00:05:29,168 --> 00:05:34,579
it immediately to the nervous system, because
right smack on top of it is another long fixture

87
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:39,359
that’s riddled with special sensory cells
and nerve cells, called the organ of corti.

88
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,610
So when your cute little ossicle bones start
sending pressure waves up the inner fluid,

89
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,129
they cause certain sections of basilar membrane
to vibrate back and forth.

90
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:50,850
This membrane is covered in more than 
20,000 fibers, and they get longer the

91
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,300
farther down the membrane you go.

92
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,300
Kind of like a harp with many, many strings,
the fibers near the base of the cochlea are

93
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,750
short and stiff, while those at the end are
longer and looser.

94
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,660
And, just like harp strings, the fibers resonate
at different frequencies.

95
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,160
More specifically, different parts of the
membrane vibrate, depending on the pitch of

96
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,289
the sound coming through. So the part of the
membrane with the short fibers vibrates in

97
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,189
response to high-frequency pressure.

98
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:17,668
And the areas with the longer fibers resonate
with lower-frequency waves.

99
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:21,019
This means that, all of the sounds that you
hear -- and how you recognize them -- comes

100
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:25,918
down to precisely what little section of this
membrane is vibrating at any given time. If

101
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,500
it’s vibrating near the base, then you’re
hearing a high-frequency sound. If it’s

102
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,579
shakin’ at the end, it’s a low noise.

103
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:35,439
But of course nothing’s getting heard until
something tells the brain what’s going on.

104
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,389
And the transduction of sound begins when
part of the membrane moves, and the fibers

105
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:42,060
there tickle the neighboring organ of corti.

106
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,410
This organ is riddled with so-called hair
cells, each of which has a tiny hair-like

107
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:50,310
structure sticking out of it. And when one
is triggered, it opens up mechanically gated

108
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:55,089
sodium channels. That influx of sodium then
generates graded potentials, which might lead

109
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:58,709
to action potentials, and now your nervous
system knows what’s going on.

110
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:02,598
Those electrical impulses travel from the
organ of corti along the cochlear nerve and

111
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:04,728
up the auditory pathway to the cerebral cortex.

112
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:08,899
But the information that the brain gets is
more than just, like, “hey listen up.”

113
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:13,228
The brain can detect the pitch of a sound
based solely on the location of the hair cells

114
00:07:13,228 --> 00:07:14,258
that are being triggered.

115
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:18,280
And louder sounds move the hair cells more,
which generates bigger graded potentials,

116
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,750
which in turn generate more frequent action
potentials.

117
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,639
So the cerebral cortex interprets all those
signals, and also plugs them into stored memories

118
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:30,550
and experiences, so it can finally say oh,
that’s a chickadee, or a knock at the door,

119
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,120
or the slow burn of an 80s saxophone solo,
or whatever.

120
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,439
So that’s how you hear.

121
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,629
But we’re not done with you yet -- we gotta
talk about equilibrium. The way we maintain

122
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:44,080
our balance works in a similar way to the
way we hear, but instead of using the cochlea,

123
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,408
it uses another squiggly structure in the
labyrinth that looks like it’s straight

124
00:07:47,408 --> 00:07:52,110
out of an Alien movie -- a series of sacs
and canals called the vestibular apparatus.

125
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,939
This set-up also uses a combination of fluid
and sensory hair cells. But this time, the

126
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:00,990
fluid is controlled not by sound waves but
by the movement of your head.

127
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:05,329
The most ingenious parts of this structure
are three semicircular canals, which all sit

128
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:07,818
in the sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes.

129
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:11,530
Based on the movement of fluid inside of them,
each canal can detect a different type of

130
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:15,969
head rotation, like side-to-side, and up-and-down,
and tilting, respectively.

131
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,730
And every one of the canals widens at its
base into sac-like structures, called the

132
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:24,500
utricle and saccule, which are full of hair
cells that sense the motion of the fluid.

133
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,019
So by reading the fluid’s movement in each
of the canals, these cells can give the brain

134
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:30,259
information about the acceleration of the
head.

135
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:34,799
So if I move my head like this, because I’m,
like, super into my jam, that fluid moves

136
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:38,848
and stimulates hair cells that read up and
down head movement, which then send action

137
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:43,169
potentials along the acoustic nerve to my brain, where
it processes the fact that I’m bobbing my head.

138
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:47,028
And, just as your brain interprets the pitch
and volume of a sound by both where particular

139
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:51,129
hair cells are firing in the cochlea and how
frequent those action potentials are coming

140
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:55,500
in, so too does it use the location of hair
cells in the vestibular apparatus to detect

141
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,578
which direction my head is moving through
space, and the frequency of those action potentials

142
00:08:59,578 --> 00:09:02,058
to detect how quickly my head is accelerating.

143
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:03,899
But things can get messy.

144
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:08,429
Doing stuff like spinning on a chair, or sitting
on a rocky boat, can make you sick because

145
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:12,309
it creates a sensory conflict. In the case
of me spinning around on my chair, the hair

146
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:16,629
cells in my vestibular apparatus are firing
because of all that inner-ear fluid sloshing

147
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:20,289
around — but the sensory receptors in my
spine and joints tell my brain that I’m

148
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:24,319
sitting still. On a rocking boat, my vestibular
senses say I’m moving up and down, but if

149
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,881
I’m looking at the deck, my eyes are
telling my brain that I’m sitting still.

150
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,900
The disconnect between these two types of movement,
by the way, is why we get motion sickness.

151
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,659
It doesn’t take long for my brain to get confused,
and then mad enough at me to make me barf.

152
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,259
Aaand I’m sorry that we’re ending with

But, we are. Today your ears heard me tell
you how your cochlea, basilar membrane, and

154
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:49,969
hair cells register and transduct sound into
action potentials. You also learned how different

155
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:54,540
parts of your vestibular apparatus respond
to specific motions, and how that helps us

156
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:56,079
keep our equilibrium.

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,540
