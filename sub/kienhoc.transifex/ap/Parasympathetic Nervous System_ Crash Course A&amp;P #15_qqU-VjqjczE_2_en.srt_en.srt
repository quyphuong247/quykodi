1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,339
Consider your heart for a moment.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:06,609
For the average person -- at rest, like you
probably are, sitting there watching me -- the

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,660
heart beats at around 60 beats per minute.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,660
Once a second. Nice and easy.

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,339
But if you were to somehow disconnect your
heart from your autonomic nervous system,

6
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:16,320
things, as you might imagine, would change.

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:20,989
But, your heart would not stop. Actually,
it would be the opposite.

8
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:21,980
It would speed up.

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,490
It would start beating at around 100 beats
per minute -- and that’s just at rest.

10
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:29,469
With your heart beating two-thirds faster
than normal, before you even broke a sweat,

11
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:33,310
your cardiac muscle would experience a lot
of extra wear and tear. The surrounding blood

12
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:37,219
vessels would be under enormous pressure.
And your body would suddenly require -- and

13
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:38,699
waste -- a lot of energy.

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,000
Basically, you’d be out of balance.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,770
Part of what keeps your heart under control
is your parasympathetic nervous system.

16
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:49,050
It’s often described as the calming side
of your autonomic system -- a kind of antidote

17
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,269
to the effects of stress created by the sympathetic
system.

18
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,660
But it’s really much more than that.

19
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:58,169
Unlike your sympathetic division, which lets
you deal with the crisis of the now, the parasympathetic

20
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,520
system allows your body to handle … everything
else.

21
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,260
It not only calms you down after being stressed
out, it’s what allows you to digest food,

22
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,320
to reproduce, to excrete waste, to fight off
infections.

23
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:11,219
Basically, it lets you do the business of
living.

24
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:15,170
But our bodies can only do that when they
are in balance, somewhere between excitement

25
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:19,439
and inhibition, both aroused enough and calm
enough to keep things working.

26
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,239
So the parasympathetic system is why our hearts
don’t pump so hard that they explode, sure.

27
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:25,280
But it also explains a lot of other stuff
about our bodies.

28
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,710
Oh, but just one thing?

29
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:30,279
Learning about the parasympathetic system
is going to involve a lot of memorizing.

30
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,760
Hope that doesn’t stress you out.

31
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,779
You will recall that our sympathetic & parasympathetic
systems not only have different functions

32
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,540
-- more or less engaging the same organs to opposite
effects -- they also have different structures.

33
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:55,420
Their ganglia, for example, are located in
different places: The sympathetic ganglia

34
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,180
are located near the spinal cord, while on the
parasympathetic side, they’re close to the effectors.

35
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,780
And likewise, the use of neurotransmitters in the
two systems is similar, but not quite the same.

36
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:10,060
In both systems, neurons release acetylcholine,
or ACh, in their preganglionic synapses.

37
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:15,530
But in your parasympathetic system, the postganglionic
neurons release ACh at their synapses with

38
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,919
the effector organs, too...

39
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,098
...as opposed to in the sympathetic system,
where effectors get a dose of norepinephrine instead.

40
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:24,919
But the biggest anatomical difference between
these two systems has to do with the physical

41
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:28,179
networks that they form as they reach throughout
your body.

42
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,439
While the sympathetic nerves all spring from
the thoracolumbar area of your spinal cord,

43
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:37,079
right around your midsection, the nerves of
the parasympathetic division are craniosacral.

44
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,140
And with the exception of a couple of sacral
nerves near the tailbone that run to the bladder

45
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:45,568
and genitals and rectum, most of these nerves
never go through the spinal cord.

46
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:49,439
Instead, they run right from the brain almost
all the way to their effectors.

47
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:55,280
There are 12 of these cranial nerves, and they vary
in terms of what kinds of neurons they contain.

48
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,479
I mean, we’re talking about the autonomic system
here, but they are not all autonomic motor fibers.

49
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:04,789
Some of your cranial nerves also carry motor
fibers that control voluntary functions, like

50
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:06,239
moving your eyeballs around.

51
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,459
And others carry only sensory fibers, which
relay data to and from your sensory organs.

52
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,519
And, you know, just to keep things interesting,
some of your cranial nerves carry both motor

53
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,959
and sensory neurons.

54
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,938
So, which ones are where? And what exactly
does each one of these 12 nerves do?

55
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:26,939
As anatomists, we have to keep track of the
human wiring-diagram that are cranial nerves,

56
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:30,759
because you don’t want to end up like some
sidekick in a ‘90s action movie who has

57
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,389
to defuse a bomb all by himself.

58
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:35,279
SHOULD I CUT THE RED WIRE OR THE BLACK WIRE?

59
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,878
Honestly, though, if you find yourself inside
of somebody’s brain stem you probably shouldn’t

60
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:40,199
be cutting anything.

61
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:44,419
Since all 12 of these cranial nerves are important,
you’re gonna have to come up with some kind

62
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:47,879
of mnemonics to help you keep track of both
their names and their functions.

63
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,680
You’ll need to know what each one is called, whether
it’s a sensory nerve, a motor nerve, or both.

64
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,040
And the map that we follow of the cranial
nerves is based on a ventral view of the brain

65
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:02,000
-- looking at its underside, with the anterior
portion at the top, and posterior on the bottom.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,830
First, let’s tackle the names.

67
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,769
Starting at the top, the first cranial nerve
you encounter is the olfactory nerve, which

68
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:11,169
takes scent information gathered by the nose
and sends it to the brain.

69
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:14,820
Followed by the optic nerve, which does the
same, but with visual data.

70
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:19,939
Then there’s oculomotor, which controls four of the six
muscles that control the movements of your eyes.

71
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:24,020
The next nerve, near the center of the brain’s
ventral side, is the trochlear nerve, which

72
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:28,399
controls a single muscle in the eye,
and it lets you do this.

73
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,489
Just below that is the trigeminal nerve, the
largest of the cranial nerves, which branches

74
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,278
into three main strands -- hence the ‘tri’
-- and innervates the face and jaw muscles.

75
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:41,519
After that there’s the abducens, which stimulates
the muscles that let your eyes do this -- from

76
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,788
side to side, followed by the facial nerve,
which operates the muscles that make most

77
00:04:45,788 --> 00:04:47,539
facial expressions possible.

78
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,680
Then there’s the auditory nerve. You can
probably guess what that’s for.

79
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,769
You might notice that, up until the auditory
nerve, the cranial nerves mostly control organs

80
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:58,088
in the front of the cranium -- mainly the
eyes and facial muscles.

81
00:04:58,088 --> 00:05:01,709
But as you work your way down, the nerves
tend to innervate the lower and more posterior

82
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:02,930
portions of the head.

83
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,649
Like the glossopharyngeal nerve, which leads
to your tongue and your pharynx.

84
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:10,288
That’s followed by your vagus nerve -- you
should definitely remember that one -- and

85
00:05:10,288 --> 00:05:14,498
then the spinal accessory nerve -- which has
to do with moving your head and shoulders,

86
00:05:14,499 --> 00:05:16,460
and not whether your belt matches your shoes.

87
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:20,838
Lastly there’s the hypoglossal, the nerve
that allows you to swallow and talk, among

88
00:05:20,838 --> 00:05:23,110
other things that you do with your mouth and
tongue.

89
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,420
That was a lot of information and probably new
words, so how are you gonna remember it all?

90
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,620
Well, by finding a way to remember the first
letter of each name, in order. Which is:

91
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,220
O-O-O .. T-T … A-F-A … G-V-S-H.

92
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,460
That doesn’t spell anything useful at all.
There is a mnemonic that you’ll probably

93
00:05:40,468 --> 00:05:42,248
hear in school that goes like this:

94
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:46,740
On old Olympus’ towering top, a Fin and
German viewed some hops.

95
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,949
That’s pretty weird sounding -- not terribly
easy to remember. I mean, Olympus? Fin? Hops?

96
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:55,838
There’s gotta be something more relevant
to us 21st century science lovers. Like, the

97
00:05:55,838 --> 00:05:59,278
Lord of the Rings fans out there might prefer
something along the lines of:

98
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,819
Onward old orcs! Toward the Argonath for a
Great Villain! Slay Hobbits!

99
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:05,959
I’m just trying to help.

100
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:09,338
Whatever device you use to remember the names
of the cranial nerves, you also have to keep

101
00:06:09,338 --> 00:06:14,699
track of their functions -- that is, whether
they’re sensory, motor, or both. So, again

102
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:19,459
from top to bottom, a lot of teachers use
this sequence of S’s, M’s and B’s to remember:

103
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:23,459
Some say marry money, but my brother says
big brains matter more.

104
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:27,079
That one’s not so bad. But I don’t know, maybe
you’ll have better luck with something like this:

105
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:32,139
Sorry, Sherlock -- Mean Moriarty Beat Me,
But Some Bobbies Busted Moriarty Masterfully!

106
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:36,838
You are, of course, invited to think up your
own. And feel free to share them in the comments,

107
00:06:36,838 --> 00:06:40,699
hopefully there will be some good ones down there
-- anything would be better than Fins and Hops

108
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:46,159
But if you’re going to commit one cranial nerve
type to memory, it should be 10, the vagus nerve.

109
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,400
This long and extensive nerve stretches from
near the brainstem down to most of your visceral

110
00:06:51,408 --> 00:06:53,990
organs, including your heart, lungs, and stomach.

111
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,509
The vagus nerves work as a two-way street,
ferrying incoming sensory information from

112
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:02,929
the peripheral system to the brain, and transmitting
outgoing motor instructions from the brain

113
00:07:02,928 --> 00:07:04,098
to the rest of the body.

114
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:08,009
So it’s a “B” nerve, because it has
“both” sensory and motor functions. And

115
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:12,509
usually you don’t notice this nerve at work,
because its functions are mostly automatic.

116
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:16,069
Say you’ve had a really stressful day, so
your sympathetic system is charged up. You

117
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,778
come home, crash on the couch, mow down a
half a pizza.

118
00:07:18,778 --> 00:07:23,118
Your stomach sends signals to your brain through
the sensory nerve axons in your vagus nerve,

119
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:26,169
telling you that your belly is full of starch
and protein and fat.

120
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:31,718
Your brain sees that your stomach is churning
away, which is a usual parasympathetic activity,

121
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:35,968
so it sends signals back down through the
vagus nerve, triggering other parasympathetic

122
00:07:35,968 --> 00:07:40,338
responses -- like slowing down your heart rate,
putting some glucose back into storage, and

123
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:44,209
reducing all that norepinephrine that your
sympathetic system was pumping out all day.

124
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:48,228
Soon, you start feeling more relaxed. Which
is just one reason why, for some people, eating

125
00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:52,738
is a way of reducing stress and anxiety. In
fact, it can feel so good that even though

126
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:55,118
your stomach is full, you might continue eating.

127
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:58,849
So, like I mentioned before, it can be easy
to think of the two divisions of your autonomic

128
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:02,738
system as opposites or even rivals, but that’s
a little off the mark.

129
00:08:02,738 --> 00:08:06,908
Looking at your body as a whole, you should
picture them as two sides of a scale -- sometimes

130
00:08:06,908 --> 00:08:11,099
it’s balanced in the middle, and sometimes it leans
to the left or right, depending on what's happening.

131
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:17,160
That balance is the essence of homeostasis, and
as you’ll recall, homeostasis is the key to life.

132
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,900
Here’s something else that’s important
for life: sex.

133
00:08:19,908 --> 00:08:24,209
It mostly falls within the parasympathetic
domain of “necessary but not an emergency.”

134
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:27,720
But in order to effectively do it, you need
help from both systems.

135
00:08:27,728 --> 00:08:31,788
First, the parasympathetic system has to make
sure you’re calm enough to even think about

136
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:35,668
sex, and then funnel extra blood away from
your muscles and down to your genitals -- which

137
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:38,860
is why too much stress and anxiety can lead
to sexual dysfunction.

138
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:43,908
But you also need a burst of that sympathetic
system to excite you, and keep you excited.

139
00:08:43,908 --> 00:08:48,039
So like two sides of the scale, the balance
depends on having the right amount of both.

140
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:52,379
The rate of action potentials travelling through
each division is known as your “sympathetic

141
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:54,320
tone” and your “parasympathetic tone.”

142
00:08:54,328 --> 00:08:58,508
And, most of the time, our parasympathetic
tone is actually dominant, keeping down the

143
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:00,909
caged animal that is your sympathetic response.

144
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:04,870
That’s why you need your parasympathetic
system to keep your heart from racing like

145
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,909
a rabbit’s. And why, most of the time, our
bodies can do the eating, and sex-having,

146
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:12,818
and all of the other fun tasks that make up
the business of living.

147
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:16,909
Today on Crash Course: Anatomy & Physiology
we looked at the parasympathetic nervous system,

148
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:21,409
its structural differences from the sympathetic
system, and the 12 cranial nerves. We also

149
00:09:21,409 --> 00:09:25,899
looked at the vagus nerve as a way of understanding
how parasympathetic responses work, and how

150
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,479
they make our lives possible.
