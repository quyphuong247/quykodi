1
00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:04,060
You may not know it, but your body is engaged
in a never-ending battle.

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:08,810
You are literally covered in staph and strep
and e coli, and all sorts of dubious characters

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:14,199
that are intent on using you, and your body’s
many resources, to feed themselves, find shelter,

4
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:16,199
and reproduce as much as they want.

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,600
And, hey, we all gotta make a living. But
it is not your job to give these guys a free lunch.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,220
So your body has developed a three-part policy
toward these shady customers, and its enforcement

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,528
is handled by your immune system.

8
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,399
The immune system is different from all the
other systems we’ve talked about this year

9
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,390
in that it’s not a specific, tissue-organ-system
kind of system.

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,329
Instead, it involves a whole bunch of
different tissue groups, organ systems, and

11
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,899
specialized-but-widely-distributed defense cells.

12
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:45,169
Together, this league of extraordinary substances
joins forces to perform all of the defense

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:50,309
functions your body depends on to keep you
alive in an incredibly germy world.

14
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:56,308
And the first line of defense in this never-ending battle?
That’s your innate, or nonspecific, defense system.

15
00:00:56,308 --> 00:00:59,829
Like your average frontline soldier, it’s
prepared to immediately engage with anyone

16
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:03,698
suspicious, and it mostly includes stuff we
were born with, like the external barricades

17
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:08,968
of your skin and mucous membranes, and internal
defenses like phagocytes, antimicrobial proteins,

18
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:10,038
and other attack cells.

19
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:13,459
But some enemies must be fought with special
forces. And here, your body can deploy your

20
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:17,349
adaptive, or specific defense system, which
is more like your Seal Team Six.

21
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:21,299
It takes more time to call in, but it’s
specially designed to go after specific targets.

22
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,969
And it keeps files on those bad guys so it
knows how to handle them next time around.

23
00:01:24,968 --> 00:01:28,228
But today we’re going to focus on your innate
system, and look at how it uses an arsenal

24
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:32,899
of physical and chemical barriers, killer
cells, and even fever, to keep you healthy.

25
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:37,879
Proving that sometimes, the symptoms we associate
with illness are actually the signs that we're healing.

26
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:51,099
Just because something is simple doesn’t
mean that it can’t be elegant.

27
00:01:51,108 --> 00:01:55,208
I mean, your body is capable of some 
incredibly sophisticated things, including

28
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:56,680
defending itself from infection.

29
00:01:56,688 --> 00:01:58,888
But occasionally there’s something to be
said for brute force.

30
00:01:58,888 --> 00:02:02,899
And a lot of your innate immune system’s
functions aren’t exactly subtle. For example,

31
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:07,228
your body’s very first line of defense is
a simple physical barrier. And it works!

32
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:11,228
Like a wall around a fortress, your skin does
a fantastic job of keeping out all manner

33
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:13,299
of malevolent microorganisms.

34
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:17,909
As long as that tough, keratinized epithelial
membrane doesn’t get torn open or busted

35
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:23,209
up too much, you could probably, like, make
snowballs out of raw sewage and still be alright.

36
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,340
Although...no. No.

37
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,560
Your many mucous membranes also provide a
handy physical barrier. You’ll remember

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,289
that they line any cavity that opens up into
the germy outside world, including the respiratory,

39
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:35,628
digestive, urinary, and reproductive tracts.

40
00:02:35,628 --> 00:02:38,768
Not only do your skin and mucosa
supply simple physical protection,

41
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:41,060
they also pack some serious chemical weaponry.

42
00:02:41,068 --> 00:02:45,589
Eat some questionable leftovers for lunch?
Don’t worry, your stomach is literally filled

43
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,799
with acid, so you probably are covered.

44
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:52,040
Walk face-first into your co-worker’s nasty
sneeze cloud? No worries, your nasal passages

45
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:56,560
can whip up a tissue-box worth of sticky mucus
to help trap viruses before they enter your lungs.

46
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,900
You’ve also got bacteria-fighting enzymes
in your saliva and lacrimal eye fluid, and

47
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,670
peptides called defensins in your skin and
membranes that help keep bacteria and fungi

48
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:08,479
from setting up shop around inflamed or scraped
skin.

49
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,639
Which, no matter how careful you are, you’re
gonna get, one way or another.

50
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:14,979
Maybe you shave with a dull blade. Or you
just brush your teeth too hard. And DON’T

51
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:17,619
GET ME STARTED about the dangers of bagel-cutting.

52
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,908
So when you’ve breached that first, simple
line of defense, it’s time to call on your

53
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:23,620
second line of internal innate defenses.

54
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,780
This is where your body starts pulling strategic
maneuvers like firing up a fever, releasing

55
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,109
chemical signals, causing inflammation, or
other defensive tactics that help identify

56
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:34,150
and attack infectious invaders.

57
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,700
Some of the first defensive cells on the scene
are your phagocytes. Their name literally

58
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:42,048
means “to eat,” and like Pac-Man, they
indiscriminately chase down intruders and

59
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:44,748
gobble them up. And they come in a few different
varieties:

60
00:03:44,748 --> 00:03:48,060
First you’ve got neutrophils, which are
the most abundant type of your white blood

61
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,658
cells. They kind of self-destruct after devouring
a pathogen. And, in fact, you’ve actually

62
00:03:52,658 --> 00:03:56,078
seen piles of their little dead bodies, because
that’s what pus is made of.

63
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,189
But the bigger, tougher phagocytes are the
macrophages. They’re derived from monocyte

64
00:04:00,188 --> 00:04:04,150
white-blood cells that have moved out of the
blood stream to occupy tissues. And some are

65
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,629
free types that patrol tissues looking for
creepers, while others are fixed -- attached

66
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:12,009
to fibers in specific organs, devouring anything
suspicious that passes by.

67
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:16,608
So when a macrophage in, say, the finger I
just cut slicing a bagel, sees a new bacterium

68
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:22,089
coming along, it snares it using cytoplasmic
extensions, reels in it, completely engulfs

69
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:25,918
it, and -- essentially -- digests it and spits
the rest out.

70
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,579
And unlike neutrophils, it can do this over
and over again, like a boss.

71
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:33,659
But not all your defense cells are phagocytic.
You’ve also got cells with what is by far

72
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,449
the awesomest name of any cell in the body:
the natural killer cells. You can call them

73
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:41,270
NK cells if you want to, but like, why would
you do that?

74
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:45,659
Anyway, these tiny assassins patrol your blood
and lymph looking for abnormal cells, and

75
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,930
are unique in that they can kill your own
cells if they are infected with viruses or

76
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,509
have become cancerous.

77
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:51,509
How can they tell?

78
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:56,970
A normal, healthy cell contains a special
protein on its surface called MHC1, or major

79
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:01,530
Histocompatibility Complex. But if it’s
infected, it stops making that protein.

80
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:05,968
And if an NK cell detects a defective cell,
it doesn’t swallow it whole like a macrophage

81
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:10,728
-- it pokes it with an enzyme that triggers
apoptosis, or programmed cell death, which

82
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:11,769
is pretty awesome.

83
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,649
So those are some ways your innate immune
cells handle their enemies, but how do they

84
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:16,719
know where to look in the first place?

85
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,129
So, let’s talk strategery.

86
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:22,620
So, say you’re in a banana factory and you
slip on a banana peel and scrape your knees.

87
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,750
Your outer fortress has been breached, and
the pathogens are just flooding in like orcs

88
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,970
through Helm’s Deep.

89
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,400
Banana factories are very dirty places.

90
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:33,878
Now your body wants to contain the spread
of pathogens, clean up the mess, and get healing

91
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:37,199
as quickly as possible, so it cues up your
inflammatory response.

92
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,449
This is basically an internal fire alarm,
only it uses chemicals instead of sirens to

93
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:46,460
get the message across, and instead of smoke
and fire you sense redness, swelling, heat,

94
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:47,029
and pain.

95
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:50,559
For example, in the event of injury, specialized
mast cells in your connective tissue send

96
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,970
out histamine molecules.

97
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,919
And histamine is great at calling in the cavalry.

98
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,269
For one thing, it causes vasodilation, which
creates redness and heat at the site of the

99
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:00,918
injury. Now, those things might freak you
out a little, but they’re actually signs

100
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:04,870
of healing -- the increased temperature, for
example, ratchets up the cells’ metabolic

101
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,180
rates so they can repair themselves faster.

102
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,780
Meanwhile, histamines and other inflammatory
chemicals also increase the permeability of

103
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:14,649
blood vessels, causing nearby capillaries
to release protein-rich fluids.

104
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:18,978
This causes swelling -- which again, is actually
a good thing -- because that leaked protein

105
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:23,399
helps clot blood and form scabs, while the
lymphatic system sucks up and filters that

106
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:26,689
extra fluid, cleaning it up before putting
it back into your bloodstream.

107
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:30,620
And of course, like chum to sharks, an inflamed
knee is also going to attract a bunch of local

108
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,389
phagocytes -- which find it easier to escape
your now-leaky capillaries -- and lymphocytes

109
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:39,769
that are also flowing freely, helping to destroy
pathogens while also cleaning up dead-cell

110
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:39,990
wreckage.

111
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,250
And don’t forget: During all this, the neutrophils
have been doing their best, but they were

112
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,389
the first wave to arrive, so by this time,
they’re starting to die in heaps.

113
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:51,468
They’re triggered when the injured knee-skin
cells release chemicals that begin leukocytosis

114
00:06:51,468 --> 00:06:55,129
– the release of neutrophils from the bone
marrow where they’re made into the bloodstream.

115
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:59,789
To attract the neutrophils to the damaged
area, inflamed endothelial cells in the capillaries

116
00:06:59,788 --> 00:07:03,688
send out chemicals that act like homing devices--
and when the neutrophils arrive, they cling

117
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:08,289
to the capillary walls near the injury, flatten
themselves out and squeeze through the vessel

118
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:09,550
walls to get to work.

119
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:14,220
Your big monocytes eventually roll up to the
battle, and transform into hungry macrophages,

120
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,550
replacing that first line of now-dead neutrophils
and basically just eating up any lingering

121
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,120
enemies and then cleaning up the carnage.

122
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,149
Now, all this works pretty well in most circumstances.
But you may have noticed if you’ve sustained

123
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:27,538
a more major injury, or are battling an especially
nasty virus or infection, that sometimes your

124
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:28,668
local troops get overrun.

125
00:07:28,668 --> 00:07:32,829
When white blood cells and macrophages run
into more foreign invaders than they can handle,

126
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:37,560
they let loose pyrogen chemicals that tap
the hypothalamus and raise your body’s thermostat,

127
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,509
calling in a systemic fever to burn everything.

128
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:45,038
The resulting temperature rise increases the
metabolism of your cells so they can heal

129
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:49,348
faster, and it also tells the liver and spleen
to hold onto all of their iron and zinc, so

130
00:07:49,348 --> 00:07:51,699
those things can’t contribute to bacterial
growth.

131
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:56,240
But even then, sometimes, well sometimes you
find yourself facing a more formidable foe.

132
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,990
That’s when you call in the specialists
-- your adaptive immune defenses.

133
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,000
And to learn exactly how they save the day,
you have to watch next time.

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,939
But for now you learned that your immune system’s
responses begin with physical barriers like

135
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:11,800
skin and mucous membranes, and when they’re
not enough, there are your phagocytes -- the

136
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,560
neutrophils and macrophages. You also learned
about natural killer cells and the inflammatory

137
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,310
response, and watched as all of these elements
saved the day when you slipped on a banana

138
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:21,819
peel.
