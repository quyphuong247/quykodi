1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,500
Maybe you’ve noticed that every time we
talk about a new system, we highlight its

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,339
importance by saying how you’d die without
it.

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:10,699
Like, without your muscular and skeletal systems
you’d collapse into an inert bag of goo.

4
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:14,828
Or how if we magically removed your respiratory
or circulatory system, you’d die in a couple

5
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:16,480
of minutes ‘cause your cells wouldn’t
have oxygen.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,000
That’s because most of our bodies’ systems
are just trying to keep us alive, minute to minute.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,039
But one of those systems doesn’t really care if
you live or die. At least, not until it’s done its job.

8
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,570
It’s how every living thing gets its start,
but it doesn’t really kick in until puberty,

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,710
and even then it’s more concerned about
investing in the future than keeping you alive.

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,320
When it comes to your reproductive system,
it’s not concerned about you, so much as

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,399
it is about your alleles, your genetic code,
and the future of the human species.

12
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:45,018
Which are no small stakes.

13
00:00:45,018 --> 00:00:49,088
This system includes our primary, internal
sex organs, the gonads -- like testes and

14
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:54,280
ovaries -- the various sex hormones they secrete,
and the gametes -- the sperm and eggs -- they produce.

15
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,219
It also includes the glands, ducts, external
genitalia, and particular brain parts that help the

16
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,060
gonads and gametes do what they need to do, which
basically is mate, combine alleles, and make babies.

17
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,519
Now, all animals have their own particular
and fascinating anatomical methods for getting

18
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:11,938
their gametes together, and we could do a
whole course just on that, and never run out

19
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:14,449
of material, and let me tell you, I would
like to do that.

20
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,909
But while we may seem kinda tame compared
to animals that turn bright red, bite off

21
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:22,820
penises, or starve themselves for a chance
to breed, our systems are still plenty complex.

22
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:26,879
In fact, it’s gonna take most of the month
to get through all our various anatomical

23
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,769
parts and hormones, and explain how sexy time,
fertilization, pregnancy, and development

24
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:34,399
work, starting today with the female anatomy.

25
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:38,090
And remember, this is nothing to be shy about
-- when we’re talking about sex, we’re

26
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,829
talking about the future of humanity.

27
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,618
So, when we talk about sex, we’re talking
about spreading our alleles around. But when

28
00:01:53,618 --> 00:01:57,289
we visualize sex, what most of what we picture
are our anatomies.

29
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:59,289
Who has what. And what goes where.

30
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:03,090
In an anatomical female, that involves the
vulva, which includes the mons pubis over

31
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,579
the pubic bone, and labia majora and labia
minora — the elongated skin folds that surround

32
00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:11,429
the vestibule, which contains both the urethral
and vaginal openings.

33
00:02:11,429 --> 00:02:15,269
Beyond that is the vagina, which I’m sure
you know is how menstrual blood and babies

34
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,430
leave the body, and how sperm gets in.

35
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,580
But, as much as we tend to put all the focus
on the bathing-suit parts, those are only

36
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,680
the genitalia -- the external sexual organs.

37
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,610
And they’re really just a means of getting
gametes together. Reproductively speaking,

38
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,790
they’re the least important parts of the
system.

39
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:32,000
The ground control of the female reproductive
anatomy -- the place where the orders are

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,280
given -- are of course the ovaries. Their main job is

41
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,060
to produce and release female gametes and sex
hormones like estrogen and progesterone.

42
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,900
You’ll remember from biology that gametes
are haploid cells, meaning that they only

43
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,090
have one set of chromosomes, and are formed
by meiosis.

44
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:50,009
When a sperm fuses with an egg, they make
a diploid cell, which has all the genetic

45
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:53,919
instructions required to make a baby. And
pretty much everything about how our reproductive

46
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,079
systems work is designed to make that happen.

47
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,599
Each ovary lives inside a fibrous sac that
consists of a layer of connective tissue called

48
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:05,389
the tunica albuginea, and another layer of
cuboidal epithelial cells called the germinal

49
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:09,438
epithelium, which is actually part of the
peritoneum that lines the abdominal cavity.

50
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:13,769
The ovary itself contains a cortex that houses
developing eggs, and a medulla that contains

51
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:15,769
most of the ovary’s blood vessels and nerves.

52
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:20,140
But the business of passing on alleles and
saving humanity really begins in the basic

53
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:23,768
reproductive units in the cortex -- the ovarian
follicles.

54
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:28,090
These are tiny-sac-like structures that each
hold a single primary oocyte — a sort of

55
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,310
incomplete proto-egg — along with a bunch
of supporting follicle cells around it.

56
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,199
Females are born with essentially all of these
early versions of eggs in all of the primordial

57
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:39,530
follicles they will ever have -- around 1
million at the time of birth.

58
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:44,219
But right around birth, the oocytes stop developing
-- they get stuck in the first stage of meiosis.

59
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:46,810
And they stay that way for years, sometimes
forever.

60
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,128
The actual process of egg creation, or oogenesis,
is delayed until puberty, when the rest of

61
00:03:51,128 --> 00:03:52,899
the body is physically ready to reproduce.

62
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,879
Now, this works differently for us than it
does for some other animals. Like, if you’re

63
00:03:55,878 --> 00:04:00,259
a salmon or a mayfly, then all of your eggs
will mature at once, and then you’ll mate,

64
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:02,419
reproduce, and usually die, in quick succession.

65
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:06,318
I mean, people talk about living fast and
dying young, but that -- that’s too fast.

66
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,988
So human eggs mature one-by-one, almost constantly,
doled out so that every month or so, a mature

67
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:14,120
egg is either fertilized, or dies to make
way for a new egg.

68
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,810
This should all sound familiar if you were
born with female anatomy, or know anyone who

69
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,399
was, because it’s a big part of the well-known
monthly menstrual cycle.

70
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,929
But the truth is, menstruation is only one
part of one cycle.

71
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,680
The menstrual cycle is what happens in the
uterus to prepare for a fertilized egg. The

72
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,319
other cycle, the ovarian cycle, is all about
the maturation of the follicle and egg, and

73
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,199
it’s actually what drives the menstrual
cycle.

74
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,680
Every day, even before birth, a bunch of follicles
will begin a process of maturation, very slowly

75
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,430
morphing from primordial follicles into what’s
known as late-tertiary follicles, which are

76
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,250
the ones that will support a fully developed
egg.

77
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,560
This process takes 375 days.

78
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,978
But out of that bunch of follicles -- usually
about 20 or so -- only one follicle will end

79
00:04:51,978 --> 00:04:55,978
up supporting a single, mature egg. The rest
won’t get the hormonal boost they need to

80
00:04:55,978 --> 00:04:59,728
bring the egg to completion. This is what
happens to the one that start maturing before

81
00:04:59,728 --> 00:05:04,180
puberty, for example, so they undergo atresia,
a kind of programmed self- destruction.

82
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,009
And because I keep mentioning puberty, which
you’ve probably been through yourself, it

83
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:11,379
should come as no surprise that all of this
activity is regulated by sex hormones.

84
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:15,649
Starting around puberty, the hypothalamus
and pituitary set up two concurrent cycles

85
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:20,109
-- the ovarian cycle in the ovaries, which
ripens eggs and secretes sex hormones, and

86
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,069
the menstrual, or the uterine cycle, which
prepares the uterus to capture and nourish

87
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:25,860
any mature, fertilized eggs.

88
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,300
When puberty begins the hypothalamus starts up the
ovarian cycle by secreting gonadotropin-releasing

89
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,629
hormone about once a month. This is a sex
hormone that stimulates the anterior pituitary

90
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:39,959
to release two more hormones: follicle-stimulating
hormone -- you’ll often hear it called FSH

91
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,818
-- and luteinizing hormone, or LH.

92
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:45,810
The follicle-stimulating hormone lives up
to its name by stimulating the growth of a

93
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,040
follicle -- but only one: the one that happens
to be furthest along in development at the time.

94
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,759
The FSH drives that one lucky follicle to
keep growing, by triggering the follicle itself

95
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:59,919
to secrete its own estrogen hormones, which
locally signal the follicle to mature even more.

96
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:04,009
That surge of follicle-secreted estrogen then
ends up stimulating the pituitary to secrete

97
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:07,098
another pulse of luteinizing hormone to finish
the job.

98
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:11,300
The LH gets to work on the oocyte that’s
been dormant inside the follicle, and triggers

99
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,420
it to finally start dividing again -- getting it to
complete meiosis I and move on to metaphase II.

100
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,639
This whole process takes about 14 days, at
the end of which, the follicle -- which is

101
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,389
now mature -- pushes up against the ovary
wall, ruptures, and, with the help of enzymes,

102
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:27,970
breaches the wall and ejects a single, now
mature, oocyte.

103
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,380
Congratulations. You’ve just ovulated.

104
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:34,168
The damaged follicle now slows its estrogen
production while morphing into a different

105
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:37,318
structure, called the corpus luteum, which
eventually degenerates.

106
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,910
But first it releases a final hormonal swan
song -- a bunch of progesterone, a little

107
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:47,090
estrogen, and some inhibin -- that together
stop the release of FSH and LH.

108
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:51,369
They also prepare the uterus to receive the
oocyte, which is now on its way down a fallopian

109
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,689
tube, where it might meet a nice young sperm.

110
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:57,509
The tubes are about 10 centimeters long, and
interestingly, they aren’t actually connected

111
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:02,050
to the ovaries. This means that when the egg
pushes through ovary, it has to float a short

112
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,900
way through the peritoneal cavity before it’s
caught by a fallopian tube.

113
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:10,388
Now, only if and when an egg fuses with a
sperm does it actually complete meiosis II

114
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:11,418
and officially become an ovum.

115
00:07:11,418 --> 00:07:14,758
But, whether it’s fertilized or not, the
egg works its way down the tube until it enters

116
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,439
the uterus, a hollow, thick-walled, and very
stretchable muscular organ that sits anterior

117
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,560
to the rectum and posterosuperior to the bladder,
and ends with the cervix.

118
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,379
And the uterine wall is composed of three
layers: the perimetrium on the outside; the

119
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:32,550
bulky, smooth muscle myometrium that contracts
during labor; and the inner mucosal lining,

120
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:37,480
the endometrium, which consists of a thin,
deep basal layer, and an outer functional layer.

121
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,819
If fertilization does happen, then the new
embryo snuggles into the endometrium for gestation

122
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:46,698
-- but the uterus is only receptive to implantation
for a short time, about a week after ovulation.

123
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:50,189
If the egg isn’t fertilized, that outer,
functional layer sloughs off.

124
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:53,990
And that’s the first phase of the uterine,
or menstrual cycle -- the series of changes

125
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,478
that the endometrium goes through every 28
days or so, in response to changing hormone

126
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,180
levels, and in coordination with the ovarian
cycle.

127
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,668
The shedding of the functional layer is triggered
when the progesterone and estrogens that were

128
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:09,219
being produced by the corpus luteum start
to drop, about 10 days after ovulation. This

129
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,960
phase lasts about 5 days.

130
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,908
Meanwhile, the FSH and LH released from the
anterior pituitary start to rise again, stimulating

131
00:08:15,908 --> 00:08:18,860
the next round of follicles, which begin to
make estrogen.

132
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,650
This heralds the start of phase two of the
menstrual cycle, the proliferative, or pre-ovulatory

133
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:27,109
phase, which typically lasts from days 6-14
of the cycle.

134
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:31,288
The rising estrogen levels in the follicles
stimulate the regeneration of the endometrium,

135
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:36,199
building a cushy, well-vascularized habitat
for another potential fertilized egg to call home.

136
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,700
And after the next egg is released, the final
secretory, or postovulatory phase begins.

137
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,660
This is when the ruptured follicle forms in
the corpus luteum. And if fertilization didn’t

138
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:49,110
happen, the corpus will stop producing progesterone,
and the endometrium will start to shed its

139
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,330
functional layer. And it starts all over again.

140
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:55,759
BUT! If, by this time, the egg has met a nice
sperm and gotten fertilized, then the pulse

141
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:00,259
of progesterone from the corpus triggers even
more thickening of the functional layer of

142
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:04,399
the endometrium, and a secretion of nutrients
that will tide an embryo over until it has

143
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,459
implanted itself in the blood-rich lining.

144
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,600
Which is a big if.

145
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,080
Like, its whole separate video “big.”
So that’s where we’re going next time!

146
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:15,070
But for now, you learned all about female
reproductive anatomy, how sex hormones affect

147
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,610
oogenesis and ovulation, and how the ovarian
and menstrual cycles mature and release oocytes,

148
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,470
and create a comfy uterine environment for
a fertilized egg.
