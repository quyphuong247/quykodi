1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,859
What’s true in World of Warcraft is also
true in your immune system:

2
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:06,509
To defeat your enemy, you have to know your
enemy.

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:09,929
Uncover its weaknesses. Learn how to see it,
before it sees you.

4
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,169
We’ve already talked about how your innate
defense system keeps out, or quietly neutralizes,

5
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:17,800
pathogens without much too much fuss. But
sooner or later, a threat’s gonna come along

6
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:21,750
that’s stronger than what the first-responders
can handle. That’s when it’s time for

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,750
the adaptive, or acquired immune system to
step in.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,160
While your innate system takes its zero-tolerance
policy very seriously, and tries to toast

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,299
any foreign microbe that it encounters, your
adaptive system does things differently.

10
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:39,479
It has to be expressly introduced to a specific pathogen,
and recognize it as a threat, before it will attack.

11
00:00:39,488 --> 00:00:43,608
As its name suggests, you’re not born with
a working adaptive immune system -- it’s

12
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:47,649
slow to act, in part because it takes time
for it to shake hands with so many pathogens

13
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:48,920
and get to know them.

14
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:52,079
These introductions may be organic -- like
touching a dirty faucet in the bathroom or

15
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,988
walking into a sneeze cloud.

16
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:57,768
Or they may be premeditated, which is why
vaccination is pretty much the greatest thing

17
00:00:57,768 --> 00:00:59,308
to happen to medicine ever.

18
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:03,280
But once it’s been introduced to a potential
threat, your adaptive defenses never forget

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,189
it. And this ability to remember specific
pathogens is one of the key differences between

20
00:01:07,188 --> 00:01:09,339
the adaptive and innate defenses.

21
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,368
Another main difference is that adaptive immunity
is systemic -- rather than being restricted

22
00:01:13,368 --> 00:01:17,929
to a particular infection in, say, a sinus
or a sliced finger, your adaptive system can

23
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:19,960
fight throughout your whole body at once.

24
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:24,278
And it does this by deploying one or both
of its separate, but cooperating, defenses

25
00:01:24,278 --> 00:01:27,239
-- your humoral immunity and your cellular
defenses.

26
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:30,938
Your humoral immunity -- which you might not
have heard of before -- works by dispatching

27
00:01:30,938 --> 00:01:34,069
important proteins that I’m sure you have
heard of: antibodies.

28
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:38,038
They’re made by special white blood cells,
and they patrol the body’s “humors”

29
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:42,228
or fluids like blood and lymph, where they
combat viruses and bacteria moving around

30
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:44,368
the interstitial space between your cells.

31
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:48,509
Much of what you know, or have heard about,
or think of, when your immune system comes

32
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,950
up actually has to do with your humoral immunity.

33
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,810
It’s why, if you had mumps as a kid, you
probably don’t have to worry about getting

34
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,260
it again for the rest of your life.

35
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,079
It’s also why doctors and nurses and patients
who have been infected with the ebola virus

36
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:02,459
-- a disease once thought to be incurable
-- have lived to tell about it.

37
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:05,059
And it’s why vaccinations work.

38
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:19,039
Whether you’re protecting yourself from
infections or playing an MMO, one of the first

39
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,530
steps in any good defensive strategy is to
be able to tell your friend from your foe.

40
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,689
And in the case of your immune system, that
means being able to identify antigens.

41
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:31,810
An antigen could be an invader from the outside
world, like a bacterium, virus, or fungus.

42
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,360
Or it could be a toxin or a diseased cell
within your own body.

43
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,580
But in any case, antigens are large signalling
molecules not normally found in the body,

44
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,540
and they act as flags that get the adaptive
immune system riled up.

45
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:45,310
So let’s say a flu virus gets inside of
you, and it’s floating around trying to

46
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,900
find a good host cell to start multiplying
inside of.

47
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,599
Before it finds that cell, hopefully it will
be paid a visit by one of the stars of your

48
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,060
humoral response -- a B lymphocyte.

49
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,420
Like all blood cells, these guys originate
in your bone marrow. But unlike other white

50
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:00,259
blood cells, they also mature in the bone
marrow too.

51
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:04,899
And as a B cell matures, it develops the ability
to determine friend from foe, developing both

52
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,920
immunocompetence -- or how to recognize and
bind to a particular antigen -- as well as

53
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,799
self-tolerance, or knowing how to NOT attack
your body’s own cells.

54
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,710
Once it’s fully mature, a B lymphocyte displays
at least 10,000 special protein receptors

55
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:22,280
on its surface -- these are its membrane-bound
antibodies.

56
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,009
All B lymphocytes have them, but the cool
thing is, every individual lymphocyte has

57
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:31,120
its own unique antibodies, each of which is ready
to identify and bind to a particular kind of antigen.

58
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,200
That means that, with all of your B lymphocytes
together, it’s like having 2 billion keys

59
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:39,400
on your immune system’s keychain, each of
which can only open one door.

60
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,319
So, part of your immune system’s strategy
is just to win with overwhelming odds: The

61
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,069
more unique antibodies your lymphocytes have,
the more likely it is that one will eventually

62
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:50,750
find, bind to, and mark a particular antigen.

63
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:55,259
Once they’ve matured, B cells colonize or
“seed” your secondary lymphoid organs,

64
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,719
like your lymph nodes, and start roaming around
in your blood and lymph.

65
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,319
At this point they’re still naive and untested,
and they won’t truly be activated until

66
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,289
they meet their perfect enemy match.

67
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:06,039
Which brings us back to the flu virus.

68
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:10,379
When the right B cell finally bumps into an
antigen it has antibodies for -- usually in

69
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:14,829
a lymph node or in the spleen -- and recognizes
it, it binds to it. This summons the full

70
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:19,150
power of the humoral immune response, and
the cell basically goes into berserker mode.

71
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:23,349
Once activated, the B cell starts cloning
itself like crazy, quickly producing an army

72
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,150
of similar cells, all with the instructions
for the exact same antibodies that are designed

73
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:30,339
to fight that one particular antigen.

74
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:34,560
Most of these clones become active fighters,
or effector cells. But a few become long-lived

75
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,430
memory cells that preserve the genetic code
for that specific, successful antibody.

76
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,250
This ensures that, if and when the antigen
returns, there will be a prepared secondary

77
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,540
immune response that’s both stronger and
faster than the first.

78
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,300
This is key to why vaccinations are so brilliant
and important, which I’ll come back to in a minute.

79
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,439
But while the memory cells are just there
to hang back and record things, the effector,

80
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,339
or plasma cells, are packed with extra amounts
of rough endoplasmic reticulum, which acts

81
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:01,739
as an antibody factory.

82
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,900
These cells can mass-produce the same antibodies
over and over for that particular invader,

83
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:10,539
spitting them out into the humor at a rate
of around 2,000 antibodies per second for

84
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,560
four or five days until they die.

85
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,819
And the antibodies they make work the same way that
the membrane-bound ones do; they’re just free-floating.

86
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:20,800
So they ride the tides of blood and lymph,
binding to all the antigens they can find,

87
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,680
and marking them for death.

88
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,910
Now, antibodies can’t really do the killing
themselves, but they do have a few moves that

89
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,060
could make it hard for intruders to take hold.

90
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,259
One of their most effective and common strategies
is neutralization, where antibodies physically

91
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:37,019
block the binding sites on viruses or bacterial
toxins, so they can’t hook up to your tissues.

92
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:41,269
And because antibodies have more than one
binding site, they can bind to multiple antigens

93
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:44,069
at the same time, in a process called agglutination.

94
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:47,670
The resulting clumps can’t get around easily,
which makes it easier for macrophages

95
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,030
to come and gobble them up.

96
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:52,638
And not only that, but while all this is going
on, antibodies are also ringing a chemical

97
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,960
dinner bell, calling in phagocytes from the
innate immune system, and special lymphocytes

98
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:01,370
from the adaptive system, to destroy these
messy little antigen-antibody clumps.

99
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,930
So, the point of all this in the short term
is to keep you healthy. But in the long term,

100
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,329
this process also adds to your overall immunity.

101
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:12,009
The humoral response allows your body to achieve
immunity by encountering pathogens either

102
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:13,899
randomly or on purpose.

103
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:17,109
Active humoral immunity is what we were just
talking about -- it’s when B cells bump

104
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,460
into antigens and start cranking out antibodies.

105
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:23,209
This can occur naturally, like when you catch
the flu or get chickenpox or pick up some

106
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:28,789
nasty bacterial infection, or it can happen
artificially -- particularly through vaccination.

107
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,790
Most vaccines are made of a dead or extremely
weakened pathogen. And they work on the premise

108
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,930
that, because a secondary immune response
is more intense than a primary response, by

109
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,620
introducing a pathogen into your body, you’re
priming it to fight hard and fast should that

110
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,949
antigen show up again.

111
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:46,560
In the case of typically non-fatal infections,
like the common flu, this immunity should

112
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,850
at least spare you from some of the most severe
symptoms.

113
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:53,400
But in the case of more serious diseases,
like polio, smallpox, measles, and whooping

114
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,629
cough, vaccinations can be truly life-saving.

115
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:58,779
Now, some antigens -- like those for mumps
or measles -- don’t really change much over

116
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:01,529
time, so a few immunizations will leave you
set for life.

117
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:05,709
But others, like influenza, are constantly
evolving and changing their surface antigens.

118
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:09,819
So immunity to last year’s flu probably
doesn’t work against this year’s flu.

119
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:12,259
Still, acquired immunity doesn’t have to
be active.

120
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:17,110
Babies, for example, naturally obtain passive
humoral immunity while still in the womb.

121
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:21,240
They receive readymade antibodies from their
mothers through the placenta, and later on

122
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,910
through breast milk.

123
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,570
And that works pretty well for a few months,
but the protection is temporary, because passively

124
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:29,540
obtained antibodies don’t live long in their
new body. And they can’t produce effector

125
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:34,439
cells or memory cells, so a baby’s own system
won’t remember an antigen if it gets infected again.

126
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:37,850
You can also acquire this kind of temporary
passive immunity artificially, by receiving

127
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,169
exogenous antibodies from the plasma of an
immune donor.

128
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:45,060
This is what recently saved some doctors and
nurses who had contracted the ebola virus

129
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,290
from infected patients.

130
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:50,540
A serum was made from the blood plasma of
other medical workers who had been infected,

131
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,210
and survived.

132
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:54,560
The antibodies helped defend the patients
from the virus before their own active immunity

133
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,509
could identify that particular antigen and
start creating their own antibodies.

134
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:02,500
It’s not the same as a vaccine, which immediately
engages your B cells, but it can buy a patient

135
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,949
some crucial, life-saving time against an
infection that would otherwise quickly kill.

136
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:10,949
But B cells and antibodies are only part of
the immunity equation. There are plenty of

137
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:15,330
pathogens that quickly worm their way right
inside your cells, where they’re safer from

138
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,649
the humoral response and free to multiply
as much as they’d like.

139
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:22,859
Luckily, your immune system has yet another
game plan and new set of players ready to

140
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,069
fight that final battle with cell to cell
combat.

141
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:31,418
Make sure you catch our final episode next
week and learn all about this epic battle royale.

142
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:35,978
But as for today, in our second-to-last episode,
you learned how the adaptive immune system’s

143
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:40,329
humoral response guards your extracellular
terrain against pathogens. We looked at how

144
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:46,039
B cells mature, identify antigens, and make
antibodies, and how antibodies swarm pathogens

145
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:50,528
and mark them for death. We also talked about
active and passive humoral immunity, and how

146
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:51,639
vaccines work.
