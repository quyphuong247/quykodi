1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,279
What’s 1000 times thinner than a piece of
paper, more numerous in you than grains of

2
00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:08,740
sand on a beach, and proof that the smallest
things can sometimes be the most powerful?

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,330
I’m talking about the synapse -- the meeting
point between two neurons.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,410
If your neurons form the structure of your
nervous system, then your synapses -- the

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,480
tiny communication links between them -- are
what turn that structure into an actual system.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,760
Because, as great and powerful as your neurons
are, when it comes down to it, their strength

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,260
and their purpose lies in their connections.
A single neuron in isolation might as well

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,189
not exist if it doesn’t have someone to
listen or talk to.

9
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:37,749
The word “synapse” comes from the Greek
for “to clasp or join.” It’s basically

10
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:39,560
a junction or a crossroads.

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,499
When an action potential -- and if you don’t
know what an action potential is, watch the

12
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:46,969
last episode -- sends an electrical message
to the end of an axon, that message hits a

13
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:51,629
synapse that then translates, or converts
it, into a different type of signal and flings

14
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:52,998
it over to another neuron.

15
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:56,780
These connections are rather amazing feats
of bio-electrical engineering, and they are

16
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,009
also ridiculously, mind-bogglingly numerous.

17
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:04,950
Consider that the human brain alone has 100
billion neurons, and each of those has 1000

18
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,680
to 10,000 synapses.

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,860
So you’ve got somewhere between 100 to 1,000
trillion synapses in your brain.

20
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:16,890
Each one of these hundreds of trillions of
synapses is like a tiny computer, all of its

21
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,170
own, not only capable of running loads of
different programs simultaneously, but also

22
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,560
able to change and adapt in response to neuron
firing patterns, and either strengthen or

23
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,920
weaken over time, depending on how much they’re
used.

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,159
Synapses are what allow you to learn and remember.

25
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,479
They’re also the root of many psychiatric
disorders.

26
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,780
And they’re basically why illicit drugs
-- and addictions to them -- exist.

27
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,519
Pretty much everything in your experience
-- from euphoria to hunger to desire to fuzziness

28
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:45,459
to to confusion to boredom -- is communicated
by way of these signals sent by your body’s

29
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:47,939
own electrochemical messaging system.

30
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,260
Hopefully, you know enough about email and
texting etiquette to know that if you’re

31
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:05,368
gonna communicate effectively, you have to
respect the sanctity of the group list.

32
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:09,080
It’s not a great idea to send a mass text
to all of your friends first thing in the

33
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,660
morning to give them the urgent news that you
just ate a really delicious maple-bacon donut.

34
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:18,159
Seriously, people. If you happen to have a friend who
truly adores bacon, then an email would suffice.

35
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:22,609
But! If you’re out clubbing and suddenly
Bill Murray shows up and starts doing karaoke...

36
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,720
then that would be a totally appropriate time
to notify all of your friends at once that

37
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,460
something awesome is happening and they better
be a part of it.

38
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,400
And in much the same way -- OK, in kind of
the same way -- your nerve cells have two

39
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,980
main settings for communicating with each other,
depending on how fast the news needs to travel.

40
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:41,840
Some of your synapses are electrical -- that
would be like an immediate group text.

41
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,159
Others are chemical synapses -- they take
more time to be received and read, but they’re

42
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:50,829
used more often and are much easier to control,
sending signals to only certain recipients.

43
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,540
Fortunately, your nervous system has better
text etiquette than your mom, and knows when

44
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:57,280
each kind is appropriate to use, and how to
do it.

45
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,219
Your super fast electrical synapses send an
ion current flowing directly from the cytoplasm

46
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:05,840
of one nerve cell to another, through small
windows called gap junctions.

47
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,930
They’re super fast because the signal is
never converted from its pure electrical state

48
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,870
to any other kind of signal, the way it is
in a chemical synapse.

49
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,230
Instead, one cell and one synapse can trigger
thousands of other cells that can all act

50
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:21,479
in synchrony. Something similar happens in
the muscle cells of your heart, where speed

51
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,899
and team effort between cells is crucial.

52
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,480
This seems like a good system, so why aren’t
all of our synapses electrical?

53
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,939
It’s largely a matter of control. With such
a direct connection between cells, an action

54
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:36,310
potential in one neuron will generate an action
potential in the other cells across the synapse.

55
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,620
That’s great in places like your heart, because
you definitely don’t want a half a heartbeat.

56
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,900
But if every synapse in your body activated
all of the neurons around it, your nervous

57
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:49,439
system would basically always be in “group
text” mode, with every muscle fiber and

58
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,949
bit of organ tissue always being stimulated
and then replying-all to the whole group which

59
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:57,889
would stimulate them even more until everyone
just got maxed out and exhausted and turned

60
00:03:57,889 --> 00:03:59,929
off their phones for good...which would be
death.

61
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,469
So that would be bad, which is partly why
we have chemical synapses. They are much more

62
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:09,969
abundant, but also slower, and they’re more precise
and selective in what messages they send where.

63
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:14,699
Rather than raw electricity, these synapses
use neurotransmitters, or chemical signals,

64
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:17,729
that diffuse across a synaptic gap to deliver
their message.

65
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,670
The main advantage chemical synapses have
over electrical ones is that they can effectively

66
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:26,759
convert the signal in steps -- from electrical
to chemical back to electrical -- which allows

67
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,810
for different ways to control that impulse.

68
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:34,370
At the synapse, that signal can be modified,
amplified, inhibited, or split, either immediately

69
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,399
or over longer periods of time.

70
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:38,429
This set-up has two principal parts:

71
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,379
The cell that’s sending the signal is the
presynaptic neuron, and it transmits through

72
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:47,250
a knoblike structure called the presynaptic
terminal, usually the axon terminal.

73
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:52,399
This terminal holds a whole bunch of tiny
synaptic vesicle sacs, each loaded with thousands

74
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,589
of molecules of a given neurotransmitter.

75
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:59,629
The receiving cell, meanwhile, is, yes, thankfully
the postsynaptic neuron, and it accepts the

76
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:05,459
neurotransmitters in its receptor region, which is
usually on the dendrite or just on the cell body itself.

77
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:09,829
And these two neurons communicate even though
they never actually touch. Instead, there’s

78
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:15,479
a tiny gap called a synaptic cleft between them --
less than five millionths of a centimeter apart.

79
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,300
One thing to remember is that messages that
travel via chemical synapses are technically

80
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,530
not transmitted directly between neurons,
like they are in electrical synapses.

81
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:27,559
Instead, there’s a whole chemical event
that involves the release, diffusion, and

82
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,829
reception of neurotransmitters in order to
transmit signals.

83
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:33,769
And this all happens in a specific and important
chain of events.

84
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:38,359
When an action potential races along the axon
of a neuron, activating sodium and potassium

85
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,879
channels in a wave, it eventually comes down
to the presynaptic terminal, and activates

86
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,560
the voltage-gated calcium (Ca2+) channels
there to open and release the calcium into

87
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,750
the neuron’s cytoplasm.

88
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:54,019
This flow of positively-charged calcium ions
causes all those tiny synaptic vesicles to

89
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:58,959
fuse with the cell membrane and purge their
chemical messengers. And it’s these neurotransmitters

90
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,649
that act like couriers diffusing across the
synaptic gap, and binding to receptor sites

91
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:05,149
on the postsynaptic neuron.

92
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:09,289
So, the first neuron has managed to convert
the electrical signal into a chemical one.

93
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:13,610
But in order for it to become an action potential
again in the receiving neuron, it has to be

94
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,040
converted back to electrical.

95
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,180
And that happens once a neurotransmitter binds
to a receptor. Because, that’s what causes

96
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,600
the ion channels to open.

97
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,260
And depending on which particular neurotransmitter
binds to which receptor, the neuron might

98
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,480
either get excited or inhibited. The neurotransmitter
tells it what to do.

99
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,000
Excitatory neurotransmitters depolarize the
postsynaptic neuron by making the inside of

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,930
it more positive and bringing it closer to
its action potential threshold, making it

101
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,810
more likely to fire that message on to the
next neuron.

102
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,740
But an inhibitory neurotransmitter hyperpolarizes
the postsynaptic neuron by making the inside

103
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,259
more negative, driving its charge down -- away
from its threshold. So, not only does the

104
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:54,039
message not get passed along, it’s now even
harder to excite that portion of the neuron.

105
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,840
Keep in mind here: Any region of a single
neuron may have hundreds of synapses, each

106
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:03,638
with different inhibitory or excitatory neurotransmitters.
So the likelihood of that post-synaptic neuron

107
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:09,619
developing an action potential depends on the sum
of all of the excitations and inhibitions in that area.

108
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,819
Now, we have over a hundred different kinds
of naturally-occurring neurotransmitters in

109
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:17,949
our bodies that serve different functions.
They help us move around, and keep our vital

110
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:22,209
organs humming along, amp us up, calm us down,
make us hungry, sleepy, or more alert, or

111
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,488
simply just make us feel good.

112
00:07:23,488 --> 00:07:27,668
But neurotransmitters don’t stay bonded
to their receptors for more than a few milliseconds.

113
00:07:27,668 --> 00:07:32,339
After they deliver their message, they just sort of pop
back out, and then either degrade or get recycled.

114
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:36,879
Some kinds diffuse back across the synapse
and are immediately re-absorbed by the sending

115
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,680
neuron, in a process called reuptake.

116
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:44,220
Others are broken down by enzymes in the synaptic
cleft, or sent away from the synapse by diffusion.

117
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:48,610
And this mechanism is what many drugs -- both
legal and illegal -- so successfully exploit,

118
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,470
in order to create their desired effects.

119
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:55,810
These drugs can either excite or inhibit the production,
release, and reuptake of neurotransmitters. And

120
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,199
sometimes they can simply mimic neurotransmitters,
tricking a neuron into thinking it’s getting

121
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:03,209
a natural chemical signal, when really it’s
anything but.

122
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:05,069
Take cocaine, for example. Don’t take cocaine.

123
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:08,370
Once it hits your bloodstream, it targets
three major neurotransmitters --

124
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,610
serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.

125
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:15,480
Serotonin is mainly inhibitory and plays an
important role in regulating mood, appetite,

126
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:20,699
circadian rhythm, and sleep. Some antidepressants can
help stabilize moods by stabilizing serotonin levels.

127
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,699
And when you engage in pleasurable activities
-- like hugging a loved one, or having sex,

128
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:29,299
or eating a really, really great donut -- your
brain releases dopamine, which influences

129
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,680
emotion and attention, but mostly just makes
you feel awesome.

130
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,818
Finally, norepinephrine amps you up by triggering
your fight or flight response, increasing

131
00:08:36,818 --> 00:08:42,538
your heart rate, and priming muscles to engage, while
an undersupply of the chemical can depress a mood.

132
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:45,970
So in a normal, sober state, you’ve got
all these neurotransmitters doing their thing

133
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,769
in your body. But once they’ve delivered
their chemical payloads, they’re usually

134
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:54,058
diffused right back out across the synapse
to be absorbed by the neuron that sent them.

135
00:08:54,058 --> 00:08:59,110
But cocaine blocks that reuptake, especially
of dopamine, allowing these powerful chemicals

136
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:04,680
to float around and accumulate -- making the user feel
euphoric for a time, but also paranoid and jittery.

137
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,628
And because you have a limited supply of these
neurotransmitters, and your body needs time

138
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:13,230
to brew more, flooding your synapses like
this eventually depletes your supply, making

139
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,350
you feel terrible in a number of ways.

140
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:20,558
Cocaine and other drugs that target neurotransmitters
trick the brain, and after prolonged use may

141
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:25,879
eventually cause it to adapt, as all those synapses
remember how great those extra chemicals feel.

142
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:31,100
As a result, you actually start to lose receptors,
so it takes even more dopamine, and finally

143
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,680
cocaine, to function normally.

144
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:35,599
Sometimes the best way to understand how your
body works is to look at how things can go

145
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,199
wrong. And when it comes to your synapses,
that, my friends, is what wrong looks like.

146
00:09:40,198 --> 00:09:44,708
In their natural, healthy state, your synapses
know when to excite, when to inhibit, when

147
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,179
to use electricity and when to dispatch the
chemical messengers.

148
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:51,620
Basically, a healthy nervous system has the
etiquette of electrical messaging down to,

149
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,259
well, a science.

150
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:57,929
Today you learned how electrical synapses
use ion currents over gap junctions to transmit

151
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:02,758
neurological signals, and how chemical synapses
turn electrical signals into chemical ones,

152
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:06,318
using neurotransmitters, before converting
