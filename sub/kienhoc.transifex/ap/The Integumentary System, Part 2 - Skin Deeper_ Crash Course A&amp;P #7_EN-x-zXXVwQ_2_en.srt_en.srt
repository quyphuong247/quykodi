1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:04,159
Look at all this stuff!
Soaps, lotions, conditioners, polishes -- all

2
00:00:04,158 --> 00:00:07,039
from that huge section of your local store
that’s dedicated solely to the grooming

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,080
of your skin, hair, and nails.
Some might see these things as the trappings

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,720
of vanity.
But me? I see them as the tools for the care,

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,449
maintenance, and -- sure, sometimes decoration
-- of the integumentary system.

6
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,288
Now, true, in spite of what the cosmetics
industry may lead you to believe, your integumentary

7
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,868
system is more than just a place to put eye shadow
and hair product in the hopes of attracting a mate.

8
00:00:26,868 --> 00:00:31,670
This collection of resilient tissues, ranging
from the sharp and hard to the soft and fluffy,

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:36,019
serve a whole panoply of functions, the majority
of which you never even notice.

10
00:00:36,018 --> 00:00:40,140
But, when you do notice what your integumentary
system is doing, the results are often uncomfortable

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,259
or ugly or both, and that is what this stuff
is mostly for.

12
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:44,850
Your sweat glands can make you smell.

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,530
Your oil glands can give you zits.

14
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,620
Your skin can become either scaly or greasy,
and -- in rare cases -- it can even change color.

15
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:53,488
And hair, well, let’s just say it takes
a lot of science to tame this mane.

16
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:57,888
But each of these tissues -- frustrating as
they may be at times -- has a purpose, and

17
00:00:57,889 --> 00:01:00,579
without them you’d be cold and vulnerable
and dead.

18
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:04,158
I’m not gonna lecture you on personal hygiene
today. But hopefully by the end of this you’ll

19
00:01:04,158 --> 00:01:07,688
understand the important functions of your
integumentary system, and maybe why it’s

20
00:01:07,688 --> 00:01:09,768
worth a little bit of time and effort to keep
it healthy.

21
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,769
And hey, it might even score you a date.

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,659
If you recall our recent run-ins with rogue

23
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,840
nails and tattoo needles, you’ll probably
remember that the first and most vital purpose

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,710
of your integumentary system is to act as
a protective barrier.

25
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:35,319
Your skin, hair, nails and sweat and oil glands
all work together to shield you from all the

26
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:39,679
things out there that are out to get you:
excessive sunlight, infections, abrasions,

27
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,399
and just, you know, getting poked by sharp
sticks and stuff.

28
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,929
But beyond that, this system is also vital
to how you sense the world around you.

29
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:49,269
Your skin is loaded with structures that are
actually part of your nervous system -- called

30
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:53,769
cutaneous sensory receptors -- they’re what
receive stimuli from the outside environment

31
00:01:53,769 --> 00:01:55,099
and send them to your brain.

32
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:59,038
These receptors, or corpuscles, as they’re
sometimes called, register all of the different

33
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,890
sensations that you associate with touch.

34
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,079
Your tactile corpuscles, for instance, are
what make you constantly aware of the tag

35
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:08,829
that’s scratching at the back of your neck,
while your lamellar corpuscles register the

36
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,740
sense of pressure, like when someone puts
their hand on your shoulder.

37
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,330
Your hair follicles have receptors, too, which
is why you can feel a slight breeze on your

38
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,540
skin or through your hair.

39
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:20,169
Now, on the less-sexy front, your integumentary
system also plays a role in the excretion

40
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:23,189
of waste, though not as big as a role as we’re
often led to believe.

41
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:26,939
Most nitrogen-containing wastes like urea,
uric acid, and ammonia are disposed of through

42
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:30,060
your urine, but small amounts are eliminated
through your skin in sweat.

43
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,280
But despite what you may be told at the beginning
of your hot-yoga class, there isn’t much

44
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,699
evidence that suggests that heavy sweating
actually rids your body of any extra toxins

45
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,879
-- if anything, you’re just losing more
water.

46
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:43,799
When you do exercise, though, you call on
another of your skin’s lesser-known functions

47
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
-- as a handy blood storage unit.

48
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,860
About 5 percent of your entire blood volume
is retained in your skin at any given time.

49
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,080
And when you suddenly need more blood supplied
to your organs, like when you’re working out,

50
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,219
your nervous system constricts your dermal blood
vessels to squeeze that extra blood into circulation.

51
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:03,359
Now, during these times of exertion, both
your blood and your sweat glands work together

52
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,800
to perform a key function: regulating your
body temperature.

53
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,460
Even without exercise, your body oozes out
about half a liter of sweat per day, in an

54
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,640
effort to keep you at a comfortable temperature.
That’s just your normal, barely noticeable

55
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:18,179
sweat called insensible perspiration.

56
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,879
But on a hot day, or if you’re on the dance
floor exerting yourself, that sweat becomes

57
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:27,840
much more noticeable. Such sensible perspiration could
produce as much as 12 LITERS of sweat per day!

58
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,490
Now, if the temperature gets chilly, the surface
of your skin can lose a lot of heat, because

59
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:36,140
it has so much warm blood behind it. To regulate
that heat loss, your dermal blood vessels

60
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:41,579
constrict, causing your blood to head deeper
into your tissues and help keep your vital organs warm.

61
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,170
Once things warm up, those blood vessels in
the skin gradually relax, and allow that blood

62
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:46,189
to return to the surface.

63
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:49,289
You’ve probably noticed that if you’re
cold for too long, your skin may lose some

64
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:53,609
of its color -- or even turn pale blue if
you’re light-skinned -- as that blood retreats

65
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,730
from the surface.

66
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:58,979
And in fact, like a litmus test for your body,
changes in the color of your skin can indicate

67
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:00,979
a number of homeostatic imbalances.

68
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:05,619
Blue skin, or cyanosis, in Caucasian people
may indicate heart failure, poor circulation,

69
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,870
or severe respiratory issues. That’s because
blood that’s been depleted of oxygen turns

70
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,730
darker in color, and when seen through the
tissue of lips or skin, it can look bluish.

71
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:19,339
A yellowing of the skin, called jaundice,
usually signifies liver disorder, as yellow

72
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,548
bile starts accumulating in the blood stream.

73
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:25,979
Reddened skin, or erythema, could indicate
a fever, inflammation, or allergy -- all of

74
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,810
these conditions cause blood vessels to expand
and more blood to flow to the skin’s surface.

75
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,930
Of course, human skin color spans a pretty
wide spectrum, so some of these conditions

76
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:37,829
are easier to diagnose by looking for discolorations
of other tissues, like mucous membranes and

77
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:39,609
the beds of finger and toenails.

78
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,620
However light or dark your skin color is,
though, you can thank your melanin for it.

79
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,730
You’ll remember that melanin is a pigment
produced by the melanocyte cells in your epidermis.

80
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,780
Melanin has two forms, producing pigments
that range in color from reddish yellow to

81
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:53,209
brownish black.

82
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,930
Because its main job is to protect us from
the sun’s ultraviolet rays, it makes sense

83
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,000
that, in the distant past, the distribution of these
different skin tones was not at all random.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,899
Historically, where solar radiation is more
intense, higher concentrations of deep-colored

85
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:07,429
melanin became an advantage for the protection
it provided.

86
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,620
But closer to the poles, where those solar
rays are weaker and more diffuse, lower concentrations

87
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,740
of melanin allowed people to collect what
sunlight was available, to manufacture vitamin D.

88
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,710
‘Cause the fact is, we all need some level
of sunlight to hit our skin to survive.

89
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:24,009
Your bones require vitamin D to keep producing
new bone cells, and it’s the only vitamin

90
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:28,199
that your body can actually produce on its
own. Your skin cells contain a molecule that

91
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:31,819
converts to vitamin D when it comes in contact
with UV light.

92
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:34,680
From there the vitamin heads through your
bloodstream to your liver and kidneys where

93
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,360
it truly becomes activated D, also called calcitriol,
which is circulated to all the bones of your body.

94
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,439
But let’s not just be skin-deep here -- your
integumentary system also involves your so-called

95
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:50,099
skin appendages -- your hair, nails, sweat
and sebaceous, or oil glands, which can each

96
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,750
be fascinating as well as frustrating in its
own way.

97
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,089
If you’re like some people I know and you
spend a fortune on hair conditioner? That’s

98
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,339
because your cuticles are out of control.

99
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:03,769
All of your hairs, or pili, are basically
just flexible strands of dead keratin protein

100
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:05,019
cells, like your fingernails.

101
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:08,539
And the outermost layer of these dead cells,
called the cuticle, looks like it’s made

102
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,450
of overlapping roof shingles. So what you’re
paying the conditioner to do is even out the

103
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:17,339
rough surface between those cells of the cuticle
to make it look smooth.

104
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:20,869
Now if you pluck out a strand of your hair
you will be in pain, but you will also have

105
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,540
the opportunity to notice that it has two
main regions -- the shaft -- where the keratinization

106
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:30,620
is complete -- and the root -- the part inside the
follicle where keratinization is still happening.

107
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,240
Each follicle is just a tube of epidermal
cells, and just like in your epidermis, the

108
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,150
cells at the bottom of each follicle are young
and fresh, continually dividing and pushing

109
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:43,569
older cells up through the skin and into the
open air.

110
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,620
And your finger- and toenails pretty much
grow the same way -- starting at the back

111
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:50,969
of the nail bed where new cells divide at
the root and get pushed forward, creating

112
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:56,090
the scaly-hard keratin that you paint with
polish and keep trimmed during flip-flop season.

113
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:59,509
But there’s probably no other part of the
integumentary system that you spend more money

114
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:02,399
on trying to control than your sweat and oil
glands.

115
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:08,019
You’ve got up to three million tiny sudoriferous,
or sweat glands distributed throughout your

116
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:13,359
body. These guys secrete your salty, watery
sweat, and they come in two types: eccrine

117
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,169
and apocrine.

118
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:17,799
Your eccrine sweat glands are more abundant
-- they’re in your palms, forehead, and

119
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,790
in the soles of your feet.

120
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:23,180
They’re just simple coiled tubes that start
in the dermis, extend through a duct, and

121
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,360
open into a pore on the surface of your skin.

122
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,009
Your apocrine sweat glands are a slightly
different story. You only have about 2000

123
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:32,769
of these, and they start cookin’ around
puberty, emptying into the hair follicles

124
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:34,430
around your armpits and groin.

125
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,459
These glands secrete a kind of deluxe sweat,
with fats and proteins in it. It’s more

126
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:42,829
viscous and sometimes yellowish in color.
When bacteria on the skin get a hold of this

127
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:46,359
sweat, it gets odorific, creating what we
generically call body odor.

128
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,319
Deodorants don’t affect how much you sweat,
but they do reduce those smells by attacking

129
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,430
the stink-making bacteria, while antiperspirants
do the opposite, using ingredients like aluminum

130
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,550
to block your sweat glands and actually keep
you from perspiring.

131
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,400
Some researchers believe these glands may
be the human equivalent of other animals’

132
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,989
musky sex scent glands. So while you might
not want to stink up a whole room, a little

133
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,290
bit of body odor might actually get you a
mate.

134
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:13,180
Mammary glands, which secrete milk in lactating
people, and ceruminous glands, the ones that

135
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,990
make your cerumen, or earwax, are two other
types of modified apocrine sweat glands.

136
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,569
Finally, your sebaceous, or oil glands are
found everywhere but the thick skin in your

137
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:27,430
palms and foot soles. Their ducts are smaller
on your limbs, but they’re pretty big on

138
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,370
your face, and neck, and upper chest.

139
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,918
Most of your sebaceous glands secrete their
sebum, an oily substance, into hair follicles

140
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:36,198
where it can travel to the surface of your
skin.

141
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:41,299
And while yes, they cause wicked pimples,
their primary goal is to soften and lubricate

142
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:45,799
your skin and hair, and help slow water loss
from the skin in dry environments.

143
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:49,179
Try to remember that the next time you have
a break-out before a big date or job interview.

144
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:51,508
Maybe it’ll make you feel better. It probably
won’t.

145
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:54,749
The irony here is that about half of the things
I showed at the beginning of this episode

146
00:08:54,749 --> 00:08:59,999
are used to wash away our natural protective
moisturizing oils, while the other half are

147
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:02,569
there to add them back through lotions and
conditioners!

148
00:09:02,568 --> 00:09:05,649
Deodorant, though. I think we’re all glad
that exists.

149
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:10,139
Today you learned how your integumentary system
protects your body, senses the outside world,

150
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:15,009
helps excrete waste, stores blood, regulates
temperature, makes vitamin D, indicates signs

151
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:18,749
