1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,459
I feel like I haven’t spent nearly enough
time lately talking to you about all the stupid

2
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:07,390
and dangerous things that you can do to your
own body, so let’s talk about doping.

3
00:00:07,389 --> 00:00:10,469
You probably have heard of this thanks to
Lance Armstrong, who secretly messed with

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,780
his own blood so that he could illicitly win
the Tour de France seven times in a row.

5
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:18,689
You might be dimly familiar with the fact
that doping isn’t like shooting steroids,

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,270
but it is still cheating, even though, like,
why is it cheating? And how does it work?

7
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:26,710
And is it even possible to make your blood
better at being blood?

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:32,010
In other words, how can some people treat -- or
mistreat -- their own blood like it’s some sort of drug?

9
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,789
Short answer: Because your blood is incredibly
powerful stuff.

10
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:40,780
And its power rests largely in your erythrocytes,
or red blood cells. They’re the most abundant

11
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,260
cell type in your blood, accounting for nearly
45 percent of its volume.

12
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:48,929
Every time you take a breath, they pick up
oxygen in your lungs and distribute it through

13
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:53,259
your body, and then grab carbon dioxide, and
bring it back to the lungs where it can be exhaled.

14
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:56,960
The main mission of erythrocytes is to keep
your body fed with oxygen, so your muscles

15
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,629
can do their thing, and your brain can continue to
think and feel and boss around your various parts.

16
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:05,989
But you don’t want to mess around with your red
blood cells because erythrocytes are weird characters.

17
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:10,420
They go places that other cells won’t. They
purge themselves of their most precious inner

18
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,478
belongings, preferring instead to live as
hollow shells.

19
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:16,379
Because of the crushing demands of their job,
they don’t live very long. And just like

20
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:20,289
with your blood pressure, too much of these
good things can turn bad quickly.

21
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:24,168
So the erythrocyte must be respected. It is
not for doping. Or for dopes.

22
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,519
Despite their prominent role in some international
sports scandals, your red blood cells are

23
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:41,089
fairly simple and unassuming little cells.

24
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:45,310
They’ve got a distinct biconcave shape -- which
just means that they’re concave on both

25
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:50,189
sides -- making them look kinda like a breath
mint… a tiny, bloody breath mint.

26
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:54,059
And while they have a plasma membrane, they
don’t have a nucleus and don’t have most

27
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,429
of the parts other cells do.

28
00:01:55,429 --> 00:02:00,668
So they’re basically just glorified, protein-filled
phospholipid-bilayer sacks. But they’re

29
00:02:00,668 --> 00:02:04,929
still another great example of that harmony
between form and function.

30
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:09,500
For one thing, that biconcave shape gives them a
large surface area that’s ideal for gas exchange.

31
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:14,110
It also makes them flexible, able to change
shape as they squeeze through tiny capillaries

32
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,709
with diameters smaller than the cell itself.

33
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:20,670
Of course, all that squeezing and twisting
is hard on a cell’s membrane, and that,

34
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:25,009
combined with their general lack of organelles
to help repair the membrane, means these cells

35
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:28,848
don’t live very long, surviving on average
only 120 days.

36
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:30,840
But they sure work hard while they’re alive.

37
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,120
And their work is mostly in gathering and
transporting oxygen. They’re able to do

38
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,629
this because, if you don’t count their water
content, red blood cells are 97 percent hemoglobin

39
00:02:39,628 --> 00:02:45,128
-- a molecule that easily binds to, and releases,
oxygen. It’s like an oxygen sponge.

40
00:02:45,128 --> 00:02:49,169
Every hemoglobin molecule is really made of
eight different component molecules -- four

41
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:54,568
are a red pigment called heme, and four are
a protein called, you guessed it, globin.

42
00:02:54,568 --> 00:02:58,798
Each globin is a globular polypeptide chain
-- hence its name -- and proteins, you’ll

43
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:00,989
probably remember, like to bind to stuff.

44
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:05,769
So each globin has its own personal ring-shaped
heme molecule, and in the center of that heme

45
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:09,968
is an iron atom, kinda like a cherry on top
of a protein-and-pigment sundae.

46
00:03:09,968 --> 00:03:13,378
It’s that iron in the center of the heme
that makes our blood red.

47
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:17,239
Incidentally, not all animals have red blood,
because not all animals use hemoglobin to

48
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,849
move oxygen. For example, most mollusks like
squids and snails have blue blood, because

49
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:26,998
it contains hemocyanin, a copper-rich protein-pigment
that turns blue when exposed to oxygen.

50
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:30,459
But, iron is what we’re stuck with, and
I have to say it’s great at its job, because

51
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:33,530
each iron can bind with one whole oxygen molecule.

52
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,568
And that oxygen really adds up.

53
00:03:35,568 --> 00:03:39,568
Since you have four iron atoms in every molecule
of hemoglobin and every red blood cell contains

54
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:46,078
something like 250 million hemoglobin molecules
that means each one of your tiny, floppy red-breath-mints

55
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:49,069
can grab about a BILLION molecules of oxygen.

56
00:03:49,068 --> 00:03:52,878
Exactly how they transfer oxygen and carbon
dioxide from your tissue cells is something

57
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:55,959
that we’ll get into when we talk about the
respiratory system.

58
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,938
But if you’re wondering why all this hemoglobin
can’t simply skip the red blood cell rigamarole

59
00:03:59,938 --> 00:04:04,169
and just run around naked in your blood, it’s
because free-range hemoglobin would actually

60
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:07,929
thicken the blood, making it so viscous that
it would impede blood flow.

61
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,528
This also happens to play a part in blood doping,
which -- stick with me -- I will explain in a bit.

62
00:04:12,528 --> 00:04:17,298
So what does the brief but glorious four-month
life of an erythrocyte look like? Well, remember

63
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:21,429
when I said a red blood cell doesn’t have
a nucleus? And maybe you thought, hey wait

64
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,650
a second, how can it even be a cell without
a nucleus, or DNA?

65
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:26,219
First of all, nice catch.

66
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,080
But actually, erythrocytes do start off with
a nucleus and DNA, they just get rid of them,

67
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:35,250
because their entire purpose for existing
is to schlep around hemoglobin and oxygen,

68
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,459
and they want the extra room.

69
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:40,758
The whole process of forming blood cells,
called hematopoiesis, happens in your red

70
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,800
bone marrow, which is mostly made of reticular
connective tissue that’s snuggled up to

71
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,110
special capillaries called blood sinusoids.

72
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:52,110
In short, the process begins with a hemocytoblast
-- or a specialized stem cell -- which soon

73
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:58,038
differentiates into an early erythroblast.
Then, it starts making a whole bunch of ribosomes,

74
00:04:58,038 --> 00:04:59,939
the organelles that manufacture proteins.

75
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:04,719
And in this case, the ribosomes start cooking
up tons of hemoglobin, as the cell transforms

76
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,190
into a late-stage erythroblast.

77
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:10,810
When it’s got enough hemoglobin, it suddenly
jettisons most of its organelles, which causes

78
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,478
the cell walls to collapse a little, giving
it its biconcave bloody breath-mint shape.

79
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:19,758
Now you’re left with a reticulocyte, which
is pretty much just an early erythrocyte that

80
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,129
still has a little group of ribosomes left,
called a reticulum.

81
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:26,289
So far, this whole journey so far has taken
about fifteen days.

82
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:30,339
When the reticulocyte is finally bursting
with hemoglobin, then it leaves the marrow

83
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:34,728
and enters the bloodstream, and a couple of
days later, when the last ribosomes have degraded,

84
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:37,829
you’ve officially got yourself a mature
red blood cell.

85
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:41,769
And that cell travels around your body, doing
its job for a few months before it gets old

86
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:43,529
or damaged and needs to be replaced.

87
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:48,448
Now, maintaining the balance between production
and destruction of these cells is crucial.

88
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:51,088
Too many will make the blood too
viscous and difficult to pump,

89
00:05:51,088 --> 00:05:54,199
and too few leads to oxygen deprivation, or hypoxia.

90
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:58,310
The process of maintaining the right levels
of red blood cells is regulated by a special

91
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:03,560
hormone called erythropoietin, or EPO. It’s
produced mostly in the kidneys, but also in

92
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,079
the liver, and is constantly circulating in
the blood.

93
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,469
If you’re anemic, or hiking at a high altitude,
or hemorrhaging blood, or experiencing anything

94
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,659
else that creates a drop in your blood oxygen
levels, certain cells in your kidney will

95
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:16,269
notice, and take action.

96
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:20,288
And they can do that, because they traffick
in a signaling molecule called hypoxia-inducible

97
00:06:20,288 --> 00:06:23,269
factor, which monitors your blood’s levels
of oxygen.

98
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:27,049
The way that this works is pretty cool. These
special kidney cells need oxygen in order

99
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:31,658
to break down that signaling molecule, so
if oxygen levels in the blood are low, they

100
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:35,560
can’t turn the signal off. This means that
the signal keeps going, which triggers the

101
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,379
release of more and more EPO, which stimulates
your red bone marrow to pump out more red

102
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,580
blood cells to carry around more oxygen.

103
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:46,939
As oxygen levels in your blood increase, the
signal is degraded, and EPO production slows.

104
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:50,569
And EPO is a key player in blood doping too,
but we’re gonna have to wait a minute before

105
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:54,460
we get there, because I first want to get
back to the fate of your hard-working erythrocytes.

106
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:58,788
So if you’re generating about two million
new blood cells every second, you also have

107
00:06:58,788 --> 00:07:02,709
to dispose of about the same number of dead
ones to maintain the balance, right?

108
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:06,418
When these cells get old, they turn rigid,
and their hemoglobins starts to fall apart.

109
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:10,799
As they get stiffer, they can end up getting
stuck in capillaries in your brain or heart,

110
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,870
which would not be good.

111
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,908
Luckily, you have certain channels to corral
these dying cells, especially around the spleen,

112
00:07:16,908 --> 00:07:20,408
which some anatomists call “the red blood
cell graveyard.”

113
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:25,379
So these tired old cells get trapped and then
basically ambushed by big macrophage white

114
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:29,569
blood cells in the spleen, liver, and bone
marrow, which break them down and recycle

115
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:30,840
their various components.

116
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:34,560
The globin proteins are broken down into their
basic components -- amino acids -- which go

117
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,168
back into the blood to be used by other cells
for making more proteins.

118
00:07:38,168 --> 00:07:41,589
Iron from the heme group is separated and
either bound to proteins and stored in the

119
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:46,098
liver, or put right back into a new hemoglobin
molecule. And the heme gets turned into bilirubin,

120
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:50,218
a yellowish pigment that goes to the liver
where it’s added to the bile that it secretes

121
00:07:50,218 --> 00:07:53,240
into the intestine and eventually leaves the
body in your poop.

122
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,180
Now that you know how your erythrocytes function
naturally, it’s easier to see how they can

123
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,139
be messed with -- often with bad results.

124
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:02,500
You can dope your blood in a few different
ways, but the most common technique is to

125
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,829
inject natural or synthetic EPO hormone to
boost your red blood cell production.

126
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:11,870
It’s also possible to draw and store some
of your own blood, and then transfuse it back

127
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:16,389
into your body after your body has recovered
from the blood loss, effectively raising your

128
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:17,930
volume of red blood cells.

129
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,060
The logic, if you can call it that, is that
more red blood cells equals more oxygen being

130
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,848
carried to your muscles, and therefore better
physical performance.

131
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:29,360
Now, the extra oxygen can’t change your actual
muscle strength, but the added aerobic capacity

132
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,019
does reduce muscle fatigue and enhance endurance,
by allowing your muscles to work harder for longer.

133
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:39,569
And it can provide enough of an extra edge
to win a race, like, say, the Tour de France.

134
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,820
Seven times.

135
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,240
But not only is it banned in athletic competitions,
blood doping is also dangerous.

136
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,320
Because, remember, a red blood cell count
that’s too high thickens the blood, and

137
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,930
that actually makes it harder for the heart
to pump blood around the body. In addition

138
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:55,349
to defeating the purpose of enhancing the
blood’s effectiveness, this can lead to

139
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,730
blood clots, and strokes, and heart failure.
So, no thank you.

140
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,580
Plus, cheating sucks.

141
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,420
But today you learned about the structure
and function of your erythrocytes, and of

142
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:09,199
hemoglobin, which they use to carry oxygen.
We also went through the formation and life

143
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,840
cycle of a red blood cell, and studied how
their levels are regulated by EPO and their

144
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,230
signalling molecules. Finally, we learned
how doping the blood is a recipe for disaster

145
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:23,950
and for finding yourself on Oprah and apologizing to
everyone you know and losing all of your yellow jerseys.
