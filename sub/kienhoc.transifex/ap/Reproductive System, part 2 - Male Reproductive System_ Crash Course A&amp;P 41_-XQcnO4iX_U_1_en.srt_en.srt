1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:01,980
Sex is a big gamble.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,910
I mean, the mental risks alone that we take
with our relationships are taxing enough:

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,919
When is he going to text me back? Am I good
enough? What if she doesn’t like the real me?

4
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,050
But the emotional price we pay for intimacy
can almost seem paltry compared to the physical

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,089
investments that our bodies make in order
to reproduce.

6
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:19,670
And the sexes each make this wager differently.

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,570
The female gamete is, biologically speaking,
a big bet.

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,570
It’s like putting all your chips on black.

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,539
An ovum and follicle take over a year to develop,
and, as human cells go, it’s huge -- about

10
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:32,629
a tenth of a millimeter, just large enough
to be seen with the naked eye.

11
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:37,259
Plus, it requires a whole network of supporting
tissues in the uterus while it waits for fertilization,

12
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:40,658
which -- if that doesn’t happen -- then
have to be shed and re-built a month later.

13
00:00:40,658 --> 00:00:44,558
And then there's the commitment. Once an egg
has been ovulated, everything in the female

14
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,998
reproductive system is dedicated to dealing
with that one cell for almost a month.

15
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:51,280
And if it gets fertilized, you’re looking
at 10 months.

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,149
But when it comes to playing the reproductive
roulette wheel, the male reproductive system

17
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:56,798
takes the opposite strategy.

18
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,599
If female gametes amount to a high-stakes
bet, the males’ are basically the penny slots.

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,540
Human sperm are only about one-hundred-thousandth
the mass of an egg. And they’re almost as

20
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:11,349
easy to produce as skin cells -- actually, the
process by which they mature is pretty similar.

21
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:16,078
That’s because sperm are small and stripped
down -- not invested in much beyond a nucleus,

22
00:01:16,078 --> 00:01:19,250
and a tail, and some extra mitochondria to
fuel their journey.

23
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,478
All they have to do is drop off their DNA,
and fall apart.

24
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,569
The risk of failure is still there. In fact,
with male gametes, the odds are overwhelmingly

25
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:29,648
against any single sperm actually accomplishing
its mission.

26
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:33,530
But while the female reproductive system meets
this risk head-on, with a single, big play,

27
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,390
the male’s tries to beat the odds with the
sheer force of numbers.

28
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,219
Here’s a question for you: why are the most
important parts of the male’s reproductive

29
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:54,579
system literally left hanging?

30
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,950
The testes -- the gonads of the anatomical
male -- are tasked with making male gametes,

31
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,749
sperm, and the androgen hormone testosterone.

32
00:02:01,748 --> 00:02:06,060
But unlike the ovaries, which are protected
inside the body, testicles dangle outside

33
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,429
the abdominal cavity, in the scrotum.

34
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,879
Because -- even though sperm may not be terribly big or
complex -- they’re touchy when it comes to temperature.

35
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:19,240
The rate at which they divide, copy DNA, and
even feel the effects of some hormones, are

36
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,050
all diminished at the core body temperature
of 37 degrees.

37
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,180
So the testes have to be outside the body
cavity to reach the lower temperature necessary

38
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,920
for proper spermatogenesis, or sperm production.

39
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:34,099
It’s a rare instance of sensitivity among what
are otherwise pretty hardy and expendable cells.

40
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:36,699
But that’s not to say that the testes aren’t
complex.

41
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:41,989
Each one is divided into about 250 sections,
called lobules, which are loaded with tightly-coiled

42
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,450
seminiferous tubules.

43
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:48,099
These tubules are the sperm factories, made
of a stratified epithelium surrounding a central

44
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:49,629
fluid-filled lumen.

45
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:53,819
And this sperm-making work is supported by
cells throughout and around the tubules.

46
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:58,150
Among the most important are the sertoli cells
inside the tubes, which nourish developing

47
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,530
sperm cells, sort of like how female follicle
cells help oocytes.

48
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:07,250
There are also Leydig cells that secrete testosterone,
much like the corpus luteum that secretes estrogen.

49
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,330
But compared to egg-making, spermatogenesis is
-- as I mentioned --

50
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,460
a pretty cheap and easy process, biologically.

51
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,719
It’s actually kind of like how your skin
cells are produced -- with stem cells at the

52
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:20,659
basal layer that produce immature cells, which in
turn get forced toward the surface as they mature.

53
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:25,340
But in this case, the sperm develop on the outer edge
of the tubule, and progress inward toward the lumen.

54
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:28,870
And it all begins with a trigger that -- if
you’ve seen our lesson on female reproduction

55
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,849
-- should look pretty familiar: a hormonal
cascade.

56
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:34,509
When puberty comes a-knocking,
the hypothalamus starts releasing

57
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:37,500
gonadotropin-releasing hormone, or GnRH.

58
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:42,370
And this tells the anterior pituitary to secrete
follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing

59
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,539
hormone into the blood, just like in females.

60
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:49,449
But in females, LH leads to the release of
estrogen in the follicles, whereas in males,

61
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:51,889
it spurs the Leydig cells to release testosterone.

62
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:57,279
Meanwhile, the FSH triggers the sertoli cells
to release androgen-binding protein, or ABP.

63
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,780
This binds to the testosterone, creating large,
local concentrations of the stuff, which is

64
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,280
ultimately what triggers the production of
sperm.

65
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,280
The targets of the testosterone are the outermost
cells in the tubules, called spermatogonia.

66
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,750
They’re the stem cells that set the sperm-making
process in motion, by dividing.

67
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,250
And actually, they’ve been doing that all
along -- even before puberty. Throughout childhood,

68
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,459
a spermatogonia cell uses mitosis to continuously
divide into two identical daughter cells.

69
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:26,389
But when puberty starts, the testosterone
causes them to divide differently -- instead

70
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:32,039
of splitting into two identical spermatagonia
cells, they begin producing two distinct spermatogonia.

71
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,910
One type of daughter cell -- known as a type
A cell -- stays up near the basal lamina and

72
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,430
just keeps dividing, so you never run out
of spermatogonia.

73
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,350
But the other kind -- the type B’s -- get
pushed down the tubule toward the lumen, and

74
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,890
turn into primary spermatocytes.

75
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:49,209
These primary spermatocytes then go into meiosis
I, and form two smaller haploid cells called

76
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:50,459
secondary spermatocytes.

77
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:55,519
They then rush through meiosis II, and their
resulting daughter cells total four round spermatids.

78
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:00,799
These spermatids now have all of the 23 chromosomes
they need for fertilization. But they aren’t exactly mobile.

79
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,840
If they’re ever gonna find themselves an egg,
they’ll need a way to get around -- they need a tail.

80
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:09,219
The process by which a spermatid elongates,
grows a tail, or flagellum, and officially

81
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,220
becomes a mobile sperm is called spermiogenesis.

82
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,720
And the whole process takes about five weeks.
But it’s not like it holds anything up,

83
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,290
because there are plenty more where those
spermatids came from.

84
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,569
In the end, each primary spermatocyte gives
rise to four actual sperm. And considering

85
00:05:23,569 --> 00:05:28,529
how many spermatogonia are continuously dividing
into spermatocytes, it’s easy to see how

86
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:32,189
a mature male can crank out 1500 sperm a second.

87
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:36,250
That’s a far cry from all the investment
that goes into making a single ovum.

88
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,810
Now, obviously, if sperm are going to get
anything accomplished, they have to leave

89
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,800
the seminiferous tubules that made them.

90
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,160
So, even once they have tails, they still
need a little help getting going.

91
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,480
That’s why each tubule is surrounded by
several layers of myoid cells, which, like

92
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,720
smooth muscle, rhythmically contract, using
peristalsis to squeeze sperm -- and some fluid

93
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,290
secreted by the sertoli cells -- through all
the twists and turns, toward their next destination,

94
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,580
the rete testis in the posterior testis.

95
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:06,750
From there, the sperm -- although still immobile
-- leave the testes, by way of the epididymis,

96
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:12,319
a long, tangled set of tubes behind the testes where
they’ll spend the next few weeks gaining their mobility.

97
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,099
The bulk of the epididymis consists of the
enormous duct of the epididymis, which, believe

98
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,199
it or not, could be uncoiled to stretch about
six meters -- though I don’t suggest doing that.

99
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,599
This duct is full of tiny microvilli called
stereocilia, which provide a huge surface

100
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:34,340
area to help reabsorb some extra fluid, and
help pass along nutrients to feed the idling sperm.

101
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:38,259
It takes sperm nearly 20 days to work their
way through this labyrinth, during which time

102
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:39,709
they continue to mature.

103
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:43,979
Once through the duct they enter the inferior
epididymis, where they gain mitochondria so

104
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,550
they’ll have energy to swim hard at a moment’s
notice.

105
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,629
At this point they have the hardware to swim,
but still lack the ability to actually move

106
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:55,139
on their own, a skill kept under wraps until
they leave the epididymis and get activated

107
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,290
by a series of glandular secretions.

108
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:01,949
When that time comes, during ejaculation,
the sperm flow from the epididymis through

109
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:06,250
the vas deferens, a tube that travels up behind
the bladder and joins with the duct from the

110
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,879
seminal gland to create the ejaculatory duct.

111
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,850
The left and right ejaculatory ducts pass
into the prostate gland where they empty into

112
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,199
the urethra, which runs from the bladder,
through the penis, and into the outside world.

113
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,520
This system of tubes feeding into tubes allows
all of the necessary glands to make their

114
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:26,379
contributions to a moving wave of seminal
fluid that helps sperm mature and perform

115
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,420
their ultimate function -- fertilization.

116
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,100
The resulting mix of sperm, testicular fluid, and
gland secretions -- which we call semen -- provide

117
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:38,460
sperm with transportation, nutritional energy,
chemical protection, and finally activates their motility.

118
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,650
So let’s take a look at these glands.

119
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:44,829
The seminal vesicles are a pair of small,
hollow glands behind the bladder that secrete

120
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:50,259
a yellowish, slightly alkaline fluid that
contains coagulating enzymes, fructose, and

121
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:52,930
other things to help nourish and transport
sperm.

122
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,509
Interestingly, the vesicles also secrete special
prostaglandins that help increase sperm success

123
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:02,769
outside of the body, by decreasing the viscosity
of a female’s cervical mucous, and actually

124
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:08,519
triggering a reverse peristalsis of the uterus that
helps draw sperm up the female reproductive tract.

125
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:13,560
Now, the prostate gland encircles the urethra
just inferior to the bladder. During ejaculation

126
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:18,310
it contracts to squeeze its own special secretion
into the urethra. This stuff contains mainly

127
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:23,220
citric acid and an enzyme cocktail that help
keeps semen liquified -- and thus easier to

128
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,490
move and swim through.

129
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:29,180
And finally we have the pea-sized bulbo-urethral
glands below the prostate, that secrete a

130
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:34,099
clear mucus that drains into the urethra to
clear out any acidic urine prior to ejeculation.

131
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:38,019
Speaking of, by now you may be wondering if
we’re ever going to get to what’s probably

132
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:41,068
the first thing you think of when it comes
to the male anatomy.

133
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:45,649
The penis hangs from the perineum, between
the pubic bone and coccyx. It consists of

134
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:50,980
a shaft that ends in an enlarged tip called the glans
penis, surrounded by a fleshy cuff of foreskin.

135
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:55,279
Internally, the penis contains three layers
of erectile tissues, each wrapped in a layer

136
00:08:55,289 --> 00:09:00,889
of dense fibrous connective tissue. This spongy
network is made of connective tissue and smooth

137
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:06,149
muscle that’s full of tiny vascular spaces
that fill with blood during sexual arousal,

138
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:08,318
and make the penis expand and become rigid.

139
00:09:08,318 --> 00:09:11,639
The resulting erection is what helps the penis
penetrate the vagina.

140
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:14,789
And, the fact that we’re only now getting
around to talking about it here at the end

141
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:19,269
should tell you that -- as with the female
external genitalia -- the penis actually isn’t

142
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:22,389
all that important in terms of overall reproductive
function.

143
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:27,129
Evolutionarily speaking it’s just a delivery
system, designed to get male gametes as close

144
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:31,149
to female gametes as possible, and reap some
payoff for their investments.

145
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:36,139
Now! What that payoff looks like in term of
fertilization is where we’re headed next week.

146
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:40,659
But for now, you learned all you’d ever
care to about testicular anatomy, the steps

147
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:45,409
of sperm production, and how it’s influenced
by gonadotropin and testosterone. We also

148
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:50,578
looked at how sperm mature, and how they leave
the body on a tide of glandular secretions

149
00:09:50,578 --> 00:09:51,688
during ejaculation.
