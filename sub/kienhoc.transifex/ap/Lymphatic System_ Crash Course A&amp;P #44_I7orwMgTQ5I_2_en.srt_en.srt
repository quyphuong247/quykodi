1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,629
Let’s say you’re at the airport. You’re
waiting in line to get through security.

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:07,628
You’re in your socks, in public, and you’re
wrestling with those plastic bins, and people

3
00:00:07,628 --> 00:00:11,320
are yelling at you about dumping liquids and
taking your laptop out your bag.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,469
But even with a certain amount of chaos, the
line moves pretty quickly.

5
00:00:14,468 --> 00:00:15,989
I mean, it should. Theoretically.

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,289
Because really, everyone has the same goal:
to get to where they need to be.

7
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,480
Now, you probably think that I’m setting you
up to talk about stress or anxiety or something.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,800
But I am not!

9
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:29,439
Instead, I want you to imagine that security
line as being like your blood, moving through

10
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,740
your high-pressured circulatory system.

11
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,488
And you, my friend, are not just some impatient
traveler in a hurry to catch the next plane

12
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:38,099
to Seattle. You are a bit of blood plasma.

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,359
And the biggest concern of everyone in your
queue is just to get delivered to their destination.

14
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:45,808
But the problem with rushing stuff through
a blood vessel -- or a security line -- is

15
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:49,929
that if it moves too fast, you run the risk
that something bad might get through.

16
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:53,000
So, in the case of the line at the airport,
every now and then, the security people funnel

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,030
some random people into a slower line for
a full pat down and bag check.

18
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,899
And, that is kinda what your lymphatic system
does. It takes up some extra fluid and, while

19
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:06,700
it’s ultimately helping it get to its destination
-- it runs a background check to make sure it’s legit.

20
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,260
It may not be as well-known as some of your
more popular organ systems, but your lymphatic

21
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:16,200
system quietly plays a vital supporting role
to both your cardiovascular and immune systems.

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,250
For one thing, it maintains your homeostasis
by eventually returning most of the fluid

23
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,359
that has been diverted back into your blood.

24
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:25,929
Which is good, because if it didn’t, your
ankles would swell up like balloons, your

25
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,420
lungs would fill with fluid, and your blood
volume and pressure would drop to the point

26
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,850
where your body would just give up and you
die.

27
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:35,929
But the lymphatic system isn’t just another
security line. It also has a series of checkpoints

28
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,880
that are staffed by special security officers that have
the ability to take care of small infections on the spot.

29
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,839
Or if they really don’t like the looks of
what they’ve found, they can alert the whole

30
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:45,438
immune system to take it down.

31
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,589
So, for keeping your blood-volume levels where
they need to be, for keeping you from collapsing

32
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,520
from low blood pressure, and for preventing
you from dying from a staph infection every

33
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,569
time you scrape your elbow, you have to thank
the unsung hero of your anatomy:

34
00:01:57,569 --> 00:01:59,250
your lymphatic system.

35
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,199
Structurally speaking, your lymphatic system
consists of three main parts:

36
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,479
The first is just ...your lymph.

37
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:18,719
It’s a watery fluid that flows through your
lymphatic system.

38
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,729
Much of your lymph starts out as blood plasma
that gets forced out of your capillaries,

39
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:26,609
way down in the capillary beds, where the
leakage helps the exchange of nutrients and

40
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,220
gases between the blood in the capillaries
and the hungry cells in your tissues.

41
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:34,469
The blood capillaries reabsorb some of the
fluid, but a lot gets left behind. So, much

42
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:37,949
of the rest of your lymphatic system works
to soak it up and get it back to where it

43
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,399
needs to go, inspecting it along the way.

44
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,459
For example, you have a network of lymphatic
vessels that help reabsorb the fluid, and

45
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:50,079
about 600 or 700 lymph nodes, which are basically 
checkpoints that monitor and cleanse the lymph

46
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,180
as it filters through.

47
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,560
Then there are special lymphoid organs, like
the spleen, thymus, adenoids, and tonsils,

48
00:02:55,568 --> 00:02:58,329
as well as other lymphoid tissues throughout
the body.

49
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:02,140
Some of these organs and tissues house special
defensive cells of the immune system to fight

50
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:06,189
infection by gobbling up bacteria and other
harmful antigens -- all of which we’ll get

51
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:10,759
into a lot more in upcoming lessons. Others,
like the thymus and spleen, provide a nursery

52
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:13,030
for maturing immune cells called lymphocytes.

53
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,568
But to understand the special supporting role
that your lymphatic system plays in your body,

54
00:03:16,568 --> 00:03:20,939
let’s start with its origins -- in the capillary
beds of your circulatory system.

55
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:24,969
You’ll recall that these beds are where
the capillaries carry blood from your arterioles

56
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:29,379
-- and your arteries before that -- and feed blood
into your venules -- and eventually your veins.

57
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:33,780
This is where the transfer of nutrients and
waste takes place, as blood pressures force

58
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:38,620
plasma out of the arteriole end of the capillaries
and into the interstitial fluid between the

59
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,610
cells of whatever tissue you happen to be
in.

60
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:44,170
And most of that fluid gets drawn right
back into the capillaries on the venous end,

61
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:45,699
thanks to osmotic pressure.

62
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:50,339
But some is left behind. Of the 20 liters
a day that’s forced through the arteriolar

63
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,900
end of all the capillaries all over your body,
only 17 liters is taken back up by the venous end.

64
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,739
Those other 3 liters? That becomes your lymph.

65
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,200
It’s almost immediately picked up by nearby
lymphatic capillaries that wind their way

66
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,859
in and among the blood capillaries, and they’re
really well-suited for the job.

67
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,799
Lymphatic capillaries are made of loosely
overlapping, endothelial cells that look kind

68
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,480
of like roofing shingles, forming little flap-like
valves that only open in one direction.

69
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,870
So when the pressure in the interstitial space
becomes greater than the pressure inside the

70
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:23,350
lymphatic capillary, the flaps push open and
take in fluid to relieve the pressure.

71
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,550
Once the fluid is inside a lymphatic capillary,
we can officially call it lymph. Then it flows

72
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:33,300
through successively larger lymphatic vessels
to collecting vessels and then to larger trunks

73
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,270
and finally, into one of two big ducts that
feed back into the lowest pressure area of

74
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:39,430
the circulatory system.

75
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,990
The right lymphatic duct drains all the lymph
collected from the upper right area of the

76
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,889
torso, as well as the right arm, and the right
sides of the head and thorax, and feeds them

77
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,810
all into the internal jugular vein.

78
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,490
The larger thoracic duct takes lymph from
the rest of the body, and dumps it into the

79
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,629
subclavian vein.

80
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,779
Overall, these vessels work a lot like your
veins do. They operate under very low pressure,

81
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:04,349
have a series of valves that prevent backflow,
and are helped along a bit by smooth muscle

82
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,350
in the vessel walls that keep the fluid moving.

83
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,520
OK, so the lymphatic system takes extra fluid
that’s squeezed out of the blood capillaries

84
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:14,788
and basically mops it up. That sounds handy.
But, as a living thing that wants to stay

85
00:05:14,788 --> 00:05:17,079
alive, what’s in it for you, exactly?

86
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:21,779
Well, remember: We’re talking about recovering
3 liters of blood fluid per day -- that’s

87
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,948
more than half of your total blood volume.

88
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:27,169
If that weren’t returned to your circulatory
system, you’d be looking at a serious drop

89
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:30,969
in blood pressure, and little to no oxygen
delivery, or waste pick up.

90
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,830
Plus, any blockage in the lymph system -- like
from a tumor that obstructs one of your vessels

91
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:39,529
-- can be really dangerous, resulting in edema,
or swelling, that can constrain blood flow

92
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:41,129
and lead to serious complications.

93
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:45,019
And finally: Don’t forget that your lymph also plays
a key role in the function of your immune system.

94
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:49,000
Say you scrape your elbow, and some bad stuff
-- like the staphylococcus bacteria that’s

95
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,100
covering your entire body right now -- infiltrates
some of the loose areolar connective tissue

96
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,000
under your skin.

97
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:57,589
Since that tissue is full of interstitial
fluid that drains into your lymphatics, which

98
00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:01,788
ultimately drain to your heart, you’re going
to want to vanquish those bad guys before

99
00:06:01,788 --> 00:06:04,029
they have a chance to wreak any havoc.

100
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:05,439
What ever will you do?

101
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,959
Well, this is where your lymph nodes come
in.

102
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:12,159
Your body’s main lymphoid organs, the lymph
nodes are where your lymph gets close and

103
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,410
regular inspection by its resident immune
cells, lymphocytes.

104
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,610
Depending on what kind of troublemaker they
find in the fluid, the lymphocytes might trigger

105
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,259
the release of resident macrophages to attack
unwanted microorganisms. Or they might activate

106
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:25,900
the general immune system outside of the node,
if they need extra support.

107
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:30,429
The details of how that happens we will get
to next time, but for now just understand

108
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,870
that lymphocytes are found in, and mature
in, the loose reticular connective tissue

109
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,879
that makes up a large part of the nodes and
most of your other lymphoid organs.

110
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,829
Now, if a node is overwhelmed by whatever
invader it’s trying to quell, it may become

111
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:45,279
inflamed.
You can actually feel some of your nodes if

112
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,918
you poke around the sides of your neck.

113
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:51,189
They feel like little bumps...yeah, there
they are.

114
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:55,639
And noticeably enlarged lymph nodes are often
an early diagnostic sign of disease or infection,

115
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,259
which is why doctors are always feeling around
under your jawline during check-ups.

116
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:02,629
But your lymph nodes aren’t the system’s
only checkpoints. You’ve also got a few

117
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:07,399
special outposts placed at strategic entry
points to particularly sensitive tissues,

118
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,649
like the those in the respiratory and digestive
tracts.

119
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:14,348
These are called mucosa-associated lymphoid
tissues, or MALTs, because they can be found

120
00:07:14,348 --> 00:07:17,719
in mucous membranes around the body, outside
of the lymphatic vessels.

121
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,960
Your tonsils are some of the largest collections
of these tissues, which together form a ring

122
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:26,430
around the entrance of the pharynx. There
they can inspect everything you eat and breathe

123
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,160
and try to remove any pathogens before they
enter the GI tract or lungs.

124
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,150
It’s a pretty big job, actually, which is
why sore throats and swollen tonsils are a

125
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:36,239
common sign of a cold or other infection.

126
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,990
Another collection of MALTs, called Peyer’s
patches, are in the distal portion of the

127
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:43,319
small intestine, providing another check point
along the GI tract.

128
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,050
And contrary to popular myth, your appendix
is not useless, because it too contains a

129
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,348
bunch of lymphoid tissue and is conveniently
located where it can destroy any remaining

130
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:55,870
bacteria before it can breach the intestinal
wall during absorption.

131
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,329
Exactly how your lymph and immune cells detect
and destroy the unwanted visitors that might

132
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:04,939
otherwise kill you is what we’re gonna be
talking about for the remainder of this course.

133
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:09,668
But for now you learned how your unsung lymphatic
system supports cardiovascular function by

134
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:14,219
collecting, filtering, and returning interstitial
fluid back into the bloodstream via a system

135
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,310
of lymphatic vessels. We also talked about
the system’s major role in fighting off

136
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:23,939
infection, and how lymph nodes, and other
lymphoid organs, and MALT areas house antigen-attacking

137
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:27,129
lymphocytes that provide crucial support to
the immune system.
