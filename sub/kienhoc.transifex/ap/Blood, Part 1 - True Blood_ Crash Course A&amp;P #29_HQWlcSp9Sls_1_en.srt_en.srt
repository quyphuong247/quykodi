1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,720
Don’t take this the wrong way, but you’re
pretty replaceable.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,060
When it comes to your body, science has figured
out how to hack, synthesize, or replace a

3
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:09,808
surprising amount of its parts and processes.

4
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:13,199
We have implants to keep heart beats steady,
and steel rods to mimic bones.

5
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,579
We’ve got drugs that can replace hormones,
and antibiotics to cover for your immune system,

6
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:21,679
and pretty soon you’ll be able to just 3D
print a new ear if you need one. Really!

7
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:26,199
But one thing we absolutely cannot manufacture
-- despite what True Blood would have you believe --

8
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:29,460
is blood.
And yet blood is a thing that we all need.

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,039
And sometimes, because of injury or illness,
we need extra blood.

10
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,899
In fact, every two seconds, someone in the
U.S. needs a blood transfusion. This could

11
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:41,159
be a victim of a car accident, someone undergoing
surgery, or a cancer patient who needs new

12
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:43,669
blood to maintain their health during chemotherapy.

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,989
And because we can’t grow it on trees, or
make it in a lab, or even it store it for

14
00:00:46,988 --> 00:00:51,328
all that long, the blood that people need
-- nearly 16 million pints a year in the U.S.

15
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:53,719
-- has to come from people who have donated
it.

16
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:55,149
So let’s talk blood, shall we?

17
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:59,789
The meal of choice for vampires and female
mosquitoes, blood is red, sticky, salty, and

18
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:00,780
kind of metallic tasting.

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,049
It is indeed thicker than water, and super
viscous -- which is why Hitchcock used chocolate

20
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:08,190
syrup as a stand-in in a certain classic shower
scene.

21
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:13,239
For most purposes, blood comes in eight different
types, and it accounts for about 8% of your body weight.

22
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,949
You might remember from our episodes on tissues
that blood is a type of connective tissue,

23
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,270
which means it’s made of living cells suspended
in a nonliving matrix, which in this case

24
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:23,719
is the fluid ground substance called plasma.

25
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:27,939
And of course one of blood’s main missions
is to transport and distribute oxygen, nutrients,

26
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:29,859
waste products, and hormones around the body.

27
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:34,680
But it also helps regulate and maintain body
temperature, pH levels, and the volume of

28
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,280
fluids in your body. Plus it protects you from
infection and from the loss of blood itself.

29
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,480
Perhaps second only to your brain, your blood
is the one component of your body that we

30
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,880
haven’t figured out how to reproduce, synthesize,
or imitate.

31
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:51,119
It’s a part of you that is literally irreplaceable.

32
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:05,379
It’s Saturday and you feel like doing a
good deed, so you head over to your local

33
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:06,899
Red Cross for a blood drive.

34
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,460
You get your finger pricked and then somebody
directs you toward a lounge chair, swabs your

35
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,760
inner elbow with alcohol, and then comes at
you with a hollow needle.

36
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,199
Once the bag is full -- they usually take
about a pint -- you get unhooked and grab

37
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,739
a cookie and a juice to replace the blood sugar you lost.
And the whole process takes around 20 minutes.

38
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,900
But for your blood, the day is just beginning.
Soon it will be taken to a lab, where it’ll

39
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,580
be tested for infectious diseases and separated
into different parts before heading out to hospitals.

40
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,819
So, hold up: What exactly do I mean by different
parts?

41
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:38,889
Well, the blood that flows from your arm into
that bag is whole blood, a mixture of cells

42
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:43,809
and cell fragments called formed elements,
along with water, and lots of dissolved molecules.

43
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,870
A patient who needs a transfusion may only
need some of those things and not others,

44
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,180
so the parts are separated.

45
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:52,959
Once your blood makes it to a lab, technicians
put it in a centrifuge, which spins it around

46
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,400
fast enough to send the heavier components
to the bottom of the tubes, and bring the

47
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,020
less dense elements to the top.

48
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,459
In the centrifuge, three distinct layers emerge.

49
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:04,569
Down at the bottom you’ve got a heavy red
layer of erythrocytes, or red blood cells

50
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:09,459
that carry oxygen and carbon dioxide. They make 
up about 45 percent of your total blood volume.

51
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,840
Then you’ve got this thin little whitish
layer in the middle. Those are your warriors,

52
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:18,409
the leukocytes or white blood cells, that
defend your body from toxins and foreign microbes.

53
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:22,128
And there are also the cell fragments, called
platelets, which help with blood clotting

54
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:24,419
and make up less than one percent of your
blood.

55
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:29,780
Finally, up at the top you see the yellowish plasma,
which accounts for about 55%of your blood volume.

56
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,599
Plasma is actually 90 percent water, but the
other 10 percent is chock full of 100 different

57
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,378
solutes, including proteins, electrolytes,
gases, hormones, and waste products.

58
00:03:38,378 --> 00:03:41,768
The most of abundant of these solutes are
electrolytes -- which you may have heard of

59
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:46,920
as the secret ingredient in sports drinks. But they’re
really just positively-charged cations -- like calcium,

60
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:52,239
sodium, and potassium -- and negatively-charged
anions, like phosphate, sulfate, and bicarbonate.

61
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:57,820
Together these ions help regulate your blood’s
chemistry, maintaining its pH levels and proper osmotic

62
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:03,539
pressure, and allowing other tissues to do their jobs, like
making muscles contract and sending action potentials.

63
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:08,699
But when measured by weight, the bulk of the
solutes in your blood are really the plasma proteins.

64
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:12,979
Most of these proteins -- like albumin, and
alpha and beta globulins -- are made by the

65
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:17,000
liver, and do things like balance the osmotic
pressure between the blood and surrounding

66
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:19,619
tissues, and transport lipids and ions.

67
00:04:19,619 --> 00:04:25,119
Others run defense for you, like the gamma globulin
antibodies that are released by plasma cells during

68
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,560
an immune response, or fibrinogen proteins, which
are vital to forming blood clots and stopping bleeding.

69
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,000
All right, bleeding. I want to talk about that.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,639
Because, for the very reason that I mentioned
at the beginning -- that we can’t replace

71
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,158
your blood with some synthetic wonder-fluid
-- the LAST THING that your circulatory system

72
00:04:41,158 --> 00:04:45,868
wants is for you to fritter away your blood,
in some sidewalk scrape or kitchen accident.

73
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:49,969
So, it has a whole system in place to prevent
you from losing too much of it, through a

74
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:52,129
process known as hemostasis.

75
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:56,580
So imagine you’re slicing a nice garlic-cheese
bagel one morning, and you lacerate the distal

76
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:00,359
phalanx of your pollex -- in other words,
you cut the tip of your thumb.

77
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,189
And now you’re bleeding all over your breakfast.

78
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:06,009
At the very first sign of a rupture, the blood
vessel actually constricts itself, to slow

79
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:07,580
the flow of blood through it.

80
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:11,008
Then little cell fragments called platelets
gather at the site of the injury, creating

81
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:14,460
a plug that dams the breech and keeps the
blood from leaking further.

82
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:17,978
Now these free-floating platelets don’t clump
together during regular circulation -- that

83
00:05:17,978 --> 00:05:22,348
would be terrible -- but when the endothelial
cells lining a blood vessel wall tear, the

84
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:27,449
underlying collagen fibers are suddenly exposed.
And they chemically react with the platelets,

85
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:30,379
turning them all sticky and glue-like at the
scene of the injury.

86
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:34,369
But that platelet plug still isn’t as strong
as it could be -- it needs reinforcement to

87
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:35,960
complete the clotting process.

88
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:40,498
This reinforcement comes in the form of fibrin
threads, protein strands that join together

89
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:43,749
to make a sort of mesh that traps the platelets
and blood cells.

90
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:47,960
Eventually, the threads actually pull the
opposite sides of the wound together, to close

91
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:51,028
the vessel wall, so the endothelial cells
can be replaced.

92
00:05:51,028 --> 00:05:53,740
Over a few days, the blood vessel heals, and
the blood clot dissolves.

93
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,199
Or at least, that’s how it is supposed to
happen.

94
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,439
People who suffer from disorders related to
hemostasis may have trouble with unwanted

95
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,540
clotting, or the inability to form clots.

96
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,718
In the family of disorders known as hemophilia,
a patient can usually complete the first two

97
00:06:06,718 --> 00:06:11,699
steps of hemostasis just fine, but they can’t
make an effective fibrin clot. So it’s not that they

98
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:16,199
bleed more than anyone else, it’s just that they bleed
longer. Which, I guess means that they bleed more.

99
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,528
As a result, they may need frequent blood
transfusions throughout their lifetime.

100
00:06:19,528 --> 00:06:22,278
Which brings me right back around to that
Saturday morning blood drive.

101
00:06:22,278 --> 00:06:25,749
Another thing you’re going to need to know
before you give blood is what type you have

102
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:29,149
-- do you have A, B, AB, or O?

103
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:33,240
These different types all do the job equally
well, they just sort of have a different flavor

104
00:06:33,249 --> 00:06:34,889
related to your immune system.

105
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:39,098
All the cells in your body have a plasma membrane
with specialized glycoprotein markers on them

106
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:43,408
that act like name tags or labels, sort of
like “This cell is Property of Hank.”

107
00:06:43,408 --> 00:06:45,158
These markers are your antigens.

108
00:06:45,158 --> 00:06:49,118
And your body’s immune system is totally
fine with your particular antigens, but if

109
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:53,869
it detects antigens from someone else’s
cells -- including viruses or bacteria -- then

110
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:59,109
it’ll send out antibodies to bind to those markers, often
to tag them for destruction by the immune system.

111
00:06:59,108 --> 00:07:03,859
Your red blood cells have specialized antigens on
them, called agglutinogens, that activate antibodies

112
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:09,800
that work by binding invading cells to each other,
which causes coagulation, or the clumping of blood.

113
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,220
Which agglutinogens you have on your
erythrocytes defines your blood type.

114
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,020
But they’re classified in two different ways.

115
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:18,158
In the most important blood classification
-- the kind people are most familiar with

116
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:22,959
-- there are only two kind of agglutinogens,
simply A and B. And your blood can either have

117
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,319
one, or both, or neither of these molecules.

118
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,379
So the name of your blood type refers to what
kind you have or don’t have: A-type has

119
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:34,819
A antigens, B-type has B, AB has both, and
O has neither.

120
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:37,689
So, why do you need to know what type you
are before you give or receive blood?

121
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:40,899
Well, like I mentioned: If you have either
of these antigens, your body will be fine

122
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:43,809
with it, because it doesn’t produce any
antibodies that label it for attack.

123
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:47,699
So if you don’t have a particular antigen
on your blood cells -- say the type B -- then

124
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:53,419
you do have antibodies that are going to label those
B antigens for attack, should they enter your space.

125
00:07:53,418 --> 00:07:58,209
So AB-type folks are called universal recipients,
because they have both antigens, and therefore

126
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:05,038
no antibodies for either. So they can accept
A, or B, or AB, or O blood. Meanwhile, O-type

127
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:10,079
doesn’t have A or B antigens, so those folks
have antibodies for both. That means that they

128
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,199
can only accept other O blood.

129
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:16,338
And yet that lack of antigens means that Type
O blood can mix with other types of blood

130
00:08:16,338 --> 00:08:19,879
without getting attacked, which is why it’s
known as the universal donor.

131
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:23,278
But just to complicate things a little bit
more, you’ve got a whole other set of antigens

132
00:08:23,278 --> 00:08:28,058
with totally different protocol. These are
your Rhesus, or Rh antigens, named after the

133
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:30,689
species of monkey they were first identified
in.

134
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:35,019
Much like A and B, you either have the Rh
antigens, in which case you’re Rh positive,

135
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:36,828
or your don’t, and are Rh negative.

136
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:41,578
Most of the population is Rh positive, so
they don’t have the anti-Rh antibodies,

137
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:45,599
which means they can accept either positive
or negative blood. But negative types should

138
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,649
stick to just the Rh negative blood.

139
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:51,549
And since the presence of A-B antigens is
controlled by different genes than the Rh

140
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:56,689
ones, we end up with eight different blood types --
four separate groups, each with two variations.

141
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:02,010
And now, hopefully, you understand why it’s
so hard to replace blood, and why True Blood

142
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:05,129
is...not true. I’ve not actually ever seen
that show.

143
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:08,679
Along the way, you also learned the basic
components of blood -- including erythrocytes,

144
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:13,959
leukocytes, platelets, and plasma -- as well
as the basic process of hemostasis that stops

145
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,460
bleeding, and how antigens are responsible
for the blood type that you have.
