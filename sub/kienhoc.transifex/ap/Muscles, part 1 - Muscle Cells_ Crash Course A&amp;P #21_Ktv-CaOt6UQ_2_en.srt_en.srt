1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,038
Romeo and Juliet. Helen and Paris. Tristan
and Isolde.

2
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:08,649
These famous star-crossed lovers bring to
mind insatiable longing, forbidden love, and

3
00:00:08,648 --> 00:00:12,108
tragic separation. And poets and emo rockers
love them for it.

4
00:00:12,108 --> 00:00:14,379
But you know where else you can find a nice
hot romance?

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,419
Your muscle cells.

6
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:21,298
They’ve got their own famous coupling -- a pretty
pair of tiny protein strands called actin and myosin.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,380
Romeo and Juliet may have set a chain of tragic
events into motion with their infatuation,

8
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:29,489
but deep down in the cells of your muscles,
the hot protein action between actin and myosin

9
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:33,369
is actually, literally causing all of
your motions. ALL of them.

10
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:36,679
And I don’t just mean voluntary stuff, like
walking down the street, or moving your mouth

11
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:41,899
so you can talk or chew chips. Because your muscles
also support your weight and help fend off gravity.

12
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:46,579
The amazing thing about your complicated,
self-healing, blood-guzzling muscle tissues

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,329
is that they turn chemical potential energy
into mechanical energy, or movement, simply

14
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,480
by doing two things -- contracting and relaxing.

15
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,469
And that contracting and relaxing is exactly
what’s fueled by the constant coupling and

16
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,929
separation of biology’s greatest lovers.

17
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:03,009
Somebody get these proteins a movie contract.

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,320
You will recall from our early lessons on
tissues that you’re kept alive and moving

19
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:21,659
by three types of muscle tissue: smooth, cardiac,
and skeletal.

20
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,920
Your smooth muscle tissue is found in the
walls of all your hollow visceral organs,

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,019
like your stomach, and airways, and blood
vessels, where it involuntarily and very usefully

22
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:35,479
pushes fluid and other material around by
contracting and relaxing, over and over.

23
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:39,719
Your heart is so important that it gets its
very own muscle tissue type -- cardiac muscle,

24
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:44,219
which looks striped, or striated, and also
functions involuntarily to keep your blood

25
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:46,069
pumping without you having to think about
it.

26
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:49,599
But when you hear the word “muscle,” you
probably think of the kind you see on Chris

27
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,438
Evans when he first walks out of that machine
in Captain America.

28
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:57,879
And those types -- the ones you can see and
feel and flex -- are your 640 skeletal muscles.

29
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:01,989
They’re striated like cardiac muscle tissue,
but they’re also mostly voluntary, meaning

30
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:05,909
you have to think about using them and activate
them with your somatic nervous system. Most of

31
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,810
them attach to your skeleton, and create movement by
pulling bones in different directions as they contract.

32
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,069
Each one of your different skeletal muscles
-- like your biceps brachii, or vastus lateralis

33
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:20,068
or gluteus maximus -- is technically its own
organ, made up mostly of muscle tissue, but

34
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:23,009
also of connective tissue, blood vessels,
and nerve fibers.

35
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:27,229
And because your muscles are voracious energy
hogs, each one is rigged up with its own personal

36
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:31,789
nerve to stimulate contraction, and its own
artery and vein to keep it well-fed with all

37
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:34,039
the blood, and oxygen, and nutrients it needs
to operate.

38
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:37,959
But to understand those operations, we first
need to get a grip on the anatomy of a skeletal

39
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,020
muscle, which involves fibers within fibers,
and lots of layers.

40
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,659
Basically, a skeletal muscle is constructed
like a really sturdy piece of rope.

41
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:49,318
Thousands of tiny, parallel threads called
myofibrils squish together to form muscle

42
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:53,689
fibers, which are your actual muscle cells
-- cells with mitochondria, multiple nuclei,

43
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:56,209
and a cellular membrane called a sarcolemma.

44
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:00,659
Those muscle fibers then form larger, string-like
bundles called fascicles, which combine to

45
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:04,259
form the larger rope-like muscle organ, like
your biceps brachii.

46
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:08,959
Overall, this bundles-of-bundles configuration
makes muscle tissue fairly sturdy. But considering

47
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,569
how much abuse your muscles take when you
do something like pretty simple, like lift

48
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:15,738
a big bag of dog food, it’s no surprise
they need a little help.

49
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:19,810
That’s why every muscle contains a few different
kinds of supportive sheaths of connective

50
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,080
tissue -- the protective reinforcements to
keep that bulging muscle from bursting.

51
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,190
So that is the structure part of the story.

52
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:30,129
But if you want to get into the nitty-gritty
-- the down-and-dirty -- of how you actually

53
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:31,719
move, well, there are rules.

54
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:34,848
Really, just two main rules, and they have
to do with proteins.

55
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:38,709
And they’re both true for a lot of the proteins
we talk about, whether they’re enzymes or

56
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:41,348
ion channels or receptors or muscle proteins.

57
00:03:41,348 --> 00:03:42,908
And these rules are:

58
00:03:42,908 --> 00:03:47,199
One. Proteins like to change shape when stuff
binds to them. And two. Changing shapes can

59
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:50,519
allow proteins to bind -- or unbind -- with
other stuff.

60
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,719
So keep those rules in mind, while we see
how a muscle fiber contracts and relaxes.

61
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,669
Now, remember those tiny myofibrils that bundle
up to form your muscle fibers?

62
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:02,750
They’re divided lengthwise into segments
called sarcomeres, which contain two even

63
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:09,219
tinier strands of protein -- two different
kinds of myofilaments called actin and myosin.

64
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:14,479
And it’s their angsty story of star-crossed love that fuels
every movement your body could possibly dream up.

65
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:19,438
A sarcomere contains both thin filaments,
made up mostly of two light and twisty actin

66
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,710
strands, and thick filaments, composed of
thicker, lumpy-looking myosin strands.

67
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:28,649
Each sarcomere is separated by what’s known
as a Z line at either end, which is just a

68
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:32,709
border formed by alternating thin filaments
in a kind of zig zag pattern.

69
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:37,299
A muscle contracting is all about sarcomeres
contracting, bringing those Z-lines closer together.

70
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,069
All right, so now comes the romance.

71
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:45,429
When your muscle cells are at rest, your actin & myosin
strands don’t touch, but they really, really want to.

72
00:04:45,428 --> 00:04:50,299
Specifically, that club-headed myosin wants
to get all up-close-and-personal with the actin.

73
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,780
When this happens -- and it will, eventually -- it’s called
the sliding filament model of muscle contraction.

74
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:59,939
But in the meantime, like in any good love
story, the pair have some obstacles to overcome.

75
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:04,420
Namely, actin is blocked by a couple of protein
bodyguards -- called tropomyosin and troponin

76
00:05:04,428 --> 00:05:06,068
-- which keep getting in the way.

77
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:10,209
Luckily, these guards can be bought off
with a little ATP and some calcium.

78
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,680
I prefer cash and nachos, but whatever.

79
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:17,699
Remember, ATP is kind of like molecular currency.
It contains chemical energy, and your muscles

80
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,158
are all about converting chemical energy to
motion, so they’re always hungry for more ATP.

81
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:26,139
Your muscle cells have lots of nuclei, but
some of them also have a lot of mitochondria,

82
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:28,869
whose sole purpose in life is to crank out
ATP.

83
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:32,869
And muscle cells also have their own version
of an endoplasmic reticulum -- the cell’s

84
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:37,169
transport and storage system -- but in this
case it’s specialized, so it gets a special

85
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:39,258
name: the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

86
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:43,968
Its walls are loaded with calcium pumps -- which
use ATP to save up a bunch of calcium ions.

87
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:48,748
And it’s also studded with calcium channels
that are linked to voltage-sensitive proteins

88
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,430
in the membrane of the muscle cell.

89
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,629
Say I want to move my arm.

90
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:56,840
My brain sends an action potential along the motor
neuron until it synapses with a muscle cell in my arm.

91
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:01,638
The receptors on that muscle cell are ligand-gated
sodium channels, so when the motor neuron

92
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:06,059
releases our old friend acetylcholine into
the synapse, the channels open up, and create

93
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:10,338
a rush of sodium into the cell as a graded
potential, which, if it’s strong enough,

94
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:13,239
causes nearby voltage-gated sodium channels
to open.

95
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:16,969
Now, I want to take a second and point out
here that we’re still talking about an action

96
00:06:16,968 --> 00:06:21,110
potential, but not in a neuron. This is happening
in a muscle cell, people.

97
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,460
So that action potential zips along a muscle
cell’s membrane, the sarcolemma, which has

98
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:29,588
lots of tubes that run deep inside the cell,
called T-Tubules.

99
00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:33,088
When the action potential travels down one
of those tubes, it eventually triggers the

100
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:38,160
voltage-sensitive proteins that are linked to those
calcium channels on the cell’s sarcoplasmic reticulum.

101
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,580
When those channels are thrown open, the calcium
stored inside rushes into the rest of the

102
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:45,649
cell, and finally myosin is like, YES! Here
we go!

103
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:49,959
At this point, the myosin is totally stoked,
because the bodyguards that have been frustrating

104
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:52,678
it are in for a big, irresistible distraction.

105
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:57,218
That’s because the protein troponin just
loves to bind with calcium, and remember:

106
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:59,889
When stuff binds to proteins, the proteins
change shape.

107
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:03,588
So the calcium latches on to the troponin
and causes it to pull the other bodyguard

108
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:08,069
protein -- the tropomyosin -- away from the
sites on the actin strands that the myosin

109
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:09,490
really wants to get its paws on.

110
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,620
And suddenly it’s all, “Okay?” “Okay.”

111
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,319
But the only myosin heads that can bind to those newly
exposed sites are ones that are ready for action.

112
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:21,379
That is, the ones that have already grabbed
a molecule of ATP that’s been floating around,

113
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:24,180
and broken it down into ADP and the leftover
phosphate.

114
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,978
When a myosin head does that, it moves into
an extended position, kinda like a stretched

115
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:33,468
spring -- still holding on to the ADP and
phosphate, and still storing the energy that

116
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:35,449
was released when they were broken apart.

117
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:39,610
So after all that, with the myosin primed
for action and the bodyguards out of the way,

118
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,840
the myosin finally binds to actin, and it
is beautiful.

119
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:46,679
When they bind, the myosin releases all that
stored energy, and -- in the excitement of

120
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:51,629
it all -- the myosin changes shape. It pulls
on its precious actin strand, kind of like

121
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:53,199
pulling a rope hand over fist.

122
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,408
In the process, it shrinks the whole sarcomere,
and contracts the muscle.

123
00:07:57,408 --> 00:08:00,188
That’s the sliding part of the sliding filament
model.

124
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:04,689
Now, with its energy spent, that little head
has no use for the ADP and the phosphate.

125
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:08,669
So they un-bind with it, because -- remember
Rule Number Two, changing shape encourages

126
00:08:08,668 --> 00:08:13,308
proteins to bind or unbind with stuff. That
unbinding causes a small change in its shape,

127
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:15,959
which lets a fresh ATP binds there in its
place.

128
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:20,379
That binding causes another shape change.
But this time, it causes the myosin to release

129
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:26,180
from the actin, in a tear-jerking scene like some
microscopic re-creation of the finale from Titanic.

130
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,218
But fear not! This epic is not quite over!

131
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:34,278
Because this is when the myosin breaks down
its new molecule of ATP into ADP and a phosphate,

132
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:38,610
which moves it into the armed position yet
again, getting it ready for its next rendezvous.

133
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:43,099
And meanwhile, those calcium pumps are working
hard to restock the calcium in the sarcoplasmic

134
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:48,079
reticulum. So they start grabbing the calcium that’s
floating around, causing calcium to unbind from the

135
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,700
troponin. When it unbinds, the resulting shape-change
puts the tropomyosin bodyguards back into place.

136
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,040
It’s a circle.

137
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:58,359
Or potentially a big Hollywood franchise.
With lots and lots of sequels.

138
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,720
It keeps repeating itself many, many times
every moment, while I sit here and talk, and

139
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,779
while you sit there and eat and text and take notes,
the whole drama replaying itself over and over.

140
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:13,078
Kind of like you’ll have to play this video
over and over again to get all the little

141
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:15,478
steps of the sliding filament model straightened
out.

142
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,680
But hey, some stories get better the more
you hear them.

143
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,209
If you do watch this one again, you will re-learn
that your smooth, cardiac, and skeletal muscles

144
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:26,799
create movement by contracting and releasing
in a process called the sliding filament model.

145
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,990
You’d also re-learn that your skeletal muscles
are constructed like a rope made of bundles

146
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:36,049
of protein fibers, and that the smallest strands
are your actin and myosin myofilaments. Its

147
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:40,719
their use of calcium and ATP that causes the
binding and unbinding that makes sarcomeres

148
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,480
contract and relax.
