1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,639
It has filled countless diapers, caused discomfort
for any number of airline passengers, and

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:10,070
it totally ruined the Dude’s rug, which
really tied the room together, man.

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,400
Anatomists call it micturition and I don’t
know why because the rest of us know it as

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,389
urination, which seems like a fine word.

5
00:00:16,388 --> 00:00:20,349
All mammals, and most animals urinate
to remove toxins and to help maintain

6
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:23,059
water-volume homeostasis, or blood pressure.

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,629
And while some of us spray it around to attract
mates or mark territory, or deter predators,

8
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:31,239
as far as I know, only humans actually study
pee.

9
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,000
In fact, we’ve been doing it for thousands
of years.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,980
Even before Hippocrates extolled the diagnostic
virtues of pee-sniffing, early Sumerian and

11
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:41,709
Babylonian physicians were making urine-related
observations.

12
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:46,079
Medieval doctors, as well, diagnosed diseases
based on on smelling, inspecting, or even

13
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,689
tasting urine samples. And although they were
often totally off-base -- which makes me feel

14
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:55,539
bad for those guys who sipped urine for no
reason -- they were kind of on to something.

15
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:58,879
Today, urological tests can help detect a
lot of ailments based on the color, smell,

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,969
clarity, and chemical composition of a sample.

17
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:05,290
Freshly peed urine is usually about 95 percent
water, slightly acidic -- with a pH of around

18
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:09,820
6 -- a little aromatic, and usually somewhere
between clear and dark yellow in color, depending

19
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,329
on your level of hydration.

20
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:16,140
Urine also contains over 3000 different chemical
compounds, and their varying levels of concentration

21
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,560
can tell us a lot about what’s going on
in the body.

22
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,769
For example, if you give me a urine sample
-- I will have no idea what to do with it,

23
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:25,689
but if you give it to a doctor and they can
see that it’s cloudy with white blood cells,

24
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:27,978
that’s a good sign you’ve got a urinary
tract infection.

25
00:01:27,978 --> 00:01:31,010
If it smells sweet and contains a lot of glucose,
you may have diabetes.

26
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,260
If it looks pink, then -- unless you’ve
erecently aten beets -- you probably have

27
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,439
internal bleeding somewhere.

28
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,079
And if it is chocked full of proteins, you
could be pregnant, or working out too hard,

29
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:41,289
or have high blood pressure, or be headed
to heart failure…

30
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,640
So as you can see, even if the most thought
you’ve given the subject is to wonder if

31
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,349
you should pee now or wait until the end of
the movie, the whole process of producing,

32
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:52,048
storing, and eliminating pee is no where near
as simple as it may seem.

33
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,200
From osmotic pressure to stretch receptors to
hormones, our circulatory, nervous, and endocrine

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,740
systems regulate how much urine we produce,
what goes into it, and when to get rid of it.

35
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:03,899
So join me as we journey into the world of
pee.

36
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:06,409
Wait. No. Can we rephrase that?

37
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,580
All right, how about: “let’s look at where
your pee comes from.” No, actually, that

38
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,729
doesn’t sound good either. Let’s begin
by looking at what regulates the production

39
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:26,549
of urine. That works.

40
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,459
Last time, we discussed how your kidneys filter
your blood, but the actual production of urine

41
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:32,340
can be affected by a whole host of factors.

42
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,289
One thing that might have crossed your mind
last time is that the production of urine

43
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:41,090
must -- by its very nature -- be influenced by
blood -- specifically, its volume and its pressure.

44
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,939
Because, step one in pee-making is the process
of glomerular filtration -- where blood is

45
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:48,120
filtered in the little blood-filled balls
of yarn that are the glomeruli.

46
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,430
So, just like water in a hose, higher pressure
in the blood must push more plasma out of

47
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,550
the capillaries and into the glomeruli.

48
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:00,069
But here’s a problem: Your kidneys can only
handle so much filtrate at a time, so they

49
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:02,939
have to maintain a constant rate of flow inside
of them.

50
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:07,060
This is known as the glomerular filtration
rate -- or how much blood passes through the

51
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,628
glomeruli every minute.

52
00:03:08,628 --> 00:03:12,500
And your kidneys have ways of regulating this
rate, despite changes in blood pressure.

53
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,848
If your blood pressure happens to increase,
for example, the higher pressure causes the

54
00:03:15,848 --> 00:03:18,109
arterioles leading to your glomeruli to stretch.

55
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,110
And then the smooth muscle in the walls of
the glomeruli respond to this stretching stimulus

56
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,409
by constricting -- automatically reducing
the amount of blood flow into the glomeruli

57
00:03:26,408 --> 00:03:29,090
and leaving the flow rate relatively unchanged.

58
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,560
This kind of intrinsic control, or autoregulation,
is helpful in controlling the filtration rate

59
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,229
through normal ranges of blood pressures,
but the kidneys mostly regulate urine concentration

60
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:40,348
at the other end of the nephron tubules.

61
00:03:40,348 --> 00:03:43,419
This kind of regulation I’m sure you’re familiar
with. If you’ve ever had too much coffee

62
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:48,299
or gone on a bit of a bender, you may have experienced
the pleasure of having to pee every five minutes.

63
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,800
That’s because your endocrine system has
a lot to say about your bathroom breaks, so

64
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,709
you have some strong hormonal mechanisms that
affect when and how often you go.

65
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:59,908
And as it happens, both caffeine and alcohol
inhibit the release of one of these hormones

66
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:04,750
-- called antidiuretic hormone, or ADH -- which
is secreted by the posterior pituitary gland

67
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,219
to help the body retain water and stay hydrated.

68
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:11,519
How ADH works is kind of complex, but first,
let’s remember that cell membranes are generally

69
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,090
not that permeable to water.

70
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,450
But in the parts of the nephron that reabsorb
water, like the descending limb of the loop

71
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:20,998
of Henle, water has to move easily through
cells, from the filtrate to the blood.

72
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:25,639
This is possible because of special protein
channels in their membranes called aquaporins

73
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:31,299
that are on both the apical, or filtrate-facing side,
and the basal, or capillary-facing side of the cells.

74
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,680
By contrast, the cells lining the collecting
duct only have aquaporins on the basal side,

75
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:38,278
so not a lot of reabsorption takes place there
usually.

76
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:43,360
But ADH triggers those cells to move aquaporins
they have in storage, over to the apical side,

77
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,360
which allows more water to leave the urine.
And since caffeine and alcohol inhibit ADH,

78
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,658
that means no moving aquaporins, which means
very little water reabsorption, and ultimately

79
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:54,778
tons of peeing, and dehydration.

80
00:04:54,778 --> 00:04:57,788
So, leah, lots of factors affect the production
of urine.

81
00:04:57,788 --> 00:05:01,418
But once it’s produced, it doesn’t just
leave the building. It has to be moved, and

82
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:02,838
stored, until the time is right.

83
00:05:02,838 --> 00:05:06,528
Once the urine leaves the kidneys, it enters
the ureters, a pair of slender tubes that

84
00:05:06,528 --> 00:05:09,439
drop down to the posterior urinary bladder.

85
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,199
Contrary to what you might think, your ureters
aren’t just passive tubes, and your pee

86
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,770
doesn’t wind up in your bladder because
of gravity alone.

87
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:20,229
Rather, like the small intestines, each ureter
features a layer of smooth muscle that contracts

88
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,819
to move urine using peristalsis.

89
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:25,800
The frequency and strength of these peristaltic
waves varies, depending on how fast urine

90
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,129
is being produced, and a series of valves
prevent pee from backing up, making sure that

91
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,490
instead it reaches the bladder.

92
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:36,389
The bladder is a hollow, collapsible sac that
temporarily stores urine. Like the kidneys,

93
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:40,490
it’s retroperitoneal, located posterior
to the pubic bone and anterior to the rectum.

94
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,218
The bladder wall consists of three layers
-- an inner mucosa, surrounded by a thick

95
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:48,538
muscular layer called the detrusor wrapped
in a fibrous, protective outer membrane.

96
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:52,968
The inner mucosal layer consists of transitional
epithelium, which allows the bladder to expand

97
00:05:52,968 --> 00:05:57,360
so it can hold more urine, a handy feature
for social mammals like us who prefer dry

98
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,028
underwear and peeing in private.

99
00:05:59,028 --> 00:06:03,678
When it’s empty, it collapses into a triangular
shape, folding up on itself like a deflated

100
00:06:03,678 --> 00:06:08,868
balloon. Then as urine accumulates, the bladder
thins and expands into a pear-shape, and all

101
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:09,919
those folds disappear.

102
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,558
A full bladder can comfortably hold around
500 ml of pee, though it can usually expand

103
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:18,229
to hold a maximum of around one liter. At
that point, though, you’re pushing your

104
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:22,990
luck, because prolonged overdistention could
-- in theory -- lead to a burst bladder, although

105
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,569
you’d probably just pee your pants first.

106
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:27,658
But let’s assume for the sake of polite
conversation that you have found an appropriate

107
00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:32,678
location to relieve yourself: Your urine enters
the thin but muscular urethra by passing through

108
00:06:32,678 --> 00:06:34,478
the internal urethral sphincter.

109
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,080
Now we don’t actually have voluntary control
over this particular sphincter, but the autonomic

110
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,098
nervous system keeps it cinched up whenever
you’re not peeing to prevent leakage.

111
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:45,368
Once the urine is through the sphincter, it
heads down through the urogenital diaphragm

112
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:49,580
which includes the last stop, the external
urethral sphincter, which is probably the

113
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:53,939
one you’re familiar with, because it’s made of skeletal
muscles and is the one that you control voluntarily.

114
00:06:53,939 --> 00:07:01,560
ONLY NOW are we finally ready to explore the act of
micturition itself, the actual excretion of urine, urination.

115
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,499
As the pee from your morning coffee builds
up, it causes the bladder to push out, activating

116
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:07,360
the stretch receptors in its walls.

117
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,270
The resulting nerve impulses zip along afferent
fibers to the sacral region of the spinal

118
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:15,618
cord, along interneurons, and toward the brain,
eventually exciting the parasympathetic neurons

119
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:17,490
and inhibiting the sympathetic system.

120
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:22,028
This tells the detrusor to contract while
the internal urethral sphincter simultaneously

121
00:07:22,028 --> 00:07:27,038
opens, and the external sphincter relaxes
so that the pee can flow out.

122
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,610
This, you may or not recall, is kind of an
acquired skill.

123
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,968
When you’re a baby, those stretch-receptor
impulses trigger a simple spinal reflex that

124
00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:39,338
coordinates this whole process, and you have
no real control over when you pee.

125
00:07:39,338 --> 00:07:42,528
But within a couple of years of birth, your
brain’s circuits have developed the ability

126
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:46,749
to override simple reflexive urination and
to choose a different neural pathway.

127
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:47,879
So how’s that possible?

128
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,088
Well, an area of your brainstem, called the
pons, contains two different centers that

129
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:57,059
lock down your urination control, or lack
of it: there’s the pontine storage area,

130
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:01,699
which inhibits urination, and the pontine
micturition center, which gives it the green light.

131
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:05,079
As your bladder fills up, impulses triggered
by stretch receptors head to the pons and

132
00:08:05,088 --> 00:08:08,098
other higher brain centers that give you that
conscious feeling that you have to pee.

133
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:11,899
If your bladder isn’t full, and you’re
too busy to find a bathroom, it mostly activates

134
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:15,610
the pontine storage area that keeps you from
peeing, by inhibiting your parasympathetic

135
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,869
activity and increasing sympathetic output.

136
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:21,110
Of course, the longer you hold it, the more
your bladder fills up, and eventually the

137
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:25,468
need to pee becomes too strong to ignore,
at which point the pontine micturition center

138
00:08:25,468 --> 00:08:31,058
jumps into action, overriding the previous orders,
and opening the sphincters so you can finally tinkle.

139
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:33,839
And that’s how your own personal waterworks
… works.

140
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,009
Whether you’re a baby in diapers, or a grown-up
science student … or a guy who was sent

141
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:40,719
to “leave a message” on Jeffrey Lebowski’s
rug.

142
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,009
Today you learned how the urinary system regulates
the production of urine, by maintaining a

143
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:48,550
study glomerular flow rate. We also talked
about the anatomy of storing and excreting

144
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:52,859
urine -- from the ureters to the urethra -- and
we went over the nervous system’s role in

145
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,019
controlling the act of urination.
