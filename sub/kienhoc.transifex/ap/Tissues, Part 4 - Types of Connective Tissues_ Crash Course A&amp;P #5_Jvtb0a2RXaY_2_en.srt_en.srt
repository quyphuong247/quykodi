1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,638
Technically, we’re all just meat.

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,359
Yeah, you could say that what makes us human
is our emotions, or thoughts, or memories,

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,060
but physically, we’re not all that different
from this.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,349
We’re used to thinking of meat as the muscle
tissue that people cook and eat -- but the

5
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:17,140
fact is, you could eat that stuff raw. A chicken
breast or a steak or a pork chop is tender

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,109
enough that it doesn’t need cooking.

7
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,710
What does need cooking is all of the connective
tissue that’s in and around the muscle,

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,060
and gets in the way of our meal.

9
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:28,679
So one of the main reasons humans began to
roast, and boil, and bake meat in the first

10
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:33,560
place, was to break down those connective tissues
that we can’t chew, so we could get the meat.

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,100
Now, you might’ve noticed that connective
tissues kind of seem like a grab bag of materials

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,620
that don’t really fit in other groups.

13
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:44,359
Our muscle, nervous, and epithelial tissue
types are more uniform, more obviously grouped

14
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:48,759
together. Sometimes, our connective tissues just
seem like the leftovers you throw in the stew pot.

15
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:53,179
But appearances are deceiving, and our inability
as a species to tolerate these tissues in

16
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:58,359
our food is just one reminder that no matter
how different tendon, bone, or a hunk of fat

17
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:01,399
may appear, they are indeed very closely related.

18
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,138
They all spring from the same embryonic cells,
and their structures are dominated, not by

19
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,040
cells, but by an extracellular matrix full
of fibers.

20
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:12,570
And it’s those fibers that have given humans
the most trouble in our meat-eating history.

21
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:16,849
It wasn’t until we figured out how to cook the
stuff the that we were able to denature, or

22
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:20,859
change the natural structure of, those protein
fibers so that they became soft and pliable.

23
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:25,810
Take a chicken for example. You couldn’t
just pull the skin off a living bird -- like

24
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,478
ethically you couldn’t do that but also
you probably couldn’t.

25
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,700
Its living skin is anchored by connective
tissue that’s full of collagen fibers. But

26
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,920
if you roast that chicken, and break apart
that collagen, suddenly the skin just peels

27
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,329
right off with no effort at all.

28
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:42,769
So connective tissues, as evidenced by this
mess here, are good reminders of how sometimes

29
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,560
things are more similar than they appear.

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,460
They’re also delicious . . . if you’re
into that.

31
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,700
So we know what our connective tissues have
in common, and we know that we’ve got four

32
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:04,839
different types -- but what do they look like,
what do they do, and where are they found

33
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,219
-- both in your butcher shop, and on your
body?

34
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:11,830
Perhaps your most diverse type is your classic
connective tissue proper. It comes in both

35
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:16,239
loose and dense subclasses, based on how many
fibers it has in its ground substance.

36
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,580
Pull on the back of your hand. See that fleshy
tent there? That’s one example of loose

37
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,130
connective tissue. There’s a lot of ground
substance in here, and the elastin fibers

38
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:29,900
help it snap back into place, while the collagen
helps anchor it so you can’t, like, snag

39
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,789
your skin on a zipper and watch it just fly
off.

40
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:36,269
But try pulling on your Achilles’ tendon,
or these wing tendons here, and there isn’t

41
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,700
a lot of give. That’s because a tendon is
an example of dense connective tissue, with

42
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:46,560
a lot more collagen. You could chew and chew
and chew on a collagen-dense tendon and never

43
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,960
get anywhere. That’s why butchers trim off most dense
connective tissue before selling cuts of meat.

44
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,500
So loose connective tissues have fewer fibers,
and more cells and more ground substance.

45
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,840
Areolar tissue is the most common loose connective
tissue you have, found ALL over your body,

46
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,939
just under your epithelial tissue, and wrapped
around your organs.

47
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:07,098
It’s got a loose and random arrangement
of fibers, with just a few fibroblast cells

48
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:10,689
that make those fibers. If you look at it
under a microscope you’ll see that its most

49
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:14,269
obvious feature is that it looks like it has
a lot of open space in it.

50
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:18,629
This makes areolar tissue makes it great at
holding the watery, salty ground substance

51
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:20,479
that surrounding tissues draw from.

52
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,119
Your adipose tissue, meanwhile, is your fat
tissue, the loose connective tissue that’s in here.

53
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,060
Rather than being mostly ground substance,
this one is mostly cells -- adipocytes -- which

54
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,719
store lipids for later use, insulate the body against
heat loss, and grow pot bellies and love handles.

55
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:37,098
The average person’s weight is about 18
percent adipose tissue, and it’s those fat

56
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:41,498
stores that keep us alive when food is scarce.
With no fat stores, you’d die within a few

57
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,039
days of your last sandwich.

58
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,519
Reticular tissue is like areolar tissue, but
with a woven mess of reticular fibers -- rather

59
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,318
than collagen and elastin fibers -- hence
the name.

60
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,298
This tissue provides the soft internal framework,
or stroma, of the spleen, lymph nodes, and

61
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,060
bone marrow, and it supports lots of developing
blood cells. Just as your areolar tissue is

62
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,519
a kind of sponge for watery ground substance,
your reticular tissue is what holds your blood

63
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:06,090
in place in many of your organs.

64
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,500
Really, all of these loose connective tissue
proper types share an airy dispersal of fibers

65
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,319
... which is why they’re easier to eat after cooking --
and why you can pull cooked chicken skin apart.

66
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,319
On the other hand, you can’t easily rip
a tendon or ligament in two, or even chew

67
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:24,740
it, because it’s made of that dense regular
tissue, full of tight bundles of collagen

68
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:26,320
fibers all running parallel.

69
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,959
You can see how neat and smooth a slide sample
looks under a scope, the fibers being those

70
00:04:30,968 --> 00:04:35,930
white, flexible structures. They provide great
resistance to tension when that tension is

71
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,220
exerted in one direction.

72
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,339
That’s why you find this tissue in your
tendons, which connect muscle to bone or other

73
00:04:41,338 --> 00:04:44,819
muscle, and your ligaments, which bind bones
together anywhere you’ve got a joint.

74
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:48,889
But what if those collagen fibers aren’t
all stacked regularly in rows?

75
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:54,129
Then it forms dense irregular tissue, whose
fibers are thicker and arranged erratically

76
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:58,360
-- it’s found wherever tension might be
exerted in lots of different directions, like

77
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,610
the leathery dermis underlying your skin.

78
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,399
And finally, your body has places that require
more elasticity than rigidity, like say, around

79
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:10,019
your joints. That’s where you’ll find
dense elastic tissue -- for example, connecting

80
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:12,709
your vertebrae so that your spine can curve
and twist.

81
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:16,938
Some of our largest artery walls are made
of this stretchy elastic tissue, too, which

82
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:19,399
provides both support and flexibility.

83
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:23,978
From fat to tendons, connective tissue proper
is the most diverse group in this tissue family.

84
00:05:23,978 --> 00:05:27,298
But for the last few minutes you’ve also
been watching a different type of connective

85
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,660
tissue bob up and down as I talk -- cartilage

86
00:05:30,668 --> 00:05:34,188
Cartilage doesn’t have any blood or nerves,
and it stands up against both tension and

87
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:38,629
compression pretty well -- it’s that whitish
gristle you see at the end of pork ribs or

88
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:42,158
chicken wings in your grocer’s freezer -- and
it’s another thing that you’re not going

89
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:43,329
to have much luck chewing.

90
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:47,240
Hyaline cartilage is your most common type
-- it’s kind of glassy looking and provides

91
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,280
pliable support. It connects your ribs to your
sternum and keeps the tip of your nose all perky.

92
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:57,939
Its ground substance is rich with those sticky,
starchy proteoglycans, and although it has

93
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:01,749
collagen fibers, when you look at it under
a scope, you can’t really see them -- instead

94
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:06,609
the tissue looks glassy, hence the name “hyal”
meaning glassy, or transparent.

95
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:10,459
Elastic cartilage is very similar to hyaline,
but with more elastic fibers that are easier

96
00:06:10,468 --> 00:06:14,528
to see, and it’s found in places where strength
and stretchability are needed. Like, it’s

97
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:17,209
why I can pull on my ear without it ripping
off.

98
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:21,459
And just as your body needs firm parts and
stretchy parts, it also needs shock absorbers.

99
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:26,959
That’s where your fibrocartilage comes in.
It’s dominated by thick fibers of collagen

100
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,109
and is good at withstanding lots of pressure,
so it makes up the discs between your vertebrae,

101
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,199
and your knee joints where it keeps your bones
from grinding together.

102
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,389
And speaking of bones!

103
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:39,418
Although you might not think of something
so hard and durable as living tissue, bones

104
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:40,399
definitely are.

105
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,800
The word “bone” can refer to an entire
organ -- like your femur or scapula -- or

106
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,338
just bone tissue. And that bone, or osseous
tissue, is just calcified connective tissue,

107
00:06:50,338 --> 00:06:53,678
perfect for supporting and protecting your
body’s various structures.

108
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,620
Spongy bone tissue is typically found in the
heads of long bones and in the inner layer

109
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:02,499
of flat bones like the sternum. This spongy
tissue is strong, but porous, even to the

110
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:06,559
naked eye, and it uses this extra room to
make and store bone marrow.

111
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,478
Compact bone tissue on the other hand is quite
dense, with no visible spaces. It forms the

112
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:15,278
external layer of your bones and stores calcium
for bone cells to use to make more tissue.

113
00:07:15,278 --> 00:07:19,329
Now, if bone doesn’t conjure up your traditional
image of a tissue, blood probably doesn’t

114
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:24,168
either -- I mean, it doesn’t seem to connect
things, or lend support, and yet, blood is

115
00:07:24,168 --> 00:07:26,428
our fourth type of connective tissue.

116
00:07:26,428 --> 00:07:30,928
And when you think about it, it clearly does
connect distant parts of your body and provides

117
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:32,528
some rigidity to other parts.

118
00:07:32,528 --> 00:07:35,879
Just like other connective tissues, blood
develops from mesenchyme and is made up of

119
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:41,289
cells surrounded by an extracellular nonliving
matrix: In this case, the ground substance

120
00:07:41,288 --> 00:07:44,800
is your blood plasma, which has protein fibers
floating around in it.

121
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,209
Your blood’s main job, of course, is delivering
goods -- it transports cells, and nutrients,

122
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:52,819
and hormones, and wastes, and all kinds of
other stuff, keeping all the parts of your

123
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:54,249
body connected in the process.

124
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:58,889
Most of your blood cells are erythrocytes,
or your famous red blood cells that zoom around,

125
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:03,389
carrying oxygen and carbon dioxide through
your body. You’ve also got larger, infection-fighting

126
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:08,679
white blood cells, or leukocytes in the mix,
and your platelets, the small cell fragments

127
00:08:08,678 --> 00:08:12,058
needed for blood clotting so that a paper
cut doesn’t bleed you dry.

128
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:15,729
Unlike other connective tissues, it doesn’t
really have what you would call fibers, but

129
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:21,028
instead has a bunch of protein dissolved in
the plasma, and those protein molecules will

130
00:08:21,028 --> 00:08:24,639
form fiber-like structures when your blood
needs to clot.

131
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,800
So. You take your four primary types of tissues,
and all of the subtypes of each that’s taken

132
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,719
us weeks to explore, and you can probably
see how they can come together in many, many

133
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,550
combinations to form all of your body’s
organs.

134
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:41,250
And just like that chaotic cafeteria packed
with middle-schoolers -- we’d be hopeless

135
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:46,110
messes without our hierarchy of organization,
our inner and outer boundaries, and the ability

136
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,370
of our systems to communicate with each other.

137
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,000
THAT is what our tissues do for us, and we
wouldn’t exist without them.

138
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:56,269
Today we wrapped up our four-episode series
on tissues, with a survey of the sub-groups

139
00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:01,789
of loose and dense connective tissue, including
areolar, adipose, reticular, tendons, ligaments,

140
00:09:01,789 --> 00:09:05,789
dense irregular, and dense elastic tissue.
We also talked about the three cartilage types,

141
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:11,799
spongy and compact bone connective tissue, and how
and why our blood is also a connective tissue type.
