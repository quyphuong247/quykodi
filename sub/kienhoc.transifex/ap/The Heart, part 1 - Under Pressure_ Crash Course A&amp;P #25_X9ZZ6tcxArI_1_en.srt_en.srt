1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,320
Your heart, that throbbing, beating muscle,
is probably the most iconic organ in your body.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,000
No other organ gets its own holiday, or as
much radio play. And you’re not likely to

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,140
get a love note decorated with a kidney or a spleen,
or even a brain, which is really what rules the emotions.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,140
Don’t get me wrong, the heart does some
great things -- namely, it powers the entire

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,118
circulatory system, transporting nutrients,
oxygen, waste, heat, hormones, and immune

6
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:25,278
cells throughout the body, over and over.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,940
But in the end, the heart does not make you
love. It doesn’t break apart if you get

8
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,970
dumped by your boo. And it’s not a lonely
hunter.

9
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:37,549
The truth is, the heart is really just a pump
-- a big, wet, muscley brute of a pump.

10
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:40,939
And it doesn’t care about poetry or chocolate,
or why you’re crying.

11
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:44,539
The heart only has one concern: maintaining
pressure.

12
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:48,200
If you’ve ever squeezed the trigger on a
squirt gun or opened up a shaken can of soda,

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,530
you’ve seen how fluids flow from areas of
high pressure -- like inside the gun or the

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,570
can -- to areas of low pressure, like outside.

15
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,179
The heart’s entire purpose is to maintain that same
kind of pressure gradient, by generating high

16
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:05,700
hydrostatic pressure to pump blood out of the heart,
while also creating low pressure to bring it back in.

17
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:08,629
That gradient of force is what we mean when
we talk about blood pressure.

18
00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:12,339
It’s basically a measure of the amount of
strain your arteries feel as your heart moves

19
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,000
your blood around -- more than five liters
of it -- at about 60 beats per minute.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,170
That’s about 100,000 beats a day, 35 million
a year, 2 to 3 billion heart beats in a lifetime,

21
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:26,109
the basic physiology of which you can
easily feel, just by taking your own pulse.

22
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:27,188
I don’t have a watch

23
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:31,288
Now, that might not inspire a lot of poetry,
but it turns out, it’s still a a pretty good story.

24
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:44,599
Let us begin with a little anatomy.

25
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:47,780
Unless you happen to be of the Grinch persuasion,
the average adult human heart is about the

26
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,469
size of two fists clasped together -- one
of the few bits of trivia you often hear about

27
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:53,969
human anatomy that is actually true.

28
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:59,039
The heart is hollow, vaguely cone-shaped,
and only weighs about 250 to 350 grams -- a

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,920
pretty modest size for your body’s greatest
workhorse.

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,439
And although Americans tend to put their right
hand over their left breast while pledging

31
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,840
allegiance, the heart is actually situated
pretty much in the center of your chest, snuggled

32
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,639
in the mediastinum cavity between your lungs.

33
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,329
It sits at an angle, though, with one end
pointing inferiorly toward the left hip, and

34
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:21,629
the other toward the right shoulder. So most of its
mass rests just a little bit left of the midsternal line.

35
00:02:21,628 --> 00:02:25,268
The heart is nestled in a double-walled sac
called the pericardium.

36
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:29,419
The tough outer layer, or fibrous pericardium,
is made of dense connective tissue and helps

37
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:33,079
protect the heart while anchoring it to some
of the surrounding structures, so it doesn’t

38
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,920
like bounce all over the place while beating.

39
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,259
Meanwhile, the inner serous pericardium consists
of an inner visceral layer, or epicardium

40
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:42,528
-- which is actually part of the heart wall
-- and an outer parietal layer.

41
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:47,009
These two layers are separated by a thick
film of fluid that acts like a natural lubricant,

42
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:51,359
providing a slippery environment for the heart to move
around in so it doesn’t create friction as it beats.

43
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,019
The wall of the heart itself is made of yet
more layers, three of them: that epicardium

44
00:02:56,019 --> 00:03:00,239
on the outside; the myocardium in the middle,
which is mainly composed of cardiac muscle

45
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,180
tissue that does all the work of contracting;
and the innermost endocardium, a thin white

46
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,319
layer of squamous epithelial tissue.

47
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,039
Deeper inside, the heart has a whole lot of
moving pieces that I’m not going to pick

48
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:13,829
apart here, because the really big thing to
understand is how the general system of chambers,

49
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:18,549
and valves, veins, and arteries all work together
to circulate blood around your body.

50
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:22,150
Of course fluid likes to move from areas of
high pressure to areas of low pressure, and

51
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,419
the heart creates those pressures.

52
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:25,919
Form once again following function.

53
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:31,088
Your heart is divided laterally into two sides
by a thin inner partition called the septum.

54
00:03:31,088 --> 00:03:35,378
This division creates four chambers -- two
superior atria, which are the low pressure

55
00:03:35,378 --> 00:03:38,638
areas, and two inferior ventricles that produce
the high pressures.

56
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,129
Each chamber has a corresponding valve, which
acts like -- like a bouncer at a club at closing

57
00:03:43,128 --> 00:03:45,388
time -- like he’ll let you out, but not
back in.

58
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:49,719
When a valve opens, blood flows in one direction
into the next chamber. And when it closes,

59
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:53,139
that’s it -- no blood can just flow back
into the chamber it just left.

60
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:57,059
So if you put your ear against someone’s
chest -- and yeah, ask for permission first

61
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,300
-- you’ll hear a “lub-DUB, lub-DUB”.

62
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,779
What you’re really hearing there are the
person’s heart valves opening and closing.

63
00:04:02,778 --> 00:04:05,679
It’s a relatively simple, but quite elegant
set up, really.

64
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,780
Functionally, those atria are the receiving
chambers for the blood coming back to the

65
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:11,658
heart after circulating through the body.

66
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:16,499
The ventricles, meanwhile, are the discharging
chambers that push the blood back out of the heart.

67
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:20,538
As a result, the atria are pretty thin-walled,
because the blood flows back into the heart under

68
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:25,029
low pressure, and all those atria have to do is push it
down into the relaxed ventricles,

69
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:26,449
which doesn’t take a whole lot of effort.

70
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:31,159
The ventricles are beastly by comparison.
They’re the true pumps of the heart, and

71
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:35,889
they need big strong walls to shoot blood
back out of the heart with every contraction.

72
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:39,668
And the whole thing is connected to the rest
of your circulatory system by way of arteries

73
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:43,609
and veins. We’ll go into a whole lot more
detail about these later, but the thing to

74
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:48,210
remember first, if you don’t already remember
it, is that arteries carry blood away from

75
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:50,930
the heart, and veins carry it back toward
the heart.

76
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,069
To differentiate the two, anatomy diagrams
typically depict arteries in red, while veins

77
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:58,710
are drawn in blue, which, incidentally, is
part of what has led to the common misconception

78
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:00,978
that your blood is actually blue at some point.

79
00:05:00,978 --> 00:05:04,639
But, it isn’t. It is always red. It’s just a
brighter red when there’s oxygen in it.

80
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,499
So let’s look at how this all comes together, starting
with a big burst of blood flowing out of your heart.

81
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,819
The right ventricle pumps blood through the
pulmonary semilunar valve into the pulmonary

82
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:18,139
trunk, which is just a big vessel that splits
to form the left and right pulmonary arteries.

83
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:21,860
From there -- and this is the only time in
your body where deoxygenated blood goes through

84
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,080
an artery -- the blood goes straight through
the pulmonary artery into the lungs, where

85
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,199
it can pick up oxygen.

86
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,060
It finds its way into very small, thin-walled
capillaries, which allow materials to move

87
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,500
in and out of the blood stream. In the case of the lungs,
oxygen moves in, and carbon dioxide moves out.

88
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:40,240
The blood then circles back to the heart by
way of four pulmonary veins, where it keeps

89
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,500
moving to the area of lowest pressure -- because
that is what fluids do -- and in this case

90
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,199
that’s inside the relaxed left atrium.

91
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,218
Then the atrium contracts, which increases
the pressure, so the blood passes down through

92
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,379
the mitral valve into the left ventricle.

93
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:56,949
So the thing that just happened here, where
a wave of blood was pumped from the right

94
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:00,650
ventricle to the lungs and then followed the
lowest pressure back to the left atrium?

95
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:03,859
There is a name for that, it is the pulmonary
circulation loop.

96
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,560
It’s how your blood unloads its burden of
carbon dioxide into the lungs, and trades

97
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,728
it in for a batch of fresh oxygen. It’s
short, it’s simple -- at least in the way

98
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:14,479
I have time to describe it -- and it’s just
delightfully effective.

99
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,840
Of all of the substances you need to continue
existing, oxygen is the most urgent -- the

100
00:06:18,848 --> 00:06:22,748
one without which you will die in minutes
instead of hours, or days, or weeks.

101
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:27,789
But it’s pretty useless unless the oxygen can actually
reach your cells. And that hasn’t happened yet.

102
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:31,149
For that, your newly oxygenated blood
needs to travel through the rest of your

103
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:32,939
organ systems and share the wealth.

104
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:37,770
And that fantastic journey -- known as the
systemic loop -- begins in the left ventricle,

105
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:41,348
when it flexes to increase pressure. Now the
blood would like to flow into the nice low

106
00:06:41,348 --> 00:06:46,149
pressure left atrium where it just came from,
but the mitral valve slams shut, forcing it

107
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:51,008
through the aortic semilunar valve into your
body’s largest artery -- nearly as big around

108
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:54,860
as a garden hose -- the aorta, which sends
it to the rest of your body.

109
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,468
And after all your various greedy muscles, and neurons,
and organs, and the heart itself have had

110
00:06:59,468 --> 00:07:04,718
their oxygen feast at the capillary-bed buffet,
that now-oxygen-poor blood loops back to the

111
00:07:04,718 --> 00:07:10,199
heart, entering through the big superior and inferior
vena cava veins, straight into the right atrium.

112
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,959
And when the right atrium contracts, the blood
passes through the tricuspid valve, into the

113
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:17,128
relaxed right ventricle, and right back to
where we started.

114
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:21,129
This whole double-loop cycle plays out like
a giant figure eight -- heart to lung to heart

115
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:25,509
to body to heart again -- and runs off that
constant high-pressure, low-pressure gradient

116
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:27,759
exchange regulated by the heart valves.

117
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,009
So the first “lub” that you hear in that
lub-DUB is made by the mitral and tricuspid

118
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:35,870
valves closing. And they do that because your
ventricles contract to build up pressure and

119
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:41,050
pump blood out of the heart. This high pressure
caused by ventricular contraction is called systole.

120
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:45,598
Now, the “DUB” sound -- and, just to be
clear, I am not talking about dubstep sounds

121
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,538
-- that’s the aortic and pulmonary semilunar
valves closing at the start of diastole. That’s

122
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:54,228
when the ventricles relax, to receive the
next volume of blood from the atria.

123
00:07:54,228 --> 00:07:57,218
When those valves close, the high-pressure
blood that’s leaving the heart tries to

124
00:07:57,218 --> 00:07:59,300
rush back in, but runs into the valves.

125
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,360
So you know when you get your blood pressure
measured, and the nurse gives you two numbers,

126
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,830
like, 120 over 80?

127
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:07,490
The first number is your systolic blood pressure
-- essentially the peak pressure, produced

128
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,478
by the contracting ventricles that push blood
out to all of your tissues.

129
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:15,089
The second reading is your diastolic blood
pressure, which is the pressure in your arteries

130
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:16,728
when the ventricles are relaxed.

131
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:20,188
These two numbers give your nurse a sense of
how your arteries and ventricles are doing,

132
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:24,500
when they’re experiencing both high pressure
-- the systolic -- and low pressure -- the diastolic.

133
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,819
So if your systolic blood pressure is too
low, that could mean that, say, the volume

134
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:31,598
of your blood is too low -- like, maybe because
you’ve lost a lot of blood, or you’re dehydrated.

135
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:34,999
And if your diastolic is too high, that
could mean that your blood pressure is high,

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,740
even when it’s supposed to be lower.

137
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,399
Considering how much we’ve talked about
the importance of homeostasis, it should come

138
00:08:39,408 --> 00:08:43,370
as no surprise that blood pressure that’s
too high or too low, or anything that affects

139
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,230
your blood’s ability to move oxygen around
can be dangerous.

140
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,778
Prolonged high blood pressure can damage arterial
walls, mess with your circulation and ultimately

141
00:08:50,778 --> 00:08:54,870
endanger your heart, your lungs, brain, kidneys,
and nearly every part of you.

142
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,299
So I guess you could say the best way to break
a heart is to mess with its pressure.

143
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:00,189
But good luck trying to write a song about
that.

144
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:04,199
Today you learned how the heart’s ventricles,
atria, and valves create a pump that maintains

145
00:09:04,198 --> 00:09:09,099
both high and low pressure to circulate blood
from the heart to the body through your arteries,

146
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,909
and bring it back to the heart through your
veins. We also talked about what systolic

147
00:09:12,909 --> 00:09:15,559
and diastolic blood pressure are, and how
they’re measured.

148
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:19,119
Thanks to our Headmaster of Learning, Thomas
Frank, and to all of our Patreon patrons who
