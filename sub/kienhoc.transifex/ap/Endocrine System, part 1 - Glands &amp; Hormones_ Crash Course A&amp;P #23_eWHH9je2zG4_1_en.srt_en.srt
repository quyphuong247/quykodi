1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,560
I’ve invited you all here today because
I wanted to talk to you about some

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,500
ugly stereotypes that are going around.

3
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:10,249
I’ve been hearing a lot of unfair, unseemly, and
unscientific generalizations being made lately.

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,539
And they mostly have to do with sex. And your hormones.

5
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:17,519
People have a nasty habit of equating “hormones”
with a particular set of behaviors and conditions,

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,500
most of which have to do with reproduction,
or sexual development, or acts that include

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,200
what my brother John has referred to as “skoodilypooping.”

8
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,358
For example, people will say that “hormones”
are why Kevin has zits, and is being all moody,

9
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:32,409
or why Hannah, who’s three months pregnant,
just cried watching a commercial for car insurance

10
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:33,799
-- which, let’s be honest, I do that too.

11
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:37,539
Now, I’m not saying that hormones aren’t
at the root of sexual attraction, or zits,

12
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:42,539
or occasional bouts of extreme emotion, because
they are. That’s just not all that they do.

13
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:43,519
Not even close.

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,760
When people talk about “hormones” in
the contexts that I just mentioned,

15
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:48,640
what really they mean is "sex hormones."

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,799
But sex hormones are just one kind of hormone
that you have coursing through your body right now.

17
00:00:52,808 --> 00:00:56,750
In fact, there are at least 50 different types
of these chemical messengers at work in your

18
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,250
body at this very minute, but only a very few
of them have anything at all to do with sex.

19
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:06,180
The truth is, from birth to death, just about
every cell and function in your body is under

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,270
your hormones’ constant influence.

21
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:12,719
They’re floating through your blood, regulating
your metabolism, your sleep cycle, your response

22
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,140
to stress, and the general and incredibly important
overall homeostasis that keeps you not dead.

23
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,700
Some hormones are just there to make other
hormones trigger even more hormones -- in

24
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,890
a kind of chemical relay race that biologists
refer to, rather elegantly, as “cascades.”

25
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,730
These hormones run through you no matter what
your mood is, or whether you have zits.

26
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:35,810
So the reality is: We’re all hormonal ... all
of the time.

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,120
OK, to begin to understand our hormones -- and
the endocrine system that produces, releases,

28
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,740
and re-absorbs them -- we have to step back
and take a broad view.

29
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:59,140
Not just by emphasizing that sex hormones aren’t
the only hormones you have -- but also by

30
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,739
looking at how your hormones interact with
your other organ systems.

31
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:07,109
Because, if anything, your body has two bosses
-- two complementary systems that are constantly

32
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:10,069
shouting instructions over each other, to
all of your bits and pieces.

33
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:13,780
Both your endocrine system and your nervous
system are constantly trafficking information

34
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,640
around your corpus, gathering intel, making
demands, controlling your every move. They

35
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,959
just have totally different ways of doing
it.

36
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,500
Your nervous system uses lightning-fast
electrochemical action potentials,

37
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,560
delivered by an expressway made of
neurons to specific cells and organs.

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,640
But your endocrine system prefers a slower,
wider stream of data.

39
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,419
It secretes hormones that travel through your
blood -- NOT through neurons -- so they move more

40
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:42,659
slowly, but they also produce widespread effects
that last a whole lot longer than an action potential.

41
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:47,489
Now, compared to your heart or brain or other,
arguably more glamorous organs, your endocrine

42
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,480
system’s organs and glands are kinda small
and lumpy.

43
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,659
They’re also rogues -- instead of being all
nestled together like in your other organ systems,

44
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:59,479
these guys are scattered all over the place, from your
brain to your throat, to your kidneys, to your genitals.

45
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:04,219
A gland is a just any structure that makes
and secretes a hormone. And the master gland

46
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:09,310
in your body is the pituitary, which produces
many hormones that signal other glands -- like

47
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,930
the thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, and pineal
glands -- to make their own hormones.

48
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,180
The endocrine system also includes a few organs
-- like the gonads, the pancreas, and the

49
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,790
placenta in pregnant women -- all of which
have some other non-hormonal functions and

50
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:24,400
are made up of multiple tissue types.

51
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,469
And technically the hypothalamus in your brain
is in the endocrine club too, since in addition

52
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:32,129
to all of its busy brain duties, it does produce
and release hormones.

53
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:36,159
So, thanks to these glands and organs, you’ve got
all these hormones diffusing through your blood,

54
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,120
doing all sorts of different things, but the thing to
remember about them is that a hormone can only

55
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,319
trigger a reaction in specific cells -- their so-called
target cells -- that have the right receptors for it.

56
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:51,369
So, just like some keys can open many locks,
while others only work with one, so too can

57
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,219
the hormone-target-cell relationship either
be widespread or localized.

58
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:58,419
You’re probably gonna want an example of
that. So, your thyroid -- at the bottom of

59
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:02,739
your throat -- produces the hormone thyroxine,
which stimulates metabolism and binds to receptors

60
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,569
in most of the cells in your body.

61
00:04:04,568 --> 00:04:08,968
But your pituitary -- which is nestled all
comfy under your brain -- produces follicle-stimulating

62
00:04:08,968 --> 00:04:13,588
hormone, which helps regulate growth and triggers
sexual maturity, and it only targets specific

63
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:15,468
cells in the ovaries and testes.

64
00:04:15,468 --> 00:04:18,569
So how do hormones bind to their target cells?

65
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:22,160
Well, chemically, most hormones are either
made of amino acids -- including their more

66
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,580
complex structures like peptides or proteins
-- or they’re derived from lipids, like cholesterol.

67
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:30,719
And this is key, because a hormone’s chemical
structure determines if it’s water soluble,

68
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,280
like most amino acid-based ones are, or lipid
soluble, like steroids are.

69
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,349
Solubility is important because your cell
membranes are made of lipids.

70
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,300
That means that water soluble ones can’t
get across them. So target cells for those

71
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,900
kinds of hormones have receptors for them
on the outside of their membranes.

72
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:49,479
Lipid-soluble hormones, on the other hand,
can just basically glide right through that

73
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,900
cell membrane, so their receptor sites are
inside their target cells.

74
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:57,019
Either way, when a target cell is activated,
the hormone alters its activity, by either

75
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:01,219
increasing or decreasing some of its functions
-- usually with the goal of maintaining your

76
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,320
body’s homeostasis in one way or another.

77
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:07,099
So, if hormones are keeping your body IN balance,
what’s putting your body out of balance?

78
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,600
I don’t know -- could I interest you in
some pie?

79
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,600
If you have a couple of nice, generous helpings
of strawberry-rhubarb pie -- and just to make

80
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,160
things interesting, let’s say they’re a la mode --
your blood glucose level is gonna go through the roof.

81
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,720
And the pancreas regulates your blood sugar by
releasing two different hormones -- insulin and

82
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,340
glucagon. Once you have a belly full of that pie,
beta cells in your pancreas release insulin, which

83
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:31,668
helps lower your blood sugar by increasing
the rate at which your cells store the sugar

84
00:05:31,668 --> 00:05:34,319
either as glycogen or as fat for later use.

85
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,259
Now, let’s say you’ve done the opposite:
You’ve eaten no pie -- you’re pie-less

86
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:40,459
-- in fact, you’ve eaten nothing for hours.

87
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:45,259
If your blood sugar drops too low, then alpha
cells in the pancreas will instead send out

88
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:49,740
glucagon, which helps raise your blood sugar
levels, in part by decreasing the storage

89
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,449
of sugar in your cells, and triggering their
release of glucose back into the blood.

90
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:57,740
Lots of different endocrine-related illnesses
-- like diabetes or hyperthyroidism -- tend

91
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,379
to be the result of either hyper (too much)
or hypo (too little) secretion of certain

92
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:05,279
hormones, which throw your homeostasis off
balance.

93
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,159
But there are lots of more common -- and less
obvious -- ways your hormones can get out

94
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,080
of balance, not because of some disorder,
but because these signaling chemicals are

95
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:16,500
just caught up in a chain reaction, which
can take a while to subside.

96
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,279
Some hormones just exist to control other
hormones, which in turn control still more hormones.

97
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,638
So as soon as one starts to trickle out, you can
pretty quickly wind up with a cascade on your hands.

98
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:28,800
You’ve got a few different hormone cascades
going on at any given moment, but one of the

99
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,860
big ones -- one that’s really worth understanding
-- is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis,

100
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,000
or the HPA axis, because you don’t want
to have to say that every time.

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,680
This is a complex series of interactions between
three glands that ultimately regulates lots

102
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:47,540
of your body’s daily processes, like digestion, sexuality,
immune response, and how you handle stress.

103
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,629
And it’s complex not just because of all
the glands involved -- it’s also one of

104
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:54,819
the more crucial instances of your endocrine
system coordinating with your nervous system.

105
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:58,769
Specifically, it’s behind that fight-or-flight
response that everybody keeps talking about.

106
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:04,000
The HPA Axis is essentially the endocrine system’s
companion to the sympathetic nervous system.

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,990
The sympathetic system, in times of high stress,
does things like speed up your heart rate

108
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,970
and direct blood away from the digestive organs
and to the muscles.

109
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,450
But many of the other effects of the stress
response are carried out by your endocrine

110
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:18,659
system. And getting your nervous and endocrine
systems to work together in times of crisis

111
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,340
is where the hypothalamus comes in.

112
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,739
It’s the hub of where the two systems meet
-- it keeps tabs on what’s going on all

113
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,750
over your body, analyzing your blood for signs
that something might be off.

114
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,800
So, let’s revisit our fight-or-flight scene from a few
lessons ago -- the old Burning House Scenario.

115
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,480
So you’re sleeping, dreaming about petting pandas with
Emma Watson or whatever, when the smoke alarm

116
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:42,080
goes off. Well, action potentials in your brain trigger
neurons in your hypothalamus to release the peptide

117
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,038
hormone CRH, or corticotropin releasing hormone.

118
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:49,158
The CRH makes the very short trip through
the bloodstream to the anterior pituitary

119
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,160
gland, where, because it’s water soluble, it
binds to receptors on the outside of its target cells.

120
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,660
There, it triggers the release of adrenocorticotropic
hormone, or ACTH. The ACTH travels -- again

121
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:04,380
through the bloodstream -- to the adrenal cortices
of the adrenal glands on top of your kidneys.

122
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:09,168
When the ACTH binds to receptors on cells
in an adrenal cortex, it triggers the release

123
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:14,639
of a frenzy of different freak-out compounds known
as glucocorticoid and mineralcorticoid hormones.

124
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,219
Typically these guys help us deal with day-to-day stress
by keeping our blood sugar and blood pressure

125
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:23,800
balanced. But under major stress -- like waking up
in a burning building stress -- these hormones,

126
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,360
like cortisol, cause the classic fight-or-flight
response: ramping up your blood pressure,

127
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,410
dumping glucose into your bloodstream, shutting
down non-emergency services like your immune

128
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,229
system and sperm and egg development.

129
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:37,528
And guess what? Now that all these stress
hormones are pulsing through your blood, the

130
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:39,519
hypothalamus back in the brain senses them.

131
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:44,338
And because its job is to monitor and maintain
balance whenever possible, it then stops secreting

132
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:49,079
CRH, which -- eventually -- causes the other
glands to stop secreting their panic hormones.

133
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:52,808
Now, because this element of the stress response
is hormonal rather than electrical, it comes

134
00:08:52,808 --> 00:08:57,610
on more slowly than the nervous system part,
and it takes longer to subside, too, as those

135
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,149
stress hormones linger in the blood before
being broken down by enzymes.

136
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:06,159
So. We’re a long way from teenage crushes and zits
and crying over commercials at this point, aren’t we?

137
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,169
As a life-long owner of hormones, I hope you’ll
join me in dispelling the stereotypes that

138
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:15,250
surround these powerful and important chemicals,
and give them the respect they rightly deserve.

139
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,318
Today we looked at the endocrine system, and
how it uses glands to produce hormones. These

140
00:09:19,318 --> 00:09:24,628
hormones are either amino-acid based and water
soluble, or steroidal and lipid-soluble, and

141
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:29,339
may target many types of cells or just turn
on specific ones. We also touched on hormone

142
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:32,739
cascades, and how the HPA axis effects your
stress response.
