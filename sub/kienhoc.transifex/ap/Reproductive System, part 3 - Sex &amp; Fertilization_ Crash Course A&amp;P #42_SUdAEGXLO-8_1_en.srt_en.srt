00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,320
Welcome to the main event!

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,379
After weeks of talking about our reproductive
parts and how they work, today we finally

3
00:00:06,378 --> 00:00:09,869
discuss what happens when those parts come
together, to do what they were born to do

4
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:11,298
- the sex.

5
00:00:11,298 --> 00:00:13,660
But first, let’s talk about what we won’t
be talking about:

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,460
We’re not going to give any advice. We’re
not going to talk about STIs - even though

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,490
some STIs can affect conception.

8
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:21,809
We’re also not going to talk about sexual
behavior, or mate selection and there will

9
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:23,799
be no discussion of birds or bees.

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,480
And while people have sex in lots of different
ways and for lots of different reasons, we’re

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,359
only going to be talking about the kind of
sex that could lead to fertilization.

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,219
We are going to talk about contraception,
though, in terms of how, and where, and when

13
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:36,100
different kinds can prevent fertilization.

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,939
And, we are going to look at what exactly
is going on in your body before, during, and

15
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:43,979
after sex, in the most very safe for work,
clinical terms possible.

16
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,179
Humans have been experiencing coitus for as
long as they could be called humans. And actually

17
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:02,809
before that, because obviously there would
be no humans without the sex.

18
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,480
And although it’s something that comes pretty
naturally, it wasn’t until the late 1950s

19
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,250
and 60s that anyone thought to look at the
physiological science behind the act of sex.

20
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,250
So when American gynecologist William Masters
and sexologist Virginia Johnson kicked off

21
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:20,349
their unprecedented -- and controversial -- research
into the so-called human sexual response cycle,

22
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:24,869
they began by inviting hundreds of male and
female volunteers to come into the lab and

23
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,359
have sex in the name of science.

24
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:28,819
Though it wasn’t as voyeuristic as it might
sound.

25
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:33,149
Outfitted with loads of wires and heart monitors,
volunteers were periodically interrupted in

26
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,870
the middle of the act to be measured.

27
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:39,640
10,000 trials or so later, Masters and Johnson
found out some interesting stuff. Namely,

28
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,159
that a typical complete sexual cycle runs
through four distinct phases: excitement,

29
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,379
plateau, orgasm, and resolution.

30
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:50,319
During the excitement phase, things are just
getting going. Sexual arousal triggers the

31
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,799
parasympathetic reflex that causes arterioles
in the external genitalia to dilate and fill

32
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,030
with blood, which is actually one of the only
times the parasympathetic system controls

33
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,390
any arteriole action.

34
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,329
The plateau phase is marked by increased muscle
tension, heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing

35
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:10,189
rates. Here the male urethral sphincter contracts
to make sure urine doesn’t mix with semen.

36
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:14,609
During orgasm, pelvic and other muscles around
the body contract rhythmically as an anatomical

37
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,060
male ejaculates, releasing the sperm that
might just get a chance to fertilize an egg,

38
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,509
depending on the situation.

39
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:24,199
Female orgasm is not required for conception,
and some may never experience one. But if

40
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:28,560
it does happen, the resulting uterine contractions
and increased lubrication can help draw up

41
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,879
and hold sperm in the uterus.

42
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:33,889
As the body relaxes after all that excitement,
it enters the resolution phase.

43
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:37,979
Here we see males entering a refractory period
that may last several minutes to a day or

44
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:41,039
two, during which they are usually unable
to reach orgasm again.

45
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:43,810
Anatomical females are thought not to need
this time out physiologically -- though they

46
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,819
may need it physically. Instead some females are
actually capable of serial orgasms, one after the other.

47
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:52,780
Masters and Johnson’s work has its share
of critics, many of whom point out that not

48
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:57,359
everyone fits into their four-stage mold,
and that things are not always quite so linear

49
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,530
in the heat of the moment.

50
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,659
But overall, their core physiological framework
is still accepted.

51
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:06,310
Now, regardless of exactly how sex happens,
if it involves a fertile anatomical female

52
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,129
and male, and the timing is right, it could
ultimately end with fertilization.

53
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:14,419
So how do a single little ovum, and an even
tinier sperm come together to make a fertilized

54
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:19,079
egg, or zygote, that divides and multiplies
and grows into the trillions of cells that

55
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,050
make up the glorious, complex individual that
is you?

56
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,090
You’ll remember that during ovulation, about
once a month, an ovary releases a secondary

57
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,050
oocyte that heads down the fallopian tube
and toward the uterus.

58
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,219
That oocyte has a window of about a day, or
less, to meet a sperm before it’s no longer

59
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:38,639
viable. But, that being said, sperm can persist in the
female reproductive tract for as much as 3-5 days.

60
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,339
Which means, for fertilization to occur, they
have to either be in place during ovulation,

61
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,370
or they have to arrive no more than a day
after.

62
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,878
But now I feel like I’m getting a little
ahead of myself.

63
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,578
Let’s go back to how sperm typically get
to the anatomical female body in the first place.

64
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,219
During sex, if a male ejaculates into a female's vaginal
canal, millions of hopeful sperm will be on their way.

65
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:00,080
Despite the fact that they only have about
a dozen or so centimeters to go, their journey

66
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,030
isn’t for the faint of heart. Luckily they
don’t have hearts.

67
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,189
The truth is, most sperm never reach an oocyte.

68
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:10,318
Some go in the wrong direction. Others are
killed in the strange new acidic environment

69
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,799
of the vaginal canal. And millions more fail to penetrate
the gauntlet of mucus that surrounds the cervix.

70
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,199
Even the ones that swim hard enough and manage
to reach the uterus may then be culled by

71
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,028
defending resident white blood cells.

72
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:24,819
In fact, sometimes only a dozen or so of the
original millions make it through all those

73
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:27,039
trials to actually reach an oocyte.

74
00:04:27,038 --> 00:04:28,998
But even if they do it’s still not over
for them.

75
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:32,319
The sperm that do make it to the uterus, and
then the fallopian tube, have another hurdle

76
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,620
to overcome, because they can’t actually
penetrate an oocyte. Not yet.

77
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,288
They could literally hang out right next to
one for hours, and be unable to make a move

78
00:04:40,288 --> 00:04:45,019
until they are what’s known as “capacitated,”
and go through one last set of changes.

79
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:49,158
As they swim through the cervix, uterus, and
fallopian tube, female secretions start to

80
00:04:49,158 --> 00:04:52,838
degrade some of the sperm’s protective proteins
until the the cap on the tip of its little

81
00:04:52,838 --> 00:04:57,509
head -- called the acrosome -- is fragile
enough it can leak special hydrolytic enzymes.

82
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:01,180
Those enzymes are the key to getting through
the oocyte’s protective outer layers.

83
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,449
But before that it has to weave through the
granulosa cells that form the oocyte’s outermost

84
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:07,478
layer, known as the corona radiata.

85
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:11,818
Once it’s past that, it runs into the zona
pellucida, a layer of glycoprotein that covers

86
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:13,550
the oocyte’s plasma membrane.

87
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,680
And this is where it starts to get a warmer
reception: This layer has specific sperm receptors

88
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,050
waiting for it to bind to, and when it does,
it opens a bunch of calcium channels, which

89
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,228
flood the sperm with calcium ions.

90
00:05:24,228 --> 00:05:28,808
These ions trigger the final acrosomal reaction
that releases the enzymes the sperm needs

91
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:30,338
to work through the zona pellucida.

92
00:05:30,338 --> 00:05:34,629
Now, a number of sperm make it to this phase.
And in terms of strategy or luck, it’s best

93
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:38,838
to arrive on the scene after your compadres
have already been hard at work digesting holes

94
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,939
through the pellucida.

95
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:44,099
Because once a path is cleared, a lucky sperm
can wiggle against the now-exposed oocyte

96
00:05:44,098 --> 00:05:48,938
membrane until it locks onto another set of
sperm-binding receptors. And when a sperm

97
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:52,990
docks into one of those, the membrane of the
sperm fuses with the innermost membrane of

98
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:56,449
the oocyte, and the contents of the sperm
enter the oocyte proper.

99
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:58,550
Then something pretty cool happens.

100
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,319
Remember that the “egg” is still just
a secondary oocyte here, and hasn’t completed

101
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,259
meiosis. As the sperm delivers its payload,
it causes a flash of calcium ions from the

102
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:09,009
oocyte’s endoplasmic reticulum.

103
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:13,218
This tells the secondary oocyte to get ready
to complete its second meiotic division. But

104
00:06:13,218 --> 00:06:17,908
it also triggers a reaction that suddenly
seals the egg by destroying all the leftover

105
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:22,199
sperm receptors in the membrane, preventing
any other sperm from weaseling in.

106
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,528
The oocyte then quickly completes meiosis
II, leaving two daughter cells: the large

107
00:06:26,528 --> 00:06:29,490
ovum and a puny second polar body.

108
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,990
Meanwhile, the sperm’s detached nucleus
swells up to five times its original size, forming

109
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:39,478
the male pronucleus, one of two sort of proto-nuclei
that contain each gamete’s genetic information.

110
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:43,288
The other one, the female pronucleus, takes
shape from the nucleus of the ovum, and then

111
00:06:43,288 --> 00:06:47,068
the two then start to approach each other,
pulled along a protein scaffolding, or

112
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:48,999
mitotic spindle, between the two.

113
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:53,379
When the membranes of the two pronuclei rupture,
chromosomes go flying, and boom, you officially

114
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,259
have a diploid zygote, which almost immediately
starts mitosis.

115
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:59,689
And that, folks, is how you fertilize an egg.

116
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:02,679
But even though our bodies are made to have
lots of sex and babies, there are plenty of

117
00:07:02,678 --> 00:07:06,758
people who are interested in enjoying the
sex part, without enjoying the baby part.

118
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,379
And given all of the things that usually need
to go right to achieve fertilization and implantation,

119
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:16,099
a little disruption at some stage along they
way is usually all you need to remain baby-free.

120
00:07:16,098 --> 00:07:19,688
So folks have been experimenting with various
herbal, chemical, physical, and behavioral

121
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,999
methods of contraception for centuries -- for
millennia.

122
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:26,369
Some of which have been pretty nutty, like
drinking cocktails laced with lead, or wearing

123
00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:31,849
weasel testicle amulets or rabbit butts, or shoving
herbs in places where herbs should not go.

124
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:35,639
But, of course, contraception has come a long
long way in recent years. In cultures that provide

125
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:41,019
access to it, folks have wide range of contraception
options -- you know, in addition to abstinence.

126
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:46,019
First, if you’re really sure you don’t want
kids, or more kids, sterilization is an option.

127
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:50,359
During a tubal ligation or vasectomy procedure,
a doctor snips, blocks, burns, or ties up

128
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:55,159
the fallopian tubes or vas deferens, effectively
ending the gamete express by permanently preventing

129
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:57,838
sperm and egg from ever getting to the penis
or uterus.

130
00:07:57,838 --> 00:08:00,569
But those who prefer a less permanent option
also have lots of choices.

131
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:04,899
We’ve got barrier methods that work mostly
by physically keeping sperm and egg on either

132
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:07,168
side of a wall, which is usually made of latex.

133
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:11,109
Condoms, of course, cover the penis and catch
ejaculated sperm before it can go anywhere,

134
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,740
while diaphragms, sponges, cervical caps,
and female condoms are inserted into the vagina

135
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,338
where they form a wall over the cervix, turning
sperm away.

136
00:08:18,338 --> 00:08:22,209
Hormonal methods of contraception -- like
the pill, or any number of newer shots, patches,

137
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:26,550
and rings -- use synthetic estrogen and progestin
to prevent the progression of the ovarian

138
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,338
cycle to ovulation, and sometimes make changes
to the functional uterine layer, the endometrium,

139
00:08:31,338 --> 00:08:33,710
and cervical mucus to help deter sperm.

140
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,820
An IUD, or intrauterine device, is a small
T-shaped object a medical provider inserts

141
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,240
into the uterus to prevent zygotes from implanting.

142
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,519
And the implantation is key.

143
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,279
Because, even if a sperm and egg manage to
complete fertilization, in order for gestation

144
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,029
to take place, the zygote has to find a home
for itself in the uterus pretty quickly, so

145
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,679
it gets the nutrients it needs to continue
developing.

146
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,649
So that’s what we’re gonna be talking
about next time. It takes a long time to talk

147
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:58,379
about all the ways to make a baby -- but it’s
important!

148
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:02,309
But for now you learned about the four phases
of the human sexual response, how a sperm

149
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:06,889
finds and fertilizes an egg, creating a zygote,
and how different types of contraception work

150
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:08,309
to prevent that from happening.
