1
00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:01,909
I weigh about 80 kilograms.

2
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:06,390
Most of that, let’s say 64 percent, is water
-- though you can’t tell by looking.

3
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:10,179
I mean, as organisms go, I like to think that
I look fairly solid.

4
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:14,410
After water, the next largest proportion of
me is protein, about 16% -- not just in my

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,320
muscles, but also in things like the tiny
sodium-potassium pumps in my neurons, and

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,140
the hemoglobin in my blood, and the enzymes
driving the chemical reactions in every one

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,250
of my 37 trillion cells.

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,219
Then another 16% of me is fat, which I’m
totally OK with;

9
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:32,099
Four percent of me is minerals, like the calcium
and phosphorus in my bones, and the iron in my blood;

10
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,590
and 1 percent is carbohydrates, most of which
is either being consumed as I talk to you,

11
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,160
or is sitting around as glycogen waiting to
be used.

12
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:43,839
But here’s the thing: It’s not like I just ate 80
kilograms of food and then all this happened.

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,510
Instead, my body, like yours, is constantly
acquiring stuff, extracting some of it to

14
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:51,399
keep, burning some of it for energy, and getting
rid of the rest.

15
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:55,058
But even the stuff that my body does hold
onto doesn’t last forever. Some of the chemicals

16
00:00:55,058 --> 00:00:59,378
that I absorb in my food eventually become
a part of me. But enzymes wear out, and membranes

17
00:00:59,378 --> 00:01:02,939
break down, and DNA gets oxidized. So, they
get discarded.

18
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:06,519
And then I need more of those chemicals to
reconstruct the material that I’ve lost.

19
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:10,968
As a result, over the course of my lifetime,
my cells will synthesize somewhere between

20
00:01:10,968 --> 00:01:14,608
225 and 450 kilograms of protein …

21
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:19,129
That’s like 3, or 4, or 5 separate me’s
-- just made of protein.

22
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:22,009
And all of the protein and fat and 
carbohydrates nucleic acids that

23
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,310
make up me, of course, come from food.

24
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:29,179
Every organism has to keep taking in and breaking
down food, to keep resupplying itself with

25
00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:31,060
the raw materials it needs to survive.

26
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,248
And all that activity requires energy, which
we also gain from food.

27
00:01:34,248 --> 00:01:38,489
So, how do our bodies actually convert what
we eat into energy and raw materials?

28
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:43,388
The answer is a neverending series of reactions
that are dedicated to doing two vital, and

29
00:01:43,388 --> 00:01:44,679
totally contradictory, things:

30
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:49,519
One set of chemical reactions destroys the
reactants that you give them, reducing big,

31
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:51,798
complex substances into molecular rubble.

32
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,149
And the other set reassembles that rubble
into new and bigger products that are put

33
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,058
together again to make you.

34
00:01:58,058 --> 00:02:04,179
So our bodies are constantly reinventing themselves --
in a perpetual state of loss, but also always rebuilding.

35
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,979
And even though all of this is happening at the
cellular level, its consequences could hardly be larger.

36
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:12,469
These two sets of reactions are where everything
that we’ve learned so far -- about the digestive,

37
00:02:12,468 --> 00:02:17,430
endocrine, circulatory, and respiratory systems
-- really starts to come together.

38
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,650
Together, these processes make up your metabolism.

39
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,140
Now the sciencey word metabolism has
come to have a meaning in popular speech,

40
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:37,559
but metabolism isn’t just one thing.

41
00:02:37,568 --> 00:02:41,688
People talk about metabolism as meaning, like,
how fast your body burns the fuel in your

42
00:02:41,688 --> 00:02:44,650
food, or how high your personal energy level
is.

43
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,359
And that’s fine for use by personal trainers
and fitness magazines.

44
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:53,539
But physiologically, metabolism really describes every
single biochemical reaction that goes on in your body.

45
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:56,900
And maybe more importantly, it reconciles
two conflicting chemical processes that are

46
00:02:56,908 --> 00:03:00,120
always, simultaneously underway inside of
you.

47
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,569
One of those chemical forces is anabolism.

48
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:05,810
Anabolic reactions construct things and consume
energy.

49
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,489
These are the processes that take the small
monomer building blocks in your food -- like

50
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:14,188
monosaccharides and fatty and amino acids
-- and build them into bigger, more complex

51
00:03:14,188 --> 00:03:17,489
polymers like carbs, and fats, and proteins
that are used in your cells.

52
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,959
Then, when you need new building blocks, or
you need to release some energy, those polymers

53
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,819
in your body, or new ones in your food, get
broken up -- by catabolic reactions.

54
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:31,498
The processes of catabolism break down bigger
molecules, and in breaking their bonds, release

55
00:03:31,498 --> 00:03:35,908
the energy you need to stay warm, and move
around, and provide your cells with fuel … to

56
00:03:35,908 --> 00:03:37,769
build the polymers back up again.

57
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:42,929
To be honest, your metabolism is a lot like
Sisyphus. It works really hard. But it is never finished.

58
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,829
And the boulder that your inner Sisyphus is
always pushing uphill and watching fall back

59
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:51,590
down? That’s nutrients -- the molecules
that your body is forever breaking up, and

60
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,218
then rebuilding, only to have them break apart
again.

61
00:03:54,218 --> 00:03:58,469
And these nutrients -- the materials your
body needs to build, maintain and repair itself

62
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:00,329
-- come in six major groups.

63
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:04,870
By volume, the majority of what we consume
-- and what makes up our bodies -- is water,

64
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,658
so that’s maybe the most vital nutrient.

65
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:11,229
Then there are vitamins, compounds that come
in either fat-soluble or water soluble forms.

66
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:14,858
They aren’t used as building blocks or for
energy, but they’re essential in helping

67
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:18,310
the body make use of other nutrients that
do do those things.

68
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,120
Vitamin C, for example, helps improve iron
absorption, while vitamin K is crucial to

69
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,538
blood clotting, and some B vitamins are important
in the production of ATP from glucose.

70
00:04:26,538 --> 00:04:30,329
Minerals, like vitamins, they don’t provide
fuel, but they have all sorts of other functions.

71
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:34,629
Calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus harden
bones and teeth, while iron is, of course,

72
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:39,509
crucial in hemoglobin. Plus, potassium, sodium,
and chlorine help maintain your body’s pH

73
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:41,788
balance and are used in action potentials.

74
00:04:41,788 --> 00:04:44,379
So water, vitamins, and minerals are all … necessary.

75
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:48,089
But the three major nutrients that everyone
always talks about -- the ones you find on

76
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:52,899
food labels, from oatmeal to Pop-Tarts -- are
carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins.

77
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:54,979
Most of the carbohydrates you’ve ever eaten

78
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,100
-- with the exception of lactose in milk --
originally came from plants.

79
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,710
Mono- and disaccharides come from fruits, honey,
sugar beets and sugar cane, while polysaccharide

80
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:04,750
starches come from veggies and grains.

81
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,389
The main thing you need to know is that the
monosaccharide glucose is the be-all-end-all

82
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:12,430
molecular fuel that your cells need to make
ATP.

83
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,900
ATP being the molecule that your cells use
to drive anabolic reactions, when they need

84
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:21,609
to make new polymers or get anything else
done -- whether that’s operating a sodium-potassium

85
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,990
pump, or detaching the head of a myosin filament
to contract a muscle.

86
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:29,590
But ATP is too unstable to store, so cells
often store energy in the form of glucose,

87
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:32,859
which they can then catabolize and convert
to ATP when they need it.

88
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,669
Now, some of your cells can get their energy
from fats. But many of the most important

89
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:41,430
ones, like your neurons and red blood cells,
feed exclusively on glucose. So most of the

90
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,860
carbs that your intestines absorb are converted
to glucose for that reason.

91
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,160
But, if it’s not needed right away, that
energy can also get stored as glycogen in

92
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,090
your liver and muscles, or converted to glycerol
and fatty acids to make triglyceride fats.

93
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:56,549
And even though there seems to be a marketing
war going on against dietary fats,

94
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,408
we most definitely need them.

95
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:02,959
The fats in your adipose tissue store energy,
of course, but they also store fat-soluble

96
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,469
vitamins, and cushion your organs.

97
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:08,199
Lipids also form the myelin that insulates
the neurons in your brain and throughout your

98
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,838
body, as well as the oil in your skin, and they
provide the vital calorie content found in breast milk.

99
00:06:12,848 --> 00:06:16,418
But there are other important lipids, like
cholesterol, which is the precursor to things

100
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,560
like testosterone and estrogen...

101
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,478
...and, of course, phospholipids, which form
the cell membrane in every single one of the

102
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:24,728
three-dozen-or-so-trillion cells you have.

103
00:06:24,728 --> 00:06:27,969
Now, if you’re into eating meat, a lot of
the fat that you ingest might come from that.

104
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,280
But guess what: Plants have fat too.

105
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:33,489
Plants use lipids for energy storage just
like we do, except they do it in fruits, and

106
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:38,400
nuts, and seeds. Which, when you think of
it, are kind of like plant breast milk -- it’s

107
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,568
food for their growing babies.

108
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:43,960
Either way, though, when you eat lipids, your
body breaks down triglycerides into glycerol

109
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,049
and fatty acids.

110
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,439
Those molecules can then be processed and
used in the making of ATP. Or they might be

111
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:52,269
converted into other kinds of fatty acids,
which your cells can then re-assemble into

112
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:54,430
your very own triglycerides or phospholipids.

113
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,610
And your liver happens to be great at converting
one fatty acid into another, but there are

114
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,509
some it just can’t synthesize.

115
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:05,460
For example, omega 6 and 3 fatty acids are
called essential fatty acids, because your

116
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,109
body can’t make them, so they have to be
ingested.

117
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:12,060
They get turned into all kinds of useful molecules,
like the ones used for synapse formation in

118
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,620
the brain, and for signalling inflammation
during the healing process.

119
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,139
But -- if carbohydrates provide energy, and
fats insulate and store energy, then just

120
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:23,098
about everything else is done with proteins.

121
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:26,728
They form the bulk of your muscle and connective
tissue, but they’re also what the ion channels

122
00:07:26,728 --> 00:07:31,188
and pumps are made of in your neurons and
muscle cells, and they make up your enzymes,

123
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:34,449
which are responsible for pretty much every
chemical reaction in your body.

124
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:38,610
In other words, your body runs on protein,
and pretty much is protein.

125
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:44,080
Nutritionally speaking, meats, dairy products,
eggs, legumes, nuts, cereals are particularly

126
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,698
high in protein. But because everything we
eat was once alive, and every cell of every

127
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:52,538
living thing contains protein, as long as
you’re eating whole foods, you’re at least

128
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,788
partially re-stocking your protein supplies.

129
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:59,759
Now it might seem like you’d have eat muscle
to make muscle, or eat enzymes to make enzymes,

130
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,689
but that’s not how it works.

131
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:04,650
Since all of your proteins are made up of
just 20 amino acids, the differences between

132
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:09,128
the thousands of unique proteins are simply
in the sequence of those amino acids.

133
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:13,300
And, of course, you have a specialized molecule
that knows just which amino acids to put together

134
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,379
in what order to make a certain protein.

135
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:16,038
It’s called DNA.

136
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:20,449
When you consume some hamburger, for example,
the protein actin in the meat gets catabolized

137
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:24,949
into its component amino acids, which gets
mixed up with all the amino acids from the

138
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:29,538
other proteins in the meat -- like the collagen
and elastin and titin and myosin -- as well

139
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:32,610
as all the protein from the bun and the tomato
and the mayonnaise.

140
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,340
Those amino acids then get reassembled using
anabolic reactions into your very own, but

141
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,460
somewhat different, proteins, as defined by
your DNA.

142
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:45,410
Each cell is like a picky little Gordon Ramsay
and it has to have every amino acid needed

143
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:49,909
-- every ingredient present -- before it will
even think about starting to make a protein.

144
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:53,949
And just like with your lipids, your cells
can improvise, and convert some amino acids

145
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,950
to others if they’re missing an ingredient.

146
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:01,420
However, there are nine essential amino acids
that you cannot make from others, and have to eat.

147
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:05,889
Now lots of foods don’t provide every essential
amino acid, but when you combine foods, like

148
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:10,019
beans and rice, or pasta and cheese, you do
get all of the essential amino acids. Which

149
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:15,299
is important because, remember: after water,
you are mostly made of protein. On the order of 16%

150
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:18,309
But what about the one percent of you? The
carbohydrates?

151
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:23,199
How that tiniest fraction of you ends up creating
all of the energy, is what we’ll discover next time.

152
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,050
But for now, you’ve learned all about the
vital nutrients -- including water, vitamins,

153
