1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,579
It is time!

2
00:00:01,579 --> 00:00:03,729
We have arrived at the final conflict.

3
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:05,080
The battle royale.

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,780
A fight to the…well, hopefully not death,
but a big fight anyway.

5
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:12,969
It only seems fitting that we spend this,
our last episode of anatomy and physiology,

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,170
talking about one of your body’s last-ditch
efforts to defend itself, at all costs.

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,620
This is what happens when all the other failsafes
have failed.

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:25,060
Your skin and mucous membranes did what they
could, as physical barriers against infection. And

9
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:29,640
your humoral immune response cranked out antibodies,
in an effort to keep your interstitial spaces healthy.

10
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:34,079
But when those systems weren’t enough, your
cells themselves were breached. And pathogens

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,009
and abnormalities began to run amok where
antibodies could not get to them.

12
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:42,478
Now, it becomes the business of your cell-mediated,
or cellular immune response.

13
00:00:42,478 --> 00:00:46,098
And that’s where stuff gets real. Where
cell fights cell.

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,660
And where the heroes look like T lymphocytes.

15
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,649
These lymphocytes, known on the streets as
T cells, go after body cells that have been

16
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:55,739
hijacked by things like viruses, or bacteria,
or become cancerous.

17
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:00,018
T cells cause inflammation, activate macrophages,
get other T cells fired up, and generally

18
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,820
regulate much of the immune response.

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,480
Which is important, because -- of all the
ways in this course that we have described

20
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,140
how you could die -- two that we’ve neglected
to mention are what happens if your body completely

21
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,099
fails to protect itself, and what happens
if your immune system goes rogue, and attacks

22
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:15,429
your own, healthy cells.

23
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,810
But even when they’re functioning well,
some of your immune cells are careening around

24
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,649
your body like miniature, biological versions
of Mad Max war boys.

25
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:26,590
Amped up on signaling chemicals, scouring
the terrain for hostiles, and covered from

26
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,909
top to bottom in the dismembered parts of
the enemies that they have vanquished.

27
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,109
They’re out to protect all of the tissues
and organs and systems that we’ve been talking

28
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:34,798
about for the past 46 weeks.

29
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,299
And these guys play for keeps.

30
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:50,679
If there are cells in your body that look
and act like they’re from some post-apocalyptic

31
00:01:50,688 --> 00:01:53,298
hellscape, it’s gotta be the cells in your
immune system.

32
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:57,319
Aside from the fact that they go around literally
eating their enemies, and have names like

33
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:00,799
“natural killers,” some of these cells
are dressed for the part, too.

34
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,700
Specifically, they go around wearing parts
of the organisms that they’ve killed, so

35
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,179
others can see them.

36
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:09,618
Sounds a little bit messed up, but we’re
talking life and death here. The stakes are high.

37
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,770
And this kind of behavior occurs both in your
innate immune response and your acquired response.

38
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,689
We’ve already talked about how, in the innate
response, when a phagocyte sees a suspicious

39
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:19,990
character, it engulfs it, and kills it, right?

40
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,530
But what we didn’t get into before is that,
during its attack, the phagocyte actually

41
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,689
breaks the pathogen into tons of tiny molecules,
and then proudly displays those broken bits

42
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:31,000
in grooved proteins on its outer membrane.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,639
These proteins are called major histocompatibility
complexes, or MHCs. And they’re a lot like

44
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:39,969
how Vlad the Impaler decorated his front yard
with the bodies of his skewered enemies ... or

45
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:43,599
how a battle-crazed warrior might show off
a necklace made of knucklebones.

46
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,639
Because cells from both your innate and adaptive
branches do this grisly accessorizing like

47
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:51,679
it’s their job, they are referred to as
professional antigen presenting cells.

48
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,659
Which might make you think, “Is there an
amateur version of an antigen presenting cell?”

49
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:57,000
and yeah, there kind of is.

50
00:02:57,009 --> 00:03:00,189
Every nucleated cell in your body -- which
means all of your cells except for your red

51
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:04,699
blood cells -- have one kind of MHC protein
on their surface, called class 1 MHC.

52
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:09,780
MHC 1 proteins present short chains of amino
acids that are based on endogenous proteins

53
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,640
-- that is, proteins synthesized inside that
cell.

54
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,449
So if a particular cell is healthy, the antigens
on its MHC 1 tell roving immune cells that

55
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:19,869
everything’s ok inside, nothing to see here.

56
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,950
But if the cell is, say, cancerous and it’s
making abnormal proteins, then it’ll fix

57
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:28,349
bits of those proteins to its MHC, which alerts
immune cells that there’s a problem inside,

58
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:30,509
and basically asks to be killed.

59
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:34,969
Now: your immune-related cells -- like macrophages,
dendritic cells, and B cells -- wear class

60
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:36,919
2 MHC proteins on their outsides.

61
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,439
These are the professionals.

62
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:43,569
Class 2 MHC proteins bind to fragments of
exogenous antigens, like a virus that’s

63
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:47,009
been engulfed, broken up, and displayed to
get the attention of other cells.

64
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:50,719
And this is how MHCs are totally essential
to the cellular immune response.

65
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,979
Because, the heroes of your cellular defenses,
the T cells, can’t actually detect whole antigens --

66
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:00,579
they can only recognize them when they’re all
diced up and decorating an antigen-presenting cell.

67
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,760
T cells are made in the bone marrow, but they
mature in the thymus, the lymphoid gland that

68
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:08,699
sits on top your heart, and which is actually
what the “T” in “T cell” stands for.

69
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:11,959
And you have several different kinds of T
cells, but the two you really have to know

70
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,960
about are the helper Ts and the cytotoxic
cells.

71
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,850
Helper Ts themselves can’t kill, but they
can activate cells that do, and they help

72
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,320
call the shots for the whole adaptive immune
response.

73
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:25,399
Meanwhile, cytotoxic cells are the ones that
actually do the killing of the cells gone bad.

74
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:30,359
Now, much like how a naive B-cell carries
antibodies for one specific antigen, a naive

75
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,509
helper T cell has receptors that will only
bind to one specific combination of a class

76
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,959
2 MHC and a particular antigen.

77
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:42,620
If that match is right, the Helper T bonds
to the MHC-antigen bit and it gets activated.

78
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,120
Then, just like with the B cells we talked
about last time, the Helper T starts copying

79
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,220
itself like crazy, making a few memory T cells
as well, which remember that particular antigen

80
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,620
should it meet one again in the future.

81
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:58,009
And it also produces a whole mess of effector
T cells -- mostly more Helper Ts, but also

82
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:00,849
some regulatory T cells that I will get to
in a minute.

83
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:05,240
But the main thing the helper T cells do is
raise the alarm that tells other immune cells

84
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,439
that there is a problem.

85
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:10,139
And they do this by releasing a cocktail of
chemical messengers called cytokines.

86
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:14,560
When a cytokine enters another Helper T, that
cell usually starts dividing, making more

87
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,300
memory T cells and more Helper Ts, which release
more cytokines that keep boosting the signal.

88
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,270
And some of those cytokines also go on to
help activate the cytotoxic T cells.

89
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:27,649
You know that macrophages from the innate
system just sort of roll up and swallow pathogens

90
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:30,899
whole…. but cytotoxic T cells do their killing
a little differently.

91
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:36,019
They roam the blood and lymph, looking for hijacked
amateur body cells that are asking to be killed.

92
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:39,859
Basically, these infected cells are already
dying, so they’ve digested some of their

93
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,530
invader’s proteins, and stuck them on some
of their class one MHCs, effectively waving

94
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:48,779
a surrender flag made of fragments of the
very virus or cancer that is destroying them.

95
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:54,339
If a cytotoxic T cell with the right receptor
floats by, it binds to the antigen-MHC combination,

96
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:56,259
and moves in for a mercy killing.

97
00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:00,240
It does this by releasing special enzymes
that punch holes in the cell’s membrane

98
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,939
or otherwise trigger apoptosis, killing both
the cell and whatever is inside of it.

99
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:08,918
Then the cytotoxic cell just detaches and
continues to run down other prey.

100
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:12,799
So by now it should be pretty obvious that
without T cells, there basically is no adaptive

101
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,120
immune response. And it really all comes back
to the Helper Ts.

102
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,550
Which is why immunodeficiencies can be so
deadly.

103
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:23,110
AIDS, for example, is caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus that specifically attacks

104
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,580
Helper T cells. And without the Helper T’s,
there wouldn’t be much of a humoral response, either.

105
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:31,399
Because the cytokines that come screaming
out of the helpers not only activate other

106
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,970
T cells, but they also finish the training
of the B cells.

107
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,980
The fact is, most of your so-called naive
B cells don’t get fully activated -- and

108
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,439
become memory or effector cells -- when they
first bind to an antigen.

109
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,579
And there’s a good reason for that.

110
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:47,589
Since antibody receptors are generated randomly,
you might wind up with B cells that could

111
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:51,049
bind to your own, healthy proteins, like,
say, your growth hormone.

112
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:55,259
So, once a B cell interacts with a substance
-- whether it’s growth hormone or some dangerous

113
00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:00,339
bacterium -- it still needs to bind to it, engulf it,
and present some fragments of it on its surface.

114
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:03,219
But then, it’ll stop, to await inspection.

115
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:08,240
It pauses until the right Helper T cell comes
by to check out its presentation. If the T

116
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,769
cell binds to the presented fragment, then
it releases cytokines, which fully activate

117
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:15,339
the B-cell and suddenly you’ve got antibodies
going everywhere.

118
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:20,219
But if it doesn’t, then the B-cell just goes about
its business and doesn’t trigger an immune response.

119
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,570
This check and balance between Bs and Ts is
an important safeguard against your immune

120
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,860
system becoming too good at its job.

121
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,230
Which is a very real risk.

122
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,580
A hyperactive immune system can cause mayhem
by losing its ability to distinguish enemy

123
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:35,759
from self, as it turns on your own body.

124
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,719
Your regulatory T cells -- another type of
effector -- help prevent this by releasing

125
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,960
inhibiting cytokines that tell other immune cells to
stand down once the initial threat has been handled.

126
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,180
Without that regulation, the body might start
cranking out too many antibodies and cytotoxic

127
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,620
cells that could damage or destroy its own
tissues.

128
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,300
This dangerous confusion is what causes many
autoimmune diseases -- like multiple sclerosis,

129
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,180
which eats away at the myelin sheaths 
around neurons, or Type One Diabetes which

130
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,379
tears up the pancreatic cells that make insulin.

131
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:06,540
So the takeaway here is that your immune system
is usually really good at its job, which is

132
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,810
to kill stuff in the name of keeping you alive.

133
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,129
And you really don’t want it to go rogue
on you, because if there’s one thing you

134
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:15,689
should have learned in the past year with
us, it’s that your body is both resilient

135
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:20,110
and fragile, and it survives only when the
sum of its many complicated parts

136
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,230
stays balanced and works together.

137
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,530
And that is the glorious wonder of you.

138
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:29,500
As we wrapped up our tour of the immune system
today you learned how the cellular immune

139
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:34,929
response uses helper, cytotoxic, and regulatory
T cells to attack body cells compromised by

140
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:39,278
pathogens. We looked how cytokines activate
B and T cells, and what happens if your immune

141
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:42,568
system goes rogue and starts causing autoimmune
trouble.
