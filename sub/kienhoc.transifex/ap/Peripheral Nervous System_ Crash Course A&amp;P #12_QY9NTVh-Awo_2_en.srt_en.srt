00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,879
When it comes to the nervous system, or just
your body in general, let’s face it:

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,740
your brain gets all the props.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,660
And it deserves those props! It’s a complicated,
and crucial, and sometimes crazy boss of an organ.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,419
But your brain would be pretty useless without
a support team that kept it

5
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:16,280
connected to the outside world.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,500
Because frankly, like any leader, the more
isolated your brain gets, the weirder it gets.

7
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,830
Put a person in a watery, pitch-black sensory
deprivation tank, and you’ll see the brain

8
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:29,839
do some really weird stuff. Without a constant
flood of external information, the brain starts

9
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:35,500
to confuse its own thoughts for actual experiences,
leading you to hallucinate the taste of cheeseburgers,

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,359
or the sound of a choir singing, or the sight
of pink stampeding elephants.

11
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,609
It’s your peripheral nervous system that
keeps things real, by putting your brain in

12
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:48,169
touch with the physical environment around you,
and allowing it to respond. This network snakes

13
00:00:48,168 --> 00:00:51,568
through just about every part of your body,
providing the central nervous system with

14
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:56,179
information ranging from the temperature, to the touch
of a hand on your shoulder, to a twisted ankle.

15
00:00:56,179 --> 00:01:00,579
The peripheral nervous system’s sensory
nerve receptors spy on the world for the central

16
00:01:00,588 --> 00:01:04,158
nervous system, and each type responds to
different kinds of stimuli.

17
00:01:04,158 --> 00:01:09,069
Thermoreceptors respond to changes in temperature.
photoreceptors react to light, chemoreceptors

18
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,449
pay attention to chemicals, and mechanoreceptors
respond to pressure, touch, and vibration.

19
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,310
And then we’ve got specialized nerve receptors
called nociceptors that, unlike those other

20
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,840
receptors, fire only to indicate pain, which
is the main thing I want to talk about today.

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,899
Because, as unpleasant as a stick in the eye
or tack in the foot may be, pain is actually

22
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,560
a great example of where everything we’ve talked
about over the last few weeks all comes together,

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,240
as we trace a pain signal through your nervous
system, from the first cuss to the Hello Kitty band aid.

24
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,129
By the end of this episode of Crash Course
Anatomy & Physiology you’ll never think

25
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:44,489
of a stubbed toe, pounding headache, or burned
tongue the same way again.

26
00:01:54,468 --> 00:01:58,868
Most people go to great lengths to avoid pain,
but really, it’s an incredibly useful sensation,

27
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:02,069
because it helps protect us from ourselves,
and from the outside world.

28
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:06,509
If you’re feeling physical pain, it probably
means that your body is under stress, damaged,

29
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,240
or in danger, and your nervous system is sending
a cease and desist signal to stop twisting

30
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,879
your arm like that, or to back away from that bonfire,
or please seek medical attention, like, RIGHT NOW.

31
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:19,199
So in that way, pain is actually good for
you -- that’s why it exists. I’m not saying

32
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,379
it’s pleasant, but if you’ve ever wished
for an X-Men-like power to be impervious to

33
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:26,979
pain, I’ve gotta say, that is one foolish
monkey’s paw of a wish.

34
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:31,639
Just ask Ashlyn Blocker. She’s got a genetic
mutation that’s given her a total insensitivity

35
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:36,809
to any kind of pain. And as a result, she’s
absent-mindedly dunked her hands in pots of

36
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,199
boiling water, run around for days without noticing
broken bones, and nearly chewed off her own tongue.

37
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:46,359
Luckily, such congenital conditions are very
rare. The rest of us have a whole nervous

38
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:52,039
system dedicated to making sure our bodies react with
a predictable chain of events at the first sign of damage.

39
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:55,419
Like say you just wake up and you’re extraordinarily
hungry for some reason, so you run downstairs

40
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,670
to grab some clam chowder, but you didn’t put
any shoes on and suddenly you’re like, “YOWW!”

41
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:01,659
There’s a tack, fell out of the wall, and
you stepped right on it -- of course.

42
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:04,659
Your foot immediately lifts off the ground,
and then you’re assuring your dog that you’re

43
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:08,359
not yelling at her, you’re just yelling,
and then you limp over to the couch, and sit

44
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,520
down, and you pull up your foot, and remove
that spiny devil from your flesh.

45
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,600
You want to talk physiology? So what exactly
just happened in your body?

46
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:18,979
Well, the first step was a change in your
environment -- that is, a stimulus that activated

47
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:20,429
some of your sensory receptors.

48
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,120
In this case, it was a change from the probably
completely ignored feeling of bare skin on

49
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,409
a smooth floor to a distinct feeling of discomfort
-- the sharp metal tack piercing your skin.

50
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:34,509
Your peripheral nervous system’s mechano-
and nociceptors provided that base sensation,

51
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:36,689
or awareness that something had changed.

52
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:40,020
Then it went to your central nervous system
-- first to the spinal cord that caused the

53
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,830
immediate reflexive action of pulling up your foot,
and then your brain eventually interpreted that

54
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:50,750
awareness into the perception of pain, and decided to
pull the tack out and probably say an expletive or two.

55
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:57,199
Pain itself is a pretty subjective feeling, but the
fact is, we all have the same pain threshold.

56
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,119
That is, the point where a stimulus is intense
enough to trigger action potentials in those

57
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,319
nociceptors is the same for everybody. But, you and
I might have different tolerances for discomfort.

58
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:13,000
In general, most doctors think of pain as the perception
of pain -- whatever any given brain says pain is.

59
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:17,370
So, you’ve got the stimulating event -- foot
meets tack -- and then the reception of that

60
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,060
signal, as the nociceptors in your foot sense
that stimulus, and then the transmission of

61
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,509
that signal through your nerves to your spinal
cord and eventually up to the brain.

62
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:31,139
Now remember back how every neuron in your body
has a membrane that keeps positive and negative

63
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:36,139
charges separated across its boundaries, like a battery
sitting around waiting for something to happen?

64
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:40,639
Well that tack in your flesh is that something.
And it snaps those nociceptors to attention.

65
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,199
Some neurons have mechanically-gated receptors
that respond to a stretch in their membranes

66
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:48,029
-- in this case, that happens when the tack
punches through them.

67
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:51,929
Meanwhile, other neurons have ligand-gated
receptors that open when the damaged skin

68
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,500
tissue releases chemicals like histamine or
potassium ions.

69
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,040
These channels allow sodium ions to flood
into the neuron, causing a graded potential,

70
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,220
if that hits the right threshold, it activates
the electrical event that sends the signal

71
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,910
all the way up the axon and gets one neuron
talking to another -- the action potential.

72
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,480
When that action potential races down the
length of its axon to the terminal, the message

73
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,759
hits the synapse that then flings it over that synaptic
gap to another neuron that’s in your spinal cord.

74
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,539
Remember, signals travel between neurons either
by electrical or chemical synapses.

75
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,370
The electrical ones send an electrical impulse,
while the chemical ones -- the ones I’m

76
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,870
talking about now -- first convert that signal
from electrical to chemical, by activating

77
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,180
neurotransmitters to bridge the synaptic gap,
before the receiving neuron converts that

78
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,480
chemical signal back into an electrical one.

79
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,750
In this case, news of the tack-attack is carried
by specific neurotransmitters whose sole job

80
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,480
is to pass along pain messages.

81
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,160
Now, so far, your body’s response to the
stimulus has been handled by the sensory,

82
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:51,590
or afferent, division of your peripheral nervous
system. This is the part that’s involved

83
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:55,159
expressly in collecting data and sending it
to the central nervous system.

84
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,500
But at this point, the responsibility changes
hands. The torch is passed.

85
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,860
Because the pain signal has just triggered
an action potential in a neuron in the spinal

86
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,439
cord, which is part of the central nervous system,
and there it reaches an integration center.

87
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:14,500
From here, the response is taken over by the
motor, or efferent division.

88
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,209
Once the integration center interprets the
signal, it transmits the message to motor

89
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:22,399
neurons, which send an action potential back
down your leg, where it reaches an effector.

90
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:27,089
And an effector is just any structure that
receives and reacts to a motor neuron’s

91
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:30,649
signal, like a muscle contracting or a gland
secreting a hormone.

92
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:34,000
From here, the motor neurons complete the
whole foot-lifting response until the rest

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,550
of your nervous system gets engaged in the
complicated tasks of figuring out what the

94
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,240
problem is, and fixing it.

95
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,519
Those are the five steps that your highly
specific neural pathways go through to produce

96
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,409
what’s known as a reflex arc.

97
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:49,840
A lot of your body’s control systems boil
down to reflexes just like this -- immediate

98
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,439
reactions that can either be innate or learned, but
don’t need much conscious processing in the brain.

99
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:59,050
Lifting your foot when you step on a tack
is an innate, or intrinsic, reflex action

100
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,400
-- a super fast motor response to a startling
stimulus.

101
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,009
These reflexes are so invested in your self-preservation
that you actually can’t think about them

102
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,230
before you respond.

103
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,930
All this processing happens in the spinal
cord, so that the control of muscles can be

104
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,400
initiated before the pain is actually perceived
by the brain.

105
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:19,489
Learned, or acquired reflexes on the other
hand, come from experience. Like how you learn

106
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,319
to dodge obstacles while riding a bike or
driving a car. That process is also largely

107
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,579
automatic, but you learn those reflexes by spending
time behind the wheel, or behind the handlebars.

108
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:33,639
And reflex arcs stimulate some muscles, while
inhibiting others. For example, the tack in

109
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:38,209
your right foot ended up activating the motor
neurons in your right hip flexors and hamstring,

110
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,639
causing that knee to bend and your foot to
lift up.

111
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:45,448
But it also told the quad muscles in your
left leg to extend and stand tall, allowing

112
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:47,650
you to shift your body’s weight off the
tack.

113
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:51,310
Of course not all reflexes come from pain,
as you’ve probably experienced when a doctor

114
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,959
tapped your knee and your foot kicked.

115
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,168
Your muscles and tendons are very sensitive
to being stretched too far, or too fast, because

116
00:07:57,168 --> 00:07:58,620
that kind of movement can cause injury.

117
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,699
So for this we have receptors called muscle
and tendon spindles that specifically sense

118
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:08,139
stretching. If triggered by an over-stretch,
they generate a reflex arc that contracts

119
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:10,180
the muscle to keep it from stretching further.

120
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,040
So, when does the brain actually get involved
in all this?

121
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,330
Well, when your spinal cord sent impulses
down the motor neurons, it also sent signals

122
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:19,800
up your spinal cord toward the brain.

123
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,350
News of the tack arrived first at your thalamus,
the information switchboard that then split

124
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:29,580
the message and sent it to the somatosensory
cortex -- which identifies and localizes the

125
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:34,578
pain, like: “sharp, and foot”; as well
as the limbic system, which registers emotional

126
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:38,978
suffering -- like, “why tack? Why me?!”
And it also went to the frontal cortex, which

127
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:43,408
made sense of it all, assigning meaning to
the pain -- like, “oh, I see this tack fell

128
00:08:43,408 --> 00:08:45,458
from the Crash Course poster on the wall here.”

129
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:49,198
So basically, although your body has been
reacting all along, it’s not until those

130
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:54,169
pain signals hit the brain that you have the
conscious thoughts of both “dang, that hurt,”

131
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:57,429
and “oh, that hurt because I stepped on
a specific pointy thing.“

132
00:08:57,429 --> 00:09:01,808
And this is where I want to point out that
we here at Crash Course cannot be held responsible

133
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:06,668
for any injuries sustained in the process
of owning a Crash Course poster. Enjoy them

134
00:09:06,668 --> 00:09:07,980
at your own risk.

135
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:12,139
Today you got your first look at the peripheral
nervous system, by learning how the afferent

136
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:17,068
and efferent divisions provide information
about, and responses to, pain. You learned

137
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:22,368
about the five steps of the reflex arc, the
different kinds of reflexes you have, and

138
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:26,480
what your brain has to say about all that
pain, once the news is finally broken to it.
