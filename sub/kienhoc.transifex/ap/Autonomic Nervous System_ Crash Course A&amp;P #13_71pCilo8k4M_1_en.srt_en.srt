1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,038
No matter what you’re a fan of, you can
probably think of two characters who fit the

2
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:08,839
description. Holmes and Watson. Brennan and
Booth. Kirk and Spock. Ron and Hermione.

3
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:12,419
They’re close. They understand each other
in ways that others don’t, and you really

4
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:17,298
can’t picture one without the other. But when when
happens, they usually react in different ways.

5
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:20,469
Like, if you’re snooping around Hogwarts
at night, and you come across some beastie,

6
00:00:20,469 --> 00:00:24,869
the smart money’s on Hermione to come up
with a spell that saves the day, while Ron

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,859
probably standin’ there with his mouth open.

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,350
And when Sherlock starts to go crazy because
there hasn’t been a fiendishly clever jewel

9
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:36,250
heist or whatever for him to figure out, you
can count on Watson to calm him down. Mostly.

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,090
My brother John, who is a writer of books,
will tell you that these characters are foils

11
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,450
-- they’re not opposites, exactly. They’re
contrasts, and the more you see them together,

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,390
the more they seem to complement or round
one another out.

13
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,250
And that is basically your autonomic nervous
system in a nutshell.

14
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,039
Your autonomic system is the branch of your
peripheral nervous system that regulates the

15
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:59,649
functions of your internal organs, like your
heart and stomach, and also controls your

16
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:02,829
smooth and cardiac muscles, and your glands.

17
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:07,140
All things that you you do not consciously control, so,
yes, you could say it has a lot of power over you.

18
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,400
But the funny -- or maybe confusing -- thing
about this system is that its effects on your

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,650
organs and muscles and glands are by no means
consistent.

20
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:15,670
Not at all.

21
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,079
At any given moment, whether you happen to
be totally relaxed or completely flipping

22
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:24,170
your wig, your autonomic system is constantly
making involuntary, fine-tuned adjustments

23
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,719
to your body, based on what signals your central
nervous system is picking up.

24
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,069
This could mean changing your body temperature,
sending extra blood to a particular area,

25
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:35,438
slowing your heart beat, or tweaking your
stomach secretions.

26
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,149
Its effects change, depending on the situation
you’re in -- and also which part of your

27
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,950
autonomic system is in charge at that moment.

28
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,219
Because this weird little corner of your nervous
system that keeps you alive is actually run

29
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:48,609
by two competing interests.

30
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:53,310
Two divisions that serve the same organs,
but they create opposite effects in them,

31
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,750
battling it out back and forth, to either
excite your body’s functions or subdue them.

32
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,379
One of them is dedicated to amping you up
and preparing you for activity -- that’s

33
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,859
your sympathetic nervous system. And the other
one talks you down and effectively undoes

34
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:10,008
what its foil did. And that is the parasympathetic
nervous system.

35
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:15,148
Together, they’re what make your body experience
stress, fear, relaxation, and defiance. Courage

36
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:17,539
and cowardice. Panic and peace.

37
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:22,039
If there’s an epic novel going on in your body right
now it is probably being written by these two.

38
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,859
Let’s talk about names for a minute.

39
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,489
One of the two divisions of your autonomic
nervous system is called the sympathetic system.

40
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:40,939
That sounds kinda nice, doesn’t it? It’s
like understanding, and calming, and telling

41
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:42,659
you that it’s not so bad after all.

42
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:47,400
WRONG! Contrary to its comforting name, the
sympathetic system is what sounds your internal

43
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,539
alarm bells. It’s the hardware behind the
famous “fight or flight” response. It

44
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:53,269
is synonymous with stress.

45
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:57,069
If the sympathetic is for “fight or flight,”
the parasympathetic is for “resting and

46
00:02:57,068 --> 00:03:01,909
digesting” -- it’s responsible for maintaining
your body and conserving energy for later.

47
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:03,579
I recognize that this is confusing.

48
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,590
But, when you explore the anatomy of these
two systems, like we’re gonna do today,

49
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,239
they start to make a little more sense.

50
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,060
Because, even though their basic components
are essentially the same, their physical structures

51
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,310
turn out to be different in a few really important
ways. And those differences can help explain

52
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,189
why they act like the foils that they are,
and why sometimes you feel more like Sherlock

53
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:23,219
than Watson, or the other way around.

54
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:27,819
First big difference: the nerves of these two
divisions originate at different sites in your body.

55
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:32,019
Your sympathetic fibers are thoracolumbar
-- meaning that they originate from between

56
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:37,379
your thoracic vertebrae where your ribs attach,
and the lumbar vertebrae just inferior to your ribs.

57
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:40,949
Early anatomists saw how a network of nerves
radiating from the middle of the spine like

58
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:45,519
this could quickly coordinate the functions
of many major organs at once. So it was called

59
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,209
the sympathetic system, from the Greek words
for “feeling together.”

60
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:53,649
But the nerve fibers of your parasympathetic
system begin both above and below where

61
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:55,318
the sympathetic ones do.

62
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:59,500
They’re craniosacral, meaning they sprout
from the base of your brain and also from

63
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,908
your sacral spinal cord, just superior to
the tailbone.

64
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:06,688
And because the roots of these nerve fibers
basically frame the starting points of the

65
00:04:06,688 --> 00:04:11,579
sympathetic nerves, they were called parasympathetic
-- literally “beside the sympathetic.”

66
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,348
Another difference between these two foils?
Their ganglia.

67
00:04:14,348 --> 00:04:18,180
Unlike your sensory or motor neurons, where
a single axon can reach all the way from your

68
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,110
spinal cord to whatever muscle or touch receptor
it works with, both parts of your autonomic

69
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,800
system require two neurons in order to work.

70
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,139
And those two neurons meet in ganglia -- clusters of
neuron cell bodies that house millions of synapses.

71
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,860
But where these ganglia appear relate to 
their function, and which division of the

72
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,780
autonomic system they're serving.

73
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:41,099
Sympathetic ganglia are found closer to the
spinal cord, because in those fight-or-flight

74
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,819
moments of high excitement or activity, they
need to be able to send a single message far

75
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,379
and wide, like the Bat Signal.

76
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:51,899
This way, excitatory signals traveling into
a ganglion near the spine -- ganglion being

77
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:56,168
the singular of ganlia -- can trigger action
potentials in a whole bunch of other neurons

78
00:04:56,168 --> 00:05:00,459
that lead to many different effectors, like the
heart, and lungs, and stomach, and adrenal glands.

79
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:05,388
By contrast, most parasympathetic ganglia
are found way out from the spine -- near,

80
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,829
or even inside of their effector organs.

81
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:11,859
Because this system is responsible for taking
care of particular functions only when you

82
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,788
have the time and energy to do it -- like
digesting food or excreting waste -- it uses

83
00:05:15,788 --> 00:05:17,938
more specific, strategic signals.

84
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:21,830
It’s more like Commissioner Gordon calling
Batman on the batphone, one on one just to

85
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:27,430
talk about how things are going and you know
whether Alfred’s doing OK after his meningitis.

86
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,750
It’s a private conversation -- not everybody
needs to be involved.

87
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,180
Anyway, because the ganglia of these two divisions
appear in different places in your body, it

88
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:41,780
also makes sense that their neurons themselves have
slightly different forms, namely the length of their axons.

89
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:45,568
Now, ganglia can be kind of complex -- it
actually comes from the Greek word for “a

90
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:49,740
knot in a string” -- so when dealing with
neurons around these structures, we look at

91
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,540
the fibers before they run into the ganglion,
as well as after they come out of it.

92
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,280
Understandably enough, the axon lengths of
the neurons before the ganglion are called

93
00:05:57,288 --> 00:06:01,399
the preganglionic fibers, and the ones coming
out are postganglionic.

94
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:05,209
The key here is that, in the sympathetic system,
the preganglionic fibers are much shorter

95
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:07,149
than the postganglionic ones.

96
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:10,379
Which makes sense, when you think about it,
because sympathetic ganglia are really close

97
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:14,689
to the spinal cord, and the axons don’t
have, or need, very far to go from the central

98
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:18,490
nervous system. But they do have a lot of
distance to cover, on the other side of the

99
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:23,778
ganglion, in order to reach their effectors. So naturally
the fibers leading out of the ganglia are a lot longer.

100
00:06:23,778 --> 00:06:27,959
And, foils being what they are, the reverse is of
course true for the parasympathetic system.

101
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:32,300
Since parasympathetic ganglia are so close
to, or even inside of, their effector organs,

102
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,710
the preganglionic fibers are a lot longer.

103
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:38,998
They extend from the cranium and sacrum where
they start, out to the lungs or liver or bladder

104
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,460
-- wherever their effector is -- where they
reach their ganglion.

105
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:46,799
From there, the postganglionic fibers are super short --
just long enough to communicate with their effector.

106
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:50,088
So, once again -- it’s anatomy and 
physiology -- the structure of each

107
00:06:50,088 --> 00:06:52,579
of these systems is related to its function.

108
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:56,329
The sympathetic nervous system is set up in
such a way that even a small stress signal

109
00:06:56,329 --> 00:07:00,468
sent down one path could trigger a response
in many effectors at once.

110
00:07:00,468 --> 00:07:05,399
Which is one reason why your reaction to a
sudden, stressful event can feel so all-encompassing.

111
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:09,479
By the same token, the resting and digesting
that’s overseen by the parasympathetic system

112
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,778
doesn’t require urgent, all-hands-on deck
communication. If you need to process a burrito

113
00:07:14,778 --> 00:07:20,658
or take a nap or maybe a trip to the bathroom, it can
communicate with the organs involved, one on one.

114
00:07:20,668 --> 00:07:25,038
But still none of this tells us how these
systems do what they do -- how these nerves

115
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:29,478
communicate with your organs, and muscles,
and glands in times of either stress, or relaxation.

116
00:07:29,478 --> 00:07:33,329
We’ll start that next week, with a white-knuckle
ride through your sympathetic nervous system.

117
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:35,740
So, between now and then, rest up.

118
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,088
For now, you learned the basic two-part system
of your autonomic nervous system. Mainly that

119
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:44,399
it consists of two primary, complementary
divisions, the sympathetic nervous system,

120
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,538
which arouses your body, and the parasympathetic
nervous system, which is charge of resting,

121
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,160
digesting, and repair.

122
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:53,928
We also talked through the three main anatomical
differences between the two systems. Their

123
00:07:53,928 --> 00:07:58,079
nerve fibers originate in different parts
of the body, the ganglia of the sympathetic

124
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,908
system are located close to the spinal cord,
while the ganglia of the parasympathetic system

125
00:08:01,908 --> 00:08:07,079
are close to their effectors. And finally, the nerve
fibers themselves have different structures.
