1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:03,560
This morning was a typical morning for me.
I woke up thinking about that dream that I

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,128
keep having about the guy in the sloth suit,
and then I got dressed because I was cold,

3
00:00:08,128 --> 00:00:11,559
and then I made some toast with butter ‘cause
I was hungry, and then I let the dog out ‘cause

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,490
she was whining and staring and me, and then
I made some tea but I let it cool off before

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,410
I drank it because I burned my mouth yesterday.

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,859
In addition to being just part of my morning
ritual, all of these actions are examples

7
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:24,019
of what my nervous system does for me.

8
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:28,179
The weirdo dream, the sensation of cold air
and hot tea, deciding what to put on the toast,

9
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:32,129
going to the door at the sound of the dog
-- all that was processed and executed by

10
00:00:32,129 --> 00:00:35,149
electrical and chemical signals to and from
nerve cells.

11
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:38,799
You can’t oversell the importance of the
nervous system.

12
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,799
It controls ALL THE THINGS!

13
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,948
All your organs, all your physiological and
psychological reactions, even your body’s

14
00:00:44,948 --> 00:00:49,968
other major controlling force, the endocrine
system, bows down before the nervous system.

15
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:53,429
There is no “you” without it. There is
no “me” without it. There’s no dogs

16
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:57,969
without it. There’s no animals. There’s
no -- there’s no things -- there’s things.

17
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:01,439
It’s important. That’s why we’re dedicating
the next several episodes to the fundamentals

18
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:06,069
of the nervous system -- its anatomy and organization,
how it communicates, and what happens when

19
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:07,199
it gets damaged.

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,240
This is mission control, people!

21
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:22,959
Even though pretty much all animals -- except
super simple ones like sponges -- have a nervous

22
00:01:22,968 --> 00:01:27,390
system, ours is probably the most distinctive
feature of our species.

23
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,009
From writing novels, to debating time travel,
to juggling knives -- all of your thoughts,

24
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,009
and actions, and emotions can be boiled down
into three principal functions -- sensory

25
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:40,140
input, integration, and motor output.

26
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,250
Imagine a spider walking onto your bare knee.

27
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,549
The sensory receptors on your skin detect
those eight little legs -- that information

28
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:47,740
is your sensory input.

29
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:52,158
From there your nervous system processes that
input, and decides what should be done about

30
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,020
it. That’s called integration -- like, should
I be all zen about it and just let it walk

31
00:01:56,019 --> 00:02:01,819
over me, or should I not be zen and freak
out and run around screaming, “SPIDER!”?

32
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:06,179
Your hand lashing out to remove the spider,
and maybe your accompanying banshee scream,

33
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:10,140
is the motor output -- the response that occurs
when your nervous system activates certain

34
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,059
parts of your body.

35
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,479
As you can imagine, it takes a highly integrated
system to detect, process, and act on data

36
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,099
like this, all the time.

37
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,120
And when we talk about the nervous system,
we’re really talking about several levels

38
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,830
of organization, starting with two main parts:
the central and peripheral nervous systems.

39
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,640
The central nervous system is your brain and
spinal cord -- the main control center. It’s

40
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,000
what decided to remove the spider, and gave
the order to your hand.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,729
Your peripheral system is composed of all
the nerves that branch off from the brain

42
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:40,699
and spine that allow your central nervous system
to communicate with the rest of your body.

43
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:45,099
And since its job is communication, your peripheral
system is set up to work in both directions:

44
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:49,579
The sensory, or afferent division is what
picks up sensory stimuli -- like, “hey,

45
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,400
there’s an arachnid on you” -- and slings
that information to the brain.

46
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,490
Your motor, or efferent division is the part
that sends directions from your brain to the

47
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,879
muscles and glands -- like, “hey hand part,
how ‘bout you do something about that spider.”

48
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,659
The motor division also includes the somatic,
or voluntary nervous system, that rules your

49
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:09,099
skeletal muscle movement, and the autonomic,
or involuntary nervous system, that keeps

50
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:11,699
your heart beating, and your lungs breathing,
and your stomach churning.

51
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:16,429
And finally, that autonomic system, too, has
its own complementary forces. Its sympathetic

52
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,719
division mobilizes the body into action and
gets it all fired up, like “Gah! SPIDER!”

53
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,780
-- while the parasympathetic division relaxes
the body and talks it down… Like, “it

54
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,069
wasn’t a black widow or anything; you’re
fine, breathe!”

55
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:31,180
So that’s the organization of your nervous
system in a nutshell. But no matter what part

56
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,950
you’re talking about, they’re all made
up of mainly nervous tissue, which you’ll

57
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:37,030
remember is densely packed with cells.

58
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:42,280
Maybe less than 20 percent of that tissue consists of
extracellular space. Everything else? Cells.

59
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,680
The type of cells you’ve most likely heard
of are the neurons, or nerve cells, which

60
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,349
respond to stimuli and transmit signals.

61
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:51,530
These cells get all the publicity -- they’re
the ones that we’re always thanking every

62
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,699
time we ace an exam or think up a snappy comeback
to an argument.

63
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:58,769
But these wise guys really account for just
a small part of your nervous tissue because

64
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:04,130
they are surrounded and protected by gaggles
of neuroglia, or glial cells.

65
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:08,109
Once considered just the scaffolding or glue
that held neurons together, we now know that

66
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:13,090
our different glial cell types serve many
other important functions, and they make up

67
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:18,560
about half of the mass of your brain, outnumbering
their neuron colleagues by about 10 to 1.

68
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,350
Star-shaped astrocytes are found in your central
nervous system and are your most abundant

69
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:27,530
and versatile glial cells. They anchor neurons
to their blood supply, and govern the exchange

70
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:29,949
of materials between neurons and capillaries.

71
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:34,639
Also in your central nervous system are your
protective microglial cells -- they’re smaller

72
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,169
and kinda thorny-looking, and act as the main
source of immune defense against invading

73
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,520
microorganisms in the brain and spinal cord.

74
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:44,759
Your ependymal cells line cavities in your
brain and spinal cord and create, secrete,

75
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,319
and circulate cerebrospinal fluid that fills
those cavities and cushions those organs.

76
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:53,969
And finally your central nervous system’s
oligodendrocytes wrap around neurons, producing

77
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,530
an insulating barrier called the myelin sheath.

78
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:01,429
Now, over in your peripheral nervous system,
there are just two kinds of glial cells. Satellite

79
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:05,930
cells do mainly in the peripheral system what
astrocyte cells do in the central system -- they

80
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:11,060
surround and support neuron cell bodies. While
Schwann cells are similar to your oligodendrocytes,

81
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,530
in that they wrap around axons and make that
insulating myelin sheath.

82
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:18,989
So don’t sell your glial cells short -- they’re
in the majority, cell-wise. But of course

83
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:23,449
when it comes to passing tests and winning
arguments, most of the heavy lifting is done

84
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:27,159
by the neurons. And they’re not all the
same -- they’re actually highly specialized,

85
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,380
coming in all shapes and sizes -- from tiny
ones in your brain to the ones that run the

86
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:32,889
entire length of your leg.

87
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:36,069
But they do all share three super-cool things
in common.

88
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:40,199
Number 1. They’re some of the longest-lived
cells in your body. There’s a lot of debate

89
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:44,129
right now about whether you’re actually
born with all of the neurons you’ll ever

90
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:48,449
have, but some research suggests that, at
least in your brain’s cerebral cortex, your

91
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:50,379
neurons will live as long as you do.

92
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:54,949
Cool fact number 2. They are irreplaceable.
It’s a good thing that they have such longevity,

93
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:59,779
because your neurons aren’t like your constantly-
renewing skin cells. Most neurons are amitotic, so

94
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:03,109
once they take on their given roles in the
nervous system, they lose their ability to

95
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,970
divide. So take care of ‘em!

96
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:10,889
And number 3. They have huge appetites. Like
a soccer-playing teenager, neurons have a

97
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:15,879
crazy-high metabolic rate. They need a steady
and abundant supply of glucose and oxygen,

98
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:20,589
and about 25 percent of the calories that
you take in every day are consumed by your

99
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:21,759
brain’s activity.

100
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,860
Along with all these wonderful qualities,
your neurons also share the same basic structure.

101
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,689
The soma, or cell body, is the neuron’s
life support. It’s got all the normal cell

102
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:33,790
goodies like a nucleus, and DNA, mitochondria,
ribosomes, cytoplasm.

103
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:38,050
The bushy, branch-like things projecting out
from the soma are dendrites. They’re the

104
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,780
listeners -- they pick up messages, news, gossip from
other cells and convey that information to the cell body.

105
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:48,299
The neuron’s axon, meanwhile, is like the
talker. This long extension, or fiber, can

106
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,900
be super short, or run a full meter from your
spine down to your ankle. We’ve got a few

107
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:56,939
different axon layouts in our body, but in
the most abundant type of neuron, the axons

108
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:00,569
transmit electrical impulses away from the
cell body to other cells.

109
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:04,870
For us students of biology, it’s a good
thing that nerve cells aren’t all identical.

110
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:09,250
Because their differences in structure are one of
the ways that we tell them apart, and classify them.

111
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,370
The main feature we look at is how many processes
extend out from the cell body.

112
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:17,500
A “process” in this case being a projecting
part of an organic structure.

113
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,800
99 percent of all your neurons are multipolar
neurons, with three or more processes sticking

114
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,400
out from the soma -- including one axon, and
a bunch of dendrites.

115
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:31,879
Bipolar neurons have two processes -- an axon
and a single dendrite -- extending from opposite

116
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:35,649
sides of the cell body. They’re pretty rare,
found only in a few special sensory places,

117
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:37,049
like the retina of your eye.

118
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,560
Unipolar neurons, on the other hand, have
just one process, and are found mostly in

119
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,899
your sensory receptors.

120
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:45,478
So, if you ever find yourself probing around
someone’s nervous tissue, remember these

121
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:48,029
three terms to help you figure out what you’re
looking at.

122
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:51,789
But because we’re talking physiology here
as well as anatomy, we have to classify these

123
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:56,050
cells in terms of their function, and that
basically comes down to which way an impulse

124
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,478
travels through a neuron in relation to the
brain and spine.

125
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:03,918
Our sensory, or afferent, neurons pick up
messages and transmit impulses from sensory

126
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:09,278
receptors in say, the skin or internal organs,
and send them toward the central nervous system.

127
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:11,219
Most sensory neurons are unipolar.

128
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,430
Motor, or efferent, neurons do the opposite
-- they’re mostly multipolar, and transmit

129
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,949
impulses away from the central nervous system
and out to your body’s muscles and glands.

130
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:24,840
And then there are interneurons, or association
neurons, which live in the central nervous

131
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,339
system and transmit impulses between those
sensory and motor neurons. Interneurons are

132
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:32,309
the most abundant of your body’s neurons
and are mostly multipolar.

133
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:35,889
OK! It’s applied knowledge time! Let’s
review everything we’ve learned so far in

134
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:37,759
terms of that spider on your knee.

135
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,969
Those eight creeping legs first activate your
unipolar sensory neurons in the skin on your

136
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:46,569
knee, when they sense something crawling on
you. The signal travels up an axon wrapped

137
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:52,519
in Schwann cells and into your spinal cord, where it
gets passed on to several multipolar interneurons.

138
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:56,399
Now, some of those interneurons might send
a signal straight down a bunch of multipolar

139
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,278
neurons to your quadriceps muscle on your
thigh, triggering you to kick your leg out

140
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:02,909
before you even know what’s going on.

141
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:07,159
Other interneurons will pass that signal to neurons
that carry it up your spinal cord to your brain.

142
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:11,058
That’s where your body first recognizes
that thing as a spider, and the connections

143
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:15,938
between neurons interpret and split the signal
so that you can either scream, and start swinging

144
00:09:15,938 --> 00:09:21,658
your arms wildly about...or...remain calm, and
with dignity remove the spider from your person.

145
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:24,379
It’s all based on the connections between
neurons.

146
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:27,359
Which brings me to a whole new question: How?

147
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,560
How in the name of Jean-Martin Charcot do
nerve cells use chemistry and electricity

148
00:09:32,568 --> 00:09:34,110
to communicate with each other?

149
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,119
It’s one of the most stupifyingly awesome
and complicated aspects of your nervous system,

150
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,970
and basically of all life and it is what we
will cover in our next lesson.

151
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,990
Today you learned how sensory input, integration,
and motor output of your nervous system basically

152
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:51,269
rules your world. We talked about how the
central and peripheral systems are organized,

153
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:56,480
and what they do, and looked at the role of
different glial cells in nervous tissue function.

154
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,420
We also looked at the role, anatomy, and function
of neuron types in the body, both structurally

155
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:05,899
and functionally, and how everything plays out
when you find a spider crawling on your skin.
