1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,079
Check out this amoeba.

2
00:00:02,078 --> 00:00:04,899
Pretty nice. Kind of a rugged, no-frills life
form.

3
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:08,730
The thing about amoebas is that they do everything
in the same place. They take in and digest

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,030
their food, and reject their waste, and get
through everything else they need to do, all

5
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:13,250
within a single cell.

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,160
They don’t need trillions of different cells
working together to keep them alive. They

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,359
don’t need a bunch of structures to keep
their stomachs away from their hearts away

8
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:24,419
from their lungs. They’re content to just
blob around and live the simple life.

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,830
But we humans, along with the rest of the
multicellular animal kingdom, are substantially

10
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:33,128
more complex. We’re all about cell specialization,
and compartmentalizing our bodies.

11
00:00:33,128 --> 00:00:37,198
Every cell in your body has its own specific
job description related to maintaining your

12
00:00:37,198 --> 00:00:41,049
homeostasis, that balance of materials and
energy that keeps you alive.

13
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:45,419
And those cells are the most basic building
blocks in the hierarchy of increasingly complex

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,070
structures that make you what you are.

15
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,350
We covered a lot of cell biology in Crash
Course Bio, so if you haven’t taken

16
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,219
that course with us yet, or if you just want
a refresher, you can go over there now.

17
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:57,139
I will still be here when you get back.

18
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,600
But with that ground already covered, we’re
going to skip ahead to when groups of similar

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,340
cells come together to perform a common function,
in our tissues.

20
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,500
Tissues are like the fabric of your body.
In fact, the term literally means “woven.”

21
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,050
And when two or more tissues combine, they
form our organs. Your kidneys, lungs, and

22
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,689
your liver, and other organs are all made
of different types of tissues.

23
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,429
But what function a certain part of your organ
performs, depends on what kind of tissue it’s

24
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,130
made of. In other words, the type of tissue
defines its function.

25
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:28,250
And we have four primary tissues, each with
a different job:

26
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,640
our nervous tissue provides us with control
and communication,

27
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,250
muscle tissues give us movement,

28
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:38,209
epithelial tissues line our body cavities and organs,
and essentially cover and protect the body,

29
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:40,319
while connective tissues provide support.

30
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:45,890
If our cells are like words, then our tissues,
or our groups of cells, are like sentences,

31
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,739
the beginning of a language.

32
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,829
And your journey to becoming fluent in this
language of your body -- your ability to read,

33
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:54,489
understand, and interpret it -- begins today.

34
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,248
Although physicians and artists have been
exploring human anatomy for centuries, histology

35
00:02:09,248 --> 00:02:11,848
-- the study of our tissues -- is a much younger
discipline.

36
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:15,858
That’s because, in order to get all up in
a body’s tissues, we needed microscopes,

37
00:02:15,859 --> 00:02:21,248
and they weren’t invented until the 1590’s,
when Hans and Zacharias Jansen, a father-son

38
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:25,430
pair of Dutch spectacle makers, put some lenses
in a tube and changed science forever.

39
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,780
But as ground-breaking as those first microscopes
were then, they were little better than something

40
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,598
you’d get in a cereal box today -- that is to
say, low in magnification and pretty blurry.

41
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,968
So the heyday of microscopes didn’t really
get crackin’ until the late 1600s, when

42
00:02:36,968 --> 00:02:41,568
another Dutchman -- Anton van Leeuwenhoek
-- became the first to make and use truly

43
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:42,899
high-power microscopes.

44
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,998
While other scopes at the time were lucky
to get 50-times magnification, Van Leeuwenhoek’s

45
00:02:46,998 --> 00:02:53,068
had up to 270-times magnifying power, identifying
things as small as one thousandth of a millimeter.

46
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:57,919
Using his new scope, Leeuwenhoek was the first
to observe microorganisms, bacteria, spermatozoa,

47
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,818
and muscle fibers, earning himself the illustrious
title of The Father of Microbiology for his troubles.

48
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:06,929
But even then, his amazing new optics weren’t
quite enough to launch the study of histology

49
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,139
as we know it, because most individual cells in a
tissue weren’t visible in your average scope.

50
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:16,069
It took another breakthrough -- the invention
of stains and dyes -- to make that possible.

51
00:03:16,068 --> 00:03:20,628
To actually see a specimen under a microscope,
you have to first preserve, or fix it, then

52
00:03:20,628 --> 00:03:26,068
slice it into super-thin, deli-meat-like sections
that let the light through, and then stain

53
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:28,429
that material to enhance its contrasts.

54
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,560
Because different stains latch on to different
cellular structures, this process lets us

55
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,028
see what’s going on in any given tissue
sample, down to the specific parts of each

56
00:03:37,028 --> 00:03:38,389
individual cell.

57
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:42,169
Some stains let us clearly see cells’ nuclei
-- and as you learn to identify different

58
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:47,109
tissues, the location, shape, size, or even
absence of nuclei will be very important.

59
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:51,079
Now, Leeuwenhoek was technically the first
person to use a dye -- one he made from saffron

60
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:55,639
-- to study biological structures under the
scope in 1673, because, the dude was a boss.

61
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:00,379
But it really wasn’t until nearly 200 years
later, in the 1850s, that the we really got the

62
00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:03,949
first true histological stain.
And for that we can thank German anatomist

63
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:05,289
Joseph von Gerlach.

64
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:08,739
Back in his day, a few scientists had been
tinkering with staining tissues, especially

65
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:13,919
with a compound called carmine -- a red dye
derived from the scales of a crushed-up insects.

66
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,299
Gerlach and others had some luck using carmine
to highlight different kinds of cell structures,

67
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:21,878
but where Gerlach got stuck was in exploring
the tissues of the brain.

68
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:25,939
For some reason, he couldn’t get the dye
to stain brain cells, and the more stain he

69
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:27,500
used, the worse the results were.

70
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,029
So one day, he tried making a diluted version
of the stain -- thinning out the carmine with

71
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:35,609
ammonia and gelatin -- and wetted a sample
of brain tissue with it.

72
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,180
Alas, still nothing.

73
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,209
So he closed up his lab for the night, and,
as the story goes, in his disappointment,

74
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:45,549
he forgot to remove the slice of someone’s
cerebellum that he had left sitting in the

75
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,668
He returned the next morning to find the long,
slow soak in diluted carmine had stained all

76
00:04:50,668 --> 00:04:56,359
kinds of structures inside the tissue -- including
the nuclei of individual brain cells and what

77
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,139
he described as “fibers” that seemed to
link the cells together.

78
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:03,889
It would be another 30 years before we knew
what a neuron really looked like, but Gerlach’s

79
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:08,038
famous neural stain was a breakthrough
in our understanding of nervous tissue.

80
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:12,610
AND it showed other anatomists how the combination
of the right microscope and the right stain

81
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:18,430
could open up our understanding of all of our
body’s tissues and how they make life possible.

82
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,569
Today, we recognize the cells Gerlach studied
as a type of nervous tissue, which forms,

83
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:26,490
you guessed it, the nervous system -- that
is, the brain and spinal cord of the central

84
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,500
nervous system, and the network of nerves
in your peripheral nervous system. Combined,

85
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,560
they regulate and control all of your body’s
functions.

86
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,848
That basic nervous tissue has two big functions
-- sensing stimuli and sending electrical

87
00:05:38,848 --> 00:05:42,199
impulses throughout the body, often in response
to those stimuli.

88
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:47,439
And this tissue also is made up of two different
cell types -- neurons and glial cells.

89
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:52,139
Neurons are the specialized building blocks
of the nervous system. Your brain alone contains

90
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:57,199
billions of them -- they’re what generate
and conduct the electrochemical nerve impulses

91
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,889
that let you think, and dream, and eat nachos,
or do anything.

92
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:04,530
But they’re also all over your body. If
you’re petting a fuzzy puppy, or you touch

93
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:08,438
a cold piece of metal, or rough sandpaper,
it’s the neurons in your skin’s nervous

94
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:13,300
tissue that sense that stimuli, and send the
message to your brain to say, like, “cuddly!”

95
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,908
or “Cold!” or “why am I petting sandpaper?!”

96
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:21,110
No matter where they are, though, each neuron
has the same anatomy, consisting of the cell

97
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,288
body, the dendrites, and the axon.

98
00:06:23,288 --> 00:06:27,168
The cell body, or soma, is the neuron’s
life support. It’s got all the necessary

99
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:29,688
goods like a nucleus, mitochondria, and DNA.

100
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:33,889
The bushy dendrites look like the trees that they’re
named after, and collect signals from other

101
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,030
cells to send back to the soma. They are the
listening end.

102
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:42,059
The long, rope-like axon is the transmission
cable -- it carries messages to other neurons,

103
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,449
and muscles, and glands. Together all of these
things combine to form nerves of all different

104
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:48,379
sizes laced throughout your body.

105
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:52,639
The other type of nervous cells, the glial
cells, are like the neuron’s pit crew, providing

106
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,500
support, insulation, and protection, and tethering
them to blood vessels.

107
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,168
But sensing the world around you isn't much
use if you can't do anything about it, which

108
00:07:00,168 --> 00:07:02,948
is why we've also got muscle tissues.

109
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:07,189
Unlike your nervous tissues, your muscle tissues
can contract and move, which is super handy

110
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:10,759
if you want to walk or chew or breathe.

111
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:15,520
Muscle tissue is well-vascularized, meaning
it’s got a lot of blood coming and going,

112
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,339
and it comes in three flavors: skeletal, cardiac,
and smooth.

113
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:22,899
Your skeletal muscle tissue is what attaches
to all the bones in your skeleton, supporting

114
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:24,620
you and keeping your posture in line.

115
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:29,439
Skeletal muscle tissues pull on bones or skin
as they contract to make your body move.

116
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,610
You can see how skeletal muscle tissue has
long, cylindrical cells. It looks kind of

117
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:39,069
clean and smooth, with obvious striations
that resemble little pin stripes. Many of

118
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:43,610
the actions made possible in this tissue -- like
your wide range of facial expressions or pantheon

119
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,499
of dance moves -- are voluntary.

120
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:49,539
Your cardiac muscle tissue, on the other hand,
works involuntarily. Which is great, because

121
00:07:49,538 --> 00:07:53,459
it forms the walls of your heart, and it would
be really distracting to have to remind it

122
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:58,748
to contract once every second. This tissue
is only found in your heart, and its regular

123
00:07:58,749 --> 00:08:02,569
contractions are what propel blood through
your circulatory system.

124
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:07,169
Cardiac muscle tissue is also striped, or
striated, but unlike skeletal muscle tissue,

125
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:11,938
their cells are generally uninucleate, meaning
that they have just one nucleus. You can also

126
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:17,069
see that this tissue is made of a series of
sort of messy cell shapes that look they divide

127
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:19,990
and converge, rather than running parallel
to each other.

128
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,908
But where these cells join end-to-end you
can see darker striations, These are the glue

129
00:08:23,908 --> 00:08:28,418
that hold the muscle cells together when they
contract, and they contain pores so that electrical

130
00:08:28,418 --> 00:08:31,120
and chemical signals can pass from one cell
to the next.

131
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,469
And finally, we’ve got the smooth muscle
tissue, which lines the walls of most of your

132
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:39,050
blood vessels and hollow organs, like those
in your digestive and urinary tracts, and

133
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:40,408
your uterus, if you have one.

134
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:44,450
It’s called smooth because, as you can see,
unlike the other two, it lacks striation.

135
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:49,370
Its cells are sort of short and tapered at the
ends, and are arranged to form tight-knit sheets.

136
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,470
This tissue is also involuntary, because like
the heart, these organs squeeze substances

137
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,100
through by alternately contracting and relaxing,
without you having to think about it.

138
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,579
Now, one thing that every A&P student has
to be able to do is identify different types

139
00:09:01,578 --> 00:09:03,458
of muscle tissue from a stained specimen.

140
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,098
So Pop Quiz, hot shot!

141
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,278
See if you can match the following tissue
stains with their corresponding muscle tissue

142
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:11,649
types. Don’t forget to pay attention to
striations and cell-shape!

143
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:13,799
Let’s begin with this. Which type of tissue
is it?

144
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:17,649
The cells are striated. Each cell only has
one nucleus. But the giveaway here is probably

145
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:22,379
the cells’ branching structure; where their
offshoots meet with other nearby cells where

146
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:26,179
they form those intercalated discs. It's cardiac
muscle.

147
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:30,509
Or these -- they’re uninucleate cells, too,
and they also are packed together pretty closely

148
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:34,649
together. But…no striations. They’re smooth,
so this is smooth muscle.

149
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:38,950
Leaving us with an easy one -- long, and straight
cells with obvious striations AND multiple

150
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,160
nuclei. This could only be skeletal muscle
tissue.

151
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:45,100
If you got all of them right, congratulations
and give yourself a pat on your superior posterior

medial skeletal muscles -- you’re well on
your to understanding histology.

153
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:54,209
Today you learned that cells combine to form
our nervous, muscle, epithelial, and connective

154
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:59,399
tissues. We looked into how the history of
histology started with microscopes and stains,

155
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,750
and how our nervous tissue forms our nervous
system. You also learned how your skeletal,

156
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:09,299
smooth, and cardiac muscle tissue facilitates
all your movements, both voluntary and involuntary,

157
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:12,588
and how to identify each in a sample.
