1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,879
James was healthy professional, a father of
two. He had lots of friends, loved telling

2
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:06,679
jokes, and played softball on Sundays.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,929
Then one day, at the age of 45, he suffered
a stroke. He bounced back fairly quickly,

4
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:16,359
with one major exception: He was no longer
able to speak. The stroke damaged a specific

5
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:20,769
area in the left hemisphere of his brain called
Broca’s area, and left him with what’s

6
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:22,640
known as Broca’s aphasia.

7
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:27,318
Broca’s area is partly responsible for the
ability to produce and process language, and

8
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:31,818
Broca’s aphasia often leaves its sufferers
with some ability to understand speech, but

9
00:00:31,818 --> 00:00:34,199
an inability to produce intelligible words.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,359
James could understand his wife when she asked
if he wanted cereal for breakfast, but he

11
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:42,609
could only respond by repeating the word “too”
-- although he could still intonate as though

12
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,289
he were speaking a whole sentence.

13
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:48,689
Then, after some time and therapy, something
rather unexpected happened -- James regained

14
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:51,500
some ability to communicate through singing.

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,240
Broca’s aphasia can sometimes be treated
by teaching patients to sing, because singing

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,650
uses a different region of the brain -- one
that’s on the right side and that’s analogous

17
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:02,189
to Broca’s area on the left.

18
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:07,420
So after some practice, James could sing words,
and he eventually relearned how to talk by

19
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,799
teaching the right side of his brain to speak
rather than sing.

20
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,409
Whether it’s a stroke affecting your speech,
a tumor destroying your memory, a concussion

21
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:18,979
affecting your aggression, or that fateful iron
rod that shot straight through Phineas Gage’s

22
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:23,539
skull -- a lot of what we know about how the brain
works has come through studying injuries to it.

23
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,600
And what we’ve learned so far is that, even
though it looks like a 1.4-kilogram lump of

24
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:33,799
gray, congealed oatmeal, the brain is made up of
super-specific areas that have super-specific functions.

25
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,659
You might actually say the same thing about
your brain that’s sometimes said about politics:

26
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,239
Everything is local.

27
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,519
You’ll remember that our nervous system
is divided into two main networks that work

28
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:56,509
in harmony -- the central nervous system,
consisting of your amazing brain and spinal

29
00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:01,500
cord, and the peripheral nervous system, made up of
the nerves coming out of that central nervous system.

30
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,358
The central nervous system’s main game is
integrating the sensory information that the

31
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:09,740
peripheral system collects from all over the
body, and responding to it by coordinating

32
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,020
both conscious and unconscious activity.

33
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,280
The sun is bright, so I’ll shade my eyes;
I’m hungry, so I’m calling the pizza man;

34
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,210
the phone is ringing, maybe I’ll answer it.

35
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,800
All these sensations, thoughts, and directions
process through this two-part system.

36
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,300
It’s the brain, of course, that sorts out
all that sensory information and gives orders.

37
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,680
It also carries out your most complex functions,
like thinking, and feeling, and remembering.

38
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:34,250
Meanwhile, your spinal cord conducts two-way
signals between your brain and the rest of

39
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,919
your body, while also governing basic muscle
reflexes and patterns that don’t need your

40
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:42,539
brain’s blessing to work -- this is how
a chicken can still run around even if the

41
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:44,060
poor thing has been decapitated.

42
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,599
Both your spinal cord and brain are made of
fragile, jelly-like nervous tissue that is

43
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,650
extremely susceptible to injury.

44
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,080
So all that goo is well-protected by the bones
of your vertebrae and cranium, as well as

45
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,180
membrane layers, or meninges, before being bathed
in a cushy waterbed of clear cerebrospinal fluid.

46
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,960
This fluid actually allows your brain to float
somewhat in your skull, reducing its weight

47
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,849
and letting it slosh around while you and
your head are free to move.

48
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:12,799
But even with all that extra protection, your
brain is still vulnerable. And one thing James’s

49
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,170
story taught us is that its vulnerabilities
can be incredibly specific, because your brain

50
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:22,389
is divided into specialized regions that may, or may not,
interact with each other to produce a given action.

51
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:26,409
We can better understand this division of
labor by looking at how the brain first develops

52
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:28,189
into its main component parts.

53
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:33,240
Inside a developing embryo, the central nervous
system starts off as a humble little neural tube.

54
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,700
Soon the caudal, or lower, end of the tube
stretches out, forming the spinal cord, while

55
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:43,969
the cranial end begins to expand, divide,
and enlarge into three primary brain vesicles,

56
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:45,340
or interconnected chambers.

57
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,900
This is kind of your proto-brain.

58
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:51,930
We call these chambers the prosencephalon,
the mesencephalon, and the rhombencephalon

59
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,000
-- or forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,060
By an embryo’s fifth week of development,
these main three chambers start morphing into

61
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:04,728
five secondary vesicles that essentially form the roots
of what will become your grown-up brain structures.

62
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:09,179
The prosencephalon divides into two sections
-- the telencephalon and the diencephalon.

63
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,360
The rhombencephalon forms into another pair,
called the metencephalon and the myelencephalon.

64
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,400
And in between, the mesencephalon, thanks
to evolution, remains undivided.

65
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,779
The real action starts as these five secondary
vesicles start developing into the major adult

66
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:27,319
brain regions that you might be more familiar
with -- the brainstem, the cerebellum, the

67
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:31,680
diencephalon, also known as the interbrain,
and finally the cerebral hemispheres.

68
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:36,339
But, in order to go from a simple tube into
that classic, wrinkly icon we think of as

69
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:41,759
the “brain,” each of these five vesicles
grows in different ways. Basically, some develop

70
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,789
a lot more than others.

71
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:48,260
The least dramatic changes occur in the three
most caudal or lower sections: the mesencephalon,

72
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:50,839
the metencephalon, and the myelencephalon.

73
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:56,060
They go on to form the cerebellum, which mostly helps
coordinate muscular activity, and the brainstem,

74
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,480
which plays a vital role in relaying information
between the body and the higher regions of the brain.

75
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,699
The brainstem actually has three main components
-- and I know this is getting to be a lot

76
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:09,389
of vocabulary here -- you have the midbrain,
the pons, and the medulla oblongata. Together

77
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:13,908
they regulate many of the most basic, vital involuntary
functions, like keeping your heart on pace, keeping

78
00:05:13,908 --> 00:05:18,060
your lungs working, and controlling things like sleep,
and appetite, and pain sensitivity, and awareness.

79
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,620
But of the three brainstem parts, it’s your midbrain
that carries out the higher-level functions.

80
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,590
Like, when your eyes track a fast moving object,
or when you look behind you after hearing

81
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:31,759
some sudden loud sound, it’s the midbrain
that receives and processes that sensory information

82
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,230
and sends out the reflexive motor signals,
so you react without thinking.

83
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:39,830
The midbrain also passes that data to regions
like the cerebral cortex, which do the actual

84
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:43,889
conscious thinking about the stimuli, like
“What is that thing whizzing across the sky?”

85
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:45,900
or “WHAT JUST EXPLODED BEHIND ME?!”

86
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:49,859
So with the brainstem and cerebellum covering
your basic life and motor functions, you start

87
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,480
to see somewhat more complex tasks being carried
out in the next major brain structure, the diencephalon.

88
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,140
This is where you find the thalamus, hypothalamus,
epithalamus, and the mammillary bodies, which

89
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:05,000
regulate things like homeostasis, alertness,
and reproductive activity. Here we also find

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,819
part of the limbic system, which is a center
for strong emotions, like fear.

91
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:12,379
This area is sometimes called the “reptilian
brain” because we share it with some of

92
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:15,480
our less philosophical animal brethren like
lizards and fish.

93
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,290
I’m not putting these guys down, but by
our standards, they don’t think so much

94
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:23,430
as focus on the more instinctual pursuits
that are ruled by the caudal regions of the

95
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,840
brain -- eat, drink, sleep, mate, stay safe.

96
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:30,839
All those things are awesome. But it wasn’t
until the appearance of birds and mammals

97
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:35,899
that some animals’ brains came to be dominated
by the last of the five vesicles, the telencephalon.

98
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:40,589
During your brain’s growth, the telencephalon
undergoes the biggest changes of all, as it

99
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:45,679
develops into the most brainy part of your
brain -- the two classic, walnut-looking hemispheres

100
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,939
we collectively call the cerebrum, that cover the
rest of your brain like a mushroom cap on its stalk.

101
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:56,160
That’s the cerebrum -- not to be confused with
Cerebro, which is Professor X’s telepathy-enhancing

102
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,479
device -- and it is the largest region of the
brain and performs the highest functions.

103
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:05,110
It’s made up of the wrinkled, outer layer
of “gray matter” called the cerebral cortex,

104
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,830
and the inner squishy layer of “white matter”
beneath it.

105
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:12,479
And it’s the cerebrum that rules our voluntary
movements and our most advanced tricks, like thinking,

106
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,919
and learning, and regulating and recognizing emotions,
and experiencing consciousness in general.

107
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:21,959
You’ll remember that higher processing requires lots
of synapses, which require lots of nervous tissue. 

108
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:28,439
So as the cerebrum grew through evolutionary time,
it got more massive but our skull didn’t exactly keep up.

109
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,418
So in order to squeeze all that material into
your skull, the brain forms little creases,

110
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:37,358
called gyri, and larger grooves, or sulci, giving
it more folds than than an origami pineapple.

111
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,520
And although a big fissure separates the left
and right hemispheres, the two halves communicate,

112
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,668
through a series of myelinated axon fibers
called the corpus callosum.

113
00:07:45,668 --> 00:07:50,109
And each hemisphere has other, smaller fissures
that divide it into lobes -- each with a different

114
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,389
set of major functions.

115
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:55,650
The frontal lobe, for example, governs muscle
control and cognitive functions like planning

116
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:59,370
for the future, concentration, and preventing
socially unacceptable behaviors.

117
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,418
In most people, this area doesn’t finish
developing until after the teenage years,

118
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:07,930
which tells you a lot about the teenage years.
Since Broca’s area lives in this lobe in

119
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,959
the left hemisphere, it also is important
in language comprehension and speech.

120
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:15,299
If you’re enjoying a beautiful sunset, you
can thank your occipital lobe at the back

121
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,040
of your head for processing those bright visual
cues.

122
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,669
And the next time you step on a lego, you
can curse your parietal lobe, which processes

123
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,589
the sensations of touch, pain, and pressure.

124
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:30,228
Meanwhile the temporal lobe helps sort out
auditory information, including language.

125
00:08:30,228 --> 00:08:35,019
It contains Wernicke’s area -- another important
region of the brain associated with the production

126
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:37,019
of written and spoken language.

127
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:41,110
This part of the limbic system includes your
short-term memory keeper, the hippocampus,

128
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:45,399
and the emotional amygdala, which controls
sexual and social behavior. So, if you damage

129
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,559
the wrong part of your temporal lobe, you
may never again be able to remember what you

130
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:53,159
ate for lunch… or you might suddenly become
a total jerk who kicks kittens and cuts in line.

131
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:57,490
We could do a whole course on the finer-grained
functions and consequences of malfunction

132
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,100
in every bit of brain in your gourd,
but, well, we can’t do that today.

133
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,190
And you got to remember that, when it comes
to your body, no organ or system is an island.

134
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,740
Your brain would be pretty useless if it weren’t
hooked up to the outside world. That’s where

135
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:13,409
the peripheral nervous system comes in, which
we’ll be spending the next few lessons exploring.

136
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:17,299
Meanwhile, you learned today about the central
nervous system and how important location

137
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:21,250
is to brain function. We looked at how the
brain develops from an unassuming neural tube

138
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,179
into three primary vesicles, and then five
secondary vesicles, and finally into our complex

139
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:29,799
set of four adult structures and their basic
functions.
