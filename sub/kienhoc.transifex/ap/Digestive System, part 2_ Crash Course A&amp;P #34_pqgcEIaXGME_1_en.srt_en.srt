1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,780
In the summer of 1822, a French-Canadian fur-trapper
named Alexis St. Martin was going about his

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,480
business near Lake Michigan, when he was shot
by a hunter, right in the stomach.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,320
The wound was severe, and everyone expected
St. Martin to die that night.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,420
But…he didn’t.

5
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:20,009
A local army doctor named William Beaumont
kept him alive.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,150
In fact, Beaumont performed so many surgeries
on the injury over the next several months,

7
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:29,539
that he decided, somewhat questionably, to
just keep St. Martin’s stomach wound open.

8
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:34,179
St. Martin was left with a hole, or fistula,
in his abdominal wall, which allowed anyone

9
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:36,079
to see right into his stomach.

10
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,259
Now, it’s probably hard to work as a fur
trapper with a hole in your guts, but Beaumont

11
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:46,539
saw -- or possibly created -- an opportunity.
He hired St. Martin -- technically as a handyman,

12
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:48,420
but really as a guinea pig.

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,859
Over several years and some 238 experiments,
Beaumont recorded what St. Martin ate, and

14
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:55,759
what his stomach did to his meals.

15
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:00,140
Sometimes they just skipped the eating part
all together and just shoved some food, tied

16
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,268
to a string, right into the guy’s gut-hole.

17
00:01:03,268 --> 00:01:06,819
Beaumont took samples of gastric juices and
had them analyzed by chemists -- something

18
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:10,659
no one else had done before -- and he also
noticed that St. Martin’s digestion slowed

19
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:12,939
at certain times, like when he was sick or
stressed.

20
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:16,200
I mean, like, beyond the stress of having
a gaping hole in your abdomen.

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,040
Through his somewhat questionable research,
Beaumont discovered some major secrets of

22
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,420
the digestive system, like that the stomach’s
extremely strong acids and muscular contractions

23
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,970
break down food, and that some foods are more
digestible or less digestible than others,

24
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:31,409
and that the brain can affect the stomach.

25
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,590
Beaumont’s findings -- as well as his methods of clinical
observation -- revolutionized the field of physiology.

26
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:42,790
And St. Martin? Don’t worry about him. He
lived to be 83 years old, in great health.

27
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,240
And a hole in his guts...

28
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,939
Now, I sincerely hope that you can’t actually
see what’s going on in your stomach, but

29
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:50,879
lemme tell you, the story there is epic.

30
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,979
In your digestive system’s mission to disassemble
food into its tiniest, most basic molecular

31
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:00,920
forms, the stretch that runs from your mouth
to your stomach unleashes all of the mechanical

32
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:02,879
and chemical powers at its disposal.

33
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,539
It physically roughs up food; douses it in
protein-loving, acid-triggered enzymes; reduces

34
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:12,379
it all into a creamy paste -- and as a bonus,
because it likes you, it also kills a whole

35
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:17,199
host of harmful invaders that, for whatever reason,
found their way through your face and into your tube.

36
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,699
But your stomach’s not the end of the line
for your food.

37
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:21,299
Unless…it is.

38
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,520
I mean, most of the time, everything from
your mouth to your stomach prepares food to

39
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,550
be absorbed by your tissues. But sometimes...food
finds its way back up.

40
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,050
Yeah, in case the story of Alexis St. Martin
didn’t make you wanna do this already,

41
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,980
now I’m talking directly about vomiting.

42
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,240
Let’s begin with the beginning: with your
mouth, aka your oral, or buccal, cavity.

43
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,420
Now we don’t usually think of it this way,
but that is where digestion starts -- the

44
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:58,549
mechanical and chemical breakdown of food
through chewing and enzyme-action.

45
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:03,160
The inside of your mouth is lined with a tough,
thick layer of stratified squamous epithelium

46
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:07,240
that can stand up to lots of friction, like
getting scraped by tortilla chips and, like,

47
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,310
grilled cheese sandwiches that maybe were
cooked a little too much on the top.

48
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,879
Your anterior hard palate and the flexible posterior
soft palate form the roof of your mouth.

49
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:18,759
The hard palate provides, like, a hard surface
for the tongue to mash food against, while

50
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:23,859
the soft palate forms a movable fold of flesh
that reflexively closes off the nasopharynx

51
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,880
when you swallow, so food gets directed down
your esophagus and not up into your nasal cavity.

52
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,539
We all know what teeth are for, and you have
roughly 32 of them in your basic types that

53
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:35,579
help you masticate, or chew your food.

54
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,060
The tongue lives on the floor of your mouth,
and is basically just a big muscle that grips

55
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:42,840
and constantly repositions your food as you
chew.

56
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,259
The resulting ball of mush actually has its
own special name -- it’s a bolus -- and

57
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:50,759
the tongue rolls it back to the pharynx, in
preparation for swallowing.

58
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:54,049
But that’s just the physical action that
goes on in your mouth. Just as much destruction

59
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,060
is taking place through chemistry.

60
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,659
The bolus is broken down with the help of
three major pairs of salivary glands that

61
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:06,240
churn out an average of 1.5 liters of slightly
acidic saliva every day.

62
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,840
More than four soda cans worth of spit. Per
day.

63
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:14,299
And all that saliva delivers enzymes like
salivary amylase, a digestive enzyme that

64
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,590
breaks down starches into glucose monomers.

65
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:21,069
Now, once the food enters the pharynx, it’s
propelled by peristalsis into the esophagus,

66
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:24,849
which, except for the little sphincter at
the end that keeps food moving in the right

67
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,590
direction, is really just a glorified laundry
chute lined with smooth muscle.

68
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:32,169
The only time you probably even remember that
you have an esophagus is when something’s

69
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:36,689
stuck in there, or if you’re feeling intense
heartburn, or if you just puked.

70
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:38,410
But, moving on.

71
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:42,650
Assuming you have not puked yet, then the
bolus moves on to Dr. Beaumont’s ticket

72
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,039
to fame: The stomach.

73
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,439
The stomach is the stretchiest part of your
digestive tube, capable of holding 2 to 4

74
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:50,430
liters of material at any given time.

75
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,439
TWO TO FOUR LITERS! That’s a lot of nachos.
Mixed with spit.

76
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:57,550
But of course it’s much more than just a
storage tank -- it’s lined with the same

77
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:03,060
four main layers found through most of the
GI tract -- the mucosa, submucosa, muscularis

78
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,420
externa, and serosa -- but it’s got a few
special modifications.

79
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:10,319
For one thing, the muscularis includes an
additional layer of smooth muscle that gives

80
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:15,819
it extra strength, allowing the stomach not just to
hold materials, but to actively smush them around.

81
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:21,180
And the inner mucosa is made up almost entirely
of mucous cells, which produce a protective

82
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:25,209
coat that keeps the stomach tissues from getting
digested along with your lunch.

83
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:29,919
This inner lining is dotted with millions
of tiny, deep gastric pits which lead down

84
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,600
to tubular gastric glands. These glands, in
turn, contain various types of secretory cells

85
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,139
that brew up some of the most potent chemicals
in your body.

86
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:42,250
For example, your stomach has parietal cells
that release hydrochloric acid -- a substance

87
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,850
more acidic than battery acid -- which lays
waste to most of the bacteria, viruses, and

88
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,460
other stuff that could make you sick.

89
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:53,379
It also helps denature, or change the shape of, proteins
to make it easier for enzymes to digest them.

90
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:58,060
And maybe more importantly, when the hydrochloric
acid is combined with pepsinogen, an inactive

91
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,800
enzyme that’s secreted by another kind of
stomach cell called chief cells, the mixture

92
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,699
creates the protein-digesting enzyme pepsin.

93
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:11,019
Together, this super-powered acid and protein-hungry
enzyme can annihilate nearly anything they encounter.

94
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:15,349
This was apparently something that Beaumont
observed first-hand, by dropping hunks of

95
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:19,669
meat into a cup filled with St. Martin’s
personal gastric fluids.

96
00:06:19,668 --> 00:06:24,448
He watched the gobbits of food dissolve over
time, which is partly how he discovered the

97
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:27,800
stomach’s role in digestion was as much
chemical as mechanical.

98
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,949
But with so much mind-blowingly powerful stuff
at your stomach’s disposal, somebody down

99
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:37,209
there has to be in charge -- so your gastric
glands also contain enteroendocrine cells.

100
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:41,638
These cells release regulatory hormones, like
serotonin and histamine, which act locally

101
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,750
to trigger other cells, to, say, release more
acid, or contract muscle tissue. And when

102
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:52,379
the time comes to tamp the action down, they secrete
other hormones like somatostatin, to inhibit secretions.

103
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:56,620
And then there are G-cells, which produce
the most important hormone for stimulating

104
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,540
gastric activity: gastrin.

105
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,419
Most signals that increase stomach activity
get the job done by increasing the secretion

106
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:07,698
of gastrin, which then stimulates the release of other
gastric fluids, as well as stomach-muscle activity.

107
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:11,559
Now, if the smell of baking cookies has ever
made your mouth water and your belly grumble,

108
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,240
then it might not surprise you to learn that
these stomach secretions are ruled by neural

109
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,579
mechanisms as well hormonal ones.

110
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:22,198
In fact, stomach regulation occurs in three
phases, based on where the food is sensed

111
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,838
-- the brain, the stomach, and the small intestine.

112
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:29,799
The cephalic phase is the one ruled by your
brain, and it kicks in when you first see,

113
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,500
smell, taste, or even think about food.

114
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,660
That sensory input gets relayed to the hypothalamus,
which stimulates the medulla oblongata, which

115
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:41,500
then taps the parasympathetic fibers in the vagus nerve.
From there, the signals are sent to the stomach

116
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,379
with the word that, “Hey, we think that maybe cookies
are on the way, so you might want to prepare yourself.”

117
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:51,500
Now this is a conditioned reflex, so it only works
if you want to eat the food in question. If

118
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,899
I happen to be super-full, or not feeling
well, or somebody puts a pile of squid eyeballs

119
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:58,679
in front of me, the cephalic phase isn’t
gonna happen.

120
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,660
And no offense if squid eyeballs are totally
your thing, they’re just not my thing.

121
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,360
But say I eat the plate of squid eyeballs
anyway because, you know, I’m trying to

122
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,639
be polite. Well, even without the cephalic
warm up, when that food hits my stomach, local

123
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,490
mechanisms, both neural and hormonal jump
start the gastric phase.

124
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,300
For the next few hours, as my stomach grows
distended from the food, it activates stretch

125
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:24,960
receptors that again stimulate my medulla and get my
vagus nerves to tell my stomach to turn up the juice.

126
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,079
At the same time, the secretion of gastrin
is activated by other signals, like the rise

127
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:33,198
in alkalinity caused by the stomach acid getting
neutralized as it does its job.

128
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:36,858
Conversely, as stomach acidity increases,
it inhibits the release of gastrin.

129
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,300
Now, the third phase of gastric regulation
-- the intestinal phase -- speeds or slows

130
00:08:41,308 --> 00:08:44,860
the rate in which your stomach empties, so
that the small intestine doesn’t get too

131
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,639
overloaded with too much acid -- or with the
creamy paste that your stomach turns your

132
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,580
food into, known as chyme.

133
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,520
Now remember, not a lot of absorption actually
occurs in the stomach.

134
00:08:55,528 --> 00:08:59,929
The stomach is more like a decontamination
tank. Sure, it pummels your food down to a

135
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:04,679
paste, but it’s also where your body tries to
obliterate any nasties that could make you sick.

136
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,919
As long as food is still in there, your body
has a chance to kind of size it up, and feel

137
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:14,000
it out, and it reserves the right to eject
anything that it feels is potentially dangerous.

138
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,139
Lots of factors can trigger the stomach’s
urge to purge, or vomit, but the most common

139
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:24,028
are simply ingesting too much food, or eating
some kind of irritant or toxin, like those

140
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:28,860
produced by bad bacteria, too much alcohol,
certain drugs, or unappealing foods.

141
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,639
Of course if you’ve ever puked in a moment
of trauma or stress, you know how emotions

142
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,058
and anxiety can also trigger your stomach
to launch its lunch.

143
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:40,859
That’s the brain influencing the cephalic
phase of gastric regulation again, by sending

144
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,100
extra fight or flight signals to the stomach.

145
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,940
Beaumont noticed this mind-stomach connection
whenever St. Martin’s digestion was affected

146
00:09:46,948 --> 00:09:50,889
by illness or stress -- something you’d
think he’d have felt every time that doctor

147
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:53,209
came at him with some meat on a string.

148
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:56,388
If you were able to keep down your lunch down
today, you learned how mechanical and chemical

149
00:09:56,389 --> 00:10:00,799
digestion start in the mouth and continue
in the stomach, where food is pummeled by acids

150
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,299
and enzymes and turned into chyme. We also
looked at the stomach’s cephalic, gastric,
