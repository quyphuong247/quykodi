Do you believe the suspect&#39;s confession? Surely we can trust a confession. Why would anyone

1
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:27,410
confess to a crime that they did not commit? It might seem nonsensical. Well, this view

2
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,849
is actually shared by some investigators:

3
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:36,120
There is a principle in interrogation. A person will not admit to something they haven&#39;t done,

4
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,260
short of tortured or extreme duress. No matter how long you are grilled, no matter how much

5
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,580
you are yelled at, you are not going to admit to something you have not done.

6
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,900
However, one of the problems is in the pressure of the interview. Suspects may misinterpret

7
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,729
what they are being asked.

8
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:57,159
So far, in an earlier video, you&#39;ve heard about the cognitive interview, which can be

9
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:02,220
used to interview cooperative witnesses. The goal of the cognitive interview is to collect

10
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,580
as much accurate information about events as possible.

11
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,460
If however, police believe that the person being interviewed may be responsible for the

12
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:14,470
crime, then the goal of the interview may well change. The goal may then become to get

13
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:19,460
a confession from the suspect. And there is good reason for this.

14
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,860
Confessions are very convincing when a case goes to trial. In fact, confessions are actually

15
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,670
probably the most convincing piece of evidence that the prosecution can present against a

16
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,290
defendant.

17
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:37,290
Kassin and Neumann in 1997 found that the presence of a confession resulted in a 73%

18
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:42,770
conviction rate in a fictional trial involving mock jurors. In comparison, an eyewitness&#39;

19
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:48,430
identification of the suspect resulted in a 59% conviction rate.

20
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,810
And somewhat worryingly, confessions appear to be pretty convincing, even when we probably

21
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:58,750
should not trust them. Kassin and Sukel in 1997 found that a confession elicited through low

22
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,970
pressure on the suspect - that is when the suspect testified that they felt under stress but

23
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:09,229
suffered no physical discomfort, verbal abuse or threat - resulted in a 63% conviction rate.

24
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,629
While, a confession elicited through high pressure techniques, this is where the suspect

25
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:18,190
testified that they’d been made physically uncomfortable by the detective, the detective

26
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,290
had flaunted their weapon in a threatening manner, and the suspect said that they felt

27
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:28,400
under pressure to confess, now this still resulted in a 50% conviction rate. This compared to

28
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,580
a conviction rate of 19% when there was no confession at all.

29
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,880
So how often do confessions occur, and how often are these false confessions? Well these

30
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:43,709
are very tricky questions to answer. Moston and colleagues in 1992 estimated that between

31
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:48,330
39% and 48% of suspects make full confessions.

32
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,990
But what is the rate of false confessions? This is a difficult statistic to know reliably,

33
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:59,940
for a whole range of issues. One piece of evidence suggests that up to 25% of cases

34
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:06,200
in the innocence project involved a false confession (Garrett, 2008). Bedau and Radelets

35
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:12,700
(1987) study of wrongful convictions in capital and potentially capital cases in the US from

36
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:19,430
1900-1987 found that false confessions played a role in 49 of the 350 miscarriages of justice

37
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,830
that they had documented in these cases.

38
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:28,410
Leo and Drizin in 2010 summarise across a number of studies and noted that the percentages

39
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,930
of miscarriages of justice involving false confessions in these analyses range from 14

40
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,330
to 60%.

41
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,980
So these studies show that the problem of false confessions remain a key cause of the

42
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,980
wrongful conviction of innocent people. And this is pretty concerning.

43
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,660
Research suggests that part of the problem is that most people assume that someone would

44
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,140
never confess to a crime they didn&#39;t commit, partly because people don&#39;t really understand

45
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,950
the dispositional and situational factors that lead to false confessions.

46
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,280
So who would falsely confess and why would they do it?

47
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,489
Well some people are more vulnerable to false confessions than others, due to individual

48
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:10,670
difference characteristics that these people have. For example some people are generally

49
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:15,410
more prone to compliance and suggestibility than others, other people are highly anxious,

50
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:20,039
fearful, depressed, delusional, or otherwise psychologically disordered and this makes

51
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:24,840
them vulnerable. And for some, their age, specifically being young, makes them vulnerable

52
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,569
too.

53
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:31,620
Gudjonsson in 2003 presented an interactive model of the process through which false confessions

54
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,729
occur in which the vulnerability factors, such as the ones I just talked about, were

55
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:37,449
actually involved.

56
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:41,909
The other contributing factors to this dynamic and social process outlined by Gudjonsson

57
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:47,129
were contextual factors. These are the nature and seriousness of the crime being investigated,

58
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:52,129
the strength of the police evidence, and the pressure on the police to solve the crime.

59
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:57,759
And also custodial factors, such as the length and nature of the detention and interrogation.

60
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,979
But Gudjonsson also noted some support or protective factors that can actually help

61
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:07,009
guard against false confessions, and these include the presence of a lawyer or independent

62
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:12,180
person for vulnerable suspects while the interview or interrogation is taking place.

63
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:18,139
Now it’s fair to say that these factors can combine to sometimes result in false confessions

64
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:25,139
to crime. Kassin and Wrightsman in 1985 differentiated between three different psychological types

65
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,900
of false confessions that occur as a function of different sources of pressure.

66
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,319
The first are voluntary false confessions, which are confessions given without any pressure.

67
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,279
Here the pressure or the motivation if you like to make a false confession is internal

68
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:47,020
to the person themselves and reflect a vulnerability inherent in that person.

69
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:52,330
Case examples of these types of confessions provided by Gudjonsson (2003) show a strong

70
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:57,849
association with psychopathology. These types of false confessions may occur, for example,

71
00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:01,999
because an individual has simply confused what is fact and what is fantasy.

72
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:07,610
The second type of false confession are coerced compliant false confessions. These are confessions

73
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:12,430
made due to custodial pressures. So, for example, people make these types of confessions to

74
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:19,430
escape or avoid an aversive interrogation or to gain some kind of promised reward.

75
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,349
Consistent with a general tendency for immediate or proximal factors to influence behaviour

76
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:28,469
more strongly than delayed or distal factors, a person comes to see the short term benefits

77
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:32,860
of confessing as outweighing those long term costs of being prosecuted and potentially

78
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,659
incarcerated for the crime.

79
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:40,339
Recent experimental research by Madon and colleagues in 2013, showed that this tendency

80
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:44,860
to overweight short-term contingencies in an interrogation context was stronger in a

81
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,460
lengthy interview than a shorter one or amongst those who simply expected a longer interview

82
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:54,279
versus a shorter one and was more present in interrogations about less serious crimes

83
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:57,879
and unethical behaviours than in interviews about more serious crimes and unethical

84
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,699
behaviours.

85
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:04,419
However with this type of false confession fundamentally the person knows that they have

86
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:11,419
not committed the crime. They simply confess to doing the crime to escape the aversive situation.

87
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:17,659
The final type of false confession is the coerced internalised false confession where

88
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:22,749
the innocent person comes to believe that they have committed the crime as a result of the

89
00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:27,460
interview or interrogation. In this case, the person&#39;s memory for the event may be changed

90
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,659
permanently or they may be led to believe that they have blocked out the memory of committing

91
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,889
the crime.

92
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:37,639
Well at this stage you may be finding all this to be a bit far-fetched. And you may

93
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,580
believe, as many do, that people who are not inherently vulnerable would never falsely

94
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,740
confess to a crime.

95
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:49,499
One of the most famous demonstrations of false confessions was in a study conducted by Kassin

96
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:56,249
and Kiechel that was published in 1996. They were interested in testing the idea that presenting

97
00:07:56,249 --> 00:08:01,619
false evidence to a person who is vulnerable due to a heightened state of uncertainty might

98
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:06,830
result in a confession, and that this person may well internalise and confabulate their

99
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,729
memory for the event.

100
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:13,110
So in their study, they had undergraduate students take part in a study. The students

101
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,080
were told that it was actually going to be about reaction times.

102
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,899
In each session there were 2 apparent participants, but in reality one apparent participant was

103
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:24,429
actually a confederate of the experimenter - someone who was working with the experimenter.

104
00:08:24,429 --> 00:08:28,759
The participant and confederate were asked to engage in a computer based reaction time

105
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,580
task.

106
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,560
In the main task the confederate was told to read aloud a list of letters and the participant

107
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:40,219
was to type these letters into a keyboard. After 3 minutes had passed they were told

108
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:43,159
that they would swap roles.

109
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:47,690
Now before the session began, participants were instructed on the proper use of the computer.

110
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:52,770
They were warned not to press the &quot;ALT&quot; key positioned near the space bar because pressing

111
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,560
this key would cause the program to crash and data to be lost.

112
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,400
So in this study at about 60 seconds into the task, the computer ceased to function

113
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,820
and the experimenter accused the participant of having pressed the forbidden ALT key.

114
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,870
Now all participants initially denied the charge at which point the experimenter touched

115
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:17,750
the keyboard and confirmed that the data had been lost. They then specifically asked the

116
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,080
participant, &quot;Did you hit the ALT key?&quot;

117
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,300
In this study the vulnerability of the participant was varied by manipulating the participant’s

118
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,580
subjective sense of certainty of their own innocence. And this was done by varying the pace at which

119
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,620
the letters were read out to the participant.

120
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,990
They either had keep up with the pace of a slow and relaxed metronome, where letters

121
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:42,210
had to be typed in at the pace of 43 letters per minute. Or with the pace of a fast and

122
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:47,480
furious metronome, where letters had to be typed in at the pace of 67 letters per minute.

123
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,400
The experimenter also varied the use of false incriminating evidence. So after the participant

124
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,270
initially denied the charge, the experimenter turned to the confederate and said “Did

125
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,490
you see anything?”.

126
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,400
In the false witness conditions, the confederate admitted that they had seen the participant

127
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,380
hit the ALT key that actually terminated the program. In the no witness condition, the

128
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,760
same confederate simply said that they had not seen what had happened.

129
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,760
Now there were three key dependent measures. The first assessed compliance. Here the experimenter

130
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,880
handwrote a standardised confession which read:

131
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,120
&quot;I hit the ALT key and caused the program to crash. Data were lost.&quot;

132
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,200
They asked the participant to sign it, with the promised consequence of a phone call from

133
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,900
the principal investigator. If the participant initially refused this request, it was repeated

134
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,940
a second time.

135
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:43,960
To assess the second dependent measure, internalisation, the experimenters unobtrusively recorded the

136
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:49,590
way that participants privately described what had happened. So as the experimenter and

137
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,310
participant left the lab they were met in a reception area by a waiting participant

138
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,820
- who in fact was a second confederate who had heard the commotion.

139
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,270
The experimenter explained that the session, with this new alleged participant, would actually

140
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:08,120
need to be rescheduled and then left the area to retrieve their appointment calendar. At

141
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,910
this point the second confederate turned to the real participant and said ‘What happened?&#39;

142
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:19,420
The participants reply was coded for whether or not he or she had unambiguously internalised

143
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,700
guilt for what happened. So they said something like &quot;I hit the wrong button and ruined the

144
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,560
whole program”. And all of these responses were then coded by 2 raters who were actually

145
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,210
blind to experimental conditions.

146
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:36,300
Finally, after the session appeared to be over, the experimenter reappeared and brought

147
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,840
the participant back into the lab. And they read out the list of letters that they had

148
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,860
typed and asked if they could reconstruct how or when they’d hit the ALT key.

149
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,610
Now this procedure was designed to provide for evidence of confabulation - the 3rd dependent

150
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:56,060
measure. Here they were trying to see if participants could &#39;recall&#39; specific details to fit the

151
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:01,030
allegation. So they said “Yes, here, I hit it with the side of my hand right after you

152
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,150
called out the A.”

153
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:08,250
After the experiment had truly finished, the participants were all fully and carefully

154
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,230
debriefed about the true aim of the study.

155
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:19,230
So what did the results show? Well, overall 69% of the 75 participants signed the confession,

156
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:28,810
28% exhibited internalisation and 9% confabulated details to support their false beliefs.

157
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:35,120
These rates varied, however, as a function of the independent variables. All the participants

158
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:42,120
in the fast paced condition, with a witness present, signed a confession, 65% of them internalised

159
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:49,760
their guilt and 35% confabulated details about their false belief.

160
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:56,350
In contrast in the slow paced, no witness condition, only 35% complied with the request

161
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:03,350
to sign a confession - but still 35%. And no one in this condition internalised or confabulated.

162
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,240
The analyses indicated that the presence of a witness alone was sufficient to significantly

163
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,050
increase the rates of compliant and internalised confessions even in the low vulnerability

164
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,940
condition.

165
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,690
Now although this type of experiment has been immensely useful in identifying the causes

166
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,650
of false confessions, there are some fairly obvious issues with this paradigm which were

167
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:28,850
identified by Hasel and Kassin in 2012.

168
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,880
The first is that the behaviour that is the focus of the confession is more of an alleged

169
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,550
accident rather than a wilful illegal action. Participants in this study may have actually

170
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:42,010
been unsure whether they had committed the &#39;crime&#39; whereas most people accused of a crime

171
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:45,740
are convinced of their innocence or otherwise.

172
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,560
The other problem is that by design, all of the participants in this study were actually

173
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,410
innocent, and so you cannot compare the actual rate of false confessions with the rate of

174
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,190
true confessions.

175
00:13:55,190 --> 00:14:00,190
Russano and colleagues in 2005 developed an alternative way of looking at confessions

176
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:05,420
to get around these issues. In their paradigm, participants work on a problem solving activity

177
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,990
while paired with a confederate, which was someone who was actually working with the

178
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,100
experimenter.

179
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,870
In this paradigm, this confederate gives the participants some assistance with the problems,

180
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:20,160
when the experimenter had explicitly said that no help was allowed. A confession

181
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,650
was sought when the experimenter looked at the participants&#39; answers to the problems

182
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:28,680
and confronted participants with the allegation that they had actually cheated.

183
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,940
Now, this line of research showed that two commonly used interviewing or interrogation techniques

184
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:38,180
actually increased the rate of false confessions more than the rate of true confessions.

185
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:42,980
And these two techniques were first, a pragmatic implication of leniency through minimisation

186
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:48,300
tactics - that is where the investigator attempts to lessen the seriousness of the offence by

187
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,779
making statements that express sympathy and concern, or that offer face saving excuses

188
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:58,440
for their offence actions and by suggesting it was actually in the participant&#39;s interests to confess.

189
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,630
The second was an explicit offer of leniency via a &#39;deal’.

190
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:05,300
And so as I said, these actually increased the rate of false confessions

191
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:10,110
more than the rate of true confessions. This suggests that using those techniques actually

192
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,660
makes the eventual confession less accurate as a way of solving a crime.

193
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,250
So this brings us to consider the ways in which suspects are interviewed as these seem

194
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,430
to be important for the reliability of any confession that is made.
