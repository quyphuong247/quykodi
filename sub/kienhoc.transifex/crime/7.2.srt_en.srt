So, we&#39;ve just heard the judge summing up and instructing the jurors about how they

1
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,630
are to decide whether the defendant in this case is guilty beyond reasonable doubt.

2
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,820
The judge gave the jurors instructions about the standard of proof required for a verdict

3
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,500
and instructions about who has the burden of proof in proving the defendant&#39;s guilt.

4
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,570
These instructions are supposed to help the jury reach the correct verdict.

5
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:44,360
Now here is the full version of these instructions as used in some jurisdictions in Australia.

6
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,699
Onus of proof: As this is a criminal trial the burden or

7
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:54,970
obligation of proof of the guilt of the accused is placed squarely on the Crown. That burden

8
00:00:54,970 --> 00:01:00,890
rests upon the Crown in respect of every element or essential fact that makes up the offence

9
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:06,510
with which the accused has been charged. That burden never shifts to the accused. There

10
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:12,650
is no obligation whatsoever on the accused to prove any fact or issue that is in dispute

11
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:18,600
before you. It is of course not for the accused to prove his or her innocence but for the

12
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,960
Crown to establish his/her guilt.

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,280
A critical part of the criminal justice system is the presumption of innocence. What it means

14
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,420
is that a person charged with a criminal offence is presumed to be innocent unless and until

15
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:39,350
the Crown persuades a jury that the person is guilty beyond reasonable doubt.

16
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,930
Standard of proof: The Crown must prove the accused’s guilt

17
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:49,560
beyond reasonable doubt. That is the high standard of proof that the Crown must achieve

18
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,149
before you can convict the accused. At the end of your consideration of the evidence

19
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:59,759
in the trial and the submissions made to you by the parties you must ask yourself whether

20
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,499
the Crown has established the accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. In other words,

21
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:12,160
you should ask yourself, ‘Is there any reasonable possibility that the accused is not guilty?’

22
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,810
However, the Crown does not have the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt every single

23
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,800
fact that arises from the evidence and is in dispute. The obligation that rests upon

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,360
the Crown is to prove the elements of the charge; that is the essential facts that go

25
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,220
to make up the charge, and must prove those facts beyond reasonable doubt. I shall shortly

26
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,470
outline for you what are the elements of the charge, or the essential facts, that the Crown

27
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:42,730
must prove beyond reasonable doubt.

28
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:48,470
In a criminal trial there is only one ultimate issue that a jury has to decide. Has the Crown

29
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:54,130
proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt? If the answer is ‘yes’, the appropriate

30
00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:01,100
verdict is ‘guilty’. If the answer is ‘no’, the verdict must be ‘not guilty’.

31
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,320
