Well this is the end of Crime 101x: The Psychology of Criminal Justice.

1
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,720
We hope you have enjoyed the course as much as we have putting it all altogether.

2
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,680
It allowed us to indulge our amateur dramatic skills - and I use the term very

3
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,600
loosely - as well as, I hope, convey to you our passion for this subject.

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,579
This is subject matter that we have collectively taught for over a decade and I think it is

5
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:41,579
fair to say that we, of course, think this covers by far the most interesting aspects

6
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,930
of psychology that there are!

7
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,510
In all seriousness, what we hope that we have achieved with this course is to give you a

8
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,320
taster of psychology and law.

9
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,019
In taking you through a case from start to finish, from the point where a crime was committed

10
00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:59,199
to the point where the verdict was handed down, we have seen the many and varied ways

11
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,049
that psychology can interact with the law and legal systems.

12
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:07,210
We have looked at offender profiling, the issues around eyewitness memory and what can

13
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,189
be done to improve recall, the complexities of face recognition and how tricky it can

14
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:17,470
be to conduct identification procedures that are not in some way or other biased.

15
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:21,470
Now once we had our suspect we spent spent some time considering interrogations and interviewing

16
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:26,469
techniques, and the accuracy of nonverbal ways of detecting deception.

17
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:31,619
We then thought about who should be the decision makers in such a case: judge or jury, and

18
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,170
what extra-legal factors may influence them as a case goes to trial.

19
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,749
Once the case was heard we considered how this group of people may go about making

20
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:43,569
a decision as to the guilt or otherwise of the defendant.

21
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:49,200
We explored how such factors as decision rule and size of jury might impact on these processes.

22
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,709
And then when the verdict was handed down, we examined whether the verdict was right

23
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:57,689
or, more accurately, whether we can actually ever know. We touched on false convictions

24
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,990
and public perceptions of sentencing.

25
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,579
But this course was just a taster of the breadth and depth of psychology and law.

26
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:08,729
There are many, many other aspects we could have talked about. For example we could have

27
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,900
considered how the offender ended up offending - what factors led to this action?

28
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,150
We could have looked at the effect of punishment on the offender.

29
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,240
What would be the effect on him as a person and would it impact on his subsequent behaviour?

30
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,010
Would the punishment make him better, so that he didnâ€™t reoffend again?

31
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:30,230
And, more complexly, how can we calculate whether a person is at risk of reoffending?

32
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,820
In terms of depth of content, each topic that we have spoken about is worthy of a course

33
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,980
in its own right. There is just so much to say about each of those topics, but as this

34
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,380
course was just an introduction to the area, we had to stop somewhere.

35
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,410
So if any of the topics that we have spoken about particularly interest you then we encourage

36
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,390
you to go and find out more.

37
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,780
There are many courses available worldwide offered through other education institutions,

38
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,340
either face to face or online.

39
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,390
There are also many good books that you can start with and we have provided a list of

40
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,740
these as a starting point.

41
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,410
But even if you don&#39;t want to read or study further you can still contribute to the criminal

42
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,060
justice system.

43
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,260
If you are a practitioner in this system or if you are fortunate to serve as a juror we

44
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,430
hope that this course has encouraged you to think more critically about your input into

45
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,470
the criminal justice system.

46
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,170
Congratulations on finishing Crime101x!
