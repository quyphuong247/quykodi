Today, we&#39;re going to be talking about how jurors make decisions. As we’ve said before,

1
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,180
the juror&#39;s role is to decide the facts of the case. The judge decides the matters of

2
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,750
law. Now in jurisdictions that have no lay persons acting as jurors, the judge will decide

3
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,340
both the facts of the case and the matters of law.

4
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,180
In an earlier presentation, we learned that jurors and judges are affected by largely

5
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,770
the same factors when making their decisions. So in this video when we talk about how jurors

6
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,720
make decisions, we are really just talking about how deciders of fact make their decisions.

7
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,790
So how does the law see the jurors&#39; role? Let&#39;s look at the jurors&#39; handbook from Queensland

8
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,910
in Australia. This is pretty typical statement of the jurors&#39; role:

9
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:03,000
Their (the jurors’) role is to make the most important decision in any court case:

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,050
whether or not the accused is guilty as charged (or, in civil cases, who is at fault). They

11
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:15,000
bring to the task a wealth of experience, common sense and insight.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,720
So as we said, they have to decide the facts of the case based on the evidence presented

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,000
at trial, and to do that they bring their life experience and common sense.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,400
In psychology, there is a lot of research looking at how people use their life experience

15
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,950
and common sense to make decisions. We generally call these things schemas, stereotypes, and

16
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:32,760
heuristics.

17
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,990
A stereotype is pretty much a mental representation of information about a social category, and

18
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,340
can include information about whether we feel positively or negatively about people from

19
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:47,670
that category, and also information about what people from that category are like, so

20
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,850
their attributes, and the sorts of behaviours they perform and the roles that they occupy.

21
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:57,900
A stereotype is a specific example of what we call a schema. A schema can apply to a

22
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,259
range of other types of things as well.

23
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,299
Heuristics are quick decision rules or short cuts that we learn from our experiences.

24
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:09,649
We will be talking about how some of these things may influence jurors&#39; decisions.

25
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:13,480
It is important when we are talking about this research, however, to understand that

26
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,510
we are not trying to make a case that jurors are not up to doing the job, despite what

27
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,690
some people might think about jurors.

28
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:25,299
A better instrument could scarcely be imagined for achieving uncertainty, capriciousness,

29
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:30,359
lack of uniformity, disregard of former decisions – utter unpredictability.

30
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:34,730
Instead, the point we are making is that jurors are just people, and that all of us

31
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,519
are affected by schemas, stereotypes and heuristics. The reason why it is important to study these

32
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,340
things in the context of jury decision-making is not to specifically criticise jurors, but

33
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,799
to understand how these normal aspects of social-cognitive functioning affect jurors

34
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:50,290
in their role.

35
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,760
We want to know what factors exacerbate the effect of these things, and what factors inhibit

36
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,370
them. When are they specifically problematic, and when are they not so problematic?

37
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,040
Once we know these things, we may well be able to provide the support to jurors and

38
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,320
structure their task in such a way as to limit any adverse effect on their decisions. So

39
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,139
you can perhaps think about it this way: the research helps us to identify possible problems

40
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:18,500
with how jurors are asked to perform their job, not problems with individual jurors.

41
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,400
It is also worth noting that the single biggest influence on jurors&#39; decisions is the strength

42
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,799
of the evidence against the defendant. So generally jurors do do a reasonable job,

43
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:31,820
but there are ways that they could be better supported because research shows that factors

44
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,440
beyond just the evidence affect their decisions.

45
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,480
So how do jurors make their decisions?

46
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,669
One of the main models that describes how jurors make their decisions is called the

47
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:47,790
cognitive story model. This model was proposed originally by Pennington and Hastie.

48
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,260
According to the story model, jurors construct narrative stories during the trial to organise

49
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,310
and interpret the evidence. Jurors then evaluate and interpret all subsequent evidence, as

50
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,549
it is presented, in line with that story.

51
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:04,639
Jurors&#39; schemas and stereotypes are useful in forming the story, especially for understanding

52
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,699
missing aspects of the story. These schemas and stereotypes provide templates for what

53
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:13,430
certain types of people and events are like.

54
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,269
Schemas and stereotypes, as we said, are based on our prior knowledge of these events — they&#39;re

55
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:21,030
like our theories for what things are like. They are generally functional, and using

56
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,870
them is normal, because they help us deal with a large amount of information in our

57
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,229
day to day lives.

58
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:32,040
However, because they can sometimes be inaccurate, they can lead to less than optimal outcomes.

59
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,120
The construction of the story is a two-way process and the media may influence the story

60
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,800
that jurors construct through pre-trial publicity.

61
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,900
There&#39;s another set of models that are commonly used to understand juror decision making.

62
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,210
These are the elaboration likelihood model and heuristic systematic

63
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,000
model. These are both known as what we call dual

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,139
process models. This means they describe two ways in which things happen. The models were

65
00:04:56,139 --> 00:05:00,150
originally developed to understand persuasion and attitude change, but they have been adapted

66
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,750
to the jury context, because it is possible to think about a jury trial as a series of

67
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,009
persuasive messages.

68
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:10,919
Now while there are some fine distinctions between these two models, they generally make

69
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:14,840
the same predictions, so for our purposes we will focus on the Elaboration Likelihood

70
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,990
Model.

71
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,680
This model describes two distinct modes or routes to persuasion - the central and peripheral

72
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,389
routes. Each of these involves different amounts of thinking. The central route involves more

73
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:30,889
effortful thinking, and the peripheral route involves less thinking.

74
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:34,740
We refer to the amount of thinking in terms of how much you elaborate about a persuasive

75
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,590
message. Elaboration is measured by looking at the number of positive and negative thoughts

76
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:44,020
you have about a message. So basically, if you can generate a lot of pros and cons when

77
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:49,710
given a persuasive message, we would say you are showing a high degree of elaboration.

78
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:54,979
For the central route, the amount of favourable elaboration about the message influences persuasion.

79
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:59,639
The more that you can think of benefits compared to costs, the more you will be persuaded.

80
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,750
For the peripheral route, the strength of the message content is less important. You

81
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,379
are more persuaded if the message is associated with other things that are positively evaluated.

82
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:12,669
For example, if you have a positive stereotype about the type of person giving you the message,

83
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:15,909
you will be more persuaded by the message.

84
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,370
So when do we use each route?

85
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,199
We use a central route when an issue is important to us, when we have the time and the cognitive

86
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,919
capacity to think about the issue.

87
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:29,930
We tend to use the peripheral route when there is limited time to think about the message,

88
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:34,289
when we are distracted, when the issue is not so important, and also, funnily enough,

89
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:35,669
when we are in a good mood.

90
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:39,449
One of the assumptions underlying all of these models of jury decision-making is that perceivers

91
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:44,009
like to put in the minimum amount of cognitive effort possible. This has lead to some people

92
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:47,879
referring to perceivers as &quot;cognitive misers&quot; or &quot;mental sluggards&quot;.

93
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,280
There is an alternative perspective on what this research means, however. We, and some

94
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:57,659
others, think that we use stereotypes strategically to maximise the amount of information that

95
00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:03,099
can be stored in our brains under taxing conditions. Stereotypes help us encode some of the information

96
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:05,990
so that we can then turn our attention to other parts of the information.

97
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,770
There is actually some evidence that perceivers try to engage in as much thinking about unexpected,

98
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:16,330
or stereotype inconsistent, information as possible. For example Stern and colleagues

99
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:22,120
in 1984 found that participants spent more time reading and thinking about stereotype-inconsistent

100
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,580
behaviours, and consequently recalled a greater number of these behaviours than stereotype-consistent

101
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,870
behaviours.

102
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,699
Macrae and colleagues found that when perceivers made use of stereotypes when encoding information,

103
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:38,400
those perceivers were then able to allocate more of their thinking capacity to other cognitive

104
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,150
tasks.

105
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:45,110
Findings such as these have been interpreted in terms of a strategy to maximise or optimise

106
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:50,189
the amount of information encoded by perceivers. Our cognitive resources can be conserved by

107
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:55,960
encoding stereotype-congruent targets relatively effortlessly in terms of the relevant stereotype,

108
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,789
allowing more effortful thinking to be used in relation to stereotype-incongruent targets.

109
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:05,420
Okay, so we&#39;ve seen that sometimes jurors are influenced by the quality of the message,

110
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,059
or the evidence if we are talking about a trial. And sometimes they might be influenced

111
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:12,629
by some things that are independent of the quality of the message.

112
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:17,009
Now obviously we would want to maximise the influence of the quality of the message, and

113
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:21,229
minimise the influence of those things not related to the quality of the message.

114
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:25,309
So in the next presentation we will talk about those factors that are independent of the

115
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:28,410
quality of the message, so that we can understand what they might be.
