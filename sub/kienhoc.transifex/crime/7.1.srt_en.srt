00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:09,400
But, the angle of the wounds on the arm suggested that she only raised her arm as she was being attacked.

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,840
The defendant looked at me. He made me feel like…prey.

3
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,020
That man hurt me, and then he went and killed

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,020
someone, and you are helping him.

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,279
Order!

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,280
Your job as jurors is to do your duty to find justice for Janine Jenker.

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,340
 I ask that you find Neil Fox guilty of her murder.

8
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,960
It’s time now to put an end to this bungled

9
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:45,400
investigation and prosecution. It’s time for the police to find out who really did

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,240
commit this crime. It’s time for you to find my client not guilty.

11
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,440
Judge Theodore Bromich: The defendant is charged with the murder of Ms Janine Jenker on the 20th March 2012.

12
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:11,830
Before he can be found guilty of that charge, you need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt

13
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,960
of three things: (1) that Janine Jenker is dead;

14
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,580
(2) that the defendant killed her; that is he caused her death;

15
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,480
and (3) that the defendant did so intending

16
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:38,490
to cause her death, or at least to merely cause her grievous bodily harm.

17
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:46,639
I remind you that the burden rests on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the defendant.

18
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:54,900
There is no burden on a defendant to establish any fact, let alone his innocence.

19
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:04,100
The defendant is presumed to be innocent. He may be convicted only if the prosecution establishes that he

20
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,749
is guilty of the offence charged. For the prosecution to discharge its burden

21
00:02:10,749 --> 00:02:17,639
of proving the guilt of the defendant, it is required to prove beyond reasonable doubt

22
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:25,839
that he is guilty. This means that in order to convict you must be satisfied beyond reasonable

23
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:34,360
doubt of every element that goes to make up the offence charged. It is for you to decide

24
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:40,599
whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prosecution has proved the

25
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:49,099
elements of the offence. If you are left with a reasonable doubt about guilt, your duty

26
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:56,099
is to find the defendant not guilty. If you are not left with any such doubt,

27
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:04,520
your duty is to convict. In respect of the charge you must reach a

28
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:11,549
unanimous verdict: that is, a verdict on which you all agree,

29
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:14,949
whether guilty or not guilty.

30
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:21,749
You may now retire to consider your verdict.

31
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,120
Henry: I should like to take this opportunity to nominate myself as jury foreman. Now the only reason I…

32
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,389
Merilyn: Sorry, now hang on for a sec. Why don’t we have an election?

33
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:35,089
Henry: May I just finish please?

34
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,189
Merilyn: Well no. You’ve nominated yourself…

35
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:39,489
Merilyn: Well no let&#39;s see if someone else wants to nominate (Other jurors mumble agreement)

36
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:41,229
Frank: I think she has a point. I think…Henry: I&#39;m just making a suggestion

37
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,380
Henry: okay? We haven’t even started.

38
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,340
Merilyn: Yeah but how about inviting - a woman for instance to nominate? Henry: right, well um...

39
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,620
Henry: Okay well nominate yourself!

40
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,220
Merilyn: Okay I will. I’ll nominate myself.

41
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,460
Henry: Good. Shall we take a vote? (Other jurors mumble agreement) Henry: Who’d like me or who’d like bucket mouth over here?

42
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,060
Merilyn: No, excuse me!

43
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:57,439
Henry: Who would like to vote me? Good, well we’ve done that, haven’t we.

44
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,199
Henry: Great! Righto, done and dusted. Alright, let’s kick things off straight away, and we’ll

45
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,260
work around the table if you like. As far as I’m concerned there’s not a snowball

46
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,769
in hell&#39;s chance that this guy did it. For goodness sake…Hang on…

47
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:10,069
Merilyn: Oh come on…come on.

48
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:12,069
Henry: Okay, we have a guy who walks down an alley.

49
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:18,460
Just happens to be waiting outside the back door of a gym. Alright? In his shirt and tie and

50
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,660
slacks and nice shoes, and he has a knife in his pocket and then stabs this woman to

51
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:29,850
death. But then we also have another guy on top of a walkway, who’s looking over the

52
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:35,180
side and the moment someone looks at him, he runs away. And that guy’s got form.

53
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:40,610
Merilyn: Yeah, but how do you think real estate agents make their money? They take the opportunity, they seize the moment.

54
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,610
Henry: I think the guy’s not guilty. So if you

55
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,350
like we might chuck some ballot papers around, and maybe we can get a vote, and maybe we

56
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,780
can be out of here by teatime.

57
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,680
Merilyn: You’ve got to be kidding. You’ve got to be kidding! (Other jurors murmur disagreement)

58
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,840
Phil: That might be a bit premature. Frank: We have to take this seriously. Phil: We’re not in a rush, I don’t think anyone here has to be somewhere in the next 10 minutes. So

59
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,230
perhaps we just need to have a talk about it, you know? Discuss what we think - throw

60
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,330
the ball around a bit. (Other jurors start speaking at once)

61
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,920
Susan: Somebody’s life is at stake here. Frank: Exactly! (Other jurors murmur agreement)

62
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,440
Henry: That’s right - that’s why I’m saying I don’t think he did it.

63
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,380
Merilyn: Give people the time to think about it!

64
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,120
Henry: I’m just going around the table! Merilyn: Gee...

65
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:21,630
Henry: But then we also have another guy on top of a walkway, who’s looking over the side and the moment

66
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:26,720
someone looks at him, he runs away. And that guy’s got form. I think the guy’s not

67
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,440
guilty. Over to you.

68
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,440
Merilyn: Excuse me, Neil’s got form too.

69
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,100
Henry: What kind of form?

70
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,080
Merilyn: May. 

71
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,640
Henry: Who?

72
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,320
Merilyn: May. We all saw May.

73
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,220
Susan: Nora! Nora!

74
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,600
Henry: You don’t even know who you’re talking about. 

75
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,390
Merilyn: I thought it was May.

76
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,250
Merilyn: Well, it’s confusing.

77
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,250
Henry: There’s no form because there was no conviction.

78
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,080
And she comes forward two years later, while, after the trial has started, and puts her name up.

79
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,380
(Jurors start to disagree at once) Merilyn: That doesn’t mean that ….

80
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,500
Merilyn: You gotta be kidding! You gotta be kidding!

81
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:58,620
Henry: Ah hang on…Scott has got convictions. Well, you can’t convict Neil! You can’t convict Neil! Merilyn: You&#39;re just saying...

82
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,500
Henry: Hang on whoa whoa whoa. You can’t convict Neil of being guilty of something when it

83
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,210
hasn’t even gone to trial. So you’re just simply saying that he actually did that.

84
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,780
Merilyn: But you’re convicting Scott just because he goes to a bondage club.

85
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:13,020
Henry: No, because he’s got a form for assault. And he ran away from the scene of the crime.

86
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,380
Merilyn: I think you’re jumping to conclusions.

87
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,380
Susan: Absolutely. Wayne: Yeah I think so too.

88
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:17,880
Henry: Okay!

89
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,450
Merilyn: And I think you’re prejudiced against him

90
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,370
because he’s got a crime conviction and he’s a member of a bondage club.

91
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,500
Sam: Look, can we have some kind of structure or something to this? Is there like a method or something? Frank: Yeah. 

92
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,600
Henry: Okay we’ll have a little bit of structure.

93
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,840
Why don’t we do a ballot right now and we’ll run these around and see how everyone’s thinking.

94
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,130
Merilyn: You’re kidding. You’re kidding.

95
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,050
Jenny: No, no, no...(Other jurors start to disagree)

96
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,320
Henry: We’ll just have a run around…

97
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,100
Phil: It’s too early to be taking a ballot. I mean mean we haven’t even discussed anything…

98
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,350
Henry: At least we can get a way of how people are feeling and then we can discuss those points...

99
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,060
Merilyn: What&#39;s this about ‘getting away’?

100
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,420
Susan: What if it was one of our kids who was, you know, potentially going to go to jail for

101
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,720
the rest of their life. I’d like to think someone gave it more than 10 minutes consideration.

102
00:06:50,820 --> 00:07:01,200
Henry: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 for guilty. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 

103
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,140
Who’s the smart arse that didn’t vote!

104
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,500
Jorge: (Laughs)

105
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,560
Henry: Eh?

106
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,820
Phil: Well, I’m sorry. That’s … I think it’s

107
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,780
disrespectful. A woman’s been murdered

108
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,100
Henry: That&#39;s right...Phil: and I think and I think we owe her the respect to actually discuss

109
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,210
the evidence that’s been presented to us in a thorough way.

110
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,560
Frank: The case for me is very simple. It was a left handed person who did it and that to me is

111
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,120
the only real evidence that matters here. Wayne: That&#39;s not a reason to convict. Frank: All the rest is…

112
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,940
Henry: Hang on! There’s other evidence. For goodness sake - everyone seems to be forgetting this.

113
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:42,260
We have one guy who’s being charged, okay, who is a man of good character, good reference,

114
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,270
has character references everywhere, he’s been a pillar of society … we have another. Merilyn: Err...

115
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,150
Henry: Hang on, can you just stop interrupting...

116
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,780
Merilyn: Well you stop talking so loudly Henry: Just for once!!!

117
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,320
Frank: Please! Please! Stop it. Stop it.

118
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,480
Henry: Can I just finish what I’m saying?!

119
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,940
Merilyn: You are so opinionated!

120
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,120
Susan: No more yelling! Let&#39;s be civilised.

121
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,960
Henry: Can we just finish this? 

122
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,880
Frank: Henry, you are... 

123
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,760
Henry: We have another guy...

124
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,160
Phil: …I’d just like to hear from one of the other people around the table. Merilyn: I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve heard every

125
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,680
Henry: Enough, we’ve been over everything!

126
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,090
Merilyn: We haven’t heard anything from Phillipa for ages!

127
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,890
Alison: Because she doesn&#39;t get a chance to!

128
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,770
Susan: Because you won’t be quiet!

129
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,950
Merilyn: Ooohhh .. c’mon.

130
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,030
Kyle: Can we have a ballot to go to lunch please?

131
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:19,530
Frank: Exactly!

132
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,360
Henry: Thank you!

133
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,100
Merilyn: You’ve got to be kidding...

134
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,100
Henry: Can we have the ballot, is that all right? Sam: Yes!

135
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,680
Susan: You know this is becoming the Henry and Merilyn show.

136
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,820
Merilyn: Oh, don’t be ridiculous!

137
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,140
Henry: Yeah, will we all be voting this time, Phil?

138
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,080
(Overtalk, arguing)

139
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:44,220
Henry: Righto! Here we go. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Oh for s**t&#39;s sake!

140
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,580
Wayne: (Laughs)

141
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,620
Henry: C’mon what&#39;s going on? Make up your minds.

142
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,560
Wayne: I don’t want to see any of you again! (Other jurors fight with each other around the table)

143
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,240
Susan: You know you’re starting to really bully people and it’s irritating.

144
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,740
Sam: Oh come on guys how old are you?

145
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,900
Alison: We keep talking about the same things again and again.

146
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,000
Merilyn: Yeah, just step back a bit.

147
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,720
Phil: We’re hearing you all loud and clear. Let’s

148
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,440
just listen to other people around the table. It’s not all about you, all right?

149
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:13,180
Phil: So why don’t we just list the points we that have, take time just to brainstorm those. We got

150
00:09:13,189 --> 00:09:16,509
a whiteboard here, work our way through it - how does that sound?

151
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:18,809
Jenny: That sounds good - yeah! (Murmurs of agreement from the other jurors)

152
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,499
Frank: There are simply too many people who could

153
00:09:20,499 --> 00:09:24,459
have done it. I think we haven’t even considered all the options, all the possibilities.

154
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:29,000
We keep talking about two suspects but there could be a third suspect as well, and I don’t

155
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:30,549
think we’ve even considered that option.

156
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:32,440
Merilyn: Well who do you think that could be?

157
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,639
Frank: I&#39;m not sure. But if I look at the map there&#39;s all sorts of people in the picture

158
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:39,120
that could potentially have had a grudge against the person.

159
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,550
Phil: Why don’t we just maybe just move around the table and just list the key issues or

160
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:53,860
key points that we want to discuss. And umm I’m happy to go first; Wayne: Yes. Phil: if someone else wants to…

161
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,600
Merilyn: No, no you go - that’s alright. (Other jurors agree Phil should speak)

162
00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:05,449
Phil: Well, first of all I’d like us to discuss Neil Fox. The blue door - it didn’t open.

163
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:12,730
And, and straight up, there’s just inconsistencies. I mean, the fact that he was smiling on camera

164
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:18,100
is just creepy. It raises ... it issues a red flag for me.

165
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:24,230
Susan: I just want to say that when you see someone on camera— in a photo —the difference

166
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:29,800
between a smile and a grimace can be really tiny. So maybe he wasn’t actually smiling,

167
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
maybe he was grimacing.

168
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,440
Merilyn: That’s a good point.

169
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,580
Susan: It just looked like a smile.

170
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,300
Merilyn: Yeah!

171
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,920
Sam: Let’s start with what evidence they have against Neil. What suggested to them that

172
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,900
he was the one that committed the crime?

173
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,500
Well he smiled on camera...

174
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,520
Phil: The blue door which is now... Merilyn: But what if

175
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,520
Merilyn: What if he’s colour blind? What if he’s colour blind?

176
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,460
Phil: Yeah - so the blue door, that&#39;s the first point.

177
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,780
Merilyn: Did anyone ask that question?

178
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,249
Alison: If you’re tired and emotional and you’ve

179
00:10:52,249 --> 00:10:56,619
just seen something horrible happen, are you really going to remember if you went through

180
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:57,999
a blue door or a grey door?

181
00:10:57,999 --> 00:10:59,160
Henry: Absolutely!

182
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,839
Alison: Shades of blue, shades of grey… Henry: Absolutely!

183
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,129
Phil: So there’s the door... Sam: there’s the grimace, the smile on camera. And the fact that he

184
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:10,229
was looking at Scott on the overpass.

185
00:11:10,229 --> 00:11:12,229
Merilyn: But there’s the prior that came up.

186
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:13,519
Henry: What, Nora?

187
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,279
Wayne: Nora

188
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,079
Merilyn: Yeah!

189
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,999
Henry: Nora, who didn’t report to the police a man that threatened her with knife. Phil: Well again, let&#39;s...

190
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:22,479
Merilyn: Yeah … she was terrified.

191
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:25,259
Phil: We’ll come to discuss it - lets just get the points.

192
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:29,129
Let’s just work to get the points and then we can come back and we can start

193
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:30,749
to extrapolate.

194
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:32,879
Wayne: Can I put on the table what for me is a really

195
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,519
serious issue - and it’s about the weapon. The guy comes down the lane-way, he allegedly

196
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,149
knifes and kills this person. Within a very short while he is back again. Then he races

197
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:45,470
through the blue or grey door - I don’t know which - and he apprehends this guy on

198
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:51,660
the overpass. Now, then the police are very quickly on the scene. He could only have moved

199
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,820
geographically within a very small area, and got rid of that knife.

200
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,100
(Mumbled agreement)

201
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,380
Wayne: It’s a built up area, it’s occupied offices and so on. Phil: The knife, the knife...Wayne: So why couldn’t they find the weapon?

202
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:05,879
Susan: I watch a lot of crime shows, and I know you could poo poo that, but I really watch them

203
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:10,300
closely and I’m worried about this forensic stuff. Because, if you stab, and I’ve seen

204
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:15,300
it a thousand times, if you stab someone in the neck and in the arms, the blood is

205
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,460
going to go everywhere. Blood splatters ….

206
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,580
Merilyn: Yeah, yeah…hang on!

207
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,820
Susan: Not just up your arms!

208
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
Merilyn: What you see on the telly - that’s not real life. Phillipa: Down his chest and everything. 

209
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,300
Susan: Well it’s based on real cases.

210
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,620
Merilyn: Yeah, but they have to dramatise it to get the punters in.

211
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:32,920
Susan: I’m just making the point, I think he would have it all over him. Phil: So, so The issue...

212
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,319
Phil: here is the fact that he had blood on his hands? That is something..

213
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:38,739
Henry: But there’s none on his shirt!

214
00:12:38,739 --> 00:12:40,739
Phil: Sure. Susan: That’s right. Phil: But let’s ..

215
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:46,230
Merilyn: I tell you what, you’ve got a knife, you’re leaning over, you’re not sort of hugging

216
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,420
the person, you’re leaning over, you’re stabbing, stabbing — there’s a distance.

217
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:56,990
Frank: But, I think what we all miss here is the left hand. I think as we noticed it must have

218
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:00,420
been done by a left hander. I think for me this is the most compelling evidence.

219
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,560
Merilyn: And Neil’s left handed.

220
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,110
Wayne: He’s a business guy, he’s dressed in his

221
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,790
good suit, and everything, out selling houses…

222
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,699
Phil: It was a bit interesting that the defence tried to make sure we didn’t know that!

223
00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:11,099
Sam: So other evidence that they&#39;ve built we’ve got, 

224
00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:12,619
Phil: Other points we want to discuss...

225
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,740
Sam: We’ve got the doors, we’ve got the smiling, there’s no sign of a murder weapon, they’ve got the character

226
00:13:17,749 --> 00:13:24,749
testimony from Nora, ah there’s blood on the shirt, the fact that he’s left handed, ..

227
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,860
Frank: Shari.. Oh, Shari.

228
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,900
Jenny: Shari, the eyewitness. Merilyn: But Shari...

229
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,820
Sam: Now what did she have to say about Neil?

230
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,470
Wayne: Well she didn’t identify him.

231
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,470
Merilyn: I wouldn&#39;t take everything she said...

232
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,679
Phil: Anyway, let’s put it down and we’ll come back and discuss it later.

233
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:45,579
Merilyn: She was a bit uncertain. She was crouching down, probably in shock, she’s on the ground

234
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:48,480
picking up her stuff - what did she really see?

235
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,939
Phil: We definitely need to put Scott on there and perhaps the fact that perhaps that initial

236
00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:57,099
interview was flawed.

237
00:13:57,099 --> 00:14:00,079
Henry: He made a confession and then conveniently retracts it.

238
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,880
Sam: He’s a nervous guy, you saw him on the stand.

239
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,940
I don’t think that there’s any chance …

240
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:07,669
Henry: Even though he admits that he did it?

241
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,880
Merilyn: Look he goes to a bondage club, he might be a masochist. Who knows?

242
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,820
Sam: That’s jumping to a conclusion a little bit…

243
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:17,410
Wayne: I’ve raised some points and argued them

244
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,220
incessantly and I know you’ve sick of them. But I’ve got another one to throw in because

245
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,220
I’m always throwing things in from left field, and this is the one that concerns me

246
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,819
now. Is that Detective Kate, there’s something wrong with the investigation. She walks out

247
00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:34,069
of that gym and she’s immediately at the scene. She should have been a witness for

248
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:39,170
the prosecution, probably for the prosecution, but she’s there investigating the case.

249
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,110
There’s something wrong, I reckon the investigation is totally flawed. Jorge: Exactly!

250
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,379
Henry: I want to talk about the blood. Can I just talk about the blood?

251
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:47,779
Phil: Let’s put it on the list.

252
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:48,759
Henry: Can we put it on the list? Can we just have

253
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:49,959
a quick chat about it now?

254
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:51,019
Sam: It’s on the list.

255
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:57,860
Henry: We have a guy in a shirt and tie and slacks. He has blood on his hands, alright, as from

256
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:04,220
where he’s knelt down there. The woman has defensive wounds all over her body, yeah?

257
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:04,929
Phil: Yeah. 

258
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:10,920
Henry: Arms and neck. Phil: Yeah. Henry: She’s also a gym instructor and she fought back. How is it possible, how

259
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,470
is it possible, that not one drop of blood got on his clothes?

260
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:19,749
Phil: Well perhaps he took off his coat and dumped it before he came back to the scene.

261
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:27,189
Susan: On the other hand if Scott, and you’re not in favour of Scott, if Scott did it why hasn’t he got blood on him?

262
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:28,940
Sam: Scott - the guy on the overpass?

263
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:30,909
Merilyn, Alison and Jenny: Yeah. Yeah.

264
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:33,840
Merilyn: And how did he, why would he go up there and be looking down? Henry: He could have washed. 

265
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,839
Henry: He could have washed.

266
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:42,419
Wayne: The forensic evidence suggests this is a very long bladed knife, this guy hasn’t got a coat on, how does he hide a knife? Henry: Yeah, how does he hide a knife?

267
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,400
Henry: We’ve got Scott who confessed and then withdrew his confession.

268
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,960
Merilyn: Well there’s reasons for that, there’s reasons for that.

269
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,199
Phil: We’ve got the film, the film taken on the

270
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,670
camera, the young guy who filmed at the scene, for example Neil smiling.

271
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,730
Jorge: Yes, yes.

272
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,720
Susan: But, but, is that a smile or is it a grimace?

273
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,229
Phil: Let’s discuss it. Let’s discuss it.

274
00:16:00,229 --> 00:16:02,220
Henry: Well people respond in very different ways, don&#39;t they?

275
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:07,559
What’s all this stuff we’re worried about that was coming out about the

276
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:11,149
blue door that was locked. Well I think if I’d just seen someone who’d been hacked to pieces

277
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:16,670
in front of me, and then I’m chasing up...the last thing I would be remembering is the colour

278
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,530
of the bloody door!

279
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,279
Kyle: Of the door though, he was insistent that

280
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:25,499
it was blue. He was absolutely sure. And that door does not open!

281
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:26,539
Sam: That’s a great point. A great point!

282
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:28,659
Merilyn: He could be colour blind. He could be colour blind. We don’t know.

283
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,420
Merilyn: And I think we could put Nora’s testimony there.

284
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,880
Phil: Absolutely (Muttered agreement)

285
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,560
Henry: How do we know she’s not lying?

286
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,180
Merilyn: Well, just because … why do you think she’s lying? Why?

287
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,679
Henry: Because she wants to promote herself. Phil: Let&#39;s discuss this...

288
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:47,079
Merilyn: Yeah but hang on. Because she fancies herself as a singer and would like to be an actor,

289
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:53,119
do you think she’s going to promote herself as a sex assault victim in order to enhance her career?!

290
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,540
Henry: I think you’ve nailed it - that’s exactly what I think.

291
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,080
Merilyn: Is this guy nuts or what?

292
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,880
Henry: Pretty convenient that she would wait until this trial takes place.

293
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,160
Phil: Were there any key points, any other key points?

294
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,799
Merilyn: Yes, there is a key point which is, I think you’re missing a fact

295
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:08,770
that because a person might exaggerate, gild the lily in one regard

296
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:13,190
it doesn’t mean you can discount everything they say in another regard, and I think we

297
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:18,600
have Scott as a really good example of that and I think we should look at Nora in the same light.

298
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,760
Henry: Explain the thing about Scott and a good example of what?

299
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,760
Merilyn: Well because he confessed, but we know there

300
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:30,900
are all these reasons why he confessed that may have had nothing to do with the actual crime with committing the crime.

301
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,420
Henry: Why do you think, why do you think he confessed?

302
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:40,120
Merilyn: Look he’s a 37 year old guy who still lives with his mother, the guy has got, clearly social issues …

303
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,380
Henry: Do you think he’s a sensitive guy? Merilyn: He goes to a bondage club...

304
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,250
Merilyn: No, I say this is a guy who’s got a few problems.

305
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,470
Wayne: Hey I think we have to be careful too. We’re saying Scott’s has ‘got form’ whatever

306
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,680
that might mean, I don’t know what ‘got form’ means, but I think we’ve got to

307
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:56,130
think very carefully here and not put badges on people. Because in trials we don’t know,

308
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:00,400
the jury will never be told, if the accused has got a prior conviction. So we don’t

309
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,520
know whether the other guy’s ‘got form’ either. Merilyn: Exactly! Wayne: I think we have to temper our language a little. 

310
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,140
Susan: And I want to put it on the record too, and

311
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:12,880
I know it’s not very scientific, but just between us the accused gave me the creeps.

312
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,880
Merilyn: That guy, he is so entitled. You know, he has this sense that he’s really important. He’s used to getting

313
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:25,800
his own way, and I think one of the things we should be considering is perhaps he didn’t

314
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:31,560
intend to kill her. But the fact is he may well have come on to her, she’s rejected

315
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,100
him in a forceful manner.

316
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,090
Phillipa: Maybe wanted to have sex with her in the

317
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:40,010
middle of the day, in broad daylight. A little bit kinky. Maybe that’s what his style was after all.

318
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,820
Wayne: I’m leaning towards Mr Fox not being a very nice gentleman.

319
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,560
Frank: But on the other hand, the fact that we all

320
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,170
have a left hand page and a right hand page with marks for and against probably is a good

321
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,810
indication that there&#39;s quite a bit of doubt and reasonable doubt.

322
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:01,730
Wayne: Well we’ve been arguing for a number days and I’m moving very much from the left to the right. 

323
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,350
Frank: Myself also.

324
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:08,560
Sam: I guess also, stacking it errr, not so much in Mr

325
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:17,150
Fox’s favour would be the fact that we have this testimony from singer girl. She claims

326
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:23,880
that Mr Fox has an unsavoury past, that maybe he’s done some nasty things in the past.

327
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:30,880
And then this crime takes place outside a women’s gym, which Mr Fox has never been seen near

328
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,780
before to my knowledge, and a woman’s been murdered in an attack that frankly looks a

329
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:43,150
little bit frenzied. Maybe stuff got a little bit out of hand and it was too much for the

330
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,130
fantastic Fox to handle.

331
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,830
Henry: What, do you think he was like going to threaten

332
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:51,750
her and then she maybe responded and he had to..

333
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,910
Sam: Do something!

334
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,410
Henry: ...that he had to do something?

335
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,490
Sam: Or his reputation’s at stake - big time.
