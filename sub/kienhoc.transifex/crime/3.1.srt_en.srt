00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,210
(Music)

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,680
(Screaming)

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,660
Police! Move!

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,240
Detective Kate Warne. Thank you very much for coming in. 

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,120
I&#39;m really sorry about the wait.

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,760
I see her - Janine - only I didn&#39;t know it was Janine.

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,480
Memory is a fragile thing - go at it too hard and you&#39;ll crush it.

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,760
Go at it too marshmallow and they&#39;ll walk all over you.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,140
Now hang on mate!

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,880
No, you hang on mate! There&#39;s a dead girl lying on a cold bit of steel refrigerator

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,370
and it&#39;s my job to find out who the hell put her there. Now sit back down!

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,480
(Music)

13
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:50,300
Yeah, yeah that’s got it right. Yeah.

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,140
Try the hair?

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,400
Umm - short, scruffy, umm like he&#39;d messed it up. 

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,240
Brownish, or dark anyway.

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,780
Don’t rush it Neil. It’s better to get it right than to rush it.

18
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,280
Umm..

19
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,340
Umm...

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,320
Ahh, we can take a break if you need it.

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,080
I did this first aid course a couple of months ago. 

22
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:29,780
And for the first couple of weeks I just, I was looking for, I was willing for someone to need me. You know?

23
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,020
Have a heart attack or something.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,600
And then I forgot about it, and then this happened. And it ...

25
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,760
I’m okay. Really I’m okay.

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,900
These guys support witnesses of violent crimes. They do really good work and they’ll understand

27
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:49,649
what you’re going through. A lot of people won&#39;t understand, but these guys will.

28
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,500
Well I did get a good look at him so, that will help won’t it?

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,500
Yes, Neil, that will help.

30
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,860
Okay shall we try the eyes?

31
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:09,320
Yeah ... no no no the one before. No, yeah.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,760
(Calming music plays)

33
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,380
(Music turns sinister)

34
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,680
Agghh geez Louise, Kate!

35
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,180
What the hell were you thinking sneaking up on me like that?

36
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,180
Just coming to check on the photofit.

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,200
Looks like your intuition might have something going for it after all.

38
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,880
Where’s the window?

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,160
Pardon?

40
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,440
When you said lineup I thought we’d be looking through a window. 

41
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,620
You know - like on telly.

42
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,080
New technology. And it saves us a room. 

43
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,340
There&#39;s all this fancy stuff you see on TV - forensics and what not. Now I&#39;m not knocking that but

44
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,420
but it&#39;s the little things from people like you that usually break a case.

45
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:19,040
Well like I told Detective Warne, I&#39;m not sure how much help I&#39;ll be, but I&#39;ll do my best.

46
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,480
That’s all we can ask for.

47
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,430
Is one of these him?

48
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:27,110
Well that’s what we think. Do any of these guys look familiar to you?

49
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,920
(Dramatic music)

50
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,720
I’m not sure.

51
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,080
Have another look. What about the guy at the end? Have you seen him before?

52
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,180
(Dramatic music)

53
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,160
I think he was there - in the alleyway. 

54
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:21,520
Yes, I’m sure of it now. I can’t believe I didn’t notice it before.

55
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,720
Are you sure?

56
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,160
Yes, absolutely. That’s him.

57
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,160
Thanks. You’ve been a great help.

58
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:33,880
Oh God, I did it. I can&#39;t believe I remembered. It came clear as day.

59
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,840
Will that help you catch him?

60
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,240
We’ll certainly be doing our best.

61
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,180
Umm...you’ve got a ...

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,500
(Office sounds)

63
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,440
Right, we’d better get him back in then.
