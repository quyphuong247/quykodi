So do juries make better decisions than individual jurors? Obviously a verdict is returned by

1
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,240
the jury as a group — individual jurors&#39; decisions are not accepted as the verdict. But there

2
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,890
is a reasonably substantial body of research comparing the decisions of individuals to

3
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,020
the decisions of groups not just in the context of jury decision-making. So, even though

4
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,430
the jury group returns a verdict, it&#39;s worth considering how the group deliberation process

5
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,980
might influence jurors&#39; decisions. Now we touched on this in the last video. In this video

6
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,519
we will focus not just the characteristics of group deliberation, but also the psychology

7
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:56,769
behind group discussion to understand whether groups make better decisions than individuals.

8
00:00:56,769 --> 00:01:00,190
Intuitively it might be tempting to think that this is not a difficult question to answer

9
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,970
- two heads are better than one after all as the saying goes. And so it might seem that

10
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,900
groups must make better decisions than individuals. The results of a relatively early study by

11
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,610
Kaplan and Miller in 1978 would support this idea. They found that the effect of stereotypes

12
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:21,030
about defendants was reduced following jury deliberation. In essence, the group deliberation

13
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,830
helped jurors move beyond their preconceptions about the defendant and make decisions based

14
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,290
on other information -- presumably the evidence.

15
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,310
But don&#39;t forget that other saying -- too many cooks spoil the broth! Let&#39;s see what

16
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,070
the rest of the research on group decision-making says about this issue.

17
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,930
Well one area of potentially relevant research you may have already heard about in the popular

18
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,980
media is called groupthink. According to Janis, groupthink is a mode of thinking that can

19
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:51,110
occur in highly cohesive, high status groups in which the desire to reach unanimous agreement

20
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:56,380
overrides the motivation to adopt proper, rational decision-making procedures. Several

21
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,430
famous instances of poor group decision-making have been given as examples of groupthink

22
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:05,950
by commentators over the years — the Challenger shuttle disaster, the Columbia shuttle disaster,

23
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:11,090
the weapons of mass destruction case agains Iraq, the Bay of Pigs fiasco, and also the

24
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,090
escalation of the Vietnam war.

25
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,500
Groupthink is triggered by: directive leadership style; intense group cohesion; similarity

26
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,830
of ideology within the group; pressure for unanimity in decision-making; insulation of

27
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:30,060
the group from critics; insecure member self-esteem; and a sense of crisis. It is thought to typically

28
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,740
occur in very high status groups where other group members are viewed as powerful and wise.

29
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,450
Group members are therefore likely to keep any objections to themselves, and so dissent

30
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,860
becomes stifled.

31
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,420
Groupthink results in several inadequate decision processes. For example, an inadequate consideration

32
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,010
of the alternative decision options, ignoring the implications of failure, and a biased

33
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:57,080
assessment of the risks, costs and benefits. There is also poor information search and

34
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,740
meagre contingency planning in the event that the group solution fails.

35
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:06,490
There is actually mixed support for the concept of groupthink. For example, manipulating cohesion

36
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:12,560
to be high should promote groupthink, but Esser&#39;s 1998 research did not find any evidence

37
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,410
that this was the case. Increased threat to the group should also enhance groupthink,

38
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:22,530
but Fodor and Smith&#39;s 1982 research didn&#39;t find any effect of heightened threat.

39
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,660
On the other hand, Esser&#39;s 1998 research did find that as would be expected, directive

40
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:33,900
leadership and group insulation do produce some characteristics of groupthink such as

41
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,240
poorer decision-making. Mullen and colleagues in 1994 argued that all the preconditions

42
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,810
for groupthink must be present before the effects and symptoms of groupthink will be

43
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,610
seen.

44
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:50,310
Does this mean groupthink exists or not? And does it apply to the jury decision-making

45
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,830
context? Well, such research suggests that groupthink probably only applies in a more

46
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:59,870
narrow range of circumstances than originally thought. Given the pre-conditions for groupthink,

47
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,819
it seems quite unlikely that groupthink would exert a strong influence in the jury context.

48
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:08,830
For example, it is perhaps unlikely that all members of a jury would view all the other

49
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,590
members as particularly powerful and wise on the topic under discussion — which is

50
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,220
the verdict.

51
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,009
Having said that, the research on groupthink does identify a number of things that might

52
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:23,340
mitigate the more negative aspects of group decision-making. For example, the importance

53
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,740
of dissent via the sharing of divergent ideas and opinions via a devil&#39;s advocate, and

54
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,940
also the importance of the group&#39;s leader not advocating a position early in the discussion.

55
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,560
We will come back to these ideas shortly. But first, let&#39;s look at some other areas

56
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,410
of the research on group decision-making to see what effect group discussion might have

57
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,740
on the quality of a group&#39;s decision.

58
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,960
Group polarisation is one such area of research. Group polarisation was originally studied

59
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:53,820
by Moscovici and Zavalloni in 1969. This is the phenomena where the group discussion tends

60
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,949
to intensify a group&#39;s opinion -- so individual group members&#39; original attitudes become more

61
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:03,680
extreme following group discussion. The reason why this phenomena might be more relevant

62
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,310
to jury decision-making than groupthink is because it is not limited to high-status or

63
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:14,500
highly cohesive groups. However, for it to take effect, group members must basically

64
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,720
agree on the favoured side of the issue at first -- so they must basically agree on how

65
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,780
to interpret the evidence. The research shows that group polarisation intensifies many kinds

66
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:29,310
of attitudes: such as feminism, pacifism, equality, under-age drinking, racial attitudes,

67
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,919
and most relevantly the perceived guilt or innocence of defendants in criminal trials.

68
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,030
There are a few explanations for why group polarisation might occur. The first is called

69
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,530
persuasive arguments theory and was originally put forward by Burnstein and Vinokur in 1977.

70
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,340
The idea is that if there is a generally agreed upon group position at the start of group

71
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:54,120
discussion, group members are more likely to hear arguments consistent with their own

72
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,540
personal views. The preponderance of these arguments persuades group members that their views are

73
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:05,210
correct, especially when some of these arguments are new to group members, and so as a consequence their attitudes

74
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:11,300
become more extreme. So group members are influenced by the new information. Kaplan

75
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:17,970
in 1977 and Diamond and Casper in 1992 argued that this was the explanation for group polarisation

76
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,030
in the context of jury decision-making.

77
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:25,290
An alternative perspective is based on Festinger&#39;s social comparison theory. When there isn&#39;t

78
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,710
an objective standard to compare your views against to see if they are correct, we compare

79
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:35,430
our views to those of the other group members. In this case, the group norm is important

80
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,389
rather than the exchange of information in the form of persuasive arguments.

81
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:43,759
The idea goes that if there is a pre-existing group norm, group members will be reluctant

82
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,690
to deviate from it. In fact, group members try to be “above average” in terms of

83
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,660
their adherence to group norm to show that they are good group members. Most group members

84
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,139
assume they are already better than the average group member and think that their individual

85
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:02,030
attitudes demonstrate their standing as a good group member.

86
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:06,340
Group discussion may however disconfirm this belief when group members hear that other

87
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:11,180
group members hold pretty much the same attitudes, and so they find out that they are merely

88
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,380
an &quot;average&quot; group member. Group members then adopt more extreme attitudes in an attempt

89
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:22,350
to become better than average group member. As a result, the group&#39;s decision also becomes

90
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,940
more extreme.

91
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,500
So which of these two theories about group polarisation is most accurate? Well it turns

92
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,539
out that there is evidence that both are correct in some circumstances.

93
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:36,690
Support for the social comparison explanation can be seen in Baron and colleagues&#39; 1996

94
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,720
research. Those findings suggest that arguments don’t have to be new to the group members

95
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,970
— polarisation occurs even if group members just find out that others agree with their

96
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:51,600
choices. Likewise for Stewart and Stasser&#39;s 1998 finding that polarisation is observed

97
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,139
even if group members only find out that they share some of the reasons for their views.

98
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:01,889
Both of these effects seem to be related to an increase in confidence. In fact, we can

99
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:06,729
see some evidence of group polarisation in Baron and Roger&#39;s 1976 study even when no

100
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:09,370
arguments at all are exchanged.

101
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:14,750
On the other hand, Burnstein and Vinokur&#39;s 1973 study clearly showed evidence of polarisation

102
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:20,600
only when persuasive arguments are exchanged by group members, even when there was explicitly

103
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,199
no information available about the actual attitudes of other group members, and so there

104
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,910
could be no group norm to compare oneself to.

105
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:33,159
A final perspective on group polarisation come from self-categorisation theory. According

106
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:37,919
to Hogg, Turner and Davidson in 1990, people express stronger views when they discover

107
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,209
they are shared by others because they want to be liked. Group discussion promotes greater

108
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:47,019
awareness of group affiliation — in effect it increases the salience or prominence of

109
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:52,070
the group identity — and group members make more effort to adhere to prototypic group

110
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,800
norms.

111
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,010
Rather than thinking about the merits of the arguments for one viewpoint or another, group

112
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:02,830
members focus on the norm that embodies the group. Now in an inter-group setting, this

113
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:07,750
norm is the position that maximises similarity within the group and minimises similarity

114
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:12,200
to other groups. This is different from the social comparison explanation because group

115
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,940
members are not trying to be better than each other, they are just trying to distinguish

116
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,589
their group from other relevant out groups.

117
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:24,540
There is quite a bit of research supporting this view. One of the key studies by Spears

118
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:30,360
and colleagues in 1990 showed that group polarisation only occurs when group salience is high. And

119
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,779
So one would have to consider whether this would be the case in a jury deliberation setting.

120
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:38,209
Do the jury members see themselves as members of a group, and in this example, who would

121
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:39,890
be the relevant out group?

122
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:45,130
Okay, so it seems that groups might make individuals decisions&#39; more extreme for a number of reasons

123
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:50,580
including exposure to biased information that is, one side of the issue, comparison with

124
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,390
other group members, and also comparison with other groups.

125
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,300
Let&#39;s take a look at that first mechanism in a little more detail, and it is probably

126
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,120
one of the most relevant for thinking about how juries make decisions and why their decisions

127
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,149
might polarise.

128
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:07,300
So the research suggests that individuals are influenced by the flow of arguments in

129
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,339
group discussion, and this information flow can be biased in that it tends to justify

130
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:16,500
the side of argument favoured by most group members. This biased flow influences attitude

131
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,730
extremity.

132
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,450
According to Stasser and Titus in 1987, one of the consequences of these processes is

133
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,959
that there is a tendency to emphasise shared information rather than otherwise important

134
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,519
information known only by individual jurors.

135
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:36,200
The problem with this was identified by Stasser in 1988 in a phenomena called Hidden Profiles.

136
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,980
This is when the information held in common by group members favours one choice while

137
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:45,350
the unshared information held by each group member contradicts that group choice. That

138
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,330
unshared information is called the hidden profile, because it does not typically emerge

139
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:54,430
during group discussion — it stays hidden while the group discussed the shared information.

140
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,750
Rationally, the group should rely on the information in the hidden profile when marking their decision.

141
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:03,430
However, due to group processes such as conformity, normative influence and polarisation favouring

142
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:08,279
the expression of shared information, the uniquely held information stays hidden.

143
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:13,750
Let&#39;s consider an example to illustrate this. Imagine a jury of six trying to decide what verdict to return

144
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:18,709
- guilty or not guilt. Suppose that all six jurors remember three bits of evidence in

145
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:23,779
favour of conviction. Importantly each juror remembers the same three bits of evidence

146
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:30,360
as the other jurors. This is the shared information. Now also imagine that each of the six jurors

147
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,529
remembers one piece of the evidence that favours acquittal or a not guilty verdict. For these

148
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:40,850
bits of information, each juror remembers a different unique bit of the evidence.

149
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,480
So at the individual juror level, each juror should favour conviction because they all

150
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,720
remember three bits of evidence that favour conviction and one bit that favours acquittal.

151
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,190
When the jurors discuss the case as a jury, if they effectively pooled all of their knowledge,

152
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,480
they would actually favour acquittal because there are three commonly held bits of information

153
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,529
for conviction and six uniquely held bits of information for acquittal.

154
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:08,269
Unfortunately, groups often don&#39;t effectively pool their information and instead they rely

155
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:12,519
on the shared common information. This biased group discussion can lead to more extreme

156
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:17,820
attitudes through confirmation of group members&#39; views, inflated estimates of group agreement,

157
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:23,110
overconfidence, less extensive generation of ideas, and poor decision-making.

158
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:27,339
So how can the effects such as hidden profiles and polarisation be avoided?

159
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:31,610
Well one promising option seems to be encouraging dissent in the group. This dissent might be

160
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:36,420
genuine or contrived, as in the &quot;devil&#39;s advocate&quot; technique. Although both work, Nemeth and

161
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:41,620
colleagues&#39; 2001 research shows that authentic dissent produces more ideas and solutions

162
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,810
than contrived techniques.

163
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:49,070
According to Greitemyer and colleague&#39;s 2006 findings, dissent works because it encourages

164
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:54,690
discussion in the group, increases pooling of unshared info, and allows for solving of

165
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:59,529
hidden profiles. It also however decreases both individuals’ satisfaction with task

166
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:03,630
outcome and willingness to work with group members in the future.

167
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:09,079
As Schulz-Hardt and colleagues showed in 2002, dissent also decreases group morale, causes

168
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:14,290
delays in decision-making and decreases group cohesion. Thus, despite the apparent benefits

169
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:18,290
of dissent for the quality of the group&#39;s decision, group members may be reluctant to

170
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,370
encourage it.

171
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:24,680
Rijnbout and McKimmie in 2012 confirmed that dissent in group decision making helps to

172
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,040
produce objectively better group decisions by undermining group members&#39; confidence in

173
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,209
their initial preferences -- as a result they focus more carefully on evaluating the strengths

174
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:38,339
and weaknesses of the information rather than relying on heuristic cues when making a decision.

175
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:42,240
A follow up study also suggested that the presence of deviance in the group helped

176
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,550
the group &quot;solve&quot; the hidden profile and move beyond relying on the shared information when

177
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:51,730
making a decision. The negative effects of dissent on the group were evident in that 2012

178
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:57,029
research. However, another follow up study also published in 2014 showed that when the

179
00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:00,769
group was working under a unanimous decision rule compared to a majority decision rule,

180
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:04,190
the negative effects of deviance were actually much reduced.

181
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,660
So it seems that under some conditions group deliberation can actually make individuals&#39;

182
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,779
decisions potentially less reliable due to biased information sampling and group processes.

183
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:17,399
However, those same group processes can be brought to bear in the form of group deviance

184
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,600
to promote better, more thorough group decision making. Unanimous decision rules, somewhat

185
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,680
paradoxically, seem to encourage the group to have to engage with the deviant group member

186
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,139
in a productive manner, rather than sidelining him or her as might be done in the case of

187
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:31,930
a majority decision rule.
