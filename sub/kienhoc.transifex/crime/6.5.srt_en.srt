Next week on Crime101!

1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,640
In respect of the charge, you must reach a unanimous verdict.

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,860
That is, a verdict on which you all agree.

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:13,360
 

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:21,600
We have a guy who walks down an alley - just happens to be waiting outside the back door of a gym. Alright?

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,660
In his shirt and tie and slacks and  nice shoes.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,860
And he has a knife in his pocket and then stabs this woman to death.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,460
But then we also have another guy on top of a walkway who&#39;s looking over the side,

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,660
and the moment someone looks at him he runs away.

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,700
Yeah, but how do you think Real Estate Agents make their money. They take the opportunity,

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,680
they seize the moment, they think fast...

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,380
Ah, come on ...the guy&#39;s just stabbed someone to death and he says &#39;oh hang on&#39; and he...
