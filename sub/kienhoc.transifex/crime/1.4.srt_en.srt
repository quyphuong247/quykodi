At face value, the FBI&#39;s approach sounds highly intuitive and appealing. 

1
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,680
However, one major issue with it is that it is unclear, aside from the original study 

2
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,660
conducted by interview with serial sexual murderers, how these associations between crime scene characteristics

3
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,860
and offender characteristics have actually come about.

4
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,470
Traditionally, the FBI in their accounts have placed great emphasis on their investigators&#39;

5
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:44,780
field experience and they cite this as the key factor that underpins the associations that they assert. 

6
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,289
So a key question is how well do these profilers actually perform?

7
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,489
Although there have been many anecdotal examples and unpublished reports claiming the success

8
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,120
of the FBI&#39;s method of profiling, there are, in fact, very few published empirical

9
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,829
analyses and each of these are controversial in their own way.

10
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,920
However, as an illustrative study, we will go back to one of the first. And these were

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,740
conducted by Anthony Pinizotto with the collaboration of the FBI. In a paper published in 1990,

12
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,880
Anthony Pinizotto and Norman Finkel sought to determine whether professional profilers

13
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,330
were more accurate than non-profilers in generating personality profiles and correctly identifying

14
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,599
offender features from crime scene details.

15
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:30,860
They also wanted to explore whether the processes used by the profilers was qualitatively different

16
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:36,270
from the processes used by the non-profilers. Now in total they had 28 participants who

17
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,250
were categorised on the basis of their profiling expertise. We are going to concentrate on

18
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,250
just 24 of those participants. These were 6 police detectives who made up the PROFILERS

19
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,950
group. That is, they had all been specifically trained in profiling. They had completed a

20
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,530
1-year program through the FBI Behavioral Science Unit and they had a range of 1-6 years

21
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,399
experience in actually profiling.

22
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,950
The second group were the group of DETECTIVES. This group was made up of 6 detectives from a large metropolitan

23
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,610
city police department. Now these officers had no training in profiling, but they were

24
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:14,190
experienced police investigators in homicide and sex offence cases 

25
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,480
(which were the two crimes chosen for this study).

26
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,610
The third group were a group of clinical PSYCHOLOGISTS and the fourth group was a group made

27
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:26,360
up of STUDENTS. In each of these were 6 participants who met the criteria and they were selected

28
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,050
as non-police participants who were both naive to profiling and criminal investigations.

29
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,350
All participants were given materials from two closed cases; that is these crimes

30
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:42,700
had actually already been solved. One case involved a homicide and the other a sex offence.

31
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,870
In both cases participants were provided with information about the victim 

32
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,730
and also the crime scene reports.

33
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,060
So for the sexual offence, it detailed the events leading up to the offence, what actually

34
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,200
occurred in the offence itself, and the events that followed the offence. In addition, 

35
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,080
in this case, participants also read a detailed victim statement, what happened and what

36
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,760
the offender did and said.

37
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,720
Now in the homicide case, participants were given 14 black and white crime scene photos.

38
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,430
They were also given autopsy and toxicology reports. Now these detailed the cause,

39
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,260
 the manner and the mode of death. The toxicology report showed whether there were any chemical

40
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,340
agents present in the victim&#39;s system at the time of death that may have caused or

41
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,170
contributed to the death.

42
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:32,100
Now in both cases, and in order to protect the identity of the victim, some information

43
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,580
that would normally be available to profilers, such as maps of geographical areas where the

44
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,180
crimes took place, were actually absent.

45
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,260
So all participants read both cases and they balanced the order, so some read the homicide

46
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:50,330
case first and the others read the sexual offence case first. Now after they read each case,

47
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,230
they were asked to cover the material and write down as many details about the case

48
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,569
that they were able to remember.

49
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,130
They then had to use this to note down all the details from the crime scene that they

50
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:05,120
felt were necessary and important to be used in writing a profile about the type of person

51
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,819
of would commit such a crime, and also note down why they felt these facts were important.

52
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:15,020
They were also then asked to write a profile of the type of person who committed the crime,

53
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:20,780
and to give as much detail as possible, and then they had to record this onto audiotape.

54
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:24,840
Finally they were given a multiple choice question sheet. This consisted of 20 questions

55
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,349
about the suspect (questions about their age, their gender, their residence, their employment).

56
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:33,419
Now 15 of these could be scored as being correct or not.

57
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:39,110
And as a very last step they completed a line up task. Participants were given five descriptions

58
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:43,729
of possible suspects and they had to rank order them from 1 (the suspect they thought

59
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:48,199
who was most likely to have committed the crime) down to 5 (the person least likely to have

60
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,699
committed the crime).

61
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:54,379
So what did they find on these measures? Well, the analysis indicated that profilers provided

62
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:59,389
richer and longer reports than the non-profilers in terms of number of the predictions, for example.

63
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:05,590
Critically, however, they also provided significantly more accurate predictions in both cases. 

64
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:10,349
Profilers were significantly more accurate than the non-profiler groups.

65
00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:15,479
However, when their responses to the multiple choice questions were analysed, profilers

66
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:19,460
only scored significantly better than the other three groups combined for the sexual

67
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,580
offence case.

68
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,870
Similarly when looking at the line up results, the superior ability of the profilers to identify

69
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:31,349
the correct offender only emerged in relation to the sexual offence. It didn&#39;t emerge

70
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:34,389
on either measure in the homicide case.

71
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:38,300
Finally when looking at how profilers used the information they were given, to see if

72
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,979
the way they used it differed from how other participants used the information, they found

73
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:47,509
no evidence that the profilers assessed the information in qualitatively different way

74
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:50,120
from the non profilers.

75
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,589
So this study gives us a mixed picture of profilers of how profilers actually perform. Professional profilers provided

76
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:01,449
richer profiles, they made more accurate predictions in their written profiles than participants

77
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:03,499
belonging to the other groups.

78
00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:07,650
Further, professional profilers were more accurate in terms of multiple choice responding

79
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:11,650
and in picking out the perpetrator from a line up for the sex offence case than non

80
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:17,389
profilers, but those accuracy differences were not seen in the homicide case. Here profilers

81
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:24,389
performed just as well, or rather, just as poorly as detectives, psychologists and students.

82
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:31,129
So why? Was the version of the homicide case just too sanitised? All the profilers noted that

83
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:36,939
information they&#39;d expected to see when constructing a profile was actually missing in this study.

84
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:40,409
Or was it more to do with the fact that the homicide offender did not fit the base rates

85
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:45,279
in all ways? And this shows an inherent problem in profiling. What if your offender

86
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,000
isn&#39;t a statistically normal or a &#39;typical&#39; offender?
