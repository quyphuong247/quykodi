00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,060
Oi! Oi!

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,060
Let&#39;s try the hair

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,680
Ahrrmm - short, scruffy, like he’d messed it up.

4
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:19,279
Have another look. What about the guy at the end? Have you seen him before?

5
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,340
(Suspenseful music)

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,980
Right. So I see a prior here for robbery.

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,240
Nothing to say about that?

8
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,980
I was 18 years old and mentally un...

9
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:47,740
Yeah, we all make our choices, Scott. Did you know this woman?

10
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,960
Why did you lie to us Scott?

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,920
I knew you’d have a go at me.

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,420
Happens a lot does it? You were seen at the overpass by multiple

13
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:06,729
witnesses. You ran from the scene frightened enough to drop your bag. You had gym clothes

14
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:10,229
in your bag, but no one at the gym recalls ever seeing you.

15
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,320
I just need to get home. I haven’t slept all night.

16
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,740
I’m talking.

17
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,409
I’m not trying to fight you.

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,139
We know you’re into hurting women and you were at the right place at the right time.

19
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:31,799
You behaved in a guilty fashion. Why’d you run Scott?

20
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,080
I panicked is all. I didn’t even know what I was looking at at first. And then it all sort

21
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:45,500
of come into focus. Then I see that fella looking at me and I just saw problems. I just

22
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:50,340
wanted to go home. It was a...

23
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,340
An opportunity?

24
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,160
No. A complication.

25
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,600
Look a woman on her own walking down an alley

26
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:07,570
like that. No woman I know would do that. Too risky. She must have liked the thrill of it.

27
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,900
I don’t know what she liked. I didn’t know her.

28
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,900
You wanted to scare her; maybe she wanted

29
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,540
to be scared, but it went a little too far.

30
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,560
No, that’s not it. I didn’t mean to...

31
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,140
You didn’t mean to kill her?

32
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,900
I never hurt anyone who didn’t want to be hurt. I never murdered...

33
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,620
So you think she wanted to be hurt?

34
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,900
I should have taken the long way home.

35
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,900
Are we done? Can I go home now? I’ve got to get to my mum.

36
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,700
As soon as you tell me how you did it.

37
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,100
I keep telling you...I’m sorry she’s dead, but it wasn’t me.

38
00:02:54,100 --> 00:03:01,360
Sure it was. We all get impulses every now and then. Everyone looks bright on the outside,

39
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,540
but scratch the surface and we all have a bit of darkness eh? It’s human nature.

40
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,300
Is that how it was? Woke up that morning and there’s that itch,

41
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:18,340
that dark itch and sometimes we just have to scratch it. 

42
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,220
Then there’s the knife. 

43
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,420
Where did you get it?

44
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,960
If I tell you will you let me go?

45
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,600
Full confession.

46
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,700
Relax cowboy. A confession isn’t a conviction.

47
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,780
I’ve got Neil Fox coming in shortly. Plus I’ve got a line on the kid in the alley

48
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,310
with his mobile phone out. Maybe he took some pics.

49
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:53,639
Do you ever lighten up? This case has been clear from the start. I saw it that way

50
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:59,489
and you didn’t. And it pisses you off. I’m sorry about what happened to you, but it wasn’t

51
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:05,329
my fault and I’m tired of the softly softly. Now you may have been hot stuff once Kate,

52
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:08,980
but you slipped with this one. I’ve got a damned confession. Would it hurt to stop

53
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,160
lecturing me and give me a little credit?

54
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,960
Is that the same shirt you wore yesterday?

55
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,260
What?

56
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,960
You missed some mustard.

57
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,960
(High five)

58
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,080
(Calming music plays)

59
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,240
(Breathes deeply)

60
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,540
(Slams locker)

61
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:53,120
(Breathes deeply and music continues to play)

62
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,220
I’m terribly sorry to keep you waiting.

63
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,060
To be honest it’s the first bit of quiet

64
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,340
time I’ve had all day. It was really nice. You okay? You look a bit flushed.

65
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,840
Oh, totally fine. It’s a bit hot in here. Would you like a water before we start?

66
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,860
Sure.

67
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:35,760
(Tense music plays)

68
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,600
Thanks. 

69
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,440
Right...let’s get started shall we?

70
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,440
You sure you’re ready? I can give you another minute.

71
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:07,500
Oh that’s kind but that’s not necessary. Interview with Neil Fox, March 25th, 4:10pm

72
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,460
regarding the murder of Janine Jenker.

73
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,860
Oh before we get started. That card you gave

74
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,930
me. Those guys really know their stuff. So thank you.

75
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:22,020
You’re welcome. They’ve helped a lot of people. Now, we have statements from all the

76
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:27,140
people who were in the alley that day, which has been really helpful. Um, but there are a couple

77
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:32,840
of little things which I was still wondering about and I was hoping if you might be able to help me.

78
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,800
Sure. I’m not quite sure what else I can add, but what do you need to know?

79
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,700
Well for starters, why did you run after the

80
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,190
guy in the overpass?

81
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,860
I don’t know. To be honest, I’ve never

82
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:53,410
done anything like that. If you’d asked me the day before if that’s what I’d do,

83
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,720
then I wouldn’t have said ‘yes’. But I did. I guess it’s true what people say

84
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:05,430
about not knowing how they’ll act in a crisis until they’re actually in a crisis. I don’t

85
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:10,710
even know if I’d do it again if the same thing, God forbid, happened tomorrow.

86
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,750
What made you think he wasn’t just an onlooker like you?

87
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:25,360
I don’t know. Intuition I guess. The way he looked at me. Sorry, I’m not being very helpful am I?

88
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,360
You said you chased him through a door. Which door was that?

89
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,640
Was it this one or that one?

90
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,640
Argh, I have no idea. I was in a rush. I’d guess it would be the first one.

91
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,540
Is that right?

92
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,920
Yes, that’s what I remember.

93
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,400
So that was the only door you could have gone through, right?

94
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,240
I guess so.

95
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,460
This one.

96
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,920
(Phone rings)

97
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,980
That’s not me.

98
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,620
Oh, sorry. I usually turn that off.

99
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,480
Well you were a little flustered when you came in here.

100
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,620
Ah, I’m sorry, I’m just going to have to take this one. I’ll be back in a moment.

101
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,460
Um, interview suspended 4.13. Yep?

102
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,960
Detective Warne? He didn’t take any photos.

103
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,700
Okay. Thanks for trying.

104
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,120
He was filming. It’s not long. I’ve emailed it to you.

105
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:26,540
(Phone noises)

106
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:34,820
(Video begins, voices muttering, someone screams)

107
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,400
(On video: Police, move, move!)

108
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,680
(On video: Crashing noise)

109
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,180
(Video finishes)

110
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,400
(Dial tone sounds)

111
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,920
Yo. It’s okay. I accept your apology.

112
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,620
Ray, listen. When you spoke to the bondage guy did he mention how he left the scene?

113
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,260
Did he mention a door?

114
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,340
What door?

115
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,340
Can you just go and ask the uniform? He was in the alleyway. He was puffed. He got the bag from the overpass.

116
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,760
Ask him about the door.

117
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,020
Aren’t you supposed to be with Fox?

118
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,200
Just do it! The door to the alleyway.

119
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,740
He says the door was locked. They all had to go around the long way.

120
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
You okay? Can I get somebody?

121
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,300
No thanks, I’m fine.

122
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,460
(Suspenseful music crescendos)

123
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,200
(Door slams shut)
