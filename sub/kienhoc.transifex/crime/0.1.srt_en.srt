Hello, and welcome to CRIME101x, The Psychology of Criminal Justice. I’m Blake McKimmie,

1
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,490
and this is Mark Horswill and Barbara Masser. And we’re all academics at The University

2
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,090
of Queensland in Australia.

3
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,860
Now we don&#39;t want to spend a long time introducing the course, we&#39;d like to just jump straight

4
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,790
into it because there&#39;s lots we want to tell you about the psychology of criminal justice.

5
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,250
There are, however, a few things that we need to cover before we get started.

6
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,550
In a minute, Barbara will tell you a bit about the topics we’ll be covering, and Mark will

7
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,820
say a few words about research and the scientific method. In this course, we’ll be making

8
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,650
numerous claims about how things do and don&#39;t work, and these claims are based on the scientific

9
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,230
literature. Sometimes they might seem to be quite counter-intuitive. Mark will tell you

10
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,730
why we use the scientific method as a more reliable way of finding out how things work.

11
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,760
Let me first say a few things about assessment in this course. You will notice that we make

12
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,020
use of polls as well as a special type of quiz based on the principles of confidence-based

13
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,190
assessment. The idea with this is that we not only ask you to say what you think is

14
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,750
the correct answer, we will also get you to rate how confident you are in this answer.

15
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,280
By giving you immediate feedback about whether you were actually correct or not, we hope

16
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,090
to help you identify any confidently held, but incorrect, knowledge. This feedback should

17
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,850
help you better gauge the quality of your knowledge of the course content, and discourage

18
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,370
lucky guessing in quizzes.

19
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,250
Research suggests that people learn more effectively with this type of quiz, and we&#39;re hoping it

20
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,490
will help challenge some of the misconceptions that people have about the criminal justice system.

21
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,960
So why did we create this course? Well the three of us have been teaching courses related

22
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,500
to the psychology of criminal justice for well over a decade. We hoped to achieve two

23
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,780
things in creating this course.

24
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,560
The first was to reach out to all those people who were interested in learning about this

25
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,770
area who otherwise wouldn&#39;t have been in a position to take our course. We think this

26
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:02,090
is not only a very interesting area of study, but it&#39;s one that also has some really 

27
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,000
important real world consequences. 

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,069
The second was to completely overhaul how we taught our on campus course. This has been

29
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:12,950
a unique opportunity to devote a large amount of time and resources to rethinking how we taught

30
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,000
our on campus course. What you will see in the online version of this course is the 

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,140
core of what we plan for the on campus course.

32
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,700
So now it&#39;s time to hand you over to Mark and Barbara, and I’ll see you in the weekly videos!
