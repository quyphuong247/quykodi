Earlier on, we talked about interviews and how to gain accurate and complete information

1
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,689
from witnesses. However, when an investigator believes someone is guilty, they may switch

2
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:29,699
from interviewing the suspect, to interrogating him or her.

3
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,899
Unfortunately, however, these prejudgements of guilt are not always accurate 

4
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:40,660
The goal of interrogation is to gain a confession, and as we saw in the previous video, the forcefulness

5
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,930
of the interrogation can affect the reliability of that confession.

6
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:49,820
Previously, interrogation techniques involved direct physical violence, such as beatings,

7
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,769
burning the skin, and electric shocks. 

8
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:56,509
As these techniques became less acceptable, both to the community, and in the eyes of

9
00:00:56,509 --> 00:01:00,159
the law, more covert methods have been employed.

10
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:05,059
These might involve techniques like near drownings, holding a suspect over a great height, hitting

11
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:10,540
a suspect through telephone books, pressing a suspect against a dead body, or deprivation,

12
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,799
isolation and intimidation.

13
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,960
Many of these so-called &#39;enhanced&#39; interrogation techniques have been alleged to have been

14
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,300
used at various military detention camps in recent years.

15
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,820
More typically, though, in police settings in countries where accusatorial methods are

16
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,130
seen as acceptable, more direct psychological means of coercion have been employed. And

17
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,360
this type of approach is best exemplified by the Inbau, Reid &amp; Buckley’s (1986) nine-step

18
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,520
approach to interrogation.

19
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,840
This interrogation occurs after an initial Behavioural Analysis Interview which is carried

20
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,740
out to determine whether the personal of interest is a suspect and therefore should be formally

21
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,400
interrogated.

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,510
This determination of guilt in this initial interview occurs through an interpretation

23
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:59,409
of non verbal behavioural cues and linguistic and paralinguistic styles that are believed

24
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:04,830
to indicate deception. And we will return to the reliability of nonverbal cues to deception

25
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,530
in a later video.

26
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,810
After the Behavioural Analysis Interview comes the interrogation. And the aim of this is

27
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,330
to establish control over the suspect and to use psychological manipulation to achieve

28
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:22,260
a confession. It is characterised by a closed-ended, confirmatory questioning approach.

29
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,689
The primary goal is that of confession and the method typically yields anxiety based

30
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:28,389
cues to deception.

31
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:35,099
Inbau and Reid specified nine steps in a successful interrogation and the process should begin

32
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:39,919
with the suspect experiencing custody and isolation - that is being kept in a small

33
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:46,919
room and left to experience the anxiety, insecurity and uncertainty associated with police interrogation.

34
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:53,689
The first formal step is confrontation, where the goal is to present evidence of the suspect&#39;s

35
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:58,769
involvement in the crime. This evidence might be real or it might be fictional. The accusation

36
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:03,400
of guilt might be repeated, and if there is no denial then the suspect is actually considered

37
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,189
to be deceptive.

38
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:09,639
Now in the second step of the nine steps is psychological theme development, and how this

39
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:14,449
proceeds depends on the emotionality of the suspect at this stage. For an emotional suspect,

40
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:19,319
the interrogator would use minimisation, that is they would provide a moral or face saving

41
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,719
excuse for the crime.

42
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:25,620
For example, the interrogator of a suspect in a case of rape might say “No woman should

43
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,629
be on the street alone looking like that, that’s too much of a temptation for any

44
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:30,199
man&quot;.

45
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:33,790
Note that throughout this, the assumption is always that the suspect who listens attentively

46
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,840
to these excuses is guilty.

47
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,930
For the suspect who is unemotional at this stage, the aim at this point is a little bit

48
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,010
different. As an interrogator, what you want to get here is an admission of lying about

49
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:50,760
some aspect of the crime. Then you can use the fact that the suspect has lied once to

50
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,739
suggest that they are lying about their innocence.

51
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:59,120
By emphasising the seriousness of the offence and exaggerating the charges, a maximisation

52
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,519
approach might be used in an attempt to scare or intimidate the suspect into confessing.

53
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,540
The third step, interrupting all statements of denial, aims to end suspect&#39;s repetition

54
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,349
of their denial of guilt. And this should actually result in a change of tactics by a guilty

55
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:15,969
suspect.

56
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:20,079
They may provide additional reasons why they couldn&#39;t have committed the crime. For example

57
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,449
by claiming that they didn&#39;t have a gun so they couldn&#39;t have done it. It is assumed

58
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:29,680
that innocent suspects, on the other hand, will not allow their denials to be cut off.

59
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,150
The fourth step is overcoming objections to the charges. Guilty suspects will raise objections,

60
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,600
and the aim of the interrogator is to overcome these by showing understanding but returning

61
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,220
to theme development.

62
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,150
Once the suspect sees that their objections are ineffective, they should become uncertain

63
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:53,570
and withdraw. Innocent suspects should simply continue with their denials.

64
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:59,160
Step five is to retain the suspect&#39;s attention. Once the suspect has withdrawn, the interrogator

65
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,600
should try and reduce the physical distance between themselves and the suspect.

66
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,040
And the sixth step actually involves urging the suspect to tell the truth by showing sympathy and

67
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:15,130
understanding to them. The interrogator should attempt to focus the suspect&#39;s mind on possible reasons

68
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:19,380
for committing the offence and try to create a remorseful mood.

69
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,060
The seventh step is about creating an opportunity to confess by providing an explanation or

70
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,760
excuse for the crime. The interrogator might pose an either or question such as: &quot;Was it

71
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,220
your own idea, or did someone talk you into it?&quot;

72
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:38,310
The final two steps encourage the suspect to recount the details of the crime as part

73
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,000
of a confession and then convert that confession into a written statement. Inbau and colleagues

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,030
have claimed on the basis of their research that this technique was effective.

75
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,100
So why might such an approach work?

76
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,590
Well, the effectiveness of the method can be explained by theories of attitude change.

77
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,240
The positivity or negativity of an attitude towards confessing is related to the relative

78
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,170
perceptions of positive and negative aspects of confessing.

79
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:07,520
The aim of an interrogation using this approach is to get the suspect to think more positively

80
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,690
about confessing and to eliminate any negative consequences of admitting guilt.

81
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:16,710
The way this is done is by giving the suspect the impression that denial will also lead

82
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:21,860
to conviction and also to imply that more lenient consequences will follow if the suspect

83
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,260
actually confesses.

84
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,640
So a suspect&#39;s willingness to confess increases as their attitude to confessing becomes more

85
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,810
positive. The problem is, that this works for both guilty and innocent suspects alike.

86
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,990
Now, one of the main problems with this approach is with the assumptions about how liars and

87
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,940
truth tellers will behave in the context of their initial interview and subsequent interrogation.

88
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,210
In fact, research suggests that liars, due to their concerns about the impression they

89
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:52,950
are creating, behave in precisely the opposite way to that expected in this approach.

90
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:57,960
It is liars who tend to be more helpful and less nervous.

91
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,250
Crucially, this interrogation approach relies on assumed non-verbal behavioural

92
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:07,620
indicators of deception. When these assumed indicators have been evaluated using the scientific

93
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,710
approach they have been found to be unreliable. Further, people are unskilled in accurately

94
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,900
reading non-verbal cues, and we will return to this point in the next video.

95
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:22,139
And so, this had lead some to conclude that the fundamental assumptions underlying this

96
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:26,930
approach are flawed. Interesting, when police officers endorse the cues to deception

97
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:31,900
described in the nine step approach, they show lower levels of lie detection accuracy.

98
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,120
Even more problematically, when people are trained to use aspects of

99
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,670
the nine step approach directly related to deception detection, these people become less

100
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,950
accurate but more confident.

101
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,900
While the nine step approach assumes that the suspect is guilty and applies pressure

102
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:52,930
to extract a confession, there is an alternative approach. In a number of jurisdictions this

103
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,940
came about through legal changes following high profile false confessions that allowed

104
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:02,690
judges more discretion in allowing (or not allowing) confession testimony that had been

105
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,930
obtained through such coercive techniques that I&#39;ve just spoken about.

106
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:12,560
In this method of interviewing, investigators seek to establish rapport with the interviewee

107
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,360
and to use direct positive confrontation of the suspect to elicit confessions or other

108
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,760
self incriminating statements. To do this, open-ended, exploratory questioning approaches

109
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,020
are used.

110
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,510
The fundamental goal of this type of approach is to gather information and this approach

111
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:33,169
yields cognitive cues to deception. Trickery or deception should not be used.

112
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:38,380
So in this technique rapport is developed between the interviewer and interviewee. And

113
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,240
this facilitates a more relaxed atmosphere in which people should be more willing to

114
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,420
talk. The interviewer will then explain the allegation and the seriousness of the offence

115
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,990
and emphasise the importance of honesty and truth to the suspect.

116
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:56,649
The suspect will then be asked to provide their version of the events. During this,

117
00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:02,040
the interviewer should not interrupt and should, instead, actively listen.

118
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,279
Once a full account has been given by the suspect, the questioning can actually begin. For example, the interviewer may

119
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,449
provide the suspect with any inconsistencies or contradictions that they are aware of.

120
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:16,050
And this may involve information that at this point the interviewer knows but has yet to

121
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,509
be revealed to the suspect.

122
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:23,430
However this information must reflect information that is known to the police because police are not

123
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,809
allowed to deceive the suspect.

124
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:30,829
So you can see at this stage that this &#39;information gathering&#39; type of approach looks quite similar

125
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:34,769
to aspects of an eyewitness interview technique we’ve already covered - that is the cognitive

126
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:35,670
interview.

127
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:40,430
However, one obvious problem with this approach is that it does require the cooperation of the

128
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:45,329
suspect to be effective. If your suspect doesn&#39;t want to talk then there there is nothing you can

129
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:49,069
legally do to make them using this technique.

130
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:52,889
But we can perhaps assume that most people would want to tell &#39;their side of a story&#39;

131
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:56,459
particularly if it is alleged that they may have been involved in a crime.

132
00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:02,160
So do police engage in information gathering when interviewing suspects? Well investigative

133
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,059
interviewing with its more information-seeking focus, has been adopted in a number of countries

134
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:10,009
including the United Kingdom, Norway, New Zealand and Australia.

135
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:15,589
Well what is the most effective of dealing with a suspect, and how does this relate to

136
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:17,240
the false confession rate?

137
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:23,149
In 2014, Meissner and colleagues published a meta analysis,that is a study that had the

138
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:28,350
aim of systematically and comprehensively reviewing published and non-published experimental

139
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:33,040
and observational studies on the effectiveness of these different types of techniques.

140
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,449
So they focused on whether an interrogation, information gathering or a combination approach

141
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:43,649
- which they called direct questioning - was taken to suspects and whether true or false

142
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:47,839
confessions were given. They also differentiated studies on the basis of whether they were

143
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,089
conducted in a field setting or whether they were lab based experimental studies.

144
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:58,480
Now in their analyses, in the field studies, the interrogation and information gathering

145
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,399
approaches were positively associated with a large and significant increase in confession

146
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,459
rates. The use of direct questioning - a mixture of the two approaches if you like - was not

147
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,819
significantly associated with an increase in confession rates.

148
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:18,129
Now in terms of false confessions, which could only be assessed in those lab based studies, they

149
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:22,470
considered the effects of the different interview or interrogation techniques on the outcomes

150
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,100
of true or false confessions.

151
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,069
When the interrogation method was directly contrasted with the information seeking approach,

152
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:32,930
the information seeking approach came out on top.

153
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:36,889
So this scientific evidence suggests that an information gathering approach is a better

154
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:39,329
way to interview suspects.

155
00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:43,920
Now earlier in this video, we talked about the possible role of nonverbal cues in helping

156
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,279
us to decide whether the witness is being truthful about their innocence and how decisions

157
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:51,540
into the interview process are based on this.

158
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,399
So in the next video, we&#39;re going to spend some more time considering the research on nonverbal

159
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:57,930
behaviour and how it is linked to being deceptive.
