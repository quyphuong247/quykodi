Okay, so some of you just heard that the defendant, Neil Fox, was found not guilty of murder,

1
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,309
and some of you heard that he was found guilty. If you heard that he was found guilty, you

2
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:31,419
would have also heard that he was sentenced to a lengthy period of jail time.

3
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:33,420
Now was this an appropriate sentence?

4
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,440
Why do we sentence people to jail for different lengths of time?

5
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,920
And what does the public think about the adequacy of sentencing?

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,489
Well, sentencing serves multiple purposes: protection, rehabilitation, accountability

7
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:46,320
and so on.

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,129
The judge takes into account the facts established by the jury when sentencing, as well as a

9
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:51,809
range of other factors.

10
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,679
These include the offender’s history and prospects for rehabilitation, character evidence,

11
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:01,449
any remorse, defendant’s mental state, the nature of the crime and the maximum penalty

12
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:07,210
possible, any sentencing precedents, and whether the punishment fits the crime. The judge also

13
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:13,310
takes into account any aggravating or mitigating factors, and the relevant sentencing guidelines.

14
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,870
Now the over-riding principle is that the sentence must be consistent 

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,480
with the jury’s verdict.

16
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,869
What does the public think about the adequacy of sentencing?

17
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,899
According to research by Hough and colleagues in 1988, the public generally think that harsher

18
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:32,759
sentences are actually required. Other research by Indermaur in 1987 agrees with this, and

19
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,679
showed that people think that the sentences handed down by judges are not severe enough.

20
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:41,770
Indermaur reported an interesting effect however. The less information that participants were

21
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,899
given about the offence, the more severe they thought the sentence should be. This is possibly

22
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:51,340
the result of relying on stereotypes about typical offences, or recalling the most common

23
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,810
offences reported in the media.

24
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,459
As it turns out, Roberts and colleagues showed that most people have a very inaccurate perception

25
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:03,649
of the actual severity of the sentences imposed by the courts, and that people assume that

26
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:06,069
judges are very lenient.

27
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:10,440
However, research by Stalans and Diamond in 1990 shows that when people are given input

28
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,890
into determining the sentences, the public actually award lighter sentences than judges for the

29
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,970
same types of crime.

30
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:23,060
So what factors might influence the public&#39;s confidence in sentences? Or perhaps stated

31
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:28,980
another way, why is it that the public&#39;s perception of the adequacy of sentencing is actually very different

32
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,950
from the reality of sentencing?

33
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,370
Well, the first factor that might influence the public&#39;s perception is selective media

34
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:41,769
exposure. Roberts and colleagues’ 2002 research shows us that the media over reports violent

35
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:44,430
crime, especially on television.

36
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,950
This affects the extent to which people estimate the threat from violent crime poses to

37
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,280
society through what is known as the availability heuristic. This

38
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,049
is when we estimate the likelihood that something will happen based on how easily we can think

39
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:02,670
of examples of that thing. Now because the media reports of violent crime are relatively easy

40
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,650
to remember, we think that violent crime is a relatively common occurrence. In essence,

41
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,299
people over-estimate the degree of threat posed by violent crime, and so they estimate

42
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:16,389
that more severe sentences are required to reduce this threat.

43
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:20,659
The second factor that might be at play is the lack of information about the factors

44
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:26,129
that are taken into account when sentencing. Research by Doob and Roberts in 1984 found

45
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:28,879
that people who read media accounts of sentencing

46
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,120
are less satisfied with sentencing practice.

47
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,730
This is because the media does not typically report all of the factors taken into account

48
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:42,010
by the judge in making a sentencing decision. Stalans and Diamond&#39;s 1990 research that we

49
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,060
mentioned earlier, found that when people had access to all of the information that

50
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,790
judges have when sentencing, they were actually more lenient than judges and so judges were

51
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,480
actually giving harsher sentences than the participants would have given.

52
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,730
So, as for verdicts, the question is really to ask whether sentences are reasonable given

53
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:04,889
the competing goals they are trying satisfy. Whether prison sentences are effective, however,

54
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:08,509
at meeting these goals is the subject of another whole series of lectures!
