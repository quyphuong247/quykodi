So, we’ve shown how we can describe relationships of different strengths between accuracy and

1
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:27,599
confidence. Which of these relationships between accuracy and confidence is true?

2
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,410
Well, criminal justice professionals and laypeople estimate the relationship to be

3
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:38,010
about point seven according to a study by Gary Wells of the University of Alberta.

4
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,010
Is that the reality? Well not according to Robert Bothwell and colleagues

5
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:48,400
from Florida State University, who used a meta-analysis to combine the findings of thirty-five

6
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,530
behavioural studies to estimate this. Their estimate came in at point two five.

7
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:00,810
So – not zero – but a much weaker relationship than the professionals and laypeople believed.

8
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:06,390
Where there’s a huge amount of overlap between the confidence levels of the accurate

9
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:13,110
and inaccurate eyewitnesses. This essentially means that, in practice, an individual eyewitness’s

10
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,740
confidence shouldn’t really be used to judge their accuracy.

11
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,360
Here’s what leading eyewitness memory researcher Elizabeth Loftus has to say on the matter,

12
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,080
linking back to our previous discussion of false memories.

13
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,740
Okay, but surely if I&#39;m really confident about my belief or my recollection 

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,340
and it&#39;s really sincere and really emotional, surely that means it&#39;s more likely to be an accurate memory?

15
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:46,580
Well it may be slightly more likely to be an accurate memory if you&#39;re really confident about it, 

16
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,040
but confidence is not a good indicator that your memory is accurate 

17
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,780
because false memories can be expressed with a lot of confidence, 

18
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:02,920
they can be expressed with a lot of detail, they can be expressed with a lot of emotion.

19
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,080
And so they have the same characteristics as true memories, 

20
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,540
and just relying on those characteristics can mis-lead people into thinking that something is real when it&#39;s not.

21
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:20,989
So, overall, confidence appears to be problematic when used as a marker of an eyewitness’s

22
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:25,070
accuracy. But, and it’s a big &#39;but&#39;, Bothwell’s

23
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:30,390
point two five correlation is the overall correlation across lots of different outcomes

24
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,670
and situations. Is it the case that this correlation stays

25
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:40,670
the same under all circumstances? Well, the answer is &#39;no&#39;, and that’s why the

26
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,490
truth of this confidence-accuracy relationship has turned out to be rather more complex than

27
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:50,600
was originally thought. For a start, Robert Bothwell found that the

28
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:57,600
correlation increased IF the eyewitness had viewed the perpetrator for a longer duration.

29
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,160
So – while it might be considered common-sense that an eyewitness’s identification accuracy

30
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:09,040
would improve the longer they viewed the perpetrator – it’s also the case that the degree to

31
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,650
which their level of confidence becomes a reliable indicator of their accuracy also

32
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:21,600
improves the longer they viewed the perpetrator. Let’s look at another variable: whether

33
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,870
the eyewitness actually identified the suspect or not.

34
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:31,100
So - they can either identify the suspect as being the criminal or they can reject them

35
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,840
as not being the criminal. Siegfried Sporer of the University of Aberdeen

36
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,319
and colleagues found that the extent to which eyewitness confidence predicted their level

37
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:47,930
of accuracy depended on what the outcome was. When eyewitnesses didn’t identify the suspect

38
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:53,709
as being the criminal – the correlation between confidence and accuracy dropped to

39
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:59,130
point one – virtually zero. That means the eyewitness’s confidence in

40
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:05,380
this case tells us pretty much nothing about whether they’re right or wrong.

41
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,360
However when the eyewitness did identify the suspect as being the criminal – the correlation

42
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,060
coefficient rose to point four. That means the eyewitness’s confidence in

43
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:21,280
this case does offer some information about whether they’re right or wrong.

44
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,620
Lots of other factors have also been found to affect the extent to which confidence predicts

45
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,740
accuracy. One example is the extent to which an innocent

46
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,410
suspect and the criminal look similar. Another influencing factor is the age of the

47
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:40,310
eyewitness – for instance, child witnesses’ confidence tells us very little about accuracy

48
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:46,210
compared with adult witnesses. However, maybe we can control or screen for

49
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:51,720
all these sorts of things – and then perhaps we can get something useful out of eyewitness

50
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,740
confidence? Well – there is one further big problem

51
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:01,630
with eyewitness confidence – especially in a trial setting – which is that it can

52
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:06,830
changed – it can be manipulated - with scary ease.

53
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:12,410
For example, if I wanted to make the eyewitness more confident, all I need to do is provide

54
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,550
some encouraging feedback after, say, the lineup.

55
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,600
Something like, “Good, you identified the suspect”, or, Excellent – that’s

56
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:26,650
who the other eyewitnesses identified too.” If I wanted to make the eyewitness less confident

57
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,840
all I need to do is provide feedback implying that they may have made the wrong choice.

58
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,680
I could even provide indirect feedback, not about their decision, but about whether an

59
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,360
easy ID is expected or not under the circumstances. For instance, I could say “You must have

60
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,350
got a pretty clear view of the criminal from where you were” or “I realise it must

61
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:53,040
be tricky to identify the criminal under those sort of circumstances.”

62
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,710
It’s not hard to imagine these sorts of interventions occurring in a real life criminal

63
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:04,710
justice situation, even without even any deliberate intent on the part of the manipulator.

64
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:09,889
And it’s been found that you can even influence whether an eyewitness is willing to testify

65
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:16,889
at all or not, by this sort of influence. Overall, these factors come together so

66
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:23,250
that when we get to the court room it’s clear that it would be potentially very dangerous

67
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,670
to rely on the eyewitness’s level of confidence in order to determine whether 

68
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,500
or not to believe them. However, is this really the best we can

69
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:39,540
expect of confidence as an indicator of eyewitness accuracy?

70
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,300
In the next presentation, we’ll look at the work of one research team who have argued

71
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:52,280
that we can do better, if we can find the right circumstances and find the right techniques.
