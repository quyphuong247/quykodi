So, we’ve seen that overall looking at correlations, confidence is only a weak predictor of accuracy.

1
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,420
Well, some researchers have argued that using correlations to examine the relationship

2
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,950
between confidence and accuracy is crude and nasty.

3
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:39,770
This is because a correlation only describes a simple one-to-one straight line relationship,

4
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,470
where the real relationship might be more complex than this – and might be contingent

5
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:49,650
on other factors. So, what happens when we use more refined

6
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,410
and sophisticated techniques to look at the accuracy-confidence relationship?

7
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,900
Neil Brewer of Flinders University and Gary Wells describe calibration techniques that

8
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:07,900
allow us to calculate how over or under confident an eyewitness is for a range of different

9
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:13,110
accuracy levels. These techniques require that we can get more

10
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:19,049
than one identification judgement per eyewitness. Basically, you end up with an accuracy versus

11
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:26,049
confidence plot, where values under the diagonal represent over-confidence and values

12
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:33,289
over the diagonal represent under-confidence. Crucially, rather than just measuring accuracy

13
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:39,249
as either being accurate or not-accurate as before, we instead extract a full range

14
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:44,840
of percent correct judgements. What Brewer and Wells found using these more

15
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:51,270
refined measurement techniques was that it was possible to demonstrate much higher confidence-accuracy

16
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:58,109
relationships under certain circumstances than we found with traditional correlations.

17
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:04,689
That is, confidence can be used as a reliable index of accuracy, but only under specific

18
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:09,429
controlled situations. Of course it&#39;s one thing demonstrating these

19
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:14,290
effects in research studies, and quite another to find a use for them in real-life

20
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,870
forensic situations. So, can we operationalise these circumstances

21
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:26,870
and leverage the predictive value of witness confidence in a real-life forensic setting?

22
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,710
This leads me back to what I was talking about in the presentations about line-ups – is

23
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:38,520
there a better alternative to the traditional line-up?

24
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,280
Neil Brewer and his colleagues have devised just such a procedure, which takes advantage

25
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:50,030
of what previous research has revealed about the circumstances under which an eyewitness’s

26
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:57,030
confidence is a good predictor of their accuracy. To start with, Brewer’s procedure involves

27
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:04,310
only taking account of confidence when an eyewitness does identify a suspect as the

28
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,610
criminal. They don’t ask the eyewitness to categorically

29
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,120
identify anyone in the line-up as definitely being the criminal.

30
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,370
So, it is the confidence ratings themselves that are used to determine the likelihood

31
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,920
that an identification is accurate, or isn’t accurate.

32
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,160
Here’s a demonstration of what their procedure might look like.

33
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,440
There are a few ways in which it differs from traditional line-ups 

34
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,110
that we’ve already seen. First of all, instead of indicating whether

35
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:40,110
each face is the criminal or not, the eyewitness rates each face on a confidence scale.

36
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:47,060
You end up with a confidence rating for each face rather than a &#39;yes&#39; or &#39;no&#39; judgement.

37
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,320
Brewer also took account of other psychological findings in his procedure.

38
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,480
For example, previous research has found that the speed of making the identification was

39
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,120
a predictor of identification accuracy. Fast identifications were more likely to be

40
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,660
accurate, but slower identifications were more likely to yield false identifications,

41
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:13,930
where it’s been proposed that the extra time allows more biases to creep into the

42
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,350
decision. So, in Brewer’s procedure, eyewitnesses

43
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:23,539
are allowed no more than three seconds to look at each person in the line-up and make

44
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:27,690
their confidence rating. Also, this procedure is explicitly attempting

45
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:33,300
to use confidence ratings taken before they can be influenced by all the sorts of biasing

46
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,510
factors that we’ve mentioned, that is, right at the point of the identification and

47
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:43,360
not after any sort of delay. Finally, following the research described

48
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,389
in the line-up presentation, eyewitnesses in Brewer’s procedure view faces sequentially

49
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:53,310
rather than simultaneously. At the end of the procedure, you just

50
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,670
end up with a confidence rating for every face in the line-up, without any yes-no

51
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,940
judgments. Then Brewer applies a classification algorithm

52
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:09,650
to process these confidence ratings in order to determine whether any of the faces were

53
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:14,740
identified with sufficient confidence to be likely to be the criminal – using ratings

54
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:20,680
of the foils as a baseline. That is, it is the confidence ratings themselves

55
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,639
that are processed to determine whether the suspect is likely to be the criminal or not.

56
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,260
Brewer and his team then tested their new procedure head-to-head with a more traditional

57
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:37,790
line-up – and found that it substantially outperformed it in terms of generating accurate

58
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:42,850
identifications. They reported that decision accuracy was between

59
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:48,440
twenty-four percent and sixty-six percent higher under their new procedure as compared

60
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:54,480
with under the traditional line-up procedure. So, it’s another example, like cognitive

61
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,580
interview and Evofit, of how applying psychological theory and research can potentially

62
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:05,430
lead to useful improvements in a problematic aspect of the criminal justice system.

63
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:10,520
As with all of these things, there are limitations. For example, Brewer’s team acknowledge that

64
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:16,940
courts are unlikely to accept confidence ratings in the same way as black-and-white yes-no

65
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:23,150
identifications for convicting people, even if they can be proved to do a better job.

66
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,730
They also accept that in a court-room setting, it’s still the case that, from a juror’s

67
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:33,680
perspective, an individual eyewitness’s confidence is a poor predictor of their level

68
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,449
of accuracy. However, they argue that at the level

69
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:43,530
of the police investigation, there is no reason why their new technique couldn’t be used

70
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:50,530
to improve eyewitnesses&#39; ability to identify the right person.
