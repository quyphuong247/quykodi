At the core of criminal profiling is the belief that you can tell something about the offender,

1
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:26,529
their characteristics if you like, by a careful and considered examination of the offence.

2
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:30,390
So after a crime has been committed you use all the information that you can gather about

3
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,590
the crime. For example, details about the crime: what occurred, where it occurred

4
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:41,140
and information either from or about the victim. And you use this to draw up a profile of the

5
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,180
characteristics of the person who most likely committed the crime.

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:49,640
This may include information on demographic features, so their age, their gender, their ethnicity.

7
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,530
And, depending on your approach, this profile might include information on the perpetrator&#39;s

8
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,710
likely motivation. Why are they engaging in this behaviour, and why did the crime take

9
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,140
place when and where it did?

10
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:07,360
Offender profiling is typically used in serious crimes like murder and in serial crimes, and

11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,470
also when it is difficult to identify the offender using standard methods.

12
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:16,600
So when described like this, criminal profiling sounds very straightforward. But, although

13
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,640
pretty much everyone agrees on the basic principle, there is actually a lot of debate about how

14
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,640
to do this in practice, and different approaches have emerged.

15
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,280
So if we think about how a profile of an offender is created we can see there are a few different

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,200
approaches. These include the FBI&#39;s Criminal Investigative Analysis and the 

17
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,200
Investigative Psychology approach, which is most commonly associated with David Canter. There is also

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,170
diagnostic evaluation and the recently developed crime action profiling.

19
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,400
And within these approaches you also have specialities if you like, that focus on one

20
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,490
element. So geographical profiling, for example, is often used in an attempt to locate

21
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:59,710
where the offender is based given his or her offending locations. So what we&#39;re going

22
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,829
to do is consider just a few of these. Those where more has been written about the approaches

23
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:05,210
that they take.

24
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:10,280
Now probably the most famous approach to criminal profiling is Criminal Investigative Analysis.

25
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,739
This approach was initially developed at the FBI Academy in Virginia and then later in

26
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:16,340
the Behavioral Science Unit.

27
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,630
It came about through an increasing awareness amongst investigators that apprehended offenders,

28
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:26,099
who had been identified using traditional investigation techniques, appeared to share

29
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:31,700
characteristics and exhibit particular patterns of behaviour at their crime scenes. 

30
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,730
So that led to the question: is it possible to get clues from the crime scene and the surviving

31
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,319
victims that would give the investigators the most probable personality and demographic

32
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,040
characteristics of the offender?

33
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,280
Now obviously this would be useful, as it would allow the investigators to focus their

34
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,750
attention on the most likely offenders rather than having to investigate a very large pool

35
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,200
of suspects.

36
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,480
So they started by drawing on their own officers experience in the investigation of serious

37
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,099
sexual assault and murder, and they also carried out in-depth interviews with a small number

38
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:06,680
of convicted sexual murderers who volunteered. But bearing in mind that these murderers

39
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,769
memories for their crimes were unlikely to be perfect, and that convicted volunteers

40
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:14,220
may not be representative of the broader category of murderers.

41
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,099
However, the aim of these activities was to identify the major personality and behavioural

42
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:24,290
characteristics that this type of offender had. And, critically, how the personality

43
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:30,200
seen in this type of offender differed from that typically seen in the general population.

44
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,750
Now this analysis led FBI investigators to propose typologies of offenders, such that,

45
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,459
for example, an offender could be categorised as organised or disorganised, or in some instances

46
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,680
a mixture or combination of both.

47
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,260
 So, and if we stick with the crime of murder,

48
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,180
 an organised offender would be someone who led an orderly life and this is reflected in the

49
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,409
way that they commit their crime.

50
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:57,830
The organised offender is claimed to be of average to high intelligence, socially competent,

51
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:02,900
and more likely than the disorganised offender to have skilled employment.

52
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,180
He typically plans his offences, he uses restraints on his victim, brings a weapon with him to

53
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,879
commit the murder and then takes it away with him from the crime scene.

54
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,930
Now this organised behaviour at the crime scene allows some inference of likely behavioural

55
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,560
and motivational characteristics. So, for example, the likelihood that there was some

56
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,960
situational stress that precipitated the assault.

57
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,060
Now in contrast the disorganised offender commits crimes that appear to have had little

58
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,810
preparation or planning. So, the crime scene might show evidence of almost random, unplanned

59
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,900
or disorganised behaviour. The offender may use whatever is at hand as a weapon, 

60
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,830
and that weapon may then be left at the scene. Also there may be little attempt to conceal other

61
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,340
evidence at the crime scene.

62
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,500
Now typically this type of offender was thought to be socially incompetent and to have below

63
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,470
average intelligence, and to be more likely to be living alone and to live and work near

64
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,460
the crime scene.

65
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,940
Now although not a direct product of the original in-depth interviews with offenders, 

66
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,560
later, a &#39;mixed&#39; offender classification was added in. Now this occurs when some elements

67
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,940
of the crime look organised but other bits seem disorganised. This might occur when elements

68
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,150
of the situation when the crime took place took the offender by surprise.

69
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,710
So maybe there was more than one person present at the scene, when the offender thought there

70
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:26,729
would only be one. Maybe the person was stronger than the offender thought, so when they fought

71
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:31,520
back it was actually a real fight. Another possibility is that the offender&#39;s method of

72
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,870
offending has evolved since the last crime they committed. So, in the case of murder,

73
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,970
because the offender&#39;s new method is partially untested it might not go quite to plan.

74
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:46,310
As Hazelwood and Warren in 2001 noted, &#39;in fantasy everything works out perfectly&#39;.

75
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:51,900
However in reality and in acting out this fantasy, this rarely occurs. So maybe the

76
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,800
method of killing wasn&#39;t as efficient as the offender thought it would be, and so a

77
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,030
real struggle occurred while the offender was trying to kill.

78
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,300
So these things would be surprising to the offender, who might otherwise be quite organised,

79
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,990
and that would lead to elements of the offence looking quite disorganised.

80
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:12,380
Now, key in this approach is the classification of the crime by the motive. 

81
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,300
That is why the crime was committed. However, of course, at the point where the

82
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,060
crime has just occurred, you don&#39;t know this. So you start with what you do know.

83
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,360
That is you look to the behavioural features that are present in the crime.

84
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,770
Using a multi stage process, the investigator needs to consider all the available information

85
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:34,210
about the victim, the crime scene or crime scenes and the details of the interpersonal

86
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,620
transaction - maybe through using a detailed reconstruction.

87
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,350
The investigator also needs to consider all the available forensic information, and make

88
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:47,090
some judgements in relation to the crime scene. Does it look organised or disorganised, do

89
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,889
elements of it look inconsistent and therefore possibly staged; that is, deliberately altered

90
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:56,600
in an attempt to mislead the investigators? They need to determine how the crime committed,

91
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,120
that is - what is the modus operandi?

92
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,650
Also is there a signature present? That is an individualised or specific way in which

93
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:08,030
the crime has been committed that tells you about the personality of the offender and

94
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,310
may be able to help you link this crime to other crimes.

95
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:15,770
Now the signature can often be a seemingly unnecessary part of the crime. It serves

96
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:21,000
no obvious purpose, like helping the offender to escape. Rather it is serving another purpose

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,270
for the offender. For example, the offender may take an object from the crime scene, 

98
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:30,650
like the victim&#39;s house keys, to fulfil some psychological or emotional desire.

99
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:35,389
So as an investigator you get the material or details from the crime; the WHAT, then

100
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:39,530
you try and determine the WHY of the crime, that is the motivation for each crime scene

101
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,509
detail and for the crime, before moving to the WHO of the crime.

102
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:48,080
Now the resulting profile will contain hypotheses about the likely demographic and physical

103
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,780
characteristics of the offender. So things like their ethnicity, their age, their type

104
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:58,069
of occupation, some comment on their marital status and on their family characteristics,

105
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:04,160
and also whether they own or have access to a vehicle and its most likely age and type.

106
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,319
Also typically there will be some hypotheses as to the offenders behavioural habits. So

107
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,419
whether they have any previous convictions and if so, for what type of offence. 

108
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,080
Or whether they&#39;ve ever served in the military.

109
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,889
Comments will also be made as to their likely social interests and personality dynamics.

110
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:24,080
So their intelligence, their likely educational level, and whether there may be any evidence

111
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,620
of psychopathology. Now that profile might also include information on their pre- offence

112
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,390
behaviour leading to the crime and also what they&#39;ve done since - their post offence

113
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:39,140
behaviour. It may also include recommendations for identifying, apprehending and interviewing

114
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:39,940
the offender.
