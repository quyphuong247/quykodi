Given the generally poor rates of lie detection accuracy shown by people, and also by some law

1
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,439
enforcement groups, can we turn to machines to help us improve our accuracy?

2
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,680
When most people think of lie-detecting machines, they probably think of the polygraph, which

3
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,670
is also sometimes simply called a lie detector. You&#39;ve probably seen a polygraph in various

4
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,140
movies, like ‘Meet the Parents’, and on various TV shows.

5
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,070
The polygraph is a machine that simultaneously records a number of physiological responses

6
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:49,799
from sensors placed on the body. The name ‘polygraph’ actually mean exactly this:

7
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,970
&#39;poly&#39; meaning &#39;many&#39;, and &#39;grapho&#39; means &#39;to write&#39;.

8
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:58,690
The polygraph output can be displayed either on paper or on a screen. That output can show

9
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:03,339
galvanic skin response, which is an indirect way of measuring sweating, blood pressure,

10
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:06,680
heart rate, and respiration, which is breathing.

11
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,670
The assumption is that lying is accompanied by identifiable and predictable physiological

12
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,640
activity in the liar&#39;s body. This is actually a pretty old assumption.

13
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,509
Quite some time ago, Chinese investigators used to force suspected liars to fill their

14
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:25,460
cheeks with rice powder. If the powder remained dry, the person was identified as a liar.

15
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,860
So when is the polygraph actually used?

16
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,290
It’s been used for criminal and forensic investigations in a number of countries such

17
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:39,060
as Canada, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Pakistan, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand,

18
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,460
and the United States of America. There have also been some trials of

19
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,190
the polygraph in the United Kingdom.

20
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:49,550
The use of a variation of the lie detector test based only on voice was actually recently

21
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:55,520
abandoned in the United Kingdom in 2010 due to low levels of reliability. The UK government

22
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,850
had hoped that the test would allow people who were cheating the social welfare system

23
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,190
to be identified when they called benefit offices.

24
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,479
They are however used in prisons.

25
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,810
There has also been some use for employment screening, although this is limited in the

26
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:14,420
United States of America by the Polygraph Protection Act of 1988. Their use in courts

27
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,390
is also somewhat restricted, as polygraphs aren&#39;t accepted as evidence in many jurisdictions

28
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,560
So how do they work? And, perhaps more importantly, do they work?

29
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,150
Well, there are actually different ways of using a polygraph. The most commonly used,

30
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,439
and also most commonly disputed test, is the control question test.

31
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:38,889
This test compares responses to deception-relevant questions with responses to control questions.

32
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:41,870
Generally there might be ten of these questions all up.

33
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,029
The relevant questions might be specific questions about a crime. For example:

34
00:02:46,029 --> 00:02:50,760
&quot;On May 17, did you stab Frank Redmond?&quot;

35
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,249
Control questions refer to acts that are related to the crime but do not actually refer to

36
00:02:55,249 --> 00:03:00,340
the crime in question. These will be more general, vague, and cover long periods of

37
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,249
time.

38
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:05,969
The idea with these questions is to embarrass the suspect so that they are forced to lie.

39
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:09,069
This has the effect of increasing their level of physiological arousal.

40
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:13,109
For example, you might ask a suspect: &quot;Have you ever tried to hurt someone to get

41
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,290
revenge?&quot;

42
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,169
The suspect will be told that answering ‘yes’ to this question will lead the investigator

43
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:23,129
to assume that they are the type of person who would commit the crime in question.

44
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:26,480
So how does this test tell us whether someone is lying or not?

45
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,909
Well, it makes two assumptions.

46
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:33,099
The first is that an innocent suspect will show higher levels of arousal for control

47
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:38,400
questions compared to relevant questions. This is because they have to respond deceptively

48
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,590
to the control questions, but they respond truthfully to the relevant questions.

49
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,040
The second assumption is that a guilty suspect will show higher levels of arousal to relevant

50
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,199
questions compared to the control questions. Although they will respond deceptively to

51
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:56,799
both types of questions, the relevant questions pose a more immediate threat to the suspect

52
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,040
and so they should elicit a stronger physiological response.

53
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,730
As an aside, if the guilty suspect doesn&#39;t respond deceptively, then they have essentially

54
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,739
confessed to the crime and we don’t need to do a polygraph.

55
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,379
To work out whether the suspect is innocent or not, the polygraph tester will look at

56
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:15,870
the output recorded by the machine and then rate the differences in physiological responses

57
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,650
to each of the question types. The differences are generally rated from minus three to positive

58
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:21,190
three.

59
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:25,300
If, on the basis of these ratings, the suspect fails the test, they are pressured into a

60
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,130
confession in a post-test interview.

61
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,580
The second type of polygraph test is called the guilty knowledge test.

62
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,650
This test aims to determine whether the suspect has knowledge about a particular crime that

63
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,690
they do not want to reveal.

64
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,539
For example, imagine the following scenario:

65
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:45,530
A suspect has killed a person with a knife. They deny this during an interview

66
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,720
and then the polygraph examiner then shows the suspect a series of knives, including the

67
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,729
one used in the killing. For each knife, the examiner asks the suspect if he or she recognises

68
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:56,289
it.

69
00:04:56,289 --> 00:05:01,569
Now, both an innocent and a guilty suspect will deny recognising the knife. The difference

70
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:05,310
however, is that the guilty suspect should show a heightened physiological response when

71
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,090
shown the correct knife that was actually used in the crime. For the innocent suspect,

72
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:15,069
all of the knives produce the same reaction because none of them have been seen before.

73
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:18,220
Now obviously you can only use this version of the test if you have a piece of evidence,

74
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:24,050
like a knife, that you can show the suspect, and that hasn&#39;t been reported in the media.

75
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,439
So how reliable are these tests?

76
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:31,379
Well, despite some of the claims made by companies that offer polygraph services, the accuracy

77
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:33,439
rate varies quite a bit.

78
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:38,060
As you can see, while the accuracy rates seem a bit better than those for relying on nonverbal

79
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,720
behaviour, they don&#39;t always perform at the levels that some people think, and are quite

80
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,669
a way off being one-hundred percent accurate. You can also see that the accuracy depends

81
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:52,039
on whether you are trying to detect a truth or detect a lie, and for the crucial role

82
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:56,780
of lie detection, accuracy can fall to levels not much higher than chance for the guilty

83
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,129
knowledge test.

84
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:02,879
When we look at polygraph accuracy across a large number of studies, we can see that

85
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:09,080
there are about 78% of guilty suspects are classified accurately as being guilty. Almost

86
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,509
70% of innocent suspects are classified correctly as being innocent. Now although these figures

87
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:20,270
seem reasonably reassuring, just over 15% of innocent people are incorrectly classified

88
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:26,219
as being guilty, and about 10% of guilty people are incorrectly classified as being innocent.

89
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:31,580
Now while some people might be willing to accept these accuracy rates, even though they

90
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,629
are less than perfect, the issue is actually a bit more complicated than that. To get a

91
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:40,590
full understanding of how reliable polygraphs are, we need to take into account the underlying

92
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:45,150
base rate of deception when we use a polygraph. And this can actually be pretty difficult

93
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,500
to know.

94
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,090
So let&#39;s take the accuracy percentages we just talked about, and apply those to a context

95
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:55,840
in which the rate of deception is 50%, which might be typical in an experiment testing

96
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,539
the validity of a polygraph. So imagine we have 500 liars and 500 truth tellers.

97
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:07,020
When we do this, we can generate a table like the one you see now. This table combines the

98
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:12,169
percentages of correctly and incorrectly identified liars and truth tellers and applies that to

99
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:15,620
our 500 liars and 500 truth tellers.

100
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,060
Now the numbers on the right, just outside of the table, tell us how many people were

101
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,939
accused of being liars (next to the positive row) and how many people were identified as

102
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:26,629
truth tellers (next to the negative row).

103
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:32,930
So there were 471 people identified as liars and 398 people identified as truth tellers.

104
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,900
We can work out the chance that a person identified as a liar is actually a liar, and the chance

105
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:43,280
that a person who is identified as a truth teller is actually a truth teller.

106
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:50,129
So for each of the 471 people accused of lying on the basis of this test, there is a 83.44%

107
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:52,960
chance that he or she is actually lying.

108
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,669
And for each of the 398 people certified as being honest, there is an 87.69% chance that

109
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:02,270
he or she is actually honest.

110
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:07,189
Now that doesn&#39;t look so bad, still not perfect, but perfection is difficult to achieve.

111
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:12,310
What happens when the base rate of deception decreases however? Is it really the case that half

112
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,360
the people who might take a polygraph are being deceptive?

113
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,099
Let&#39;s rework those numbers but this time assume a base rate for deception of 5%. So we have

114
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:24,879
50 liars in a group of 1000 people.

115
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,659
When we do this, we can see that the numbers actually change quite a bit. So let&#39;s work

116
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:34,450
out the chance that a person who fails the test is actually lying. There are now 186

117
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:39,659
people accused of lying, but for each one of these, there is only a 20.97% chance that

118
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:44,790
he or she is actually lying because the test now identifies a large number of people as

119
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,190
liars even though they are actually truth tellers.

120
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:54,650
For each of the 667 people classified as being honest, there is a 99.25% chance that he or

121
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:58,290
she is actually honest. This looks more reassuring.

122
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:03,730
So in sum, although the polygraph can discriminate between liars and truth tellers, the number

123
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,800
of false positives is rather high. False positives are those people identified by the test as

124
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,690
liars, but who are actually telling the truth.

125
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,570
So perhaps the best use of the polygraph is to identify when people are telling a truth,

126
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,700
rather than when they are telling a lie. In other words, use the test to rule people out

127
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,120
of an investigation, rather than rule them in as a suspect.

128
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,650
So why don&#39;t polygraphs perform better? What are the problems with polygraphs?

129
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:34,260
Well, one of the problems we have already discussed are potentially low base rates of

130
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,840
deception. It’s difficult to get an accurate estimate of these base rates in real life

131
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,530
as we’ve already said.

132
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:43,810
Some people are also relatively emotionally non-reactive, and so they don&#39;t produce the

133
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,760
physiological responses we expect to see when lying.

134
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,540
It&#39;s also possible that innocent people may react strongly to questions about whether

135
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:56,820
they committed a crime or not, because they worry that nobody will believe they are innocent.

136
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,220
The polygraph examiner also has to convince the suspect that the polygraph is a flawless

137
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,320
detector of lies for it to be most effective and most accurate. This necessarily involves

138
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,730
lying to the suspect, which is not be allowed in many jurisdictions.

139
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:15,220
A problem specific to the guilty knowledge test is that a suspect may well admit to having

140
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,580
guilty knowledge but deny that they were the person who committed the crime. For example,

141
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:25,330
it&#39;s possible they know which knife was used because the actual criminal told them or showed

142
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:30,180
it to them. The test can&#39;t differentiate between this type of knowledge and guilty knowledge

143
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,690
due to actually committing the crime.

144
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:37,790
Also, as we mentioned before, the guilty knowledge test can only be used when there is sufficient

145
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:42,770
specific details about a crime known to the investigators, and these details haven&#39;t been

146
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,060
released to the public.

147
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:49,600
More generally, polygraphs suffer from a lack of standardisation. The scoring is subjective,

148
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,410
and the questions will differ from test to test.

149
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,940
Another problem is that suspects may employ countermeasures in an attempt to defeat the

150
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:02,100
polygraph. For example, they might bite their tongue or press their toes on the floor. According

151
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,070
to research by Honts and colleagues in 1994, these types of counter measures can actually

152
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:11,180
reduce the detection of lies by 50%.

153
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,440
Another reason why we should be cautious about claims made about the accuracy of polygraphs

154
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,830
is that it&#39;s very difficult to actually test the accuracy of polygraphs, mainly for two

155
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:25,740
reasons. In the lab, studies don&#39;t involve the same severity of consequences for participants.

156
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,330
It simply would not be ethical to put research participants in the same context that a real

157
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:35,610
suspect experiences. And while field studies might seem like a solution to this, unfortunately

158
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,860
we can never know for certain who is lying once we test the polygraph outside of a lab

159
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,530
setting.

160
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,970
So what about other machines that might help us detect lies?

161
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,880
Well, some researchers such as Kozel and colleagues suggest that activity in particular brain

162
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,130
regions, such as the right anterior cingulate gyrus, might be a better test of whether someone

163
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,630
is lying or not.

164
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:59,810
One way we can measure activity in the brain is by using fMRI. fMRI stands for functional

165
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:04,770
magnetic resonance imagining, and it is a machine that is used to image how brain activation

166
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:08,120
changes over time in response to different stimuli.

167
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,030
It does this by using a very large magnet to detect changes in blood oxygenation in

168
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:16,890
the brain, and it is assumed that increases in blood oxygenation are associated with increased

169
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,860
brain activity in those regions.

170
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,000
Langelben and colleagues 

171
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,610
suggest that fMRI has high deception classification accuracy, and they suggest

172
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,480
that such a test could be feasible for practical use. However, one issue is that fMRI machines

173
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,990
are very expensive to purchase and run, and not particularly portable. And they also require

174
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,290
highly trained staff to run them and interpret the scans. It&#39;s also not clear whether the

175
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,880
courts would accept evidence based on an fMRI scan.

176
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,420
So, the research leaves us with a somewhat difficult conclusion. Non-verbal behaviour

177
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:51,720
is not a great marker of deception, and polygraphs are not fantastically reliable either. It

178
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,980
is worth knowing this however, because it is important that people, such as investigators

179
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,960
and jurors, don&#39;t rely on unreliable indicators of deception and truth when making important

180
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,280
decisions. And perhaps it’s best if people focus on the strength of the evidence when

181
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,529
trying to decide if someone is being deceptive.
