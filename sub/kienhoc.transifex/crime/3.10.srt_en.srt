Next week on Crime 101!

1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,560
Then there&#39;s the knife.

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,760
Where did you get it?

3
00:00:07,946 --> 00:00:10,866
If I tell you will you let me go?

4
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:13,546
I&#39;m tired of the &#39;softly softly&#39;.

5
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:17,806
You may have been hot stuff once, Kate, but you slipped with this one.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,180
You OK? You look a bit flushed.

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,440
Oh - I&#39;m totally fine.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,120
I guess it would be the first one

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,420
Is that right?

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,820
I usually turn that off.

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,240
You were a bit flustered when you came in here.
