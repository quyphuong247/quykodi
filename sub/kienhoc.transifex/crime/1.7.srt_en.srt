00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,100
(Dramatic music)

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,160
Oh my God! Someone help! Janine!

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,520
Police! Move!

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,680
Detective Kate Warne. Thank you very much for coming in. I&#39;m really sorry about the wait.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,400
I see her - Janine - only I didn&#39;t know it was Janine.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,380
Memory&#39;s a fragile thing. Go at it too hard and you&#39;ll crush it.

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,920
Go at it too marshmallow and they&#39;ll walk all over you.

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,960
Now hang on mate.

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,960
No you hang on. There&#39;s a dead girl lying on a cold bit of steel in a refrigerator,

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,160
and it&#39;s my job to figure out who the hell put her there. Now sit back down!
