The key theme running through the last few presentations is that the accuracy of eyewitnesses&#39;

1
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:28,960
memory can be unreliable. So – is there any way in which we can differentiate

2
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,629
between an accurate memory and an inaccurate one?

3
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:40,379
Well – one possible indicator of an eyewitness’s accuracy is their level of confidence.

4
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:46,379
So – if an eyewitness says that they are absolutely definitely sure that a suspect

5
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:52,730
is the criminal – then presumably this judgement is likely to be more accurate than another

6
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:58,350
eyewitness who says that the suspect could be the criminal but they’re not completely

7
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,440
certain. In fact, some have argued that the confidence

8
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,770
an eyewitness displays is the most important factor in whether jurors and criminal justice

9
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:13,850
professionals believe their testimony or not. This is backed up by behavioural data, showing

10
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:20,810
a very strong relationship between the confidence shown by a witness and whether they’re considered

11
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:26,590
to be reliable by both laypeople and legal professionals.

12
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:32,280
In fact, in several Australian jurisdictions, judges will actually cite witness confidence

13
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:39,280
as an example of an indicator of witness credibility in their instructions to the jury.

14
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:46,420
So – is this all true? To what extent does an eyewitness’s confidence actually predict

15
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,200
their accuracy? Psychologists have investigated this question

16
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,989
and while it’s not true that confidence tells you literally nothing about accuracy

17
00:01:56,989 --> 00:02:03,989
– the relationship has turned out to be much more complicated than previously thought.

18
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:10,209
To understand this, I’m going to need to explain what a correlation coefficient is.

19
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:16,170
A correlation coefficient is a statistic that measures the strength of a relationship between

20
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,890
two variables. It’s easiest to explain using a graph.

21
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:28,359
On this scatterplot, the range on the vertical axis shows all possible levels of an eyewitness’s

22
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:33,939
confidence – no confidence at the bottom to complete confidence at the top.

23
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:40,170
The horizontal axis shows two categories of accuracy – inaccurate – they got the identification

24
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,260
wrong – and accurate – they got the identification correct.

25
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:54,740
So first of all, let’s show the situation where confidence is a perfect predictor of accuracy.

26
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,920
Each dot I&#39;m going to draw here is a different eyewitness.

27
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:06,930
The first eyewitness is 100% confident – and made a correct identification.

28
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,659
The second eyewitness is completely lacking in confidence – and turns out to be giving

29
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:18,189
us an inaccurate identification. And so on with other eyewitnesses – who

30
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:23,379
stand right on top of either one of the first two dots.

31
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:29,439
So – in this first example – we have no overlap between the accurate and inaccurate

32
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:36,019
eyewitnesses – all of the accurate eyewitnesses have the same level of confidence which was

33
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:42,069
100%, and all of the inaccurate eyewitnesses also have the same level of confidence but

34
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:45,129
for them it was 0%.

35
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:52,129
Here, confidence is a perfect predictor of accuracy – and in this situation the correlation

36
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:58,849
coefficient will be at its maximum of one: denoting a perfect relationship between the

37
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:05,849
two variables – where knowing an eyewitness’s confidence allows you to know without any

38
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:12,150
doubt whether their identification is accurate or not.

39
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,900
If this happened in real life – you would always be able to know whether to believe

40
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:21,920
an eyewitness or not based entirely on whether they were high or low in confidence.

41
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,760
Now let’s see what other, rather more plausible outcomes might look like.

42
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:33,419
Now we have some variation in confidence levels, where this scatter means that the correlation

43
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:40,060
won’t quite be, technically, a perfect one. However, there’s still no overlap between

44
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:46,199
the confidence levels of the accurate and inaccurate eyewitnesses. And so, in principle,

45
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:52,050
as long as we knew in advance the point at which the confidence level flipped from yielding

46
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:58,530
inaccurate answers to accurate ones, we could still tell with a hundred percent certainty

47
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:05,479
whether an eyewitness could be believed or not based entirely on their level of confidence.

48
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:11,459
The correlation coefficient for this data would be about point nine.

49
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:17,640
Now in this example we have overlap, where some of our reliable eyewitnesses are actually less

50
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:24,360
confident than some of our unreliable eyewitnesses. So, in this particular situation, the correlation

51
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,780
coefficient would be about point seven – rather less than perfect.

52
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,440
So, eyewitness confidence gives us some indication of their accuracy. But, it’s

53
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,860
also going to be misleading some of the time. Now the overlap is much more severe.

54
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:47,860
It’s still the case that, on average, the accurate eyewitnesses are more confident than

55
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:54,169
the inaccurate eyewitnesses. But if we rely on confidence to tell whether we believe

56
00:05:54,169 --> 00:06:01,000
an individual eyewitness or not, then we’re going to be misled an awful lot of the time.

57
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,569
In this scenario, confidence is an unreliable indicator of whether an individual eyewitness

58
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:07,349
is accurate or not.

59
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,180
And, finally, here we have a zero correlation

60
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,729
between confidence and accuracy – the case where confidence tells us absolutely nothing

61
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:21,400
whatsoever about whether to believe our eyewitnesses or not.

62
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,319
The two variables are completely independent of one another.

63
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,849
So, that’s the range of relationships we could get. In the next presentation we’ll

64
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:36,020
find out which of these relationships between accuracy and confidence

65
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:43,020
is the reality.
