So, how should the photographs used in the line-up be presented to the eyewitness?

1
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:28,820
One choice is whether we present the photographs simultaneously – that is, they are laid

2
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:34,210
out side-by-side in front of the eyewitness so they that could all be viewed at once.

3
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:39,989
However, one problem with this approach is that it may encourage relative rather than

4
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:45,030
absolute judgements. That is, eyewitnesses approach the task as

5
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,689
being to determine who in the line-up looks relatively most like the criminal – rather

6
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:56,269
than an absolute decision as to whether the criminal is actually present or not.

7
00:00:56,269 --> 00:01:02,299
That is, the structure of simultaneous line-ups may foster the same sort of bias to pick someone

8
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:07,869
as biased instructions do. What can we do about this?

9
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:13,299
Well, one alternative is to use a strategy suggested by Roderick Lindsay of Queen’s University

10
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:20,180
and Gary Wells of the University of Alberta, known as the sequential line-up.

11
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,100
This is where each member of a line-up is viewed in turn.

12
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,180
The eyewitness is asked, “Is this the person you saw?”. And they have to answer “yes”

13
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,409
or “no”. In the ideal version of this, eyewitnesses

14
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:37,890
wouldn’t know in advance how many photos will be in the line-up, and the procedure

15
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:44,890
will stop on the first positive ID. The idea is that - with a sequential approach

16
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:52,260
- we minimise that implicit imperative for eyewitnesses to compare the line-up members

17
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,950
with one another – that problematic relative judgement.

18
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:02,820
Instead they are effectively being told to compare each individual against their memory

19
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,340
of the real criminal. That is, they’re making an absolute judgement.

20
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,159
And it’s the absolute judgement that we want.

21
00:02:09,158 --> 00:02:13,400
That’s the principle. But is there any evidence to suggest that

22
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:20,019
using the sequential rather than the simultaneous presentation helps witnesses correctly identify

23
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:21,750
the suspect more often?

24
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:28,590
Nancy Steblay of Augsburg College and her colleagues did a meta-analysis of thirty research

25
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:34,819
studies looking at this very question – and concluded that using the sequential line-up

26
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:41,819
procedure did indeed result in fewer false identifications than simultaneous presentations.

27
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,650
There was some evidence that sequential line-ups resulted in fewer correct hits as well as

28
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:52,670
fewer false positives – following the same reasoning with biased instructions.

29
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:58,760
However, in this case, Nancy Steblay reported that when she took more realistic conditions

30
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:05,380
into account – this effect largely disappeared. That is, sequential line-ups didn’t result

31
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,560
in fewer correct hits when real world factors were considered.

32
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,700
So, the current consensus appears to be that sequential line-ups are better practice

33
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,819
than simultaneous line-ups. One other technique that’s been investigated

34
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:27,420
by psychologists, to address the issue of response bias in eyewitnesses, is to first

35
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:33,620
deliberately show them a blank line-up, where none of the members of the line-up are the

36
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,920
suspect. The idea is that if your eyewitness does

37
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,920
pick someone from the line-up that you know for sure has no criminals in, then this may

38
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:49,390
indicate that their judgement on the real line-up should be called into question.

39
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:55,129
You’ve essentially screened them for an inappropriate response bias.

40
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:59,390
Gary Wells investigated whether this strategy worked or not, and he found that whether

41
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:05,220
or not eyewitnesses made a false ID on the blank line-up predicted whether they would

42
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,680
make a false ID on the real line-up. That is, we have evidence that this technique

43
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,060
works. In our next presentation we’ll turn our

44
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,970
attention to the members of the line-up who aren’t the suspect – the people we know

45
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,400
are innocent and how we ought to go about choosing them.
