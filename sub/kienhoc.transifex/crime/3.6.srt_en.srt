In this presentation we’ll look at who we ought to have as the members of the line-up

1
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:27,630
who aren’t the suspect – the people that we know are innocent. These people are known

2
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,310
as distractors or foils.

3
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:35,060
A few things are obvious: the foils should be wearing similar clothes to the suspect

4
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:41,330
and not be completely different from them – where there have been cases of officers using

5
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:46,989
foils who are a different race or even a different gender from the suspect.

6
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:53,020
However one standard practice is that police often try to make the foils look as similar

7
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,210
to the suspect as possible. Sounds sensible?

8
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:01,540
Well, some researchers have argued that a better practice is to make sure all of the

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,650
foils match the verbal description of the criminal that the eyewitness has already provided.

10
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,210
This isn’t quite the same thing as choosing similar people, as similar-looking foils

11
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:18,820
may still have some characteristic that the eyewitness has already discounted via their

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,690
verbal description. For example, imagine they’re completely certain about the criminal’s eye

13
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:28,610
colour, and some of the foils have a different eye colour.

14
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:33,840
This means that those foils don’t match the verbal description and are essentially

15
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,760
worthless – as it’s likely that the eyewitness will rule those people out – and this effectively

16
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,170
reduces the number of people they have to choose between in the line-up.

17
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:50,659
This in turn means that they’re more likely to pick the suspect by chance – which is

18
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:54,540
not what we want. Only using foils that fit the eyewitness’s

19
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,280
verbal description of the criminal means that we can choose foils that may vary considerably

20
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,799
on characteristics that are NOT part of the eyewitness’s verbal description.

21
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,190
It’s possible to be TOO successful in finding similar-looking foils.

22
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:15,040
If we take this to an extreme – imagine a situation where we manage to find a number

23
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,580
of foils that look absolutely identical to the suspect.

24
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,110
Even an eyewitness with a perfect memory of the criminal won’t be able to tell them

25
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:28,470
apart – for all the wrong reasons. It isn’t because they don’t know what

26
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,319
the criminal looks like – it’s because every member of the line-up looks exactly

27
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,620
like the criminal – so nobody would be able tell them apart.

28
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,950
Well – hopefully that’s provided some ideas of the sort of factors that can influence

29
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,010
the effectiveness of a line-up – though, as with all these presentations – we’ve

30
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:51,400
only just scratched the surface of the topic. If you want to dig deeper check out the further

31
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,090
reading resources we’ve provided to back up these presentations – or follow up some

32
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,770
of the onscreen citations. So – now let’s have a look at a line-up

33
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:07,130
that takes into account all of the recommendations from psychologists that I’ve just talked

34
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:11,150
about. So – here we see the use of a double-blind

35
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:16,680
procedure – where the administrator doesn’t know which of the line-up members is the suspect.

36
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,629
The eyewitness has been told that the suspect may or may not be present in the line-up.

37
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:27,410
Each of the line-up photos is seen in sequence, with the eyewitness making an absolute yes-no

38
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:33,180
judgement on each picture. However, before the main line-up, the eyewitness

39
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:40,020
is shown a blank line-up made up entirely of foils to see if they make a false ID or

40
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,050
not. The foils have been chosen on the basis that

41
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:48,560
they match the eyewitness’s verbal description of the criminal rather than just looking similar

42
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,220
to the suspect. This is a nice example of how the psychological

43
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:58,800
research literature can yield evidence-based recommendations for a standard police procedure

44
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,590
that maximise the chance that a line-up will be fair and minimise the chances that an innocent

45
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,330
person will be convicted. So – now we can reveal whether you managed

46
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,709
to successfully pick out the criminal from the line-up.

47
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:14,620
In fact, the criminal wasn’t in the line-up at all.

48
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,970
If you correctly decided that none of the people in the line-up was the criminal – then

49
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,650
– if we had prizes – you would win one.
