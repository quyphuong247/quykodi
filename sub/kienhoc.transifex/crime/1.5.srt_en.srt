So Pinizotto and Finkel&#39;s research showed clearly that FBI trained profilers are not

1
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:27,390
consistently better at identifying the likely characteristics of an offender. And this ambiguity

2
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,600
as to the superiority of FBI trained profilers comes through in all the published accounts.

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,240
On some dimensions some profilers out-perform relevant others,

4
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,019
and on other dimensions they don&#39;t.

5
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:44,250
So what alternative approaches exist that use the crime scene to infer something of

6
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,570
the characteristics of the offender? Probably the most famous alternative approach is Investigative Psychology

7
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:54,979
 that emerged from David Canter&#39;s work. Now in terms of using the crime scene

8
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:59,670
to tell us something about the offender, the aim of Investigative Psychology is much the

9
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,509
same as that of the FBI&#39;s approach. Essentially you want to be able to tell the investigating

10
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:09,630
officers something about the characteristics of an offender from their actions while committing

11
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,860
the crime. This will then allow investigators to narrow down their search of suspects.

12
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:21,140
However in contrast to the FBI&#39;s approach, Investigative Psychology attempts to identify

13
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:26,630
these characteristics by analysing behaviour in a way that is independent of the psychological

14
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:33,470
mechanisms that underpin it. That is, Investigative Psychology is not focused on identifying &#39;why&#39;

15
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:38,920
the offender commits the crime. Instead, Investigative Psychology simply infers the characteristics

16
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,850
of the offender from the known actions taken by the offender during the crime.

17
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,650
With this approach, it is possible to statistically analyse larger data sets to break down crime

18
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,939
scenes into their component parts and then relate these components to distinct aspects

19
00:01:54,939 --> 00:02:00,720
of the offender. These analyses are then submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals

20
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,180
where other researchers critically evaluate whether the analysis has been conducted according

21
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,549
to the appropriate research practices.

22
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:14,000
Unlike the FBI&#39;s case by case approach, analysis of large data sets in this way allows

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,299
more certainty in determining how often particular types of behaviour are seen in particular

24
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:24,129
crimes. A good example of this approach is seen in an early analysis conducted by Salfati

25
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:27,130
&amp; Canter that was published in 1999.

26
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:33,770
Salfati and Canter looked at 82 British cases of single perpetrator-single victim homicide

27
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,890
crime scenes that had been solved. They were interested to see whether there would be a

28
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,650
thematic structure to the actions that occurred at these crime scenes.

29
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,310
So they coded the information in the police homicide files for the presence or absence

30
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,819
of a range of variables, which reflected:

31
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:55,180
* actions by the offender on the victim, * descriptions of behaviour carried out by

32
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,680
the offender at the crime scene

33
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,290
* characteristics of the offender and

34
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,870
* characteristics of the victim.

35
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,650
Now variables that occurred in more than 90% of cases or in less than 10% of cases were

36
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:12,660
excluded as they were seen to be either too common or too rare to help the classification.

37
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:18,300
Salfati and Canter then analysed this data to detect the co-occurrence of each variable

38
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,709
with each other variable. And this analysis allowed them to produce a visual representation

39
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:28,400
of factors that frequently co-occurred and those which were very unlikely to co-occur

40
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,480
in this type of crime.

41
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,400
So for example, Salfati and Canter found that in these homicide cases, it was unusual to

42
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,920
find a body facing up where property of value had been taken from the victim or the crime

43
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,409
scene. Now through this analysis Salfati and Canter identified three crime scene themes

44
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:48,769
which reflect the role of the aggression in the offence.

45
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:53,319
The first of these is expressive (impulsive) where the underlying aim of the aggression

46
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:59,599
seems to be to hurt the victim. Instrumental (opportunistic) and instrumental (cognitive) is where the

47
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:05,599
murder is a byproduct of other more dominant motives such as the desire for objects.

48
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,459
Now of the 82 cases included in this analysis, 53 cases could be classified as showing a

49
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:18,459
dominant impulsive, opportunistic or cognitive crime scene theme. And of these 53 cases,

50
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:25,500
21 followed an impulsive theme of homicide crime scene behaviour. So, an expressive impulsive

51
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,430
crime scene comprised multiple stab wounds across the victim&#39;s body, many other types

52
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:35,319
of wounds, bringing a weapon to the scene and using a weapon from the scene in amongst

53
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:41,939
other behaviours. Contrast this with an instrumental cognitive crime scene where, for example,

54
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:46,689
offenders attempted to hide their crime: either by committing it outside or disposing of the

55
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:51,039
body outside, and by removing evidence from the crime scene.

56
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:57,629
Now as this analysis used solved cases, offender characteristics were known, so it was possible

57
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:03,729
to see which offender characteristics co-occurred with which crime scene behaviours. So, for

58
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:08,559
example, someone whose crime scene was classified as expressive impulsive was statistically

59
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:13,629
likely to have committed prior violent or sexual offences, prior damage to property

60
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:19,740
offences and/or to have been previously married. Those classified as having instrumental cognitive

61
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,189
crime scenes were statistically more likely to have served in the armed forces or had

62
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:25,759
a prior prison sentence.

63
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,740
So you can see how, as long as the perpetrator in any given case doesn&#39;t deviate from the

64
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,119
&#39;typical&#39; behaviour determined by the analysis of data from this sample, this information

65
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:42,430
would allow for a more focused targeting of suspects. That is, if you have an expressive

66
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,159
instrumental crime scene then, with all other things being equal, you should start your

67
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:51,490
further investigations with those suspects who have prior charges for offences that suggest

68
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,849
conflict with or against other people.

69
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:59,809
The other notable aspect of the analysis of Salfati and Canter is that the interactional

70
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:04,629
behaviour of offenders while offending does not seem to deviate too far from their interactional

71
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:10,139
behaviour or style when not offending. Now David Cantor, the chief proponent of Investigative

72
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:14,409
Psychology, suggests that the way in which people interact with one another in their

73
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:19,659
everyday lives is so well rehearsed and ingrained that it influences all their interactions

74
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:25,080
with others, including the way that they interact with their victim while they are offending. That is

75
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,610
there is coherence in their personal interactions.

76
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,289
And interpersonal coherence is one of the factors in Canter&#39;s five-factor model for

77
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:37,899
interpreting a crime scene, which aims to tell the investigators about the offender&#39;s

78
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:43,860
past and present experiences in life. The second factor in this model is time and space

79
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:49,279
considerations in the choice of where the crime or crimes took place. Crime scenes are

80
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:54,169
rarely random. Offenders select the time and location of their offending for a reason.

81
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:59,270
So investigators may be able to infer something about the offender based on their choices

82
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,979
about when and where to offend.

83
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:06,580
For example, Cantor proposed that if an offender is engaging in an offence where he needs to

84
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,770
feel in control, then the offender is likely to do this in a place that is familiar to

85
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:16,089
him, perhaps closer to his base where he feels more comfortable, knowledgeable and in control

86
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:19,059
of what goes on.

87
00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:22,469
Behaviour engaged in or not engaged in at the crime scene can also tell you valuable

88
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:27,369
information about the offender&#39;s background. This may be as simple as an indication of

89
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:33,119
the likely level of intelligence of the offender, but it may be more detailed. For example,

90
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:38,069
an offender who uses a knife in a very specific or specialized way, might have had training

91
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:41,529
in their occupation to use the knife that particular way.

92
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:46,610
This behaviour will also give you insight into the offender&#39;s forensic awareness,

93
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,509
and this is the third factor in Canter&#39;s five-factor model. Imagine, for example, that

94
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:55,129
at a crime scene it was clear that the offender had made little effort to cover up or remove

95
00:07:55,129 --> 00:08:00,360
forensic evidence. This may suggest that they do not have much experience on offending because

96
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,229
they are not trying to evade forensic evidence collection techniques. So this offender may

97
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:09,050
have few or no prior convictions.

98
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:13,330
Forensic awareness is closely related to the fourth factor of criminal career. This is

99
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:18,309
the idea that offenders will behave relatively consistently in committing their crimes, so

100
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:24,389
any previous offences committed by this offender will resemble the current offence. Criminal

101
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:29,169
career also covers the idea that deviations or changes away from the pattern of previous

102
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:33,409
offending may be in response to something that happened while this person was attempting

103
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:38,940
to commit their crime. For example, an offender who has never drugged their victim before

104
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:45,050
might drug their victims in the future because a victim struggled in response to the attack.

105
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,790
The final factor is criminal characteristics. This is the idea that you can use characteristics

106
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:55,899
of the offence to match it to similar types of crime. Now an obvious question here is how

107
00:08:55,899 --> 00:09:00,160
does this five factor approach help us figure out what kind of person might have committed

108
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,120
the crime? Well once you have considered the crime scene in light of the five-factor model

109
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,560
of offender experiences, you can then make inferences about the characteristics the offender

110
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,850
might have. So this might include inferences about the offender&#39;s residential location,

111
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,959
their domestic or their social characteristics, their personal characteristics and their occupation

112
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,810
or education history.

113
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,790
This means that once investigators have gathered information about the likely characteristics

114
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,750
and experiences of the offender they will have a description of the sort of individual

115
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:35,560
who may have committed the crime. This can help focus the investigation of the offence.

116
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,629
Now at this point it may sound like Investigative Psychology is very similar to the FBI&#39;s

117
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:45,930
Criminal Investigative Analysis approach. Both seem to generate profiles of &#39;typical&#39;

118
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,269
offenders, which as we saw from the analysis of Pinizotto and Finkel causes problems when

119
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:56,279
your offender is in the minority that is not typical. A key question then is how is Investigative

120
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,060
Psychology different?

121
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,050
Well while both Criminal Investigative Analysis and Investigative Psychology both involve

122
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:07,250
the investigator making inferences about the offender&#39;s likely characteristics on the

123
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:13,660
basis of the crime scene, the emphasis in each type of profile is distinct. Profiles

124
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:18,579
generated by Criminal Investigative Analysis tend to focus on an offender&#39;s characteristics

125
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:25,310
and their likely motivation. In contrast profiles created by Investigative Psychology tend to

126
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:29,360
focus on the offenders characteristics and information about the offender&#39;s likely

127
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,569
location. Typically also, Canter and colleagues research uses larger sample sizes than the

128
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:40,430
FBI and subjects the research underpinning their inferences to peer review.

129
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:45,680
So Canter and Alison (2000, P1) talk of an analysis of criminal actions from an objective,

130
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,519
often statistical viewpoint rather than one based on personal intuition and clinical experience.

131
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,930
However, it is worth noting that this reliance on statistical methods might introduce its

132
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:02,149
own problems in that at best these kinds of statistical analyses can only show associations

133
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:07,430
between crime scene actions and offender characteristics. And these associations will never be perfect,

134
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:12,220
meaning that there is always the possibility that your particular offender is an exception

135
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,089
- a statistical outlier if you like - to the general pattern of association seen in

136
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:17,860
that type of case

137
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,769
However, investigative psychology does suggest a more systematic approach to working out

138
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:27,810
the characteristics of the offender. So while David Canter is most well known for profiling

139
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:33,230
John Duffy, the so-called railway rapist, since then Investigative Psychology has grown

140
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:38,439
as a subdiscipline. Now, those working in Investigative Psychology are interested in

141
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:42,420
patterns of criminal behaviour more broadly, and they can help investigators deal with

142
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,260
a range of crimes.
