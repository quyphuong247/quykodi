Left left right, loading up the right punch. Good. Now I want 10 left and rights at bursts. Flat out guys on the pads thats the way.

1
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,420
Break it into combinations now with your left, left, rights. Left, left, right - work it up. 

2
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:22,440
Left, left, right - c&#39;mon hard hits. Good. Alright now practise your 10 left and rights and 1 burpee.

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,600
That&#39;s the way - pump it , pump it and a burpee. Good. And up.

4
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:39,300
Keep punching. Flat out, flat out. Kicks now guys - loading up right kick. 

5
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,680
The other right, hon.

6
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,680
Right. 

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,680
Oh! Sorry, sorry, sorry...

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,660
Right guys, keep on, good!

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,040
You&#39;re not here for a haircut guys, you&#39;re here to train.

10
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,940
Good! Pump it out guys. Pump it out.

11
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,900
You guys looked good out there.             

12
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,900
My mum did you mean. It’s her first class.

13
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:15,470
Really? You wouldn&#39;t know. Fantastic job with those roundhouse kicks they were perfect.

14
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,960
Lara’s the gym bunny. She’s been trying to get me to come for months.

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,360
Mum. Shower. I’m taking Mum out to dinner. It’s her first week back at work. 

16
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,420
Okay, cool!

17
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,220
Thanks for the class. It was invigorating. See you again.

18
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,280
Drug of choice. Obviously I’ll share.

19
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,020
I know what you’re trying to do, hon. The gym, dinner. It’s very sweet ...

20
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:43,470
But, it’s one hundred percent not necessary. I’m fine. Truly.

21
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,000
Really?

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,080
Cross my heart.

23
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,500
(Screaming) Oh my God...oh my God someone help ........Janine....oh my God...

24
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,360
Everybody stay here.

25
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,180
Where is she?

26
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,380
She&#39;s over there. 

27
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,400
Come with me.

28
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,780
 

29
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,320
Police! Move! Move!

30
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,860
 

31
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:15,509
Oh God...

32
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:24,460
 

33
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,720
Oi!! Oi!! 

34
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,360
For god’s sakes. Do something useful. Call triple zero.

35
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,840
Who can do CPR here? 

36
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,480
I can.                                                     

37
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,980
Great!

38
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:52,220
Police! Move back. Step back. Move back. Back. Move back please. Create space. Step back. Thanks everybody.

39
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:58,620
I need you to stay exactly where you are. We need to sort this out before you can go anywhere. Do not touch anything.

40
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,500
(Sirens sound)

41
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:15,180
 (Music plays)

42
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,390
Who called it in?                                          

43
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,490
I don&#39;t know, Sir.

44
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:32,340
 (Breathing deeply)

45
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,340
(Calming music plays)

46
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,050
Thanks

47
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,540
Looks like she fought back pretty hard.

48
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:15,320
When I was a kid I always imagined that scary stuff only happening in the middle of the night. 

49
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,900
But it doesn’t always work like that does it? 

50
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:25,200
A few minutes later, another day - it could have been my daughter in the alley.

51
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,700
 

52
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,660
You took your time.

53
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,640
Sorry it took so long. I had to go the long way. One of the doors is locked back there. 

54
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,740
We haven&#39;t got much at the moment. That CCTV camera up there is broken. But the guys in the overpass found this.

55
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,140
 

56
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,660
Oh, they didn&#39;t take long, did they? Move her back will you? We haven’t even told the family yet. 

57
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,260
Ok.

58
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,340
(Helicopter flies overhead)

59
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:55,840
Move along. You&#39;ve seen what you&#39;re going to see.

60
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:21,540
 

61
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,300
(Office background noise)

62
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,540
So just the two witnesses so far?

63
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,520
The guy reckons he caught a good look at the runner on the overpass and when he chased after him.

64
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,800
The young girl works at the gym. Still pretty shaken up and  not particularly forthcoming yet.

65
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,020
That’s okay. The interview’s not until tomorrow. A good night’s rest might help her out. 

66
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,920
So she&#39;s a gym regular eh? She buff?

67
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:52,060
 

68
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,060
The duffel bag’s clean. Just a pair of unused gym clothes. Rebel brand, 

69
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,180
could have been bought anywhere. The bag’s the same.

70
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,240
What about the rope?

71
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,620
 

72
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,460
Nothing you couldn&#39;t buy at any hardware store. Doesn’t match any threads from the scene. 

73
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,040
The guys are onto it.

74
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,940
That’s a single column knot.

75
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,480
Boy scout were you?

76
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,120
It’s an S&amp;M knot. I’ve seen it before.

77
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,500
If only I could read your mind.

78
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,000
I’ll interview the girl tomorrow. Last thing she needs is you checking her out. 

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,840
Have the guys check out the knot.

80
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,080
Already done.

81
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,160
These knife wounds, we’re looking at a male.

82
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,540
Early to mid 30’s. I’d say he hasn’t done it before. See this cut here - 

83
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:49,100
it’s panic. There’s no method to it. So a guy who likes his thrill and is taking it to the next level for the first time?

84
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,280
Maybe a robbery gone wrong?

85
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,820
Could be - she was tiny, but tough.

86
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,200
Could have been an easy mark. 

87
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,980
Could have been a woman?
