Edward Fisher of the University of California, Los Angeles, and Ronald Geiselman, of Florida

1
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,220
International University, were investigating ways of turning findings from psychological

2
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:34,540
research, such as the context reinstatement effect, into practical techniques that could

3
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:41,540
be used in real police investigations. They developed a procedure that they called the

4
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,650
cognitive interview.

5
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:49,070
The way that police traditionally interview eyewitnesses involves frequent interruptions

6
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:55,780
by the interviewer, a focus on details relevant to the investigation, and the use of the question-answer

7
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:01,290
format. As we’ve already seen, one problem with a question-focussed approach is that

8
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:07,900
there is the opportunity for false memories to be created by leading questions. Edward

9
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:13,350
Fisher and Ronald Geiselman raided the cognitive psychology literature, including the work

10
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,659
on context reinstatement, to create the cognitive interview.

11
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:24,659
Here are some of the key ideas behind it. First, memory research tells us that memory

12
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,890
traces are usually complex and contain different sorts of information. Second, research

13
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,780
indicates that the ease with which a memory is recalled depends on how much &quot;informational

14
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,659
overlap&quot; it has with the cues being used to retrieve it. This refers to work on what’s

15
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:48,120
known as the “encoding specificity principle” by Endel Tulving of the University of Toronto,

16
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,530
amongst others.

17
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,250
When something is remembered, it is encoded with respect to the context in which it

18
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:02,060
is studied, producing a unique trace which incorporates information from both target

19
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:09,060
and context. This means that the probability of successfully remembering something depends

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,720
on the degree of overlap between the information present at retrieval and the information stored

21
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,090
in memory. That is, the more overlap you can get between a memory of something that

22
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:30,670
you’ve already recalled and something you want to recall, then the better chance of

23
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:36,970
retrieving the desired memory. Another finding is that any given memory can be accessed by

24
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,170
a number of different retrieval cues. That is, if you can’t access the memory you want

25
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,690
via one particular cue, then try another.

26
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:50,670
The cognitive interview uses these principles of memory retrieval to help witnesses maximise

27
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,130
their chances of recalling the events of a crime.

28
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,040
The question is, what’s the evidence that it actually does result in better eyewitness

29
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:07,120
memory recall than more traditional police interviews? Fisher and Geiselmen tested the

30
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,480
original version of the cognitive interview by recruiting 17 highly experienced interviewers,

31
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:20,480
all of whom had been trained in forensic hypnosis. This included police detectives, CIA investigators,

32
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,550
and private detectives.

33
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:30,730
They were randomly assigned to either use the cognitive interview or to use standard police interviews

34
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:36,700
– as well as other options. Then the researchers got 89 undergraduates

35
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:43,690
to watch one of four films depicting a violent murder – borrowed from the LAPD training

36
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:49,340
academy. Forty-eight hours after watching the crime, the students were interviewed by

37
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:55,440
the professional investigators. These interviews were transcribed and scored.

38
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,120
An exhaustive list of all the details of the crimes that were mentioned was drawn up and

39
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,870
then researchers calculated the proportion of those items mentioned by each of the students.

40
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:14,849
Doing this, they found that the cognitive interview elicited between 25% and 35% more

41
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:21,849
information than the standard police interview. So – that’s very promising. As a result

42
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,840
of this early work, Fisher and Geiselmen went on to refine their methods and also to test

43
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,840
them in more realistic situations.

44
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,620
Here’s one example, where they tested the cognitive interview for real police detectives

45
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:43,620
solving genuine crimes. This time they recruited 16 police detectives based in Florida. In

46
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:50,900
the initial stage of the study, they recorded and analysed 5-7 interviews by each detective

47
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:57,419
over 4 months. Then they randomly chose half the detectives and trained them in how to

48
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:04,150
give the cognitive interview. Then they monitored and analysed interviews conducted by both

49
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:10,780
the trained and untrained detectives for 7 months afterwards. They eventually amassed

50
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:16,380
between 2 and 7 appropriate interviews per detective.

51
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:22,220
All the interviews were transcribed and analysed as before. Of course, one big disadvantage

52
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:28,400
of studying real crime investigations is that it is much harder to determine what is actually

53
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,740
true or not for the purposes of determining whether the interviews were yielding real

54
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:40,620
or false memories. The way they did this in this particular study was by comparing what

55
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,570
the witnesses said with another reliable source of information, such as another witness, a

56
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,669
confession by criminal, or from hidden camera footage.

57
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:57,560
So they only looked at corroborated facts, and this is what they found. So the cognitive

58
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:03,380
interview, in this real world study looking at real crimes, led to a 47 percent increase

59
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,600
in the number of facts recalled compared with a standard police interview.

60
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,729
There’s since been a large body of research looking at these cognitive interview techniques.

61
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:17,699
A meta-analysis of some of this work, by Gunter Kohnken of the University of Kiel and his

62
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:24,270
colleagues confirmed that, over 42 studies, the cognitive interview reliably generates

63
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:30,639
more correct details than the standard interview. And this effect was greater the more realistic

64
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,400
the context of the study.

65
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,680
The cognitive interview is now routinely taught to police officers in Britain and also widely

66
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:45,680
used in the US, Australia, New Zealand, the UK, Canada, Singapore, and Hong Kong.

67
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:50,580
Of course, as we’re taking a scientific approach in this course, we also need to talk about the

68
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:56,960
limitations of the cognitive interview. Like everything else in life, it’s not perfect.

69
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,080
The cognitive interview is more difficult to conduct than a standard interview, it takes

70
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,550
longer and it requires more effort on the part of the interviewer.

71
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,490
Also, it’s only useful for co-operative eyewitnesses.

72
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:16,200
It’s very much about improving recall memory, it doesn’t help with recognition memory

73
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:23,200
- for example recognising a suspect in a line-up. However, taking all that on board, overall

74
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:28,889
it’s still considered a valuable tool for the investigator – and it’s a great example

75
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:35,889
of how cognitive psychology research can be successfully applied to the real world.
