Despite advances in forensic science, many people are convicted solely on the basis of

1
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,360
eyewitness testimony. This means that it&#39;s absolutely crucial that

2
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,930
we understand how eyewitness memory operates and how reliable it is.

3
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:38,010
This is one of those things where some criminal justice professionals, such as judges, argue

4
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,960
that how eyewitness memory operates is essentially common sense, and so referring to behavioural

5
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,010
science research has little value. Are they right?

6
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:55,010
Well, let&#39;s look at one out of the many studies that have directly addressed this question.

7
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:01,579
John Brigham and Robert Bothwell from Florida State University gave prospective jurors descriptions

8
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:06,920
of real research studies in which people saw a simulated crime and were then asked to pick

9
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,310
out the criminal in a line up. The prospective jurors were asked to predict

10
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:18,810
what percentage of the people in the study would be able to correctly identify the criminal.

11
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:25,030
As you can see, people estimated identification accuracy to be between fifty-one and seventy-one

12
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:30,220
percent, depending on the study. However, the actual accuracy of participants

13
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:36,410
in these studies was always significantly and substantially lower, between thirteen

14
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:41,170
and thirty-two percent. So, the common sense beliefs of potential

15
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,750
jurors were not true. In most cases, they weren&#39;t even close.

16
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,920
The problem with these beliefs is that they influence how much credibility both criminal

17
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,759
justice professionals and jurors assign to eyewitness testimony.

18
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,700
Okay, so these were simulated crimes. Maybe eyewitness accuracy would be different

19
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:09,700
in a high stakes real world situation? So let&#39;s take a really extreme real world

20
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,700
example. Let&#39;s take an absolutely horrific crime of mass murder where that crime was

21
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:22,700
seen by millions of people via media coverage, and let&#39;s examine the memory accuracy of one

22
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:29,940
individual who was at the heart of events. On the eleventh of September 2001, the World

23
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,750
Trade Centre in New York was destroyed in a terrorist attack.

24
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:41,070
The President of the United States of America at that time was George W. Bush.

25
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:46,390
So, if there would be anyone who we might expect would have an accurate recollection

26
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:51,780
of how he heard about this crime, it would be him. Yet, on three occasions, he has made

27
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,460
public statements about how he heard the news and they don&#39;t all tell the same story.

28
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,730
Okay, so in this case, we&#39;re not talking about testimony that affected the crime investigation

29
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,280
itself, but the reason I want to use this example is because it&#39;s one of those rare

30
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,930
occasions where the specific memories were able to be subjected to empirical research.

31
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,840
And it illustrates a lot of the key points about human memory that are crucial to understanding

32
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,870
eyewitness testimony. The first statement we have was made on the fourth of December

33
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,390
2001. Bush was in Florida making a speech.

34
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:33,520
When the audience was given the opportunity to ask questions, a young boy named Jordan

35
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,930
asked him how he felt when he heard about the terrorist attack.

36
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,620
This is what he said: &#39;Well, Jordan, you&#39;re not going to believe

37
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,230
what state I was in when I heard about the terrorist attack. I was in Florida. And my

38
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,510
Chief of Staff, Andy Card - actually I was in a classroom talking about a reading program

39
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:55,490
that works. And I was sitting outside the classroom waiting to go in, and I saw an airplane

40
00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:01,540
hit the tower - the TV was obviously on, and I use(d) to fly myself, and I said &quot;There&#39;s

41
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:07,090
one terrible pilot.&quot; And I said &quot;It must have been a horrible accident.&quot; But I was whisked

42
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,480
off there - I didn&#39;t have much time to think about it, and I was sitting in the classroom,

43
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,380
and Andy Card, my chief who was sitting over here walked in and said &quot;A second plane has

44
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:22,240
hit the tower. America&#39;s under attack.&#39;&#39; So, that&#39;s the first account.

45
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,509
And here&#39;s a picture of the event that was in all the newspapers at the time.

46
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:30,490
Consistent with the account we&#39;ve just heard, it shows Bush sitting at the front of the

47
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,880
Florida classroom, with his Chief of Staff, Andy Card, whispering the news of the second

48
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,030
plane. So the end of the account seems to be fine,

49
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:46,960
but there&#39;s one small problem with the beginning of it - namely that it&#39;s impossible.

50
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,100
Bush clearly states that he saw the first plane crashing into the building before he

51
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,690
went into the classroom. However, in reality, footage of the first

52
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:01,990
plane hitting the tower didn&#39;t emerge until the twelfth of September.

53
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:07,700
Some people saw it as evidence of a conspiracy, as this quote from website freeworldalliance.com

54
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,740
demonstrates. &#39;Complicit factions of the U.S federal government

55
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:17,100
actually FILMED their own attack on New York&#39;s World Trade centre, and Bush has admitted

56
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,770
that he WATCHED IT!!!!&#39; Other media sources took the more moderate

57
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:27,050
view that Bush was merely a liar, as these next two quotes demonstrate.

58
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:33,970
The first is from anti-Bush website, bushwatch.com. &#39;...the most benign conclusion, then, is that

59
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,070
Bush was not telling the truth when he told Jordan that he saw the first plane hit the

60
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,970
first tower..&#39;

61
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,310
And this final media quote is from a mainstream British newspaper, The Guardian.

62
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:49,580
&#39;the story that he was watching TV contradicts reports from correspondents at the time that

63
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:55,400
he got the news in a phone call&#39; The critical point here for us is that all

64
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:02,020
of these accusations make the assumption that Bush surely could not have misremembered something

65
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,370
so dramatic and so important. That is, they assume that Bush&#39;s actual

66
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:13,910
memory must be 100% accurate for such an event and therefore he must be lying when he

67
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:20,910
reports these demonstrably inaccurate memories. Let&#39;s hold that thought for the moment and

68
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:26,139
move on to look at Bush&#39;s second account of how he heard about the crime.

69
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:32,910
On the 20th of December, 2001, Bush was interviewed by reporters from the Washington Post, and

70
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:37,810
the story he told them was different. Here&#39;s an excerpt from the article:

71
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:42,320
&#39;Bush remembers senior advisor Karl Rove bringing him the news, saying it appeared

72
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:48,180
to be an accident involving a small. Twin-engine plane. In fact it was American Airlines Flight

73
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:53,630
11. Based on what he was told, Bush assumed it was an accident. &quot;This is pilot error&quot;,

74
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:59,010
the president recalled saying. It&#39;s unbelievable that somebody would do this&#39;. Conferring

75
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:04,320
with Andrew H. Card, his White House Chief of Staff Bush said, &#39;The guy must have had

76
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:10,630
a heart attack.&#39; At 9:05 a.m., United Airlines Flight 175 smashed into the South Tower

77
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:15,520
of the Trade Center. Bush was seated on a stool in the classroom when Card whispered

78
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,389
the news, &#39;A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.&#39;

79
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:25,350
Notice that, in this account, the details of what happened in the classroom are almost

80
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,680
exactly the same, but the beginning of the story has changed, and now pretty much reflects

81
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,820
the accepted facts of the situation. Of course, it&#39;s likely that sometime between

82
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:39,270
giving these two accounts, Bush heard about the backlash over his previous slip, and made

83
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,520
sure that he got the facts more-or-less correct the second time.

84
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:50,050
But that doesn&#39;t explain his third and final statement. On the 5th of January 2002, Bush

85
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:55,419
was again fielding questions from an audience when someone asked: &#39;What was the first

86
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:58,650
thing that went through your head when you heard that a plane crashed into the first

87
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,710
building?&#39; This was his response:

88
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:06,610
&#39;I was sitting there, and my Chief of Staff ... well, first of all, when we walked into

89
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:11,699
the classroom, I had seen this plane fly into the first building. There was a TV set on.

90
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:16,070
And you know, I thought it was pilot error and I was amazed that anybody could make such

91
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:20,830
a terrible mistake. And something was wrong with the plane, or ... anyway, I&#39;m sitting

92
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:25,430
there, listening to the briefing, and Andy Card came in and said &quot;America is under

93
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,479
attack.&quot;&#39; The main thing to note here is that Bush reverted

94
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:35,019
to the impossible claim that he saw the first plane crash into the world trade centre before

95
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:38,680
he entered the classroom. Again, the details of Card&#39;s entrance remain

96
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:42,769
unchanged, although, to some extent, that&#39;s unsurprising anyway because Bush most likely

97
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:45,639
saw the photograph we looked at before in the newspapers.

98
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:52,480
So, if we treat these accounts as an eyewitness&#39;s memory of a crime, how would we explain these

99
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,470
inaccuracies? We&#39;ve already seen data indicating that

100
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:02,110
it&#39;s not a foregone conclusion that his memory would be 100% accurate.

101
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,279
So, if he is genuinely mis-remembering, what could be going on?
