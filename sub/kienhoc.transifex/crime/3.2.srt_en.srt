Witnesses to a crime will often be asked to identify the perpetrator of the crime. So

1
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:29,480
this means that witnesses need to remember the face of the suspect. So, it’s worth

2
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,980
us spending some time understanding how people recognise faces as this has implications for

3
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,300
how we deal with this issue during an investigation.

4
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,430
One technique for getting eyewitnesses to recreate an image of the face of the criminal

5
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:52,430
is known as photofit, originally known as identikit. This involves eyewitnesses reconstructing

6
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:59,369
a suspect’s face feature by feature using a library of different features. However,

7
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:04,689
there is a problem with this. The problem is that the technique has been found in multiple

8
00:01:04,688 --> 00:01:08,689
psychological studies to be very poor. 

9
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:15,689
Can psychology tell us why photofits are so poor at producing recognisable likenesses?

10
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,990
Psychologists have been researching face recognition for a long time. One of the key early findings

11
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:27,560
was a phenomenon known as the inverted face effect. This was investigated in an experiment

12
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,110
by Robert Yin of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

13
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:37,150
He showed participants a series of pictures of faces as well as other types of objects

14
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:43,700
– such as houses and airplanes. Then he gave everyone a recognition memory test on

15
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:50,450
the items, where he showed them pairs of pictures in which one had been previously shown and

16
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:57,390
the other was new. Participants had to choose which of the pictures they’d seen previously.

17
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:04,390
Crucially, some of these picture pairs were presented upside down. And here&#39;s the results.

18
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:10,909
On the vertical axis we have the number of identification errors they made. What Robert

19
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:17,120
Yin found was that people had proportionally greater difficulty recognising upside down

20
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:24,120
faces as compared with other types of objects. So, most people should find these faces proportionally

21
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:31,420
harder to recognise upside down, but easy to recognise the right way up.

22
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:37,020
Yin interpreted this as indicating that the mechanisms we use for face recognition are

23
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:43,709
inherently different from those we use for processing other classes of objects. He suggested

24
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:50,709
that in our brains there is a processor that specialises in dealing with human faces. This

25
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:58,700
idea has since been supported by lots of different strands of evidence, such as patterns of brain

26
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,620
damage, neuro-imaging studies, and behavioural experiments.

27
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:08,750
It’s been argued that the reason that faces have their own special recognition mechanism

28
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:14,860
is because they’re a class of stimuli that we’ve been exposed to every day of our lives,

29
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:21,860
and we have become super expert in telling apart faces. That is, our brains have developed

30
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:27,520
a specialist recognition system for faces because, as social animals, we have to be

31
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,970
able to recognise faces, we have to be able to tell people apart.

32
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:38,800
So, why does being super experts in recognising faces mean that they’re proportionally harder

33
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:45,800
to detect upside down relative to other objects? Martha Farah of the University of Pennsylvania

34
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:54,019
proposed that we recognise objects via two mechanisms that are housed in anatomically

35
00:03:54,019 --> 00:04:01,019
different areas of the brain. The first mechanism for recognising objects is via the strategy

36
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:06,819
of decomposing the object into its component parts or features. So, if we were looking

37
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:13,819
at something like a building, our brain dissects it into features, such as its doors, windows,

38
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:20,720
and so on and analyses whether it is a familiar building or not based on those features.

39
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,909
The second object recognition mechanism involves a more holistic approach where we recognise

40
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:32,720
objects as an un-dissected whole, where our brains are explicitly not breaking the object

41
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,650
down into its component features. Martha Farah argues, on the back of a considerable amount

42
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:45,650
of research, that faces are an extreme example of a class of object that is recognised almost

43
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,320
entirely holistically and only a tiny part by dissection.

44
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:57,090
So, when we look at objects we can use both these strategies but the proportion of each

45
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:02,810
that we use either depends on the type of object. For most everyday objects, such as

46
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:09,430
houses, airplanes, printed words, and so on, we rely much more on our feature-based recognition

47
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:16,430
system. However, for certain over-learned objects like faces, we rely much more on the holistic

48
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:23,430
strategy. This means that, when we look at a face, our brains are not attempting to dissect

49
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:28,940
it into its component features. And what she argues is that this is the key difference

50
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:35,620
that means that we find faces harder to differentiate when they’re inverted.

51
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,960
When you turn something, usually something that’s only seen upright, upside down, the

52
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,880
idea is that if it’s something that we recognise mainly on the basis of features through the

53
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,880
analysis of its parts, like buildings or airplanes, then it won’t matter so much. However if

54
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,979
it’s something that that we recognise more on the basis of more holistic information,

55
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:05,520
then it will matter more. This holistic information is proportionally much more likely to be impaired

56
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,520
by inversion which is exactly what Martha Farah’s experiments appear to demonstrate.

57
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:17,770
In the next presentation I’ll explain what all of this work on face recognition tells

58
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:24,770
us about photofits and whether it could lead to a better way of helping eyewitnesses generate

59
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,949
the likeness of a suspect.
