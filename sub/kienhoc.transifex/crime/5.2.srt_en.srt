What is it that juries are supposed to do?

1
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:23,410
In a criminal trial it’s the jury&#39;s duty to decide the truth, or otherwise, of the

2
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:29,070
evidence. Therefore juries must be impartial. In some jurisdictions, juries must reach a

3
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,540
unanimous decision, whereas in others a majority verdict is accepted.

4
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,680
It can be a bit more complicated than that however. In some places for some offences,

5
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,339
if a unanimous verdict is not possible, a majority verdict can be accepted. In the event

6
00:00:44,339 --> 00:00:49,339
that the jury cannot reach a decision, the judge will discharge the jury and a retrial

7
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:53,860
with a new jury may be held, depending on whether the prosecutor thinks there is a reasonable

8
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:59,820
prospect for conviction. Unfortunately, witnesses and victims may be reluctant to testify at

9
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,890
retrials, especially when the events they have experienced have been particularly traumatic.

10
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,210
So are juries used for all cases before courts?

11
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,439
Juries are actually used in a minority of cases. But the cases that they are used for

12
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,880
tend to be those involving more serious charges and more serious punishments. This is is why

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,130
we are interested in how they make their decisions and the types of things that influence them.

14
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,310
We will return to these questions in a later video.

15
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,930
Juries can be used for both criminal and civil trials. In some jurisdictions, such as the

16
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:37,220
United States of America, civil jury trials are relatively common. In other jurisdictions,

17
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,420
such as Australia, civil jury trials are actually quite rare, and we generally only hear about

18
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,280
the criminal jury trials.

19
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,690
The makeup of juries can also differ depending on whether the case is a 

20
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,530
criminal or a civil one.

21
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,990
For example, in Australia and the United Kingdom, there are generally twelve jurors for a criminal

22
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:58,960
trial and four to six for a civil trial. In the United States of America, depending on

23
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,710
where the trial is heard, there can be between six and twelve members of a criminal jury,

24
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,880
and likewise for a civil jury.

25
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,049
What about other jurisdictions?

26
00:02:08,049 --> 00:02:13,170
It&#39;s true that juries as we have been talking about them so far are only used in a relatively

27
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,879
small number of jurisdictions around the world - for example Australia, the United Kingdom,

28
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,439
the United States of America, New Zealand, and Canada. And more recently 

29
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,989
in Russia and Spain.

30
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:29,110
In several countries, however, lay people sit on a jury with professional judges. You can find

31
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,950
this type of jury in France, Italy, and Germany for example. There have also been some recent

32
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,800
trials of this model in Japan and some other countries.

33
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,480
Many countries, however, have no community involvement in the determination of guilt

34
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,330
for serious criminal matters.

35
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,760
Now the reasons for these differences in community involvement would take some time to explain,

36
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,319
but the short version is that they are due in part to the different histories of legal

37
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,920
systems around the world, and in part due to concerns about the community&#39;s input and confidence

38
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,520
in the legal system. Valerie Hans wrote an excellent paper in 2008 about legal systems

39
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,700
around the world, so if you’d like to read more about this topic, this would be a good

40
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:15,140
place to start. You can also find the reference to her work in the reading list for this video.

41
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,569
Now, in the crime you have been hearing about in this course, we are showing you 

42
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:24,690
a jury made up of twelve lay persons, which is the model used in Australia. Whether the size

43
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:31,099
of juries matters is something we will come back to when we talk about how juries deliberate.

44
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:35,099
Given that we are using a jury composed of lay jurors in our case, and that a lot of

45
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:40,459
the literature focusses on lay jurors (but many jurisdictions make use of judges as deciders

46
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:45,569
of fact), we need to consider whether there are differences in how lay jurors and judges

47
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:47,590
make their decisions.

48
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,780
So how do juries compare to judges?

49
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:56,959
Neil Vidmar provided a thorough consideration of judges as deciders of fact in his 2011

50
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,440
paper. In that paper, he outlines how legal training and constraints placed on judges

51
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:08,190
by precedents in previous cases contribute to potentially making judges&#39; decision-making

52
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:13,940
different to lay jurors. Having noted some of the difficulties in studying judicial decision-making,

53
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:19,940
he turned his eye to what the scientific research says about the decisions of judges compared

54
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,669
to jurors. We will return to that very shortly.

55
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:29,120
It is fair to say, however, that some commentators favour judges over jurors as better decision

56
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,300
makers. These commentators have a fairly negative view of the ability of juries to carry 

57
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,790
out their jobs effectively.

58
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:42,280
&quot;Impartiality is a capacity of mind – a learned ability to recognise and compartmentalise

59
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,870
the relevant from the irrelevant and to detach one’s emotions from one’s rational facilities.

60
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:53,169
Only because we trust judges to be able to satisfy these obligations do we permit them

61
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:57,380
to exercise power and oversight.&quot;

62
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,100
But this view that judges are best placed to decide matters of fact in an impartial

63
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:08,199
manner is contradicted by what the scientific research says about this question. 

64
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:13,560
Landsman and Rakos&#39;s 1994 experiment is probably the best illustration of this point.

65
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,080
In that study, participants who were either actual judges or regular members of the community,

66
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,410
were given a hypothetical case to decide. There were three conditions in this study.

67
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,880
One where participants were given legally prejudicial and irrelevant information; a

68
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,340
second condition where this same information was presented along with a direction to ignore

69
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,449
the information because it was inadmissible; and a final control condition where there

70
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:39,180
was no prejudicial information.

71
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,780
The results of this study showed that both judges and the community members were negatively

72
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,699
influenced by the inadmissible prejudicial information. The instruction to disregard

73
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:53,430
the prejudicial information had little effect on both judges and lay persons - their

74
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,139
verdicts in this condition were more like the verdicts in the condition without the

75
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:01,419
instruction and different from verdicts in the control condition that did not have the

76
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:02,800
prejudicial information.

77
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,050
So, in sum, this study suggests that both judges and jurors made similar decisions and

78
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:13,300
might be susceptible to the same cognitive biases, and legal training did not seem to

79
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,889
protect the judges against these biases.

80
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:20,720
One thing that does favour jurors in this instance, however, is that jurors hear less

81
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,240
inadmissible evidence and also they hear less pretrial information compared to judges. This

82
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,210
places jurors in a situation more like those participants in the control condition in that

83
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,139
study that we just heard about.

84
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:37,979
Guthrie and colleagues in 2001 also concluded that judges were vulnerable to most of the

85
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:43,490
cognitive biases that affect lay decision makers when judging legal materials. A later

86
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:48,550
study by the same authors in 2005 also found that judges, along with jurors, were not able

87
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:54,039
to disregard a range of types of inadmissible evidence, but this time there were some exceptions.

88
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:59,630
For example, information about an inadmissible confession was able to be disregarded by judges.

89
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:05,160
A further study in 2009, however, found that judges were just as likely to show evidence

90
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,720
of negative stereotypes about Black Americans which affected the sentences given in a series

91
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,699
of hypothetical cases. This bias did go away, however, when the judges&#39; attention was explicitly

92
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:19,460
drawn to the defendant&#39;s race.

93
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,830
These last two studies might lead us to conclude that judges and jurors are not necessarily

94
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,660
influenced by the same things and that judges are more immune to some of the racial stereotypes

95
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:35,140
that jury researchers have demonstrated influence jurors. As Vidmar points out in his 2001

96
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:40,919
 paper, however, these experiments lack much of the detail and impact of real trials,

97
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,620
and when actual sentencing data is looked at, there is reasonably consistent evidence

98
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:50,889
that judges, on average, tend to impose harsher sentences on negatively racially 

99
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:52,590
stereotyped groups.

100
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,850
Given this, juries may be preferable because it is much easier to remove an apparently

101
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:01,930
biased juror from a case. Also, it’s thought that the biases of many jurors may actually

102
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,550
end up cancelling each other out.

103
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,930
So having said that, let&#39;s talk about some of the things that might influence jurors&#39;

104
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:12,199
decisions before the trial, and next week we will talk about the way in which jurors

105
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:17,240
make decisions. When we are talking about jurors in this way, we are really talking

106
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,490
about whoever is deciding the questions of fact. So most of the research we will be talking

107
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:27,520
about applies to lay jurors; also potentially applies to how professional judges decide

108
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,550
questions of fact.
