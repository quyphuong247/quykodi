1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,649
I know it what you&#39;re trying to do, hon.

2
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:05,340
 The gym, dinner 

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,780
It&#39;s very sweet, but it&#39;s 100% not necessary.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,600
I&#39;m fine, truly.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,880
Oh my God...someone help! Janine..

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,140
Everybody please stay here.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,320
Police! Move! Move!

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,320
Oi!

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,140
Oi!

10
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,440
The guys in the overpass found this.

11
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,260
It&#39;s an S&amp;M knot. I&#39;ve seen it before.

12
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,120
(Phone rings)

13
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,340
Right.

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,940
Thanks.

15
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,820
They found the bag owner. Boss is going to love us.

16
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,900
We haven&#39;t even met the owner yet so hold your horses.

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,620
He&#39;s 39, bruised, evasive, with a robbery record. 

18
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,580
Local boy lives, with his mum. 

19
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,440
A kinky ex-perp just happens to be walking past as a woman is murdered?

20
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,280
I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;ve got a gut feeling about this one.

21
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,700
Probably indigestion - that stuff will kill you.

22
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,880
(Office sounds..)

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,180
Hi Shari. 

24
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,180
Oh sh**!

25
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,740
Detective Kate Warne. 

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,780
Thank you very much for coming in. I&#39;m really sorry about the wait.

27
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,260
I’m sorry, I do want to help - I really do, but will this take long?

28
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,520
It’s just I had to get a babysitter at short notice and she charges like a wounded bull...

29
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,440
I understand. I’ll try and make the best use of our time then eh? How old’s your little one?

30
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:43,590
Um, she’s ah ... 2 years old. Well, 3 in two months.

31
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:49,060
I remember when my kid was that age. It’s like when do you stop counting in months and start counting in years?

32
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,260
Yeah, I know what you mean.

33
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,260
You okay?

34
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,860
Ah ... yep.

35
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,500
I mean no. I mean it’s all wrong isn’t it. Me here.

36
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,660
And Janine , well Janine...

37
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,460
We’re just going to chat about it today.

38
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:14,340
I’m going to ask you a few questions and if you could do your best to answer. 

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,960
Give more detail than you normally would. Is that okay?

40
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,060
Umm, okay. 

41
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,660
I don’t know how much it’ll help. I don’t really remember that much. 

42
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,480
It  all happened so fast.

43
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:36,980
So, let’s just start from earlier in the morning on the day. From 7am.

44
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,450
 

45
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,070
7 am.

46
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:49,240
Um... well I guess I was stripping the bed &#39;cause Jess had peed all over us both 

47
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,620
and we both got really soaked.

48
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,640
And so I ran a warm bath and I put Jess in.

49
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,180
I felt really bad ‘cause I yelled at her when I woke up.

50
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,739
God, I hate it when I do that.

51
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:14,579
Like, she&#39;s just a little kid, but I get so tired on my own.

52
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,740
(Breathes deeply)

53
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,460
Her father is a real jerk, I mean...

54
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,790
Oh sorry, I’m rambling.

55
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,020
No. it’s okay. Just talk me through the morning.

56
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,260
Aahh...So Jess was in the bath...and  umm...

57
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:36,260
Oh yeah she got soap in her eyes, so I ran some water to try and umm rinse it out...

58
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:41,560
And umm... do you, do you want this stuff?

59
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:47,040
 

60
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,500
Can you tell me what happened next?

61
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,760
I was done for the day.                                           

62
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,340
(Loud music sounds)

63
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,090
Okay, I&#39;ll see you tomorrow!

64
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,870
What were your thoughts as you decided to walk down the alleyway?

65
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,020
How did you feel?

66
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,480
 

67
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,460
Are you okay to go on?

68
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,380
I&#39;m fine. I just need a moment.

69
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,320
Take your time. You&#39;re doing really great so far. 

70
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,580
I was going for a fag.

71
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,960
 I know what you&#39;re thinking.

72
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,740
Personal trainer? Smoking?

73
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,900
It’s the opposite of what I’m paid for, right? And it’s not like I don’t know it’s bad for me.

74
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,920
I’m fully aware of that.

75
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,980
A client found out at the last gym and I lost all these customers and 

76
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,200
I can’t have that happen again.

77
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,320
Would you like one? A cigarette?

78
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,320
Well they told me I... no smoking.

79
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,080
Well you can’t light up in here, but you can hold one - if you think that would help?

80
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,180
(Sounds of bag being opened)

81
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,580
So, you said you were going for a cigarette?

82
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,900
Yeah.

83
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:11,240
When I smoke it’s like the world is mine again...like...

84
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,980
I dunno...

85
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:22,690
Anyway, my phone starts ringing, and I’m thinking it’s the babysitter - something’s happened to my kid...

86
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,600
...but before I could find the phone I drop the bag and everything falls out onto the ground.

87
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,340
And then I hear someone running, kicking a can...

88
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:39,400
I think maybe it&#39;s a gym member and they&#39;re gonna think that I&#39;m nuts crawling around on all fours.

89
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:48,240
And then I look up...And it’s this fella and he’s got a knife. 

90
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,300
Like a full on knife. 

91
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,980
And he’s waves it in my face and all I can see is there’s blood on the knife.

92
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,960
 

93
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,910
Maybe you’re used to it, being a police officer, but my blood ran cold,

94
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:10,619
it was unreal.

95
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,400
And then he runs off.

96
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:20,060
And I look down the alley and I see her, Janine,

97
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:23,229
 only I didn’t know it was Janine.

98
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,500
And I don&#39;t want to stay where I am &#39;cause what if he comes back?

99
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,840
Can you tell me what happens after that?

100
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:37,100
Well, that’s the funny thing. I keep trying to remember and the only thing that I can remember

101
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:46,760
is thinking I yelled at Jess that morning and what if that was the last thing she remembers of her mummy?

102
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,970
So what happens next?

103
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,080
And then he ran away. 

104
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,100
And Lisa&#39;s ATTACK class was going on so the music was really pumping and

105
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,890
she never listens to the complaints.

106
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,840
 Umm...

107
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,990
I don’t think I was thinking. I was just...

108
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,720
I felt compelled to run towards the body

109
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,060
and then I saw who it was ... and she was so still.

110
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,760
and the blood...

111
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,860
What did you do?

112
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,410
I guess that’s when I screamed. It must have been.

113
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:45,490
And I kept screaming as I ran back into the gym to get help.

114
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,490
Oh God, poor thing.

115
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:52,590
She was a good person.

116
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,830
She caught me smoking once. 

117
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,830
Never told a soul or paid me out about it.

118
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:09,610
That&#39;s really great, Shari. Thank you.

119
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,610
 

120
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:22,070
I keep thinking. I had a hairspray right? Why didn’t I just spray him? 

121
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,780
I just froze. I didn&#39;t do anything.

122
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,700
In all my life I’ve done that. Just froze.

123
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,380
Do you think there’s something wrong with me?

124
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,280
No, Shari. I don&#39;t.

125
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,650
She saw him. 

126
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,670
Him - as in male? As in I’m right so far? 

127
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,040
I’ve got Mr. Bondage in shortly. 

128
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,600
Let&#39;s hope his first name isn’t James. Think about it.

129
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,090
You know even if he didn’t do it we’re still going to need his testimony.

130
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,960
Memory’s a fragile thing. Go at it too hard and you’ll crush it.

131
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,640
Go at it too marshmallow and they’ll walk all over you.

132
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,640
Well that’s a mixed metaphor.

133
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:30,570
I&#39;m not quite sure why I&#39;m here.

134
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:34,849
You ran from the murder scene, Scott and  that’s why you’re here.

135
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,840
Now hang on mate, that wasn’t me.

136
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,420
No you hang on mate. There’s a dead girl lying on a cold bit of steel refrigerator 

137
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,680
and it’s my job to figure out who the hell put her there. Now sit back down.

138
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,200
You can’t prove I took that bag. Maybe someone nicked it...

139
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,400
C’mon ...

140
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,760
You ran ‘cause you got seen while you were perving on your own crime. Isn’t that right?

141
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,760
No

142
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,960
A group of people saw you Scott.

143
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:03,899
I don’t think so.

144
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,189
Don&#39;t ya?

145
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:08,169
Shall I speak more plainly then? 

146
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,180
You’ve got a single column tie on your gym bag.

147
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,740
I’m not sure what you...

148
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,480
We checked it out. They hand them out at the Hell ’n’ Brimstone Club, exclusive Members Only. 

149
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,360
How’d you think we found ya?

150
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,400
Look, my mum&#39;s expecting me home. She&#39;s not very well.

151
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,300
Can anyone corroborate any of that?

152
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,260
Someone who you just left at the club, the time you arrived at home? 

153
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,820
The reason you left the scene?

154
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,240
Aren’t I supposed to have a lawyer or something?

155
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,980
What’s that meant to mean?

156
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,780
Spidey sense. Comes from here.

157
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,240
Women don’t get all the intuition.

158
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,860
What did he see?

159
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,100
Nothing. He wasn’t there. Or so he says.

160
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,620
He’s full of it.

161
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,900
There’s definitely more to that guy than he’s letting on and I’m going to find out what it is. Sooner or later he’ll trip up.
