So in the drama you have been watching, one of the detectives became convinced that a

1
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:25,080
witness was being deceptive, and based on this hunch sought a confession from the witness.

2
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,360
It is sound to rely on such hunches? Can we really tell if people are lying to us?

3
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,200
And does this mean that one of the reasons why police seek confessions using stronger

4
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,080
interview strategies is because they &#39;know&#39; who is guilty?

5
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,980
Well, some researchers, such as Roesch, Zapf and Hart in 2010 argue that this might be

6
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,370
part of the issue.

7
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:49,430
If I thought someone was innocent or knew nothing I would release them immediately.

8
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:53,680
In the following video, you will see a witness make some statements. When you watch this

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,440
video, I want you to try and decide whether the person is telling the truth or not.

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,620
I’m not quite sure why I’m here.

11
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,100
You ran from the murder scene, Scott, that&#39;s why you’re here.

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,440
Now hang on mate…

13
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,030
No you hang on, mate! There’s a dead girl lying on a cold bit of steel refrigerator and it’s

14
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,810
my job to figure out who the h**l put her there. Now sit back down!

15
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,800
You can’t prove I took that bag. Maybe somebody nicked it.

16
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,770
I&#39;m guessing that the majority of people will think that the witness was being deceptive.

17
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,100
How can you tell whether someone is telling the truth or not?

18
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,920
One of the things that people think you should pay attention to when trying to detect a lie

19
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,810
is non-verbal behaviour.

20
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:43,600
The idea is that when verbal and non-verbal messages do not match, the non-verbal behaviour

21
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,509
is the better indicator of the truth because it is harder to control.

22
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:50,300
Why is it so hard to control non-verbal behaviour?

23
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,899
Well, there are relatively automatic links between emotions and non-verbal behaviours.

24
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,690
So if you experience the emotion of fear for example, you might then display a particular

25
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:04,030
facial expression or body movement without conscious control of those expressions and

26
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,170
movements.

27
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:10,009
The other issue is that people are relatively unaware of what &quot;normal&quot; non-verbal behaviour

28
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:14,720
is, and so are not well practiced at controlling nonverbal behaviour. So it is harder to make

29
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,349
your non-verbal behaviour match your relatively controlled verbal behaviour when you are actively

30
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:22,200
trying to look like you are not being deceptive.

31
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,470
This leads us to two important questions:

32
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:29,990
Are there systematic differences in non-verbal behaviours between liars and truth tellers?

33
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:36,220
And, are observers aware of these cues, and also, perhaps most importantly, are observers

34
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,380
able to detect deception using these cues?

35
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,130
The answer to these questions needs to be &#39;yes&#39; for observers to be able to detect deception

36
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,590
from non-verbal behaviour.

37
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,060
There are basically three theoretical frameworks for answering these questions.

38
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:55,400
The first is the emotional approach, proposed by Paul Ekman in 1985. This perspective suggests

39
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,590
that being deceptive causes certain physiological reactions such as high blood pressure and

40
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,480
increased heart rate. These reactions are the result of heightened arousal associated

41
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,000
with guilt, fear or perhaps excitement. It is also this arousal which is thought to effect

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,140
non-verbal behaviour.

43
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,900
The second approach is Burgoon and colleagues&#39; cognitive approach.

44
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,540
According to this perspective, being deceptive is a cognitively complex task, and because

45
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,830
of the cognitive load associated with deception, body language gets neglected. As a result,

46
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:32,060
there is a reduction in the overall amount of movement, slower speech, and more pauses

47
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,710
in speech.

48
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:38,320
The final approach is DePaulo&#39;s &#39;attempted control approach&#39;, or the

49
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:44,130
self-presentation perspective as it’s sometimes called. It argues that deceivers will try

50
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,950
to control their behaviour, but because they are not very practised at being deceptive,

51
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,650
their behaviour appears more rigid and inhibited.

52
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,400
The interesting thing here is that these three approaches all actually predict different,

53
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,010
and sometimes contradictory, behaviours as markers of deception.

54
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:05,010
The emotional approach predicts that increased movements will be associated with being deceptive.

55
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,960
The emotional and cognitive approaches predict an increase in speech

56
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:13,959
disturbances as being associated with deception. Whereas the attempted control approach suggests

57
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:16,310
that there should be a reduction in movement.

58
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,769
So what does the research say actually happens when people are being deceptive? 

59
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,910
Depending on the study, deception is associated with more speech disturbances and slower speech

60
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:31,530
rate, as in DePaulo et al.&#39;s 1989 study, or fewer speech disturbances and faster speech

61
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,930
rate as in Vrij&#39;s 1995 study.

62
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,210
As it turns out, speech rate and number of disturbances depends on the type of lie that

63
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:45,310
is being told. Fabrication of false information, rather than just concealing the truth, is actually

64
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:51,069
harder to do and so leads to more speech disturbances and slower speech rate.

65
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:55,479
Voice pitch, on the other hand, does seem to be relatively uniformly associated with

66
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:57,740
deception.

67
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,919
What about non-verbal behaviours like body movements?

68
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:06,719
Vrij&#39;s 1995 study tells us that when people are being deceptive, we tend to see less movement

69
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:13,719
of hands, arms, feet, and legs. This study also tells us that gaze, smiling,

70
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:20,099
and shifting position are not really reliable indicators of deception. And so the old adage

71
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:24,590
about looking up and to the left as a marker of deception is probably not supported by

72
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,719
the results of systematic research.

73
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:30,840
Is that all that all that is associated with deception?

74
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,059
Well some people argue that due to the limits of what you can do in an experiment in the

75
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:39,430
laboratory, we can&#39;t understand the full range of behaviours associated with deception. For

76
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,860
example, for ethical reasons it is difficult to create situations in the laboratory that

77
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,110
have high stakes, or important consequences, for participants.

78
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,979
It can also be difficult to create situations where participants have high levels of motivation

79
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:57,080
to get away with a lie, or high levels of motivation to detect a lie as they might in

80
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,069
real life.

81
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:02,620
What we know from other types of research, like observational studies, however, is that

82
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,969
high stakes for getting away with a lie do not tend to produce more nervous behaviour.

83
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:14,319
This can be seen in studies by Davis &amp; Hadik, in 1995 and Vrij and colleagues in 1996. Some

84
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,379
of that research actually showed that Saddam Hussein decreased his movements when attempting

85
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,789
to get away with a lie.

86
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:26,520
Highly motivated liars do behave in different ways however. They show fewer body movements,

87
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,529
 and slower speech rate, higher voice pitch, and more speech disturbances.

88
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:35,339
Finally, we also know that people who have had time to plan their lie behave differently.

89
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:40,599
Zuckerman and Driver&#39;s 1985 study showed that planning was associated with fewer arm and

90
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:45,719
head movements, shorter response latencies, and faster speech rate.

91
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:49,689
So the next question is whether observers can actually tell when others are lying or

92
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:52,860
not by paying attention to these non-verbal cues?

93
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,829
“With about three-quarters of people I can tell [if they’re lying] pretty much instantaneously.”

94
00:06:57,829 --> 00:07:04,199
“… a hand comes near the mouth, or a swallow before an answer… is eye contact suddenly

95
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,349
different? Does the person repeatedly look off to the left as she searches for true answers

96
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:12,669
to questions, then suddenly look off to the right… when she gives one particular answer?”

97
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:16,960
So to come back to our question, can people detect lies?

98
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,099
Although there are some exceptions, which we will talk about soon, the answer is generally

99
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:23,789
that people are no better than chance at detecting deception.

100
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:30,789
Bond and DePaulo reported an average lie-detection accuracy for lay persons of 54% in their 2006

101
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:31,439
study.

102
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:36,050
It&#39;s not just lay people though. People who work in law enforcement, such as police officers

103
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:41,180
and customs officials, also perform at chance levels, as shown in research by Kraut &amp; Poe

104
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,629
in 1980. There are some exceptions to this however, such as secret service agents and

105
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:52,469
some members of the intelligence community, as Ekman &amp; O&#39;Sullivan, observed in 1991. But

106
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:55,889
the general rule holds that people are no better than chance.

107
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:01,240
Now why is that? Well let&#39;s start by asking the question in a slightly different way.

108
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,949
What non-verbal behaviours do people think are linked with being deceptive? Vrij and

109
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:12,789
Semin in 1996 asked professional lie detectors, students, and prisoners this very question.

110
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:17,710
They found that prisoners were significantly better at identifying the cues associated

111
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,649
with deception (32%) compared to the other two groups of participants.

112
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:27,289
Now what is one reason for this? Well, professional lie detectors, such as police, might not perform

113
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:31,949
better than non-professional lie detectors because they don&#39;t get very good quality feedback

114
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:37,260
on whether someone is actually being deceptive or not. In investigations, it can be very

115
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:42,349
difficult to know with absolute certainty, what exactly went on. And as we&#39;ve heard,

116
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:46,839
even when we have a confession to a crime, or an eyewitness identification or account

117
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:50,400
of events, these may be misleading for a whole range of reasons.

118
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,820
It&#39;s also possible that prisoners are particularly good at lie detection because it’s more

119
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,770
essential for them to do this well. It can literally mean the difference between life

120
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,460
and death.

121
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,180
Now lack of training might also contribute to the relatively poor deception detection

122
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,940
performance for some groups.

123
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:12,450
Porter, Woodworth and Birt in 2000 looked that the role of training. They found that

124
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,960
training, practice and feedback in detecting the nonverbal indicators of deception all

125
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,770
actually improved accuracy.

126
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:24,280
Mann, Vrij and Bull in 2004 also showed that more experienced officers performed better

127
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,380
than less experienced officers, and they also at better than chance levels. Experienced officers

128
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,620
were able to detect deception with an accuracy of 65%.

129
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,470
So in sum, people in general are not very good at detecting deception, and with a few

130
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:42,180
very special exceptions, they are really no better than chance - you may as well be guessing!

131
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:47,150
Interesting, even though people are generally not very good at detecting deception, people

132
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:53,690
are confident in their ability to detect lies as research by Vrij in 1993 shows. Unfortunately

133
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:59,650
the correlation between confidence in ability to detect lies and accuracy in detecting lies

134
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,180
is not very strong.

135
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,370
Why is this?

136
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:08,610
Well observers generally think that deception is associated with increased speech disturbances,

137
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:15,390
high pitched voice, longer latency during speech, and looking away which is also called gaze aversion.

138
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,400
And they also think it is associated with increased body movements.

139
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,470
Now from the start of this presentation, you will know that voice pitch is the only one

140
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,750
of those behaviours that is reliably related to deception. Speech disturbances and latency

141
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,130
periods are related to deception, but the nature of that relationship changes with the

142
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:36,530
different types of lies that can be told. And in fact, you also know that it is actually

143
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:41,760
decreased body movements that are associated with deception.

144
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,230
So why do people think that these things are associated with being deceptive when they might not be? Probably

145
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:52,560
because they are all markers of being nervous, and as Knapp and colleagues showed in 1974,

146
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,450
people assume that liars will actually be nervous.

147
00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:00,210
Essentially the problem is that people have a stereotype about what it means to look deceptive,

148
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:04,440
and parts of that stereotype are accurate (as for voice pitch) and parts of that stereotype

149
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,840
are inaccurate (the other cues that we talked about).

150
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,430
Interestingly, some of our research that was published in 2013 

151
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:15,290
actually suggests that people are most influenced by the parts of the stereotype

152
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:20,310
that are inaccurate, and they largely ignore the parts of the stereotype that are accurate.

153
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:25,780
Now this makes it really hard for people to accurately detect deception!

154
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:30,440
Having been rather pessimistic about observers&#39; ability to detect lies, there are a few ways

155
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,930
that people can be more accurate in this task.

156
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:36,610
We&#39;ve already heard how training in deception detection, and just generally having more

157
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:39,690
experience at it, helps to improve accuracy rates.

158
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,410
Ekman and O&#39;Sullivan argue that if you train people to specifically pay attention to micro

159
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:48,110
momentary expressions of the face, you can increase their ability to detect lies as well

160
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:54,250
Slepian and colleagues 2013 study of poker players&#39; ability to detect deception, suggest

161
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:59,350
that cues unrelated to the face might be more useful. They found that observers were more

162
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:03,800
accurate at identifying the quality of other poker players&#39; hands by paying attention to

163
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:09,130
the hand movements when placing bets rather than the players&#39; faces and upper bodies.

164
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:13,670
So perhaps we need to stop focusing on the eyes and other facial features.

165
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:18,530
Perhaps consistent with this, Porter and Brinke in 2010 argue that paying attention to multiple

166
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:24,070
cues, rather than just a single cue, can improve lie detection ability.

167
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:28,530
On the other hand, Reinhard and colleagues 2013 study suggested that observers should

168
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:34,000
avoid consciously trying to attend to cues at all, and rely instead on unconscious processing

169
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,700
of multiple cues. In their study, unconscious decision makers, that is, people who were

170
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,370
kept from actively thinking deliberatively about detecting deception, actually performed

171
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,240
the best and at better than chance levels.

172
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,980
So perhaps telling people to actively pay close attention to verbal and non-verbal behaviour

173
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,750
or demeanour is not necessarily the best way to detect deception. This is a point

174
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,550
made originally by Meissner and Kassin in 2004.

175
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:05,630
Apart from these avenues for potentially improving deception detection, is there some other way

176
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:10,380
we might be more accurate that doesn&#39;t rely on perceivers’ own perceptions of nonverbal

177
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:16,180
behaviours? What about lie detection machines? We will talk about the polygraph and other

178
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,120
such machines in the next presentation.
