Right. So I see a prior here for robbery. Nothing to say about that?

1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,120
I was 18 years old and mentally un...

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,460
Yeah, we all make our choices, Scott. 

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:28,300
Did you know this woman? Why did you lie to us Scott?

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,060
I knew you’d have a go at me.

5
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,060
Happens a lot does it?

6
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,789
You were seen at the overpass by multiple witnesses. You ran from the scene frightened

7
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,109
enough to drop your bag. You had gym clothes in your bag, 

8
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,949
but no one at the gym recalls ever seeing you.

9
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,700
I just need to get home. I haven’t slept all night.

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,640
I’m talking.

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,590
I’m not trying to fight you.

12
00:00:54,590 --> 00:01:00,150
We know you’re into hurting women. You were at the right place at the right time.

13
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,040
You behaved in a guilty fashion. 

14
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,060
Why’d you run Scott?

15
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,080
I panicked is all. I didn’t even know what

16
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:15,520
I was looking at at first. And then it all sort of come into focus. And then I see that fellow

17
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:23,700
lookin&#39; at me and I just saw problems. I just wanted to go home. It was a...

18
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,750
An opportunity. No. A complication.

19
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,800
Look a woman on her own walking down an alley like that. No woman I know would do that.

20
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,600
Too risky. She must have liked the thrill of it.

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,330
I don’t know what she liked. I didn’t know her.

22
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:50,150
You wanted to scare her; maybe she wanted to be scared, but it went a little too far.

23
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,750
No, that’s not it. I didn’t mean to...

24
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,390
You didn’t mean to kill her?

25
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:58,280
I never hurt anyone who didn’t want to be hurt. I’ve never murdered...

26
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:05,280
So you think she wanted to be hurt? I should have taken the long way home.

27
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,000
Are we done? Can I go home now? I’ve got to get to my mum.

28
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,080
As soon as you tell me how you did it. I keep telling you...I’m sorry she’s dead,

29
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,900
but it wasn’t me. Sure it was. We all get impulses every now

30
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:38,709
and then. Everyone looks bright on the outside, but scratch the surface and we all have a

31
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:44,469
bit of darkness eh? It’s human nature. Is that how it was?

32
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:52,140
Woke up that morning and there’s that itch, that dark itch and sometimes we just have

33
00:02:52,249 --> 00:02:58,620
to scratch it. Then there’s the knife. Where did you get it?

34
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,669
If I tell you will you let me go?
