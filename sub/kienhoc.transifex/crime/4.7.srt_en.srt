Next week on Crime 101!

1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,840
You don&#39;t have enough to make this stick and I think you know that.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,340
Don&#39;t the rules also ask whether the public interest requires a prosecution?

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,880
Controversy continues as the trial is about to commence.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,120
Jury selection takes place tomorrow and it may be the most important part of the trial.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,640
Juror 5

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,660
Challenge!

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,080
Finally, keep an open mind as the case progresses.

8
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:32,571
Shouldn&#39;t be too hard for them - their minds look pretty vacant already.
