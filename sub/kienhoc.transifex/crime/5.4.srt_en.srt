So, does jury selection actually influence jurors&#39; decisions? Does it matter who you

1
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,289
chose from that previous set of images? In other words, is it possible to challenge jurors

2
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,009
in such a way as to influence how the jury will decide a case?

3
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:32,800
In some countries, such as the United States of America, there are actually profitable

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,250
jury selection industries where professional consultants advise trial lawyers on how to

5
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,390
select the most favourable jury for any particular case. In fact, in the USA, according to Lieberman

6
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:50,589
and Sale&#39;s 2007 research, trial consultants are used in almost all major litigation - and

7
00:00:50,589 --> 00:00:56,269
one of the services provided by those consultants is what is called &#39;scientific jury selection&#39;.

8
00:00:56,269 --> 00:01:01,579
As Lieberman sets out in his 2011 paper on scientific jury selection, the idea is to

9
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:06,640
essentially use the scientific method as we explained at the opening of this course to

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,310
identify those jurors who will be positively disposed to the consultant&#39;s client, and those

11
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:16,640
jurors who will be negatively disposed. The assumption is that by using systematic research

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,600
techniques, consultants should be better at predicting the attitudes of jurors than lawyers

13
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,780
relying on their intuition and experience.

14
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:29,740
So how do we know if they actually are better at doing this then? That is, how do we test

15
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:35,540
that assumption that trial consultants might be more effective at selecting jurors. Well,

16
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,549
testing this actually more difficult that it seems at first.

17
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:45,890
As Lieberman noted in 2011, looking at trial outcomes might not necessarily provide a good

18
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:51,530
measure of the effectiveness of scientific jury selection. One reason is related to the

19
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:57,170
cost of using trial consultants. Because of the expense, only those defendants who can

20
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:02,810
afford the cost actually employ them, and those defendants are also more likely to hire

21
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:09,700
top tier legal representation. So it’s difficult to know if we do actually observe better outcomes,

22
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:14,640
whether those outcomes are due to the input of the trial consultants or the greater skill

23
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,590
of the lawyers who’ve been hired.

24
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:23,060
The approach that about thirty years of research has taken has been to rephrase the question

25
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,530
somewhat.

26
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,389
Rather than necessarily directly comparing the performance of consultants to lawyers&#39;

27
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:33,450
intuition, which would actually be very difficult, researchers have focused on whether individual

28
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:39,389
juror characteristics are related to trial outcomes. The idea here is that if juror characteristics

29
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:46,389
are related to trial outcomes and consultants are selecting jurors based on these characteristics,

30
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,840
then there should be some merit to scientific jury selection.

31
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,680
So does it work when we look at the effect of individual juror characteristics?

32
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,819
Well, possibly not. This is partly because in jurisdictions that allow potential jurors

33
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:06,450
to be surveyed, up to 30% of jurors do not disclose all of the relevant information in questionnaires

34
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,439
designed to aid selection, and so any attempt to influence the

35
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:15,019
composition of the jury is often made on partial information.

36
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:20,919
Some research by Lloyd-Bostock in 1988 also suggests that any individual juror biases

37
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:27,159
are actually quite a minor influence on the verdict, because individual jurors themselves don&#39;t decide

38
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:31,919
the verdict, but rather the jury as a group arrives at the verdict. We will come back

39
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:38,150
to the process of jury deliberation and what effect it has on decisions in a later video.

40
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:44,829
Other research by Baldwin and McConville in 1979 looked at 500 cases in the United Kingdom.

41
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:51,089
They found that no single social variable (such as age, gender, or race) was actually

42
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:54,980
associated with variation in the verdicts returned by jurors.

43
00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:00,499
In fact, the work of a number of researchers including Diamond and colleagues in 1998 and

44
00:04:00,499 --> 00:04:05,819
Hastie and colleagues in 1983 suggests that any individual juror characteristic actually

45
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:11,319
only accounts for about 2% of the variation in verdicts, and combined juror characteristics

46
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:16,299
account for only 5% of the variation in verdicts.

47
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:21,359
Visher found in 1987 that if there is strong evidence against the defendant, jury composition

48
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,100
actually doesn’t matter at all.

49
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,990
So the lack of a relationship between juror characteristics and verdicts, and the fact

50
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,970
that jury composition doesn&#39;t appear to matter when evidence is strong, both suggest quite

51
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:38,350
clearly that influencing the composition of the jury doesn’t appear to make much of

52
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,540
a difference.

53
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,900
Having said that jurors&#39; individual differences probably don&#39;t matter, it&#39;s worth nothing

54
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,320
that according to Ellsworth&#39;s 1993 research, most cases actually start with an initial

55
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,160
lack of agreement about the verdict when the jury takes it&#39;s first ballot in the deliberation

56
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,530
room.

57
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,310
Given that all jurors actually hear the same evidence in the court room, this suggests

58
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:04,190
that some individual differences must contribute to how they evaluate the evidence.

59
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,780
So what might those juror characteristics be?

60
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:12,730
Juror gender seems to matter in some cases. Hans and Vidmar&#39;s 1982 study suggested that

61
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:18,450
female jurors were more likely to convict in cases involving allegations of rape, and

62
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:24,540
Crowley and colleague&#39;s 1994 study found a similar effect in child sexual abuse cases.

63
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,100
Hans and Vidmar also found that older jurors were more likely to convict, as are jurors

64
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:35,250
with higher educational qualifications. Dillehay and Nietzel&#39;s 1985 study found the same effect

65
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,430
for jurors with previous jury experience.

66
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:43,600
Baldwin and McConville showed in 1979, however, that the race of the jury doesn’t seem to

67
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,810
matter, with Black defendants unfortunately being more likely to be perversely convicted

68
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,440
regardless of the racial composition of the jury.

69
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,140
Now in some jurisdictions it is possible to ask about the attitudes of jurors, in particular

70
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:02,750
their attitudes about the legal system in general and defendants as well. One such measure

71
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,860
that was designed to assess these sorts of beliefs is the Juror Bias Scale, which was

72
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,390
developed by Kassin and Wrightsman in 1983. Measures like this one tend to be slightly

73
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:18,640
better predictors of verdicts. For example, according to Lecci and Myers in 2009, the

74
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:25,020
Juror Bias Scale has been shown to typically explain about 15% of the variation in jurors’

75
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,750
verdicts. Now given the relative intrusiveness of questions asked in many of these types

76
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:35,120
of surveys, the opportunity to use them is actually often limited.

77
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,110
So while juror characteristics play only a small role in the verdicts that are returned,

78
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:44,180
and thereby potentially limiting the effectiveness of attempts to select a favourable jury based

79
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,420
on these characteristics, scientific jury selection actually makes use of a broader

80
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:55,440
range of selection tools beyond just juror characteristics. Now, as Lieberman noted in

81
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,060
2011, it’s actually very difficult to test these full range of techniques. So perhaps

82
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,640
it&#39;s fair to say, if you will pardon the pun, that the jury is actually still out on the

83
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,930
effectiveness of scientific jury selection.

84
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:13,530
It&#39;s also fair to say that those more thorough methods of jury selection are permitted in

85
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:18,330
only a limited number of jurisdictions, and so most attempts at selection will probably

86
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:23,820
be based on visible juror characteristics such as gender and age and so on.

87
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,060
So if individual juror characteristics, at least the ones that can be easily identified,

88
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,950
don&#39;t influence verdicts very much if at all, perhaps attempts to influence the composition

89
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:35,060
of the jury are not going to be that effective.

90
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,840
So what does influence jurors&#39; verdicts?

91
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,510
As we will discuss in the next couple of episodes, jurors are strongly influenced by the strength

92
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,370
of the evidence against the defendant 

93
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:49,190
as well as other factors outside of the evidence. Jury deliberation also plays a role

94
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,760
in jurors&#39; final verdicts, and helps to resolve many of the initial differences of opinion

95
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,590
that jurors may have.
