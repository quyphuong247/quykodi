How do juries deliberate? So last week we heard how individual jurors

1
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,490
arrive at their preferred verdict when hearing the evidence presented at trial. We talked

2
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,400
about the sorts of things that influence them and how they combine information, typically

3
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,110
into a story, about the events that led to the offence. What happens when they have to

4
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,020
discuss their interpretation of the evidence and their preferred verdict with the other

5
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,280
jurors?

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,640
Well over the next two videos, we are going to talk about how juries deliberate to reach

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,300
a verdict, whether these deliberations influence individual jurors&#39; views, and the different

8
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:53,440
ways that jury deliberations can unfold, and what sorts of things influence how jurors deliberate.

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,280
Now in terms of factors that might influence how a jury deliberates, one of the things

10
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,149
that people often think is important is the foreperson. This is the person chosen by the

11
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,680
jury to lead the group during discussions and also to be the spokesperson in the courtroom,

12
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,950
particularly when the verdict is returned. So, does who the jury selects as the foreperson

13
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,220
make a difference as to how the jury deliberates?

14
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,860
Well, lets start with how the foreperson is selected, and what they are typically like.

15
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,170
Usually the foreperson is elected by the jury. One view, put forward by the Morris Committee

16
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,600
in 1965, is that the foreperson should ideally possess the qualities of a good chairperson

17
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,909
but be no different from the other jurors. Saks and Hastie&#39;s 1978 research suggests that

18
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:40,090
the person chosen as the foreperson tends to be male, from a high socio-economic background,

19
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:45,140
be older, be the person who sits at the head of the jury table, and is the person who often

20
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,880
speaks first during deliberations.

21
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,119
Curiously though, Ellison and Munro 2010 found in a study with mock jurors, that when the

22
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:55,799
person who spoke first was a woman, it was still often the case that a male juror was

23
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,820
nominated to be the foreperson — the woman speaking first was often nominating a man

24
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,100
to be the foreperson.

25
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:06,759
A common view is that the foreperson is very influential. McCabe and Purves&#39; 1974 research

26
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:11,510
suggests otherwise, however. In that study, the foreperson did not exert a greater influence

27
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,660
on the decision compared to the other jurors. In contrast, Devine and colleagues 2001 review

28
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,950
of 45 years of jury research argued that the foreperson has a big influence on the style

29
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,650
of jury deliberations — whether the jury focusses initially on trying to reach a verdict

30
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:32,480
or on systematically evaluating the evidence. As such, it&#39;s possible that the foreperson

31
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,430
might influence the verdict indirectly through the way in which the jury deliberates.

32
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:42,160
It&#39;s also worth noting that the jury foreperson tends to determine who speaks and when, and

33
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,780
so can shape the discussion in that way. Ellison and Munro&#39;s 2010 research and Manzo&#39;s 1996

34
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,680
research provide some evidence for this. They are certainly also viewed as being more influential

35
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,110
by the other jurors according to Diamond and Casper&#39;s 1992 study. He or she also speaks

36
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:06,269
more often than the average juror, they speak about 25-31% of the time during deliberations

37
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:11,640
according to Ellison and Munro. And consistent with this, Diamond and Casper in 1992 found

38
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:18,640
that the foreperson spoke about 1770 words in comparison to the average juror&#39;s 789 words.

39
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:24,970
Now much of what they said, however, was designed to help organise the jury rather than express

40
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,319
a verdict preference.

41
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,800
Ok, so the foreperson possibly doesn&#39;t seem to exert a big direct influence on the jury&#39;s

42
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,750
verdict but, as Devine and colleagues found in a review of jury research, the foreperson

43
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,810
is influential in deciding how the jury deliberates.

44
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:46,379
So lets look at how jury deliberation itself influences or changes jurors&#39; decisions. What

45
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:50,909
are some of the features aside from the influence of the foreperson that might affect how juries

46
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:52,470
deliberate?

47
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,500
Let&#39;s start with the question of whether deliberation alters jury decisions. Now there has been

48
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,760
a general belief, which came from Kalven and Zeisel&#39;s influential study in 1966, that jurors

49
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,269
have already decided a verdict before they retire to deliberate. Thus, the thinking was

50
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:11,709
that deliberations did not have a big impact on jurors&#39; decisions.

51
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:16,450
Now this doesn&#39;t really fit with what we know about outcomes of deliberations however.

52
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,590
Many juries don&#39;t start out with a unanimous agreement before discussing the case. There

53
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:25,280
will be a majority group of jurors who favour one verdict and a smaller minority group who

54
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,110
think differently.

55
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,530
Given that juries are able to reach agreement in the majority of cases, deliberation must

56
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,699
exert some influence on jurors&#39; decisions.

57
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:39,360
Hastie and colleagues&#39; 1983 research even showed that the minority of jurors prevailed

58
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,130
and were able to change the minds of the majority in 25% of cases. So deliberation is obviously

59
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,050
important, and one way of making sense of these two different sets of findings — that

60
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:55,219
jurors decide their verdicts before deliberation and that deliberation changes jurors&#39; minds on the other hand

61
00:04:55,219 --> 00:05:00,750
— is to distinguish between different types of deliberations. This is a point made by

62
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,979
Sandys and Dillehay in 1995.

63
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:08,620
One of the main distinctions identified by Lieberman and Krauss in 2009 is the difference

64
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:14,330
between verdict driven deliberations and evidence driven deliberations. And the work of Devine

65
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,720
and colleagues suggests that it is through the foreperson&#39;s preference for one of these

66
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,110
styles of deliberation that the foreperson can exert an influence on the outcome of the

67
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,680
deliberations.

68
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,759
Verdict driven deliberations are those types of jury group discussion focussed on reaching

69
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,650
a unanimous decision or a majority decision if the decision rule for the jury requires

70
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,680
only a majority decision. The discussion tends to be less about the evidence and more

71
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,310
about discussing the verdict options. Pressure might be applied to any holdout minority jurors

72
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:51,100
to get them to agree with the majority position. A characteristic of this type of deliberation

73
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,560
is frequent attempts to take a poll for the verdict, which has a consequence of identifying

74
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,419
any individual jurors who might disagree with the majority.

75
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:03,940
Now you saw this type of discussion at the start of the jury&#39;s deliberation in the Crime101

76
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,280
drama this week.

77
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,229
Evidence driven deliberations on the other hand, focus on a more systematic discussion

78
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:14,410
of the evidence that was presented at trial. For these types of deliberations, there will

79
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:20,229
be less of a focus on simply trying to pressure people into reaching a decision. The emphasis

80
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:25,509
is on evaluating the evidence rather than taking polls in an attempt to reach a verdict.

81
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:30,539
Now you saw this type of discussion towards the end of the jury&#39;s deliberation in the

82
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:32,699
Crime101 drama this week.

83
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,550
A moment ago, I mentioned different types of jury decision rule. The jury decision rule

84
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:43,300
is the required number of jurors needed for agreement for a verdict. In some jurisdictions, all jurors are required

85
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:49,440
to agree to the verdict before it is accepted by the court. This is called a unanimous decision

86
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,199
rule.

87
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,690
In other jurisdictions, a majority decision will be accepted by the court. The size of

88
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:59,970
the majority that will be accepted depends on the size of the jury. For a twelve-person

89
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:05,410
jury, this might be a majority of 10 or 11 out of 12. It can be a little more complicated

90
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:11,050
than this, however. The type of decision rule used can also depend on the offence that the

91
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,990
defendant is being tried for.

92
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:17,840
For the more serious offences, a unanimous rule might be required. In addition, in some

93
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,270
jurisdictions, even for the most serious offences, a majority decision will be accepted if the

94
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:28,400
jury is not able to reach aunanimous decision after a certain period of time has elapsed.

95
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,150
So the decision rule can vary by jurisdiction, by the nature of the offence, and also by

96
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:37,830
the time that the jury has been deliberating for. Now majority decision rules are often

97
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:42,340
favoured because of concerns about hung juries — these are juries that can&#39;t agree on a

98
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:47,099
verdict. Now this actually only happens in a tiny minority of cases. There have also

99
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:52,050
been some concerns expressed about the time taken by juries to deliberate.

100
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:58,220
So does jury decision rule have any effect on how the jury makes their decision?

101
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,699
Nemeth&#39;s 1981 research suggests that the majority decision rule is associated with: less participation

102
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:09,090
by minority jurors; the majority jurors paying less attention to the minority jurors; fewer

103
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:14,360
hung juries; deliberations taking a shorter time; and, perhaps problematically, a greater

104
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,789
likelihood of conviction and more errors in recalling the evidence.

105
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:24,250
Now why is this? Well, because the jurors in the majority are not required to convince

106
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,849
the dissenting minority about the correctness of the majority position, they can generally

107
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:33,940
ignore the minority jurors. Therefore, they can avoid discussing the evidence in any great

108
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,990
detail, and just apply social pressure in an attempt to reach a majority of the required

109
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,069
size.

110
00:08:40,068 --> 00:08:44,630
Ok, so it seems that juries operating under a majority decision rule are prone to making

111
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:49,630
poorer decisions than those working under a unanimous decision rule. When discussing

112
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,769
the nature of the majority that will be accepted, I mentioned that juries can come in different

113
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:54,430
sizes.

114
00:08:54,430 --> 00:09:00,880
In Australia, New Zealand and some other jurisdictions, criminal cases are heard by juries of twelve.

115
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,269
In the United States of America, following the Supreme Court decision in Williams and

116
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:09,880
Florida in 1970, as few as six jurors can hear a criminal case.

117
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,810
Thomas and Pollack (1992) used probability theory in 1992 to argue that six and twelve

118
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:20,459
person juries are equivalent in terms of how they make decisions. Researchers also often

119
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:24,580
use six person juries in their studies because logistically it is a lot easier to conduct

120
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:30,450
studies on juries of six compared to twelve (you need half as many people for a start).

121
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,830
Unfortunately the research suggests that juries of six and twelve do not function in the same

122
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:39,690
way. Six-person juries communicate less; are less likely to recall the evidence accurately

123
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:45,620
or examine the evidence thoroughly, and according to Saks&#39;s 1977 research are more likely to

124
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,120
reach agreement that is, they are less likely to hang. They are also less representative

125
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,660
of the community; and they often return different verdicts; and are more likely to convict.

126
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,490
These issues were identified by Hans and Vidmar&#39;s 1986 research.

127
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:04,850
Now, why is this? Well one of the main reasons for these differences between juries of six

128
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,510
compared to twelve is conformity.

129
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:13,730
Conformity occurs when people yield to real or imagined social pressure. Asch&#39;s 1955 study

130
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,149
was important in highlighting how groups bring about conformity, and illuminating the conditions

131
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:21,230
that enhance conformity and those that diminish conformity.

132
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:26,029
So let’s look at Asch’s paradigm. Asch gave a group of participants, who took part

133
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:30,339
in the study as part of a group, a picture of a vertical line followed by a second picture

134
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:35,200
of three vertical lines. Participants were asked in turn which of the three lines matched

135
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,570
the length of the original line.

136
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:43,019
In this example, the answer is clearly B. Now, in this study, all of the participants

137
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:47,940
except one, were working with the experimenter. So they weren&#39;t actually real participants,

138
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,970
they were what we call confederates. All of the confederates responded before the real

139
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,140
participant. On some trials the confederates all gave the correct answer, while on others

140
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:03,720
they gave an obviously incorrect answer — for example line A in our example.

141
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,390
Asch was interested in whether the real participant would go along with the group, and why. Asch

142
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:14,250
found that the vast majority of participants, 76% in fact, went along with the group and

143
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:19,890
conformed on at least one trial when the group was giving an obviously incorrect answer.

144
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,899
Asch argued that there were two reasons why conformity occurs like this. The first is

145
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:28,810
called normative influence. Here the real participant maintains his or her private view

146
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:33,940
about what the correct answer is, but conforms in public to avoid ridicule or social censure

147
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:39,269
from the rest of the group. The second is called informational influence — if a person

148
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:43,250
is not sure about what the correct answer is the group&#39;s response helps the real participant

149
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,600
to identify what the &quot;correct&quot; answer might be.

150
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,870
Interestingly, in some studies, Asch varied whether the group gave an unanimous but incorrect

151
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:55,870
answer, or whether there was non-unanimity in the views of the rest of the group. We&#39;ve

152
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,279
seen in our example so far what an unanimous but incorrect answer would look like — the

153
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:05,769
rest of the group chooses the same but incorrect response. What happens however if the some

154
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:10,600
of the group chooses one incorrect response and the remaining group members choose another

155
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:17,600
incorrect response? What will the real participant do in this situation when there is non-unanimity?

156
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:22,570
Well Asch&#39;s studies show us that when there is non-unanimity in the views of other group

157
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:28,829
members, then the rate of conformity dramatically reduces. It is sufficient if only a single

158
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:33,769
other member of the group disagrees with the majority. That single dissenter doesn&#39;t even

159
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:38,800
have to agree with the real participants&#39; response for conformity to be reduced, the

160
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,959
dissenter simply just has to give a different response to the majority.

161
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,810
So how does this relate to how juries deliberate, and jury size?

162
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:52,110
Well, let&#39;s try a thought experiment to illustrate this. Imagine a jury of six and a jury of

163
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:57,370
twelve. Let&#39;s imagine that the rate of dissent in the general population about a particular

164
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:03,550
issue is one in six. If we select people from the general population to form two juries,

165
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:08,240
one made of six people, and one made of twelve people, then we would expect the rate of dissent

166
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,510
to be represented in each jury like this.

167
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:16,269
The six-person jury will statistically have one person who dissents on this issue. The

168
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:19,639
twelve-person jury will have two people who dissent.

169
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,579
Asch&#39;s studies tell us that the pressures for conformity will be much greater in the

170
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:28,089
six-person jury compared to the twelve-person jury because it is much more likely that a

171
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:31,940
dissenter in a six-person jury will be on their own.

172
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:36,120
So the evidence suggests jury deliberation does influence individual jurors, and that

173
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,180
twelve-person juries working under a unanimous decision rule tend to be more systematic and

174
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,480
thorough in their decision-making.

175
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,000
As such, we&#39;ve heard that juries with certain characteristics make better decisions. In

176
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,240
the next video, we will talk about whether juries as groups make better decisions compared

177
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,589
to individual jurors.
