So if we treat these accounts as an eyewitness&#39;s memory of a crime, how would we explain these

1
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:28,269
inaccuracies? A psychologist called Daniel Greenberg from

2
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:35,269
Duke University suggested two explanations. The first, he called &#39;wrong time-slice&#39; error.

3
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,070
Experimental evidence about memory for everyday occurrences suggests that when asked to retrieve

4
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,620
memories about particular everyday events, people often respond with a description of

5
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,680
an event from a completely different time. TV footage is particularly likely to lead

6
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,920
to interference of this kind, because of the strength and dominance of visual imagery.

7
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,460
Visual images can bring about memory errors, in Greenwald&#39;s words, precisely because they

8
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:09,659
are &quot;easy to generate, easy to modify, and easy to remember.&quot;

9
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:16,539
Now, as we know, President Bush couldn&#39;t possibly have seen the television footage of the first

10
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:21,469
plane crash, prior to going into the classroom. However, like the rest of us, he no doubt

11
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:27,100
had repeated exposure to the footage in the days and weeks following the tragedy.

12
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,530
So, it appears likely that he remembered the footage, but misjudged when he saw it - a

13
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:39,729
textbook example of a &#39;wrong time-slice&#39; error. But a Bush-skeptic could still argue that

14
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:45,229
he, of all people, should not have been susceptible to an error of this kind, given the personal

15
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:50,630
significance of the news. Surely, a New Yorker, for example, couldn&#39;t

16
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,850
make the same mistake? To answer that question, let&#39;s have a quick

17
00:01:54,850 --> 00:02:01,850
look at a study by psychologist Kathy Pezdek. Seven weeks after 9/11, she got undergraduates

18
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:09,860
in Hawaii, California, and New York to answer some &#39;Yes or No&#39; questions, including: &#39;On

19
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:16,140
September 11, did you see the videotape on television of the first plane striking the

20
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,700
first tower?&#39; Now, remembering that this footage wasn&#39;t

21
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,810
actually shown until the 12th, let&#39;s have a look at the proportions of participants

22
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:32,420
who, like Bush, incorrectly claimed to have seen the footage on September 11th.

23
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:39,420
First, Hawaii, which is as far as you can get from New York while still in the USA.

24
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,560
Over there, 84% of them gave the wrong answer. Next was California, which is a little closer

25
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,950
but still on the opposite side of the continent from New York.

26
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:58,650
Over there, things were a little better - only 61% gave the wrong answer.

27
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,910
But what about the New Yorkers themselves? Surely only a few would have got it wrong.

28
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:11,910
In fact 76% percent of New Yorkers made the very same mistake that Bush made.

29
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:19,080
In addition to this, across the entire sample, those who incorrectly answered &#39;yes&#39;, were

30
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,790
more confident in their answers than those who answered &#39;no&#39;.

31
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,630
That is, those who were confidence were more likely to be wrong.

32
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:35,170
This is a particularly important point as we&#39;ll find out later in this course, as confidence

33
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:40,540
is the main cue that people use to judge the accuracy of an eyewitness, on the assumption

34
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:47,540
that more confident people are more accurate. The other explanation for Bush&#39;s error suggested

35
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:53,960
by Greenwald is about narrative construction. This is the idea that when constructing a

36
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,590
narrative account of an event, people sometimes reconstruct gaps in the course based on a script

37
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:05,260
i.e., a general idea of what usually happens in a situation.

38
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,930
Bush did see video footage (of the aftermath of the first crash) playing in the school

39
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,380
building before he left. Greenberg argues after seeing the footage

40
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:20,400
of the crash, he may well have incorporated it into the video he saw in the school, completing

41
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,340
the story by adding cause to effect. In the few seconds or so it took him to formulate

42
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,810
an answer to the question, this story may have seemed reasonable enough; there was footage,

43
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:37,540
after all; people do tend to learn these things from TV; and he was watching TV that morning.&#39;

44
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:43,870
Greenberg also noted the tentativeness of memories 1 and 3. Both times, he starts by

45
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:49,630
discussing the second attack, only to interrupt himself and talk about the first; when he

46
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:54,590
does talk about the first crash, he backtracks, making statements like &#39;the TV was obviously

47
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,900
on.&#39; Such hesitations and revisions create the

48
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:05,350
impression that the President is reasoning out - perhaps reconstructing it - as he goes.

49
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:12,350
So, Bush seems to be off the hook. There&#39;s no need to look to conspiracy theories

50
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:18,990
or deliberate lying to understand his mistakes. He&#39;s making eyewitness memory errors, but

51
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:24,290
exactly the same sort of errors that most other people made.

52
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,840
This is despite the particularly shocking nature of this crime, the sort of crime that

53
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:35,200
we would expect to be unforgettable. And, while the errors did not directly affect

54
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,169
the crime investigation in this case, it&#39;s not hard to imagine how such errors, where

55
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:45,830
most people are reporting seeing something a whole day before they actually saw it, might

56
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:52,620
have serious consequences if that information was pivotal to solving a crime.

57
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:59,620
So, this example illustrates a number of the misconceptions that people have about eyewitness

58
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:05,669
memory and how it operates. First, eyewitness memory is a lot less accurate

59
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:11,270
than people expect it to be. Second, retrieving memories of an event is

60
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,280
not like passively playing back a video of the event.

61
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,770
Memory retrieval is a creative, constructive process - which makes it vulnerable to errors

62
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:27,800
such as selecting the wrong time-slice and narrative reconstruction - as well as other

63
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,300
issues that we&#39;ll visit later. Third, people&#39;s confidence in the accuracy

64
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:39,400
of their memories is unreliable. In fact, in Cathy Pezdek&#39;s data, the more

65
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,740
confident they were, the less likely they were to be correct.

66
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:50,440
That is, people lack insight into the accuracy of their own memories.

67
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,919
This is critical to understanding eyewitness memory because, as we&#39;ll see, an eyewitness&#39;s

68
00:06:54,919 --> 00:07:01,270
confidence is the key factor that people use to judge the eyewitness&#39;s accuracy, and this

69
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,979
turns out to be a surprisingly unreliable cue.

70
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:10,080
In the interest of political balance, here&#39;s a similar example about Hilary Clinton as

71
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,729
told by one of the most influential eyewitness memory researcher&#39;s there is, Elizabeth Loftus,

72
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:22,449
here interviewed by Matt Thompson. There&#39;s certainly a lot of famous politicians

73
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:29,449
who have had distorted memories, and one of my favourite ones is Hilary Clinton who was

74
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,520
running for the presidency of the United States when she talked about a trip that she had

75
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:42,820
taken to Bosnia. And she had a very vivid recollection of landing under sniper fire

76
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:48,870
on this trip. It was supposed to be a greeting ceremony, but instead they just had to run

77
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:55,870
to the base. And later photographs were revealed of this landing in Bosnia, and it was extremely

78
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:05,259
peaceful. It was... lots of children there, Hilary&#39;s daughter was there, and so what&#39;s

79
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:11,270
going on here? She had a distorted memory, one that resulted in a little bit of embarrassment

80
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:18,270
for her because people called her Pinocchio. But she made a mistake; I mean she had a false

81
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:25,169
memory. And her case shows us that all that intelligence, all that experience, all that

82
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:31,370
education, that Yale Law School degree, doesn&#39;t protect you from having false memories.

83
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:37,050
Next, we&#39;ll look at how memory works, how false memories can be created, and what we

84
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:44,050
can try and do to deal with the problems of eyewitness memory.
