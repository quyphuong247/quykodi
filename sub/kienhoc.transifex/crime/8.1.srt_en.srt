So how do we know whether a verdict is &quot;correct&quot; or not?

1
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,150
This is actually a really, really difficult question to answer. There is no systematic

2
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,190
way to know this — we generally only identify a false conviction when new evidence comes

3
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:33,220
to light. This could be a confession from the actual perpetrator, or perhaps new DNA

4
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,890
evidence, or some other new evidence that was not originally presented at trial. This

5
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,000
type of information does not come to light, however, in many cases. It&#39;s also true that

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,960
we rarely have definitive video recording of a crime to be presented at trial.

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,640
So how can we estimate the likelihood of a false conviction?

8
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,720
One way of starting to answer this question is to look at the data generated by the Innocence

9
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,680
Project. This project looks at convictions in the United States of America and makes

10
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,340
use of advances in the analysis of forensic evidence that allow for more sensitive tests

11
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,399
that were not possible until recently. For example, you might test the DNA that was preserved

12
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:11,759
in a sample of the evidence to see whether it matches the convicted defendant.

13
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,960
The analysis of death penalty cases suggest that 4.1% of convictions are actually wrongful.

14
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,830
Bornstein and Greene (2011) suggest, quite correctly, that this analysis is not representative

15
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,470
of all types of convictions, and that there is actually very little indication that the

16
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:31,170
false conviction rate in other types of cases is similar. Given that most attention is on

17
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,280
death penalty cases, and that exonerations become much less frequent when the sentence

18
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,970
doesn&#39;t include the death penalty or when the death penalty has been commuted to life

19
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:45,100
in prison, Bornstein and Greene actually suggest that 4.1% is an underestimate 

20
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,049
of the false conviction rate.

21
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,850
Now of course, we also have no way of knowing what the false acquittal rate is either. Acquitted

22
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,689
defendants generally don&#39;t turn around and admit their guilt at the end of a trial!

23
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,299
So perhaps, as Bornstein and Greene point out, the question should be not whether the

24
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:03,009
verdict was correct, but rather whether it was reasonable given the evidence presented

25
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:08,509
at trial, and the relevant law given to the jury. Now as they suggest, because jury trials

26
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:12,790
tend to be close cases — those where either the prosecution or defence could succeed in

27
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:18,340
being the most persuasive — almost all verdicts are actually reasonable. Now as an aside, those trials

28
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,190
that are not close cases tend to be either dropped if the evidence is weak, or plea bargained

29
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,829
if the evidence is strong.

30
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:30,840
So what do you think about the case you’ve just heard about? Was the jury&#39;s verdict correct?

31
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,529
Or was it at least reasonable?
