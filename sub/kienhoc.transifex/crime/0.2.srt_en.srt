The Psychology of Criminal Justice is a massive topic, and so what we have done in this course

1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,009
is to pull out some of the main areas to introduce you to the subject area.

2
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:31,140
Whether you are a high school student, a university student, or a professional working in this

3
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,570
area wanting to find out more, our aim is to tell you a little about quite a broad range

4
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,360
of areas rather than a lot about any one area.

5
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,339
If you are especially interested in any of the topics, then we will provide you with

6
00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:46,099
week by week some references and suggestions for further reading.

7
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,120
So what will we cover in this course and how will we do it?

8
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:53,530
Well, we’re going to follow an unfolding story -- from a crime being committed, the

9
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,910
resulting investigation and court case, and we will finish with the jury&#39;s verdict.

10
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:03,019
And in all of this we will explore what psychology can contribute to our understanding, and in

11
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:05,890
some places, our practice in this context.

12
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,860
To help us do this, we’ve created a crime drama to accompany the academic content in

13
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,860
our course. Each episode of the course will begin with an episode of this drama to &#39;set

14
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,670
the scene&#39; for what we’ll be considering in that week.

15
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,000
Following that, you will hear from myself, Blake or Mark and you will engage in some

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,110
activities that will help you apply what we have told you about.

17
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:30,450
The content of this course reflects the types of serious crimes that can and do take place

18
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,350
in everyday life. As such we will frequently be discussing and thinking about crimes such

19
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,450
as sexual assault, rape, manslaughter and murder.

20
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,700
So we do need to start the course by giving you a warning that some of the material that

21
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,070
we cover, both in the drama and in the academic content, may be distressing to some.

22
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,930
In the first episode we will look at profiling to see what aspects of the crime scene can

23
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,640
tell us about the person or people who committed the crime.

24
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,229
In Episode 2 we will consider the issue of eyewitness memory. We’ll explore how memory

25
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:04,600
actually works in the context of eyewitnesses, and we’ll look at techniques that investigating

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,539
officers can use that may help eyewitnesses recall the crime more accurately.

27
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,940
We continue this theme in Episode 3 by looking at some techniques that investigating officers

28
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:19,250
have often used to help identify a suspect - photofits and lineups. We will focus on

29
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,230
the psychology of face recognition and some of the issues around how lineups are conducted.

30
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,639
In Episode 4 we talk about a couple of ways to interview a suspect and whether we can

31
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:33,130
trust confessions or not, whether we can tell if someone is lying to us, and whether lie

32
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,209
detector machines are actually helpful.

33
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:40,910
In Episode 5 we consider some common issues as we get ready for trial. Who should decide

34
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:46,340
the suspect&#39;s fate - a judge or a jury? Whether jury selection makes a difference to verdicts,

35
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,889
and also what the impact of media stories about cases actually is.

36
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:55,359
Episode 6 covers the trial itself. How do jurors make sense of evidence? What do they

37
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:58,419
pay attention to, and how do they make sense of expert testimony?

38
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:03,949
Next, in Episode 7, we get to see the jury deliberate about what the verdict should be.

39
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:08,030
We will talk about the particular characteristics of group decisions and the different ways

40
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:13,060
that juries can deliberate. We will also consider how jurors understand the judge&#39;s instructions

41
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,400
when making their decisions.

42
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,739
In the final episode, we hear what the verdict is. How is it possible to tell whether the

43
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,810
verdict is correct? How can we tell if a mistake has been made. We will also say a few words

44
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,730
about sentencing.

45
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,340
So as you can see we are taking you on a journey from the start with a crime until an ending

46
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,609
point - one where we consider sentencing.

47
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:37,169
Although there are many more points in criminal justice that psychology may contribute to

48
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:41,180
our understanding, such as looking at the psychological impact of imprisonment, it is

49
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,359
at this point we have to leave Crime 101x.

50
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:45,840
We hope you enjoy the course!
