00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,100
You don’t have enough to make this stick and I think you know that.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,880
Don’t the rules also ask whether the public interest requires a prosecution?

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,750
Controversy continues as the trial of popular real estate agent Neil Fox is about to commence.

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,290
Jury selection takes place tomorrow, and it may be the most important part of the trial

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,170
given the defendant’s public profile.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,939
Finally, keep an open mind as the case progresses.

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,760
Shouldn’t be too hard for ‘em. Their minds look pretty vacant already.

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,220
(Soft music plays)

9
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,440
Is the prosecution quite ready?

10
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,440
Yes, Your Honour, sorry.

11
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,060
(Sound of paper shuffling)

12
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:07,650
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Have you ever been out in the Brisbane sun on a crisp

13
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:15,500
autumn day? You know, the ones where the air smells clean and the sky is a clear blue like

14
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,920
it could go on forever. Days like that feel full of possibility don’t they? Full of hope.

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,580
Janine Jenker was only 27 years old on a day

16
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:34,680
just like that. She had recently escaped a bad relationship, changed states, and started

17
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:41,690
a new job doing something she loved, something she was good at. Janine isn’t here to speak

18
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:48,790
to you today because something terrible happened on that perfect day.

19
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:56,110
Heading home from the gym where she worked, she cut down a back alley, a short cut to

20
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:01,530
where she had parked her bike. The up-beat music from the gym would have still been audible

21
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:09,919
to her. Minutes later she lay dying on the dirty asphalt of that cold, concrete alleyway

22
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:20,199
surrounded by strangers. She had been stabbed to death, murdered, by this defendant, Neil Fox.

23
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,940
As jury members you will have to look beyond

24
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:32,950
Mr Fox’s good looks, his current standing in the community, the charities he supports,

25
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:39,510
all the nice things the defence will say about Mr Fox. It doesn’t matter how many nice

26
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:46,510
things people say about Mr Fox, or how many nice things he has ever done. Because every

27
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:53,639
nice thing he ever did slipped away the moment he murdered Janine Jenker.

28
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:05,329
I could see you all listening intently to Mr Gambaro. Imagining yourself or someone

29
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:12,329
you love being stabbed in that alley. I understand your horror. What happened to Ms Jenker was

30
00:03:12,749 --> 00:03:19,749
a horrible crime, and whoever did it did a horrible thing. But my client was not that

31
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:26,870
person. My client did not commit this crime. My client is not guilty.

32
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:36,040
I want you to think about a different story here. It’s one where you do all the right things, but it still comes

33
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:43,040
tumbling down because you get blamed for something you did not do.

34
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:49,669
So these defensive wounds to her arms, they aren’t what killed Ms Jenker are they?

35
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:56,379
No sir. A typical adult can lose up to 40% of their blood volume before suffering irreversible

36
00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:01,689
shock. The arm wounds would not have been sufficient to produce such a loss given their

37
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:08,689
depth and location. There were also three stab wounds to the neck, one of those resulted

38
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:15,199
in the victim’s jugular vein being severed. That’s what caused the haemorrhage and shock

39
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,100
and in my opinion, that’s what caused her death.

40
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,830
So did you attach any importance to the wounds on Janine’s arm at all?

41
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:29,150
Yes, while they were not implicated in the cause of death, they did suggest that the

42
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:34,090
victim had tried to defend herself, that she saw her attacker coming. But the angle of

43
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:39,470
the wounds on the arm suggest that she only raised her arm as she was being attacked.

44
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:46,470
I’m an older man, so let me just be sure I understand what you have said. The nature

45
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:53,020
of the cuts close in like this indicate that Janine was approached by someone she may initially

46
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:59,480
have found nonthreatening, or at least someone who was able to come quite close in to her.

47
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:06,480
The defensive wounds on her arm indicate that she fought back. The blood spatter and

48
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,510
angle of the knife wounds indicate that the weapon was wielded from this very specific

49
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:22,850
angle, requiring her murderer to have been a certain height. The same height as our defendant.

50
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,870
You have understood correctly sir. But you forgot the handedness factor. As I stated

51
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:37,950
earlier, my analysis of the wound has led me to generate a conclusive case as to the

52
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:44,950
left handedness of the attacker.

53
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,420
Did the police investigators ever find the weapon?

54
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,160
No.

55
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,720
Did you ever connect my client to the site?

56
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,540
Well he was at the site, so yes of course.

57
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:13,500
We found several traces linking the defendant to the scene of the crime.

58
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,500
Of course he was there, as he was trying to help the victim. Because it is deeply rooted

59
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,420
in my client’s nature to try and help people.

60
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,400
I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth

61
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,040
and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

62
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,200
Could you tell the court how you came to know the defendant?

63
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,120
A couple of years ago I worked at a place

64
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:47,130
called PieFection in Balmoral. Um he — the defendant I mean um — he used to come in all

65
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:54,510
the time. He was really chatty, got on with everyone. A couple of the girls and me used

66
00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:01,070
to have a bit of fun, cause he was kind of, I don’t know, kind of hot. We used to call

67
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,690
him by his regular order - Mr Steak’n’Pepper.

68
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:10,190
But Mr Steak’n’Pepper wasn’t always that nice, was he Nora?

69
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,520
No. No, he wasn’t.

70
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,780
Could you tell us a little about that Nora?

71
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,040
Um well one day, the boss’d gone home. I was

72
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:29,040
locking up. The girls had gone. I’d finished the final clean up, and I was out the back

73
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:36,850
by the bins. I heard this noise, and I turned around and it was him.

74
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,200
The defendant you mean?

75
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,340
Yeah, yeah. And I said something like, ‘We’re

76
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:57,800
closed. Are you still hungry?’ And he said, ‘Yeah’. And, and he smiled. And and I smiled back

77
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:04,810
‘cause I didn’t know what to do - and and with him smiling all funny like that. And then

78
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:14,180
I, I see his hand and he he had a knife. And he assaulted me.

79
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,440
Why didn’t you go to the police with this?

80
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,800
I dunno. I mean everyone liked him.

81
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:28,240
I didn’t even tell the girls what had happened, you know? They’d talk about Mr Steak’n’Pepper

82
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:37,669
and my stomach would turn. I didn’t know what to say. Not long after that I just quit.

83
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:41,289
Maybe if I’d said something...

84
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,759
You allege that this assault took place over

85
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,119
two years ago. Why did you decide to come forward now?

86
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:59,240
I saw him on TV. And I couldn’t stop thinking about what happened to that poor woman, you know?

87
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,420
And what have you been doing since you quit PieFection?

88
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,980
A bit of this, a bit of that.

89
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:12,940
Indeed. Isn’t it true that you’ve been trying to start a new career as an actress and singer?

90
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,259
I don’t have the best looks, I know that.

91
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:21,679
But looks don’t matter if you’ve got the voice. I mean just ask anyone. Look at Susan Boyle.

92
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,100
And how is your career change going for you?

93
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,000
Well, anyone will tell you - it’s a hard business to break into.

94
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:31,639
I’m guessing the publicity from this trial couldn’t hurt could it?

95
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,319
Your Honour!

96
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:36,379
You stand there and you think you’re so

97
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:42,870
much better than me because I’m not pretty or rich or thin or famous. Well let me tell

98
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:48,439
you, that doesn’t change the fact that that man hurt me and then he went and killed someone

99
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:50,319
and you are helping him!

100
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:54,239
Order! Order in the court! Ms Mancetti!

101
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,330
The jury will disregard the witness’s last statement.

102
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,300
I tried to run out into the alley, but I couldn&#39;t.

103
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:11,980
The door was locked. So, I had to go out into the main street.

104
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,540
So you were never chased down the back alley?

105
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,980
No, the closest I got to the alley was walking

106
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,060
over the overpass at the wrong time.

107
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,060
Why did you run at all?

108
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:36,950
It was the way that man, the defendant, looked at me. He made me feel like...prey. So I ran.

109
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,559
I panicked.

110
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,579
Isn’t it true that you locked that door

111
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:47,319
to stop my client from getting to the bag that you knew you’d left behind?

112
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,419
No I told you...

113
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:51,279
The bag you knew that could link you to the crime.

114
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,920
No the door was already shut.

115
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,209
Isn’t it true that your statements to police were frequently contradictory?

116
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:01,759
Objection Your Honour. She’s badgering the witness.

117
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,359
Sustained.

118
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,860
Why didn’t you tell police about the door earlier?

119
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,420
I tried. The copper, he kept interrupting

120
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:18,430
me, like you are right now. I’m not good like that. Makes it hard to think straight.

121
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:27,259
But I swear — no one ever chased me and I never hurt that woman.

122
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:38,300
Lisa’s Attack class was going on. And there’s this power track in it and I remember it had

123
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:44,470
just started. I’m a personal trainer so my mind kinda automatically starts counting

124
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:49,959
out beats to songs that I’ve used. And that song gets used a lot.

125
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:56,959
So from this you estimate how long until you were interrupted by the man with the knife?

126
00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:02,129
About two songs. The song before the power song and about three quarters of the power

127
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:06,929
song. So about seven to seven and a half minutes.

128
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:09,420
You&#39;ve said that when you went out for a

129
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:16,420
smoke the alley was clear. How long from when you saw the assailant to when you screamed?

130
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:27,139
I waited a minute before I went out into the alley. I was scared to leave, but I was also

131
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:33,600
scared that he’d come back. And then I could see the body and I was compelled to walk towards

132
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:43,060
it. I screamed when I saw who it was and...there was blood and then I ran into the gym.

133
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:47,720
I understand. So how long would you say that took?

134
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,460
I’d say about two minutes.

135
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,460
Thank you. Thank you very much.

136
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:59,569
A man ran away from this witness’s position up the alley. Two minutes later she screamed.

137
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:05,850
A crowd formed. A minute later the defendant appeared at the scene of the crime and knelt

138
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:11,769
at the victim’s side. This is clear in the mobile footage you saw earlier and is corroborated

139
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:18,769
by Detective Warne’s testimony that the defendant was there when she arrived.

140
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:21,839
Three minutes in total.

141
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,379
I know something about second chances. I know

142
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:33,209
Janine Jenker deserved one, but we will never know what that might have looked like. Who

143
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:40,209
killed that chance? Based on the evidence, based on what you have heard, Neil Fox did.

144
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:48,610
He murdered Janine Jenker in cold blood. The prosecution has shown you evidence that the

145
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:55,589
defendant, far from being the innocent he portrays himself as, had a history of violence

146
00:13:55,589 --> 00:14:01,809
against women; that he had previously used a knife in that assault; that he lied about

147
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:08,809
chasing the witness who he tried to frame as the perpetrator down that alley.

148
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:16,809
We have shown that, in fact, the door he claimed the witness escaped through was permanently

149
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:23,959
locked making exit impossible, a fact corroborated by the janitor of that building.

150
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:32,380
You have seen evidence that the defendant was at the scene of the crime arriving precisely the

151
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:38,029
time it might take someone to run down the alley, circle around the block and return

152
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:45,860
to the scene of the crime. We have shown that the crime was committed by someone matching

153
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:58,060
the height and handedness of the defendant. Your job as jurors is to do your duty, to

154
00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:05,129
find justice for Janine Jenker, a young woman looking for a fresh start but struck down

155
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:13,149
in her prime. I ask that you find Neil Fox guilty of her murder.

156
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,590
Is the Defence ready to close?

157
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,590
Yes Your Honour.

158
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,769
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. You&#39;ve had to hear about a terrible event in this

159
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:38,860
trial. Nobody in this room doubts the heartache and loss that these events on that tragic

160
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:45,860
day have caused. The Prosecution has told you that it was my client, Mr Neil Fox,

161
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:55,170
a respected and well regarded member of the community, who committed these terrible acts.

162
00:15:56,239 --> 00:16:02,339
You&#39;ve heard the prosecution ask you to look beyond my client’s good looks and community

163
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:10,579
standing. I would ask you to do something much more important, I would ask you to look

164
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:17,589
at the evidence. Think carefully about the evidence that the prosecution presented.

165
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:27,459
As you saw, the Prosecution called a number of witnesses who all said that Mr Neil Fox

166
00:16:27,499 --> 00:16:34,499
committed a most terrible crime. I ask you to think about what each of these witnesses

167
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:41,619
told you. It is up to the Prosecution to convince you that my client committed this crime. You

168
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:51,670
heard from a witness who apparently saw my client committing the crime. This is the same

169
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:58,670
witness who also confessed to the crime. A second eyewitness also testified, but she

170
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:06,589
was the one who had earlier picked the wrong person from a lineup. You also heard from

171
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:13,589
a forensic expert, but he was only able to tell you that my client was at the scene.

172
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:18,620
Of course Mr Fox does not deny being at the scene of the crime, as he was one of the first

173
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:25,620
people there trying to save Ms Jenker. No reasonable person would be convinced by

174
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:32,700
this so-called evidence, and I can tell by looking at you that you are all reasonable

175
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:39,700
members of the community. It’s time now to put an end to this bungled investigation

176
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:45,580
and prosecution, it’s time for the police to find out who really did commit this crime.

177
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:51,000
It’s time for you to find my client not guilty so that he may go home.
