So what influences jurors?

1
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,930
So I’ve already said that the biggest influence on jurors&#39; decisions is the strength of the

2
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:29,070
evidence against the defendant. Now we turn to how factors other than the evidence influence

3
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,559
jurors&#39; decisions. Obviously these are the things we want to know about so that we can

4
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:35,300
reduce their effects.

5
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,730
Let&#39;s start with the characteristics of the defendant.

6
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,550
Physically attractive defendants are more likely to be acquitted 

7
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,190
or receive a lighter sentence. This is true as long as the defendant

8
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,950
didn&#39;t use his or her attractiveness to actually carry out the crime. For example by swindling

9
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,570
someone out of money by romancing them.

10
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:57,579
The defendant&#39;s race also has an affect the jury. In the United States of America, Black

11
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:01,200
defendants are more likely to be sent to prison. In fact, racial minorities

12
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,700
are over-represented in custody around the world. For example, not only in the United

13
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,180
States of America, but also in the United Kingdom

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,500
and Australia.

15
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,960
There is reasonable evidence from meta-analyses across many studies

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,350
that there is a main effect of defendant race. This means people from negatively stereotyped

17
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,270
racial groups tend to be more likely to be convicted.

18
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:26,300
Ok, so there is evidence that defendants from some categories are seen as being more likely

19
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,800
to be guilty. There is some more research which suggests that the story is more complicated

20
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,149
than this, however.

21
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:36,690
The short story is that defendants seem to be seen as being more likely to be guilty

22
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,369
only when they come from social categories that are stereotypically linked to the features

23
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:45,160
of the particular crime they are said to have committed. A good example of this can be seen

24
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,560
in research by Gordon and colleagues in 1988.

25
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,200
In that study, they found that when the defendant’s race matched the type of crime the defendant

26
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,520
was said to have committed, the defendant was evaluated more negatively. In particular,

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,250
a White defendant was punished more than a Black defendant when the alleged crime was

28
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:06,420
embezzling money, whereas the opposite was true when the alleged crime was burglary.

29
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,069
You can find another example of exactly the same type of effect in a study by Bodenhausen

30
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:12,819
in 1990.

31
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:16,489
One of the factors that contributes to higher conviction rates in these types of cases was

32
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:22,650
identified by Jones and Kaplan in 2003. They found that when the defendant matched race-based

33
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,660
expectations for the type of crime allegedly committed, mock jurors sought less additional

34
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,770
information to help them make a decision, and instead relied on their pre-existing stereotypes.

35
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,120
We get similar effects based on socio-economic status as well.

36
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,950
So there is reasonable evidence that the reason why people from some racial or ethic groups

37
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,170
are sometimes seen as more likely to be guilty is because stereotypes about those groups

38
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,690
are linked to particular types of crime.

39
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:54,900
So we know that the defendant&#39;s attractiveness, race, and socio-economic status all influence

40
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,800
how jurors see them.

41
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,300
What about the defendant&#39;s gender?

42
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,910
In a similar vein, non experimental research has found that prosecutors are less likely

43
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,660
to file charges against female than male narcotic offenders, judges are

44
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,430
more likely to grant women pretrial release than they are to male offenders,

45
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,910
and women face lower odds of incarceration following trial compared

46
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,860
to men.

47
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,640
The relationship between defendant gender and judgements is more complicated. There

48
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,480
doesn&#39;t appear to be a simple overall main effect of defendant gender, except perhaps

49
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,370
for punishment. Sometimes men are seen as more guilty, and sometimes women are treated

50
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,210
more harshly.

51
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,710
A good example of the first type of effect can be seen in a meta-analysis across a large

52
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:40,790
number of studies by Dean and colleagues in 2000. That study showed that male defendants

53
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:45,140
were more likely to be found guilty of some particular types of crimes, particularly assault

54
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,580
and theft.

55
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:50,150
Another good example of the first type of effect can be seen in research by McCoy and

56
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,540
Gray in 2007.

57
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,700
In this paper, they found that the mock jurors, people pretending to be jurors for the purposes of the study,

58
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,670
believed the victim more when the defendant was described as being a man compared to a

59
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:06,010
woman. In other words, the defendant seemed more guilty when he was a man rather than

60
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,170
a woman.

61
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,480
The explanation that is generally given for these types of effects is that men are stereotypically

62
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,180
seen has having more of the characteristics consistent with being a criminal - in particular,

63
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,650
they are seen as more aggressive and assertive and so on.

64
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:22,680
Now, you might be wondering, isn’t it perfectly rational to think that a male defendant is

65
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,590
more likely to be guilty than a female defendant? After all, the vast majority, as in well over

66
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,919
90%, of all people charged and convicted of crimes, especially those involving violence,

67
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,460
are men.

68
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,789
So it seems that the stereotype is based on accurate facts in this particular example—i.e.,

69
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:45,479
the base rate for offending is strongly skewed towards male offenders. Why can’t we just

70
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:50,389
make a probabilistic judgement based on these base rates and convict male defendants?

71
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:55,169
Well the problem arises because defendants are not selected at random. When police investigate

72
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,639
a crime, they don&#39;t just choose any random person on the street and charge them with

73
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,060
the offence.

74
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,680
Police investigate someone based on non-random factors, for example a tip off, or a witness

75
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,960
identification, and so base rate information is actually irrelevant for deciding whether

76
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,289
the defendant is guilty or not. Thus, jurors should make their decisions based only the

77
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:15,520
evidence presented at trial.

78
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,259
Now on the other hand, there is evidence that sometimes female defendants are treated more

79
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,580
harshly compared to male defendants.

80
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,050
Wayne and colleagues in 2001 found that a woman who sexually harassed a man was viewed

81
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:31,180
more negatively than a man who sexually harassed a woman, possibly due to stereotypes about

82
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,580
traditional sex roles and sexual aggressiveness.

83
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,580
Viki and colleagues in 2005 found that a female who murdered a number of children was evaluated

84
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,200
more negatively by participants who scored higher on a measure of sexism.

85
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:47,590
There is also some evidence that women get evaluated more negatively because they seem

86
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,979
to be &#39;out of place&#39; in the criminal justice system, and so their behaviour

87
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:54,770
is seen as particularly abnormal.

88
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,229
So why might these types of effects reverse in this way?

89
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:00,870
Well, there are a few possible reasons.

90
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,779
The first has to do with how we think about men and women in comparison to gender-based

91
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:08,120
standards and the types of questions we are asking ourselves.

92
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,770
A zero-sum or absolute judgment task, like deciding whether the defendant is guilty or

93
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:17,319
not, will tend to encourage seeing the defendant in terms of the stereotype associated with

94
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:21,400
them. For example, when thinking about the guilt of a male defendant, we might think

95
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,539
he is guilty because we see him in terms of the male stereotype which is more consistent

96
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:28,370
with the attributes of a criminal.

97
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,659
When the task is a subjective one in that we are asking ourselves how much of some attribute

98
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:37,479
a defendant has, for example how aggressive the defendant&#39;s behaviour was, then we contrast

99
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:41,999
their behaviour with our expectations for their gender. In this case, we would see a

100
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:46,009
female defendant&#39;s behaviour as being more aggressive than a male defendant&#39;s behaviour,

101
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:51,139
even if they had both objectively acted in exactly the same way. This is called shifting

102
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:52,469
standards.

103
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:57,439
The final reason is related to thinking about jurors as cognitive optimisers. We talked

104
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,249
about this in the previous video. Remember we talked about how when a defendant is stereotypical,

105
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:06,939
perceivers have more cognitive capacity to think about other things, such as the strength

106
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:09,249
of the evidence against the defendant.

107
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:13,449
This means that when the case is strong, jurors will be more likely to convict the defendant,

108
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:17,979
and when the case is weak, they will be more likely to acquit. Now because female defendants

109
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:22,729
can&#39;t easily be represented by a stereotype, jurors should be relatively insensitive to

110
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:27,279
the strength of the case against the female defendant. And so, when the case is weak,

111
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,659
jurors should tend to acquit the male more compared to the female defendant. And the

112
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,069
opposite should happen when the case is strong.

113
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:39,199
Right, so we&#39;ve spent a bit of time talking about how the defendant&#39;s attributes can influence

114
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,669
how jurors evaluate them. Now while these can be pretty difficult to change, research

115
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:47,289
is starting to identify some of the ways to potentially reduce their effects.

116
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:50,800
We probably don&#39;t have the time to get into those now, as we could spend another whole

117
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,999
course talking about how to reduce the effects of stereotypes.

118
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:58,219
But we can turn our eye to something that influences jurors&#39; verdicts, and that is also

119
00:07:58,219 --> 00:08:00,379
actually pretty easy to change.

120
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:04,149
We are talking about the order in which jurors are asked to decide verdicts in cases involving

121
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:06,039
more than one verdict.

122
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:10,219
This can happen, for example, in a murder case. A jury might be asked to decide whether

123
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:13,819
the defendant is guilty of murder, and if not murder, manslaughter, and if not that,

124
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:15,759
perhaps some lesser charge.

125
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,710
Greenberg, Williams and O&#39;Brien in 1986 gave participants a condensed version of a murder

126
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:26,479
trial. The possible verdicts were first degree murder, second degree murder, voluntary manslaughter,

127
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,259
involuntary manslaughter, or not guilty.

128
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:34,010
After being given about six pages of judicial instructions by the experimenter, participants

129
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:39,100
were asked to consider the verdicts either from harshest to most lenient, as is usual

130
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:43,190
in murder trials, or from most lenient to harshest.

131
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,170
Results showed that participants gave harsher verdicts when they were asked to consider

132
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,760
&#39;the first degree murder’ as the first possible verdict option compared to when they

133
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,160
were asked to consider &#39;not guilty&#39; as the first possible verdict option.

134
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,120
Greenberg and colleagues thought that this was due to a confirmation bias, which is the

135
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,880
idea that when given a hypothesis to test, we tend to look for information that confirms,

136
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,000
rather than contradicts, that hypothesis. So when participants were given a hypothesis

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,270
by the first proposed verdict option, they focussed on the evidence in the case that

138
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:17,110
was consistent with that verdict. When given First Degree Murder as the first verdict,

139
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:21,650
participants were more influenced by evidence suggesting guilt. When given &#39;not guilty&#39;

140
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,880
as the first verdict, they were more influenced by evidence suggesting that defendant was

141
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,220
innocent.

142
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,600
So that&#39;s a number of things that influence individual&#39;s decisions. One thing we haven&#39;t

143
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,410
talked about that has received quite a deal of attention in the research is expert evidence.

144
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,710
While stereotypes and schemas are important for how we evaluate expert testimony, it is

145
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,930
worth spending a bit more time in the next video talking about this type of testimony

146
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:51,930
because there are some additional unique issues to do with experts and their testimony.
