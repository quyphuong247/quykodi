Next week on Crime101!

1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,460
Is the prosecution quite ready!

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,440
Yes, your honour. Sorry.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,720
But, the angle of the wounds on the arm suggested that she  only raised her arm

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,600
as she was being attacked.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,180
The same height as our defendant.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,780
I&#39;m guessing the publicity from this trial couldn&#39;t hurt, could it?

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,240
That man hurt me, and then he went and killed someone and you are helping him!

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,680
Order!!

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,340
The defendant looked at me. he made me feel like...

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,980
prey.

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,560
Your job as jurors is to do your duty,

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,920
to find justice for Janine Jenker.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,040
I ask that you find Neil Fox guilty of her murder.

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,840
It&#39;s time now to put an end to this bungled  investigation and prosecution.

15
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,300
It&#39;s time for the police to find out who really did commit this crime.

16
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,360
It&#39;s time for you to find my client not guilty.
