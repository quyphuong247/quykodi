Once you heard the verdict, we gave you a poll asking you to estimate the percentage

1
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,509
chance of Neil Fox being found guilty or not guilty. 

2
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,180
Some of you viewed a video in which Neil Fox was found to be

3
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:36,820
guilty and the rest viewed a video in which he was found to be not guilty.

4
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:42,280
What we typically find in this situation is that the actual outcome that people are presented

5
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,460
with increases their estimate that that outcome would have occurred.

6
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,629
Bear in mind that everyone would have seen exactly the same depiction of the trial itself

7
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:57,250
– so in principle everyone had exactly the same basis on which to make their estimates

8
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:02,970
of the outcome likelihood. People tend to overestimate what they would have known if

9
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,290
they hadn’t heard what the outcome was.

10
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:12,140
So - knowing the actual outcome shouldn’t affect these estimates - but it does! This

11
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:18,000
is known as the hindsight bias – or the “knew it all along” effect.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,840
This effect was first empirically demonstrated by a classic 1975 article by Baruch Fischhoff

13
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,140
of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in which he asked the participants to estimate

14
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:36,450
the likelihood of various outcomes to unfamiliar historical events.

15
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,500
He found that not only did knowing the actual outcome increase people’s beliefs about

16
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,950
the inevitability of that outcome, but people were largely unaware that their judgements

17
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,130
were being affected.

18
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,190
This bias has major implications for all sorts of things

19
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,100
 – including the criminal justice system.

20
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,560
To give just one example, in situations where we’re trying to judge whether someone has

21
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:10,560
acted reasonably or negligently, then the hindsight bias may mean that, when there’s

22
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:16,530
a bad outcome as there presumably will be if it’s gone to court, the actions leading

23
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,319
up to that outcome are more likely to be seen as negligent.

24
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,829
Studies have shown hindsight bias effects both judges and jurors. That is, it looks

25
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:35,529
more inevitable that those actions would result in the bad outcome and hence the 

26
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:37,329
actions can’t be justified.

27
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:42,489
One additional interesting finding is that visual reconstructions of the event – for

28
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:49,489
instance, computer animations of vehicle crashes – can increase hindsight bias. So, it could

29
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:56,579
be that hindsight bias in our crime drama might be enhanced by the very fact that we’ve

30
00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:00,370
presented it as a video reconstruction of what happened.

31
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:07,370
Are there any techniques we can use to counter the hindsight bias? Erin Harley of the University

32
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:15,819
of California, Los Angeles, reviewed research into reducing the hindsight bias. She reported

33
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:23,209
that this is one bias that has proved resistant to interventions – where, typically, jurors

34
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:29,919
still show the bias even when the bias is explained to them, for example, by the judge,

35
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,959
before they make their judgement.

36
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:37,730
However, some bias-reduction success has been obtained by getting people to think through

37
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:43,760
what’s known as “counterfactuals” – that is, all the other ways that events 

38
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,609
could have played out.

39
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:50,249
So, in principle, in our demonstration we might first ask you to imagine that Fox was

40
00:03:50,249 --> 00:03:55,719
found guilty, and consider reasons why this might occur. Then we might ask you to imagine

41
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:02,719
that Fox was found not guilty, and consider reasons why this might occur. We’d predict 

42
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:07,579
that this ought to reduce the hindsight bias.

43
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:11,980
In everyday life, you might find it generally useful to think through the “counterfactuals”

44
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:18,209
– the alternative hypotheses – whenever you need to make an important judgement. 

45
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:23,210
The evidence suggests that this is likely to lead to better decisions.
