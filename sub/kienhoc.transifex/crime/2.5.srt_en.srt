In the last presentation we talked about some of the things that affect the encoding

1
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,790
stage of memory. What about the next step: the storage stage? To what extent can we hold

2
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:34,730
on to our memories of events? Well, let’s examine some data on the sort of high impact

3
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:41,530
traumatic event that should be very hard to forget: having a car crash.

4
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:47,850
Even a minor damage only car crash ought to be hard to forget due to the expense and inconvenience

5
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,850
caused, let alone a crash in which people are hurt or killed. But it so happens that

6
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:01,380
Geoff Maycock and Julia Lester of the Transport Research Laboratory in the UK found that drivers

7
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:08,380
appear to forget about 30% of the car crashes they’ve been involved in per year. That’s

8
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,180
incredible on the face of it. How could people possibly forget something like that? We’re

9
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:18,080
not even talking about details like the colour of the car you crashed in or whose fault it

10
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,320
is. We’re talking about people forgetting that the entire event ever took place.

11
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:29,470
So, the first message about memory storage is that it seems that people are surprisingly

12
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:36,260
likely to forget things that we really wouldn’t expect them to forget. So aside from forgetting,

13
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:41,330
what else can happen to memories during the storage phase? It turns out that it is startling

14
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:48,330
easy to modify memories both deliberately and otherwise by introducing misinformation.

15
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,310
That is, stored memories can be interfered with. In the real world, this might well happen

16
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,490
just by accident. For example, listening to an inaccurate report of the crime in the media

17
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,450
or chatting with another eyewitness who has misremembered the original event.

18
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:13,769
One thing that memory researchers are very aware of is the extent to which memory is

19
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:20,769
vulnerable to tampering. In a typical experiment, people are shown a video of a crime. They

20
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:26,720
then read a written account of the crime, such as might appear in a newspaper article,

21
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,720
or they talk to someone who has also seen the crime. So half of the participants might

22
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:39,720
be fed false information via the follow up account. For example, in the original the

23
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:45,190
criminal might be clean shaven, but in the newspaper account it might be inferred that

24
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:51,410
they had a moustache. Then they are asked to recall the crime, and the people who have

25
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:58,000
been fed the false information often end up incorporating it into their report. For example

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
recalling that the criminal had a moustache when in fact he didn’t. In a study from

27
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:10,120
2013, by Harmut Blank and colleagues from the University of Portsmouth, participants

28
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:16,620
watched a two minute video clip of a crime captured on CCTV, in which four men rob a

29
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,959
jewellery store, where one of them has a gun.

30
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,870
Then participants discussed the crime with another participant who was actually a plant

31
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:33,340
who had been briefed to give misinformation. An example of the misinformation they introduced

32
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:40,340
was to identify the wrong person as holding that gun. The following week, participants

33
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,510
returned and were asked to recall details of the crime. Even when they were told that

34
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:52,560
the information from the other witness might be incorrect and that they should ignore it,

35
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,739
they often still incorporated the false information into their account of the crime.

36
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,769
Maybe it would be different if the situation was more stressful and personal? Well, in

37
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:08,810
another recent study, Charles Morgan of Yale University and colleagues, found that military

38
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:15,560
personnel who were subject to a highly stressful prisoner of war camp simulation which involved

39
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,549
them being aggressively interrogated, they identified the wrong person as being their

40
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:28,549
interrogator after being shown misinformation – in this case a photograph.

41
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:34,030
Psychologists have been investigating the details of the misinformation effect for decades.

42
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:39,240
The sort of questions they’ve been looking at include things like: under what circumstances

43
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:46,240
is misinformation most likely to affect memory? What type of person is most susceptible to

44
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:53,050
misinformation? What actually happens to the original memory when the misinformation supplants

45
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:59,310
it? As we’ve seen, even when you tell people that the misinformation is incorrect, they

46
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:04,520
often still can’t ignore it – it becomes part of their memory. That is, in a real crime

47
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:10,310
case, even telling eyewitnesses that a media report of a crime is inaccurate might not

48
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,259
help prevent their memory of the crime from being contaminated.

49
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:19,039
We could have an entire course just looking at the misinformation effect – it’s a

50
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,120
complex and fascinating topic all on its own. Here’s another excerpt from that interview

51
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,199
with Elizabeth Loftus, which was conducted by my colleague, Matt Thompson. And here’s

52
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,180
her take on false memories.

53
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:38,090
Is it possible to implant a false memory, make somebody believe something happened when

54
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,180
it never actually happened?

55
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:46,180
Absolutely. I mean, in my own work, for example, we’ve changed people’s memories for the

56
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,610
details of events that they did experience. We’ve made people, for example, believe

57
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:57,689
that a car went through a stop sign instead of a yield sign, or a guy running from the

58
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:02,340
scene had curly hair instead of straight hair. That’s really easy to do. But you can go

59
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:08,169
further with people. You can plant entirely false memories, whole memories, into the minds

60
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:10,370
of people for things that didn’t happen.

61
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,800
Wow. So surely that has implications for people testifying in court, like witnesses saying,

62
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,759
“Yes, that was the guy that committed the crime,” or, “Yes, the car went through

63
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,439
the stop sign and hit the other car.” Does your research have implications for the courtroom?

64
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:30,639
Well, it does because, you know, most of the time little errors that we make in memory

65
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:37,080
don’t matter very much. I mean, it doesn’t really matter if I tell you that I had a hamburger

66
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:44,080
for lunch instead of chicken, but when it comes to the legal world, now very precise

67
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:51,129
memory matters, and so memory evidence is precious. It needs to be preserved. It needs

68
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:58,289
to be protected. Unfortunately, a lot of times, it’s not, and people or circumstances get

69
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:06,069
in there and contaminate those memory traces and lead to travesties of justice.

70
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:13,550
So, we’ve given some examples of problems at encoding and problems during storage. Now

71
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:21,870
let’s now turn our attention to memory retrieval. As an example of what might bias this aspect,

72
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:28,599
let’s look at another case of false memory. It turns out that you don’t even need misinformation

73
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:34,729
in order to create false memories. Let’s look at some of Elizabeth Loftus’s own research

74
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:41,379
to illustrate this. She conducted an experiment with John Palmer when she was at the University

75
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:47,979
of Washington, and this experiment involved showing people films of car crashes and asked

76
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:53,400
them how fast the vehicles in the film were going.

77
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,779
Some participants were asked how fast the cars were going when they HIT each other.

78
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:05,099
Others were asked how fast the cars were going when they SMASHED into each other. One week

79
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:10,590
later, the group who had the word “smashed” in their question, not only gave faster speed

80
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:16,919
estimates, they were more likely to remember there being glass at the scene – even though

81
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:23,919
there wasn’t any. That is, even in a situation where, crucially, there is no factually incorrect

82
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:31,370
information being introduced, we are still getting a false memory. So, overall, the picture

83
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:36,620
of eyewitness memory that the research is painting does not appear promising. Memory

84
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:43,300
appears to be much more fragile and vulnerable to distortion than people expect, and these

85
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:50,300
distortions can occur at numerous points in the memory process for a wide range of reasons.

86
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:57,970
So, the issue now becomes, what can we do about this? Are there any techniques that we can

87
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:05,139
use to improve eyewitnesses’ memory? That’s the question we’ll look at next.
