Intuitively, it seems reasonable to be concerned that jurors may be influenced by media coverage

1
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,930
of the cases they are serving on. It is quite common for the media to be prohibited from

2
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,920
publishing certain details about a case, including a defendant&#39;s prior criminal history 

3
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,910
for this reason.

4
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,010
Concern about the possible influence of media exposure on jurors&#39; decisions is one of the

5
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,110
reasons that here in Queensland, judge-only trials are allowed in high profile cases that

6
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,790
have received significant adverse media coverage.

7
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:48,699
So should we really be worried about jurors&#39; exposure to media stories? Let&#39;s look at what

8
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:50,629
the research says.

9
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:57,089
We know from Mullin and Linz&#39;s 1995 research that media reports about the accused, or defendant,

10
00:00:57,089 --> 00:01:01,690
tend to be negative. In their study, Mullin and Linz used content analysis of actual media

11
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,580
reports in fourteen large newspapers in the United States of America over an eight-week

12
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:11,690
period. In those reports, twenty-seven percent of suspects were described in a negative way

13
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:16,540
that might undermine the fairness of the trial. The comments included derogatory assertions

14
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,860
about the defendant&#39;s character and statements about the defendant&#39;s guilt.

15
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,170
So does this type of negative media exposure actually influence jurors?

16
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,750
Well, research by a number of authors such as Fein and colleagues in 1997, Hope and colleagues

17
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:36,720
in 2004, and Ruva and McEvoy in 2008, is reasonably clear on this point. Media exposure that describes

18
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,580
the defendant in a negative light can cause jurors to view the defendant more harshly

19
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,900
and result in more guilty verdicts compared to jurors not exposed to such media coverage.

20
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:52,900
In fact, Steblay and colleague&#39;s 1999 meta-analysis of 23 studies, covering a total of 5,755 participants,

21
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,550
found that participants exposed to negative pre-trial publicity were more likely to find

22
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:04,310
the defendant guilty than those who were not exposed to such media stories. This was a

23
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,540
small to moderate effect.

24
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,780
There is some evidence from that meta-analysis, however, that the effect size does vary.

25
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,480
We generally see a stronger effect of media exposure on jurors&#39; decisions when studies

26
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,950
use community members as participants. The effect is also stronger in cases involving

27
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,999
murder, sex abuse, and drugs.

28
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:30,650
And we know also that exposure to actual media stories, rather than stories created for the

29
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,400
purpose of the experiment, also makes the effect stronger. As does longer intervals

30
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,060
between exposure and having to decide a verdict.

31
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,849
It&#39;s reassuring, however, that when the evidence against the defendant is weak, the effect

32
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:49,590
is reduced. This was demonstrated in research by Ker and colleagues in 1999.

33
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,579
So that&#39;s what the experimental research suggests, what about actual cases? Well Devine and colleagues&#39;

34
00:02:55,579 --> 00:03:01,370
2009 study looked at the effect of media exposure in 179 criminal trials in Indiana, in the

35
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:06,400
United States of America. They found an increased likelihood of conviction in trials for which

36
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,029
judges reported being aware of pre-trial publicity.

37
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:14,260
One of the reasons that media exposure might have had these effects is due to confusion

38
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,290
over where information about the trial is coming from.

39
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:23,359
Research by Roberts in 1987 suggests that jurors sitting on highly publicised trials

40
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:28,180
may attribute information that they have learned from the media to evidence actually presented

41
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,219
in court.

42
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:34,120
So this effect is related to the &#39;sleeper effect&#39; which was described by Hovland and

43
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,430
Weis. This is where something has a delayed impact on us because we forget that it comes

44
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,590
from a source that should perhaps not be relied upon.

45
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:47,749
A study by Hope and colleges in 2004 suggested that pre-trial publicity can also result in

46
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:51,779
jurors thinking more negatively about the evidence that supports the defendant&#39;s side

47
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:56,999
of the case. So jurors discount the evidence in favour of the defendant when thinking about

48
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:58,620
the defendant&#39;s guilt.

49
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,389
The publicity effectively distorts jurors memories of the evidence in favour of the

50
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:05,659
prosecution case (Hope, Memon, and McGeorge, 2004).

51
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:09,189
As you will hear in the next episode, such media coverage can help shape the story that

52
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:13,629
jurors create to explain the evidence they hear about the trial. However, before we turn

53
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:17,769
to that, a final question we should consider is whether we should be worried about this?

54
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,500
Is this a big problem?

55
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:25,610
Well, in reality, only a small percentage of cases actually receive pre-trial publicity.

56
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:30,230
The concern is that in those that do get reported in the media, receive a considerable amount

57
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,480
of exposure.

58
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,870
Consistent with this, there was also a study by Bruscke and Loges in 1999 that looked for

59
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:43,700
pre-trial newspaper reports in 134 different first-degree murder cases. They found that

60
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,790
46 percent of these cases received no coverage in the news media. Of those that did have

61
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,530
stories written about them, about a fifth had between one and five reports, another

62
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:58,760
fifth had between six and ten reports, and sixteen percent had eleven or more stories

63
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,950
written about them.

64
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,780
So what can be done about this?

65
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,330
It&#39;s not really possible to stop every potential juror from being exposed to media about a

66
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:12,780
particular case. Often the media will cover a story many months or years before a jury

67
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,510
trial, and so you have no way of knowing who the potential jurors will be. Also, it is

68
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,780
not really possible for a court to impose a restriction on media reporting about a case,

69
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,870
until there is a defendant who has been identified.

70
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:30,220
One of the remedies for media exposure, apart from a judge only trial, is to give jurors

71
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,940
directions to disregard any media stories about the case they may have seen or heard.

72
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,000
Now this is a pretty easy remedy to use, but unfortunately it is not very effective at

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,280
reducing this bias as research by Devine and colleges in 2001 suggested. Now it&#39;s very

74
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,940
hard for people to un-see and un-hear things they have been exposed to in the media and

75
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,730
these things continue to influence them.

76
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:57,950
One thing that Devine suggested in 2012 as seeming to work is changing the venue of the

77
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:03,150
trial, which has the effect of changing the potential jurors for a group of people who

78
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,490
are less likely to have heard about the case.

79
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,740
Of course, in addition to the influence of the media on jurors, we’ve already discussed

80
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,340
how the memory of eyewitnesses who might give evidence in the trial could be influenced

81
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,360
by misleading or biased information.

82
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,970
If a media report contains inaccuracies, then it is possible that these inaccuracies could

83
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:27,910
affect what an eyewitness remembers about a crime – potentially leading to false memories.

84
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:33,060
Even if the media report contains no factual inaccuracies, it’s possible that the contents

85
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,180
of the media report could affect eyewitness memory – as in the example where the use

86
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,760
of the word “smash” to describe a car crash led people to think there was glass

87
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,780
at the scene when there was not.
