So where do we begin? How are we going to find the person who committed this crime?

1
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,100
Obviously, we could look at the results of any forensic tests, we could talk to eyewitnesses

2
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:31,020
and so on. But, forensic tests take time, and don&#39;t always provide a conclusive result.

3
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,320
They might only provide part of the information you need, and eyewitness accounts are not

4
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,489
always available.

5
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:41,830
Now, obviously in our case, we have some eyewitnesses, and we will return to consider eyewitness

6
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:47,110
evidence shortly in a future episode. But let&#39;s start by trying to identify the suspect

7
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,660
from what we know about the crime itself. This is called offender profiling, and one

8
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,739
famous example of profiling, is in the case of the Washington Snipers. Between the 2nd

9
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:03,270
and 22nd of October in 2002, 10 people were murdered and a further 3 wounded in Maryland,

10
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,700
Virginia and Washington, DC in the United States of America. All victims were shot at

11
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,140
a distance, with a single rifle shot, and every time the killers disappeared in amongst

12
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,430
the confusion that resulted.

13
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:21,280
The shootings appeared random. They took place in grocery store car parks, at petrol stations,

14
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,670
while victims were mowing their lawns or sitting reading a book. There was nothing to link

15
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:31,060
the victims. These shootings appeared for all intents and purposes to be random. Now

16
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:36,210
understandably these shootings caused fear and panic in the community. The pressure was

17
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:42,530
on to apprehend the culprit, but for investigators there wasn&#39;t really that much to go on.

18
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:48,100
Eyewitness accounts were few and often contained conflicting information. The media was incredibly

19
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:53,170
interested in this case and many were called on to give their opinion as to who it was

20
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:58,200
that was committing these crimes. Those who commented ranged from forensic psychologists,

21
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:05,200
to criminologists, to homicide detectives to self-taught and FBI trained criminal profilers.

22
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:10,600
These publicly available profiles, while far less detailed than would be developed in use

23
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,980
for a typical case, give us a unique opportunity to look at what the profilers said the culprit

24
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:22,480
or culprits would be like. And we can compare these descriptions with the known characteristics

25
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,859
of those who were subsequently caught and convicted of these crimes. So, if we limit

26
00:02:27,859 --> 00:02:33,410
ourselves to just those profiles provided by self-professed profilers or FBI trained

27
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:40,049
profilers we can see that there are some inconsistencies in their comments. So on the topic of who

28
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:47,049
is the sniper, Pat Brown, who is a self-taught profiler and author, stated on CNN on October

29
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:54,329
11, 2002, so at this stage 9 days and 9 shootings into this spate of criminal activity:

30
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,740
&quot;This guy is a psychopath...He&#39;s involved in power control, and he might like Rambo movies, Arnold Schwarzenegger, 

31
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,800
anything that gives him the feeling of power that he controls the universe.&quot;

32
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:13,019
Five days later on October 16, 2002, Candice DeLong, a retired FBI agent and field profiler,

33
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,280
was quoted in the New York Times as stating the following:

34
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,989
&quot;I see him into all this stealth ninja stuff, walking around with a swagger, used to bossing people around, maybe a fireman or a construction worker.&quot;

35
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:30,459
So here we are starting to get a picture of what the perpetrator is like. And note that

36
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:35,340
both suggested that it is a single person committing these crimes. We are also starting

37
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,829
to get a hint of their possible occupation. Gregg McCrary, a former profiler and instructor

38
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:46,120
at the FBI Academy&#39;s profiling unit, is quoted in the Washington Post on October 23rd,

39
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,590
the day after what turned out to be the final shooting, as drawing on the demographic make

40
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,690
up of the Washington region to suggest the following:

41
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:00,770
&quot;When you break down the demographics of the Washington region, there&#39;s a statistical probability that the sniper is a white man.&quot;

42
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,940
Now in terms of the geographical location of the perpetrator&#39;s home, Robert Ressler,

43
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:11,910
a former FBI profiler, commented on CNN on October 18, 2002 that:

44
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:25,700
&quot;It is clear that this individual, and in my opinion, these individuals, were going to stay in the major metropolitan Washington  area, which tells me that they&#39;re residents. These people are long-term residents.&quot;

45
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,960
Now note in this profile, Ressler makes it clear that he thinks that there is more than

46
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,389
one person involved in committing these crimes. And this is different to the assumptions

47
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:40,400
made by Brown, DeLong and McCrary in their profiles. Brown publicly disagreed with Ressler

48
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:44,349
and said on CBS on October 22, 2002:

49
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:51,280
&quot;I have surmised from the beginning that he probably lives in the - somewhere about three miles from the Olney, Maryland area.&quot;

50
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,980
So from these few excerpts of the many profiles offered by trained and self-taught profilers

51
00:04:56,569 --> 00:05:01,550
we can see there are inconsistencies. The same information has not led to an agreed

52
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,970
on perspective of the probable characteristics of the offender. For example, in this case,

53
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,789
the profilers cannot agree if it is a single individual or multiple people or indeed where

54
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:16,139
that person or people are likely to live. And in fact, when you consider those caught

55
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:21,569
and convicted of these crimes - that is, John Muhammad, a 41 year old Gulf War veteran and

56
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:26,129
17 year old John Lee Malvo, an immigrant from Jamaica, you can see that there are some other

57
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:31,550
issues in the profiles. For example, the assumption made on the ethnic make up of the Washington

58
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:36,939
region was that the perpetrator would be white. They were also not firemen or construction

59
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:42,360
workers, and no comment was ever made in regard to their love or otherwise of Rambo movies.

60
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,469
So why the mismatch?

61
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:50,680
Well perhaps we have biased our sample by only showing you those profiles that got

62
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,439
it wrong. It&#39;s a possibility, but there is nothing to suggest in the many articles

63
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:58,539
and books that have been written on this subject, that an accurate profile helped apprehend

64
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:02,969
the suspects. Rather, it seems in this case that a phone call from someone claiming to

65
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:07,180
be the shooter that linked these crimes to an earlier shooting, where a fingerprint had

66
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:13,060
been found and kept on file, was actually critical in solving this case.

67
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,780
Maybe the profiles offered differed because of the point at which they were made, that

68
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,460
is they were all made at different points in the sequence of the shootings, and possibly

69
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,819
more information about the characteristics of the shooter or shooters emerged as time

70
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:28,580
went on. And this is certainly true.

71
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,830
But there was a startling consistency in the way these crimes were committed, the modus

72
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:37,639
operandi if you like, that didn&#39;t seem to evolve over the course of the crime sequence.

73
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:44,080
It is also fair to say that at this point in time these were unusual crimes and so profilers,

74
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,610
like the police, really didn&#39;t have that much to go on. It is hard to comment on what

75
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,319
a perpetrator who commits this sort of crime is going to be like when you don&#39;t have

76
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:58,599
instances or examples where this sort of crime, or this type of sequence, has been seen before.

77
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:05,599
So now lets consider how profiling, in perhaps more typical crimes, might assist in investigations.
