So, eyewitness reports are incomplete, unreliable, partially constructed, and can be manipulated.

1
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:31,890
Can we improve them? Let’s start with something controversial: forensic hypnosis.

2
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,180
Hypnosis is a process in which people are guided to place themselves in an altered state

3
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:43,390
of consciousness. It’s argued that, in this altered state, individuals have heightened

4
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:48,970
focus and concentration, allowing then to potentially concentrate better on a specific

5
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:55,970
thought or memory. In this state, people also appear to be particularly open to suggestion.

6
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:00,810
The FBI, New York police, Texan police, and the Israeli police amongst others have all

7
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:07,079
used hypnosis to improve eyewitness recall. Forensic hypnosis has been reported to be

8
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:14,079
useful, especially when the witness experiences trauma from the crime they observed. To illustrate

9
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:20,270
this, let’s look at a couple of crimes where forensic hypnosis was key in catching the

10
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:26,090
suspect, as reported in an article by Marilyn Smith of the University of Toronto.

11
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:32,679
The first example is known as the Chowchilla kidnapping case. In July of 1976, twenty-six

12
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:38,130
Californian school children and their bus driver were abducted at gunpoint, herded into

13
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:44,439
vans, and driven to a quarry where they were put into a cave and the entrance sealed. Eventually,

14
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:48,689
they managed to dig their way out and escape. However, when the bus driver was questioned

15
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:54,899
by police, his recall of the events was sketchy. He had seen and tried to memorize two of the

16
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,350
van license plate numbers but had been too frightened to concentrate under the constant

17
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,130
surveillance of the kidnappers.

18
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:09,319
Under hypnosis, it was suggested to the driver that he imagine himself sitting in his favourite

19
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:15,590
chair watching the events unfold as if he was watching a documentary on TV. In this

20
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:20,440
state, he called out two license plate numbers. and one of these numbers, with the exception

21
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:27,440
of a single digit, turned out to be the licence plate of one of the vans driven by the kidnappers.

22
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,900
This led to their arrest after one of the biggest manhunts in Californian history. That

23
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:40,090
is, the use of forensic hypnosis was credited with capturing the criminals when all other

24
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,860
leads had failed.

25
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,500
In a second example, two girls, aged seven and fifteen, were kidnapped by a man from

26
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,570
the San Francisco area. He told them that the doors of his car were wired with explosives,

27
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:59,370
which he would trigger if stopped by the police. He drove them all the way to Mexico and raped

28
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:05,670
the older girl in a hotel near the border. He released them a few days later, telling

29
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:11,740
them that if they disclosed any details of events, their parents would be killed. Under

30
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:17,000
normal questioning by police, neither girl could remember much of use. The older girl

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,320
did identify the motel room and the false name the man had given at reception - but

32
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,690
these clues didn’t turn out to be useful. Then the police tried hypnosis on the older

33
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:34,900
girl. Under hypnosis, she was able to recall unique rust spots on the car as well as details

34
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:40,940
about things inside the car and parts of the car. For example, she remembered that the

35
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:46,790
gear lever was held in place by tissue paper and the passenger window made a noise when

36
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,100
it was rolled up the last few inches.

37
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:54,820
She was also able to remember a transaction at a San Diego petrol station on a hilltop

38
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:01,760
where the man had the car repaired. She remembered conversations between the man and the mechanic,

39
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,760
and that he had paid for the repairs using a credit card. The FBI agents managed to locate

40
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:15,760
the garage and the mechanic and they managed to identify the exact credit card transaction.

41
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,250
This gave them the man’s name and address and this led to his arrest at his house in

42
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,840
Northern California.

43
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:28,840
So, again, the use of forensic hypnosis proved absolutely crucial in capturing the suspect

44
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:36,040
in a case where all other leads had come to nothing. So, it’s not hard to see why, on

45
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,570
the basis of anecdotal evidence like this, some police forces have been enthusiastic

46
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,970
in the use of hypnosis. In the US, some detectives are even trained

47
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:52,760
to carry out the hypnosis themselves. This all sounds great, but unfortunately this is

48
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:59,190
one example of a situation in which anecdotal evidence and scientific research don’t tell

49
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:05,630
us the same story. With a few exceptions, most laboratory studies of hypnosis have not

50
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:11,600
been successful in demonstrating the effectiveness of hypnosis in improving memory recall. Some

51
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,630
have argued that this is because the laboratory conditions used in most scientific studies

52
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:22,440
were not realistic enough. For example, they’re weren’t realistically stressful. But even

53
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,410
studies that have used very realistic situations, for example where participants believed the

54
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:34,070
crime they saw was genuine, these studies found no advantage of hypnosis.

55
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:39,850
But if this is the case, why do we get all of the compelling anecdotal reports that forensic

56
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:46,850
hypnosis works? Marylin Smith raised one possibility, which is that while under hypnosis people’s

57
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:55,160
suggestibility is increased. This means people’s threshold for what they consider to a genuine

58
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:02,160
memory changes. This may indeed increase the number of correct memories recalled, but it

59
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:08,770
will also increase the number of false memories recalled. We can represent this using a contingency

60
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:15,199
table that shows the four possible outcomes in a situation when an eyewitness attempts

61
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,360
to recall some detail about the crime.

62
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:25,360
So, the eyewitness can correctly remember a detail about the crime – a correct hit.

63
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:32,760
They can also correctly reject that detail about the crime as being incorrect – so

64
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,500
that is they are sufficiently unsure about the detail to decide that it probably isn’t

65
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:43,980
correct. Both of these are good outcomes. However, things can go wrong in two ways.

66
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:50,930
First, we can have a false rejection and this is where the detail is correct but the eyewitness

67
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:56,919
rejects it as being a real memory. Then, we have false positives which is where the eyewitness

68
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:03,919
incorrectly recalls the detail as being correct when in fact it’s incorrect.

69
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:10,199
So changing the threshold for what people consider to be a correct memory shifts things

70
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:17,199
upwards from the bottom row, where the detail is rejected as being untrue, to the top row

71
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:24,050
where the detail is accepted as being true. So the argument is that hypnosis is shifting

72
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:30,479
things up regardless of whether they are true or not. So this is great if the detail happens

73
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:36,960
to be correct, but a problem if the detail happens not to be correct.

74
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,960
That is, overall accuracy may not be improved, even though it might appear to be if we ignore

75
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:51,540
the cases when forensic hypnosis has resulted in people reporting false memories. This is

76
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:57,169
essentially what we are doing when we refer to the anecdotal evidence of it working, where

77
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:03,110
the incidents are far more likely to become anecdotes if the hypnosis results in a positive

78
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:09,500
outcome than if it results in a false positive – which frankly don’t make such good stories.

79
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,660
Research by Elizabeth Loftus’s team found that you can get a similar effect to hypnosis

80
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:21,410
by just asking people to guess when they are uncertain about a memory judgment. That is,

81
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:26,090
you are effectively asking them to lower their threshold of certainty for what they report

82
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:30,830
as being a correct memory. If they’re doubtful about a memory then they should err on the

83
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:37,830
side of assuming it’s true. What they found was that people who were asked to guess were

84
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:44,099
more confident of the truth of their false guesses in a later test of their memory – even

85
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:50,050
when they were initially unsure. That is, the act of guessing had the effect

86
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:54,250
of cementing that false memory as being true.

87
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:59,680
However, this doesn’t mean we want to write off hypnosis, just that we need to be careful

88
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:06,260
in how it’s used. That is, it may be a good idea as a way of generating leads in investigations

89
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:13,260
when no other leads are forthcoming, which is exactly what we saw in those two anecdotes.

90
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,700
That is, we want to know about anything the eyewitness can tell us – even if they’re

91
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:23,690
uncertain about it – and we acknowledge that there’s a high chance of it being inaccurate

92
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:29,580
information. However – in terms of being evidence in its own right, we need to be suspicious

93
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:35,790
of memories generated under hypnosis, as there’s a good chance that information generated this

94
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,620
way won’t be true.

95
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:45,550
So, it’s still not quite what we want in terms of improving eyewitness memory. However,

96
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:51,410
another way of looking at this is to see if there’s any element of forensic hypnosis

97
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:58,410
that we can leverage to improve memory without risking lots of false information? That is,

98
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:05,649
does hypnosis give us clues that we can extract and use to create more effective memory enhancement

99
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:06,399
interventions?

100
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:13,399
For a start, is it really the case that all there is to the alleged improved memory generated

101
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,600
by forensic hypnosis is that all just down to threshold changes for memory acceptance,

102
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,520
or might there be more to it? Well, one other suggestion for how hypnosis might potentially

103
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:33,170
be aiding memory in some cases is that it is reinstating the context of the crime. In

104
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:39,450
a great experiment by Carol Krafka and Steven Penrod of the University of Wisconsin-Madison

105
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:46,450
examined whether context reinstatement without hypnosis improved eyewitness memory. An experimenter

106
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:54,060
posing as a customer turned up at a convenience store. He bought a can of drink using a ten

107
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,890
dollar travellers’ cheque, producing two forms of ID. He then had a brief chat with

108
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:05,709
the shop assistant then left. The first researcher gave a description of the shop assistant to

109
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:08,959
a second researcher.

110
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:15,140
Either two or twenty-four hours later, the second experimenter went and found the shop

111
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:19,220
assistant. He told him he was a law intern and said

112
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,500
“I am trying to identify a man who may have been in your store in the last twenty-four

113
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:29,790
hours. If so, he probably bought something small and paid for it with a ten dollar travellers’

114
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:35,600
cheque”. The researcher then produced six photos and said that the man might be one

115
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:42,600
of them. Half the time, he was not one of the six photos. Half the time he was.

116
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:49,450
They repeated this procedure for 98 shop assistants, and ended up with 85 people they were able

117
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:56,450
to use in the study. Half the time, the second experimenter tried to get participants to

118
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:02,779
reinstate the context. He asked the shop assistants to try and remember what had happened during

119
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:09,410
the transaction. He also produced one of the non-photo forms of ID used. What they found

120
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:13,740
was that the act of reinstating the context of the shop assistant’s interaction with

121
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:20,700
the customer dramatically improved the identification accuracy of the customer without increasing

122
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:27,700
the number of false identifications too much. So, finally we’ve got something – an intervention

123
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,690
– that we could potentially leverage to improve eyewitness memory.

124
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:39,050
Of course, what’s needed now is to find a way of turning this and other findings from

125
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:46,050
psychological research into practical techniques that can be used during police investigations.

126
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:51,350
And that’s what I’ll be talking about in the next presentation.
