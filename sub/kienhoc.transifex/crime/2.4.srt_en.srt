One way of looking at memory is to divide it up into three stages: 

1
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,090
encoding, storage, and retrieval.

2
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,900
Encoding is about whether the eyewitness actually acquired any memory of

3
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,830
the incident in the first place. Storage is about whether they can keep that memory intact

4
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:40,589
over time. And retrieval is about whether they can report that memory at a future date.

5
00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:45,400
If someone can&#39;t remember something, it could be that they never had that information

6
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,770
in the first place - that is, the information never even became a memory, that&#39;s a

7
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:57,489
failure of encoding. It could be that the information did make it into memory, but they&#39;ve

8
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:03,109
since forgotten that memory, it&#39;s no longer there to be retrieved, so that&#39;s a failure

9
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:10,589
of storage. Or a memory could still be present in their brains but they can&#39;t access it,

10
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,340
they can&#39;t retrieve it, so that&#39;s a failure of retrieval.

11
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,920
As we&#39;ve discussed, memory is a creative, constructive process. It&#39;s not like filming

12
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,340
what happened and replaying the film footage at a later date. We&#39;ve already seen narrative

13
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,259
conventions and time-slice errors and how they can affect memory accuracy. However,

14
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:38,090
there are many other types of errors that can occur at every stage of the memory process.

15
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:43,649
Let&#39;s start at the encoding stage. Well the first thing to understand is that what

16
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,569
we experience, what we think we perceive about the real world around us, is largely fake

17
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:55,569
to begin with. Presuming that there is an objective reality out there, what we perceive

18
00:01:55,789 --> 00:02:01,840
is actually only a subjective reconstruction of that reality created by our brains. Let&#39;s

19
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,500
have a look at a demonstration. I&#39;m going to show you two pictures from the crime scene

20
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,820
that will be shown in an alternating sequence.

21
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:22,060
Can you spot the differences between the two pictures?

22
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,510
If you&#39;re one of the people who didn&#39;t spot the difference, here are the two images

23
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:35,510
again, but this time with the grey screen that was inserted between the images, removed.

24
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:46,430
Most people wouldn&#39;t immediately have spotted that very large and obvious change where we&#39;d

25
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:52,999
removed an entire car from the picture. So, your impression of viewing those images was

26
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:58,340
that you were looking at the whole of the picture in all its detail. It doesn&#39;t feel

27
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:04,349
like you&#39;re only seeing a part of the picture. In reality, however, that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s

28
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:09,609
happening. Your brain was focussing in on particular narrow elements of the picture,

29
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:14,180
and essentially guessing what was in the bits you weren&#39;t attending to and filling them

30
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:20,749
in for you to give the impression of a complete picture. Hence many people fail to notice

31
00:03:20,749 --> 00:03:27,420
immediately when we remove, for example, an entire car from the image.

32
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,849
What this sort of effect tells us is that our experience of the world shouldn&#39;t always

33
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:39,849
be trusted. What we see around us is no more than an elaborate reconstruction that our

34
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:45,620
brain makes, interpreting information from our senses. What we&#39;re seeing is not the

35
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:52,319
objective reality of what is out there. There&#39;s a correspondence between what we experience

36
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,609
and the objective reality, but it&#39;s far from perfect.

37
00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:01,599
Our brain constructs an impression of the outside world that is generally convincing,

38
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,680
but it does sometimes fall down. And this is what is happening when we view visual illusions.

39
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,139
In fact, two people can experience the same event quite differently. Have a look at this

40
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:21,139
classic image by Fischer in 1968. Some of you will see an old woman, but some of you

41
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:30,300
will see a young woman. And others will see the old man.

42
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,160
So - not everyone interpreted that image in the same way. Different people saw different things. 

43
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,000
Your experience of the world around you is coloured by expectation and open to

44
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:48,120
influence. So, if you witness a crime it&#39;s entirely possible that you might misperceive

45
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:55,000
some elements of the events in the first place, even before you have to remember them. The

46
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,940
circumstances of the crime, like whether the offender has a weapon, can also influence

47
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,670
how the witness remembers the crime.

48
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:10,540
The weapon focus effect suggests that when a weapon is involved, the witness&#39;s memory

49
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,130
of the criminal&#39;s physical appearance is impaired because the witness&#39;s attention

50
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:21,630
is drawn to the weapon and away from the criminal&#39;s face. This is something that has been demonstrated

51
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:27,750
in laboratory studies, where researchers have been trying to find out why this happens.

52
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:33,590
One explanation for this effect is that witnesses are so scared by the weapon that they fixate

53
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:40,160
on the source of the threat to the exclusion of more peripheral cues. Another explanation

54
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,120
is that the weapon is an unusual or surprising item and so it draws the witness&#39;s attention

55
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:52,600
away from other things in the scene. Jonathan Fawcett, of Dalhousie University, and his

56
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:59,600
colleagues, they  did a study combining all previous research in what&#39;s called a meta-analysis,

57
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:06,870
which suggested that there&#39;s some empirical support for both of these explanations.

58
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:14,080
The weapon focus effect can be harder to reproduce in real world settings, leading to some people

59
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:21,080
to suggest that it&#39;s only something that happens under simulated conditions. However,

60
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:26,180
recent research indicates that the problem with the real world work is that it is compromised

61
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:33,000
by other issues. For example, a suspect with a weapon is more likely to be bolder in terms

62
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,670
of getting closer to a witness or staying at the scene longer, where the negative effect

63
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:45,440
of the weapon on the eyewitness&#39;s memory of the suspect&#39;s face is cancelled out by

64
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,210
the fact they had a better opportunity to see the suspect. When Jonathan Fawcett examined

65
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:57,690
this in their meta-analysis, they did find a weapon focus effect that was unaffected

66
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:02,940
by whether the event was simulated or real.

67
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:08,100
So what does the weapon focus effect mean for eyewitness testimony? Well, we need to be

68
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:14,850
aware of the potential for a witness&#39;s memory accuracy to be worse in situations where a

69
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:20,220
weapon is present, though the size of this effect depends on a number of interacting

70
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:26,160
factors that need to be taken into account, such as length of time that passes before

71
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:33,160
the memory is retrieved, the duration of the original event, and the level of threat. Another

72
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:39,730
implication is that it may be possible to train people likely to be exposed to situations

73
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:45,640
involving weapons, such as police officers, to avoid this bias.

74
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:52,640
So, that&#39;s one example of a bias that affects the encoding stage of eyewitness memory.

75
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:59,920
However, every step of the memory process is vulnerable to distortion. In the next presentation

76
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:06,090
we&#39;ll talk about some factors that can affect the storage and retrieval stages.
