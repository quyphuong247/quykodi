1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,580
Then there’s the knife. Where did you get it?

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,039
If I tell you will you let me go?

3
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:17,459
I’m tired of the softly, softly. Now you may have been hot stuff once, Kate but you

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,080
slipped with this one.

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,440
Are you okay? You look a bit flushed.

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,500
Oh, I’m totally fine.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,500
I guess it would be the first one.

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,480
Is that right?

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,880
Usually I turn that off.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,720
Well, you were a bit flustered when you came in here. 

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,580
He was filming. It’s not long, I’ve emailed it to you.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,140
Police! Move! Move!

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,020
(Program introductory music plays)

14
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,040
Controversy continues as the trial of popular

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:01,260
real estate agent Neil Fox is about to commence. Fox, widely regarded as a pillar of his community,

16
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:07,170
has been charged with the cold-blooded murder of gym instructor Janine Jenker. After a series

17
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,860
of police blunders the media has been prohibited from reporting on an extensive list of key

18
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,560
information about the case. Radio stations have been flooded with calls expressing anger

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,060
at the police and pledging support for Mr Fox. We cross now to our reporter on the scene

20
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,020
where it all began.

21
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,100
It seems like only yesterday I stood here

22
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:33,130
reporting on the violent stabbing death of Janine Jenker. Recalling

23
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,700
of course the infamous false confession, it remains to be seen whether the prosecution

24
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,450
can indeed convince the jury beyond reasonable doubt. Jury selection takes place tomorrow,

25
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:48,700
and it may be the most important part of the trial given the defendant’s public profile.

26
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,180
Hi Richard, thanks so much for seeing us. I appreciate this is out of the norm.

27
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,780
Correct me if I’m wrong, but you’ve got no weapon and no motive. The media are all over

28
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,980
this so we have a serious jury contamination issue plus a lot of people like this guy.

29
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,540
Why am I even here?

30
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,780
Richard, meet Detective Ray Barrett.

31
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,960
 Ray, QC Richard Gambaro.

32
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,189
Is he the one?

33
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:12,309
The one what?

34
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:14,669
This is not the first false confession in history.

35
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,160
But it is the most recent as far as the public are concerned.

36
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,820
Is everything alright, Richard?

37
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,560
Oh c’mon Kate, I haven’t had a drink in over four and a half years. This is water.

38
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,320
Smell it!

39
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,020
You’re an original Richard.

40
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,359
It’s pewter right? Even better than the drink bottles all the hipsters are using.

41
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:37,150
So you’re not just a pretty face? Look, you know the rules - a prosecution should

42
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:42,049
not proceed if there’s no reasonable prospect of conviction before a reasonable jury. 

43
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:45,950
You don’t have enough to make this stick, and I think you know that.

44
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,159
Don’t the rules also ask whether the public interest requires a prosecution?

45
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,100
What have you got for me?

46
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,140
A woman has come forward. She saw Neil Fox

47
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:04,280
on the media as he was leaving the police station. He attacked her two years ago. She never reported it.

48
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,629
She never peeped a word about this til now?

49
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:09,760
She didn’t tell anyone because she didn’t think anyone would believe her.

50
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:18,239
I’m nearly retired Kate and I leave an undistinguished career. I had some reasonable

51
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:24,340
years before - well, you know... My last case - does it have to be a murder trial?

52
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,279
Richard, this guy is a psychopath who deliberately

53
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:36,279
killed a woman, returned to watch the aftermath, and then implicated someone else in the murder.

54
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,920
Seriously.. I mean, he is why we have a legal system. If this doesn’t go to trial it says

55
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:50,370
to him that he’s smarter than everyone - me, Ray, you. A guy like this - next time he won’t get caught.

56
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,159
We’re going to need a good jury. He fooled

57
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:04,029
you Kate, and you are no fool. The evidence will need to be there, because if it’s a

58
00:04:04,029 --> 00:04:06,929
personality competition this guy might walk.

59
00:04:06,929 --> 00:04:09,269
Yeah, but c’mon he’s a real estate agent.

60
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:10,810
(Dramatic music plays)

61
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:17,130
Neil Fox, you stand charged that on or about the 20th day of March 2012 in the state of

62
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:23,780
Queensland you murdered Janine Jenker. How do you plead, guilty or not guilty?

63
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,600
Not guilty, Your Honour.

64
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,200
(Gasps from the courtroom audience)

65
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,140
(Music continues to play)

66
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,720
Juror 15.

67
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,040
Juror 32.

68
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,080
Juror 5.

69
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,440
Challenge.

70
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,160
(Music intensifies)

71
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,280
Juror 37.

72
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,080
Challenge.

73
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,200
Did DPP forget to pay him or what? That’s Ms Slick’s third one.

74
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,820
When’s Richard going to challenge anyone?

75
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,120
Shh. Not everyone likes to challenge. Thinks it makes the jury suspicious that you’re

76
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,730
stacking the deck.

77
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,610
Isn’t that what you’re supposed to do?

78
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,480
Juror 17.

79
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,540
(Music intensifies)

80
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,820
Juror 6.

81
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,610
Juror 20.

82
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,610
(Music stops)

83
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:58,740
Before proceeding, I must ask each of you whether you have already formed or expressed

84
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,220
an opinion about the innocence or guilt of

85
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:10,080
the defendant, Mr Neil Fox. I must also ask you whether you have had any professional

86
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:17,280
or personal dealings with Mr Fox. If the answer to either of these questions is ‘yes’,

87
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,330
please let me know before we commence.

88
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,410
Ah, excuse me, your Honour, I was once at a charity

89
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,170
event attended by Mr Fox.

90
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:30,120
Thank you for letting me know. Can I ask whether

91
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,740
you had any interactions with Mr Fox at this event?

92
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:39,200
Ah, no Your Honour, I was at the sausage sizzle getting a second serve because they were free.

93
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:46,200
I didn’t actually see him there. I only heard that he was there. Do I still get to go home?

94
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,460
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. The defendant,

95
00:06:53,460 --> 00:07:01,420
Mr Neil Fox, has been charged with the crime of murder. The prosecution alleges that the

96
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:09,980
defendant killed Ms Janine Jenker, and in doing so intended to cause her death or at

97
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:20,650
least serious harm. Your job as jurors is to decide whether the defendant, Mr Neil Fox,

98
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:31,200
is guilty or not guilty of the charge of murder. It is important that I tell you that a defendant

99
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:38,140
in a criminal trial is presumed to be innocent, and the burden of proving his guilt is on

100
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:48,840
the prosecution. The defence does not need to prove that the defendant is innocent. So,

101
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:55,240
before you may return a verdict of guilty, the prosecution must satisfy you that the

102
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:03,700
defendant is guilty of the charge in question, and must satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt.

103
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:09,710
You may have some doubts about the defendant’s guilt, but if they do not seem to be reasonable

104
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:14,620
doubts, then you can still convict him of murder.

105
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:21,620
I must also instruct you to pay careful attention to the evidence, and only the evidence that

106
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:29,550
is presented in court. Anything else that you may hear or read is not evidence. You

107
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:38,360
must ignore anything that you hear or read about the case outside of this courtroom.

108
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:45,760
Ahh hey, this might sound kinda stupid, but what about like Facebook or that kind of thing?

109
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:53,920
That’s a good question young man. You may discuss the case amongst yourselves. But you

110
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:00,670
must not discuss it with anyone else. You must also refrain from making any investigations

111
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:07,670
of the defendant or the facts of the case on your own. It is inherently unjust for you

112
00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:15,540
to act on information which is not evidence and which the prosecution and the defence do not know

113
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:21,360
you are acting on. If any of you experience a problem related

114
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:28,360
to the trial, arrange to let me know via the bailiff.

115
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:33,029
Finally, keep an open mind as the case progresses.

116
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,660
That shouldn’t be too hard for &#39;em, their minds look pretty vacant already!
