In this video, we are going to talk about expert evidence or testimony and some of the

1
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,730
issues around that. While we will talk about some of the difficulties that jurors have

2
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,800
with expert testimony, we will also talk about some circumstances where you might expect

3
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,000
that jurors will struggle, but in fact they cope just fine.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,210
Experts are called to give evidence on issues that are outside the scope of the average

5
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,650
person&#39;s knowledge - basically for topics beyond common sense, and where the truth of

6
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,760
the matter may be counter-intuitive. Experts

7
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,470
might provide evidence about the likelihood that a DNA sample would match a person by

8
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:54,110
chance, the degree of match between two fingerprints or perhaps footprints, or even the match between

9
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:59,100
two bullets. Experts might also provide evidence about financial matters, or even a defendant&#39;s

10
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,140
state of mind.

11
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,489
As noted by Gemberling and Cramer in 2014, amongst others, experts can also play a more

12
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,690
educational role -- explaining the factors that might affect the reliability of an eyewitness&#39;s

13
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:15,390
testimony, explaining when child witnesses can be relied upon, or providing context for

14
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,780
the behaviour of woman who kills her spouse after years of abuse. These are just some

15
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,670
examples.

16
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,780
In some cases, experts provide their testimony as friends of the court, while in others,

17
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,090
they testify in an adversarial setting where there might be one or more experts for each

18
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,049
side of the case.

19
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,880
While some critics argue that jurors don&#39;t have the ability to understand such scientific

20
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,090
and technical evidence, Bornstein and Greene in 2011, point out that interviews with jurors

21
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,810
suggest that jurors actually do have the capacity to think about such evidence carefully, and

22
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,320
that the jurors&#39; deliberations reflect that diligence. Research shows that jurors also

23
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,299
report that they thoroughly review the evidence when reaching a verdict.

24
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,110
While Vidmar and Diamond in 2001 point out such research suggests that jurors are using

25
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,950
systematic processing, it&#39;s worth noting that this research primarily relied on self-reports

26
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,930
of jurors&#39; experiences. There are some issues around self-report data and this is the type

27
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,920
of data that comes from participants&#39; own reflections on their behaviours and beliefs.

28
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,200
We will talk more about these issues in the video on jury directions. Suffice to say,

29
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,180
research that doesn&#39;t rely on self-report data indicates that there are some conditions

30
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,590
where jurors don&#39;t just rely on the content of the expert evidence.

31
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,200
So what are some of the challenges with expert testimony? When are jurors influenced by factors

32
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,599
other than just the content of the expert&#39;s testimony?

33
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:37,970
When talking about expert testimony, jurors are often required to evaluate highly complex,

34
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,110
technical and scientific material as we’ve said.

35
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,340
As you’ve heard in the video about how jurors make decisions, when information becomes complex

36
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,680
and difficult to evaluate systematically, we tend to rely on shortcuts, which we call

37
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,400
heuristics, to help us evaluate information.

38
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,340
It is precisely because expert testimony can often be complex that researchers have been

39
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,040
interested in whether jurors can make sense of the testimony, and whether there are any

40
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,260
cues or shortcuts that they might rely on instead.

41
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,940
In this next part we are going to talk about how things about the expert, for example who

42
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,709
they are, what their experience is, and also whether they are being paid to testify, potentially

43
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:15,980
influence how jurors perceive the expert testimony.

44
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,840
One of the first studies looking at this was conducted by Cooper and colleagues in 1996.

45
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,000
They asked participants to watch a video tape recreation of a trial in which two scientists

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,930
gave expert testimony about one aspect of the case. The plaintiff&#39;s expert was described

47
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,700
as having either strong or weak credentials, and gave his evidence using either simple

48
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,569
or complex language. As predicted, the extra-legal cue of expert credentials did influence the

49
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:45,870
participants--they were more persuaded by the expert who had strong credentials--but

50
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,760
only when the expert&#39;s testimony was complex. When the testimony was simple, participants

51
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,739
were influenced by what the expert said, rather than the expert&#39;s credentials. This suggests

52
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,950
that the participants were using the cue of the expert&#39;s credentials when they couldn&#39;t

53
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:05,019
directly evaluate what the expert said because the language was too difficult to understand.

54
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:08,690
An expert&#39;s gender can have a similar effect to credentials in that it can work as a cue

55
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:14,540
that influences how persuasive the expert is in the eyes of the perceivers or the jurors.

56
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,989
While some earlier research by Swenson and colleagues in 1984 suggested that female experts

57
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:23,960
were more persuasive than male experts, subsequent research by Regina Schuller, me, and a number

58
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,789
of our colleagues suggests that when an expert’s gender matches the domain they are testifying

59
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:33,470
about, it’s then that their testimony is evaluated more positively and mock jurors

60
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,590
award higher damages.

61
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,550
For example, if a male expert testifies about a commercial price fixing agreement in the

62
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:44,740
context of business engaged in rock crushing, he will be more persuasive than a female expert

63
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,610
giving exactly the same testimony. Whereas a female expert would be more persuasive giving

64
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:54,790
the same price fixing related testimony when the businesses were in perfume supplies.

65
00:04:54,790 --> 00:05:00,590
Our 2005 research also suggests, just as Cooper and colleagues found with expert credentials,

66
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:05,970
that this is used as a heuristic cue, as the effect is greatest when testimony is complex

67
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,169
and difficult to understand.

68
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:12,259
We also found in some subsequent research, that the type of language that an expert uses

69
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:17,190
can also be relied upon as a cue by perceivers. This is because we have expectations about

70
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:22,520
how men and women typically use language -- we expect men to use more complex language compared to

71
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,490
women. Our 2013 study suggested, consistent with

72
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:31,500
this, that male experts were more persuasive compared to female experts when they used complex

73
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,789
language and perceivers were under cognitive load.

74
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:39,150
An expert&#39;s behaviour also matters. Cramer and colleagues found that moderate levels

75
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,250
of confidence in delivering testimony led to an expert being perceived as most credible

76
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,190
by mock jurors.

77
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,990
It&#39;s not just an expert&#39;s credentials and gender that matter either. Whether an expert

78
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,570
is a one who testifies in court frequently and is one who is paid for his or her services

79
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,600
also affects how jurors think about the expert&#39;s testimony.

80
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,210
This is known as the hired gun effect, and was originally studied by Cooper and Neuhaus

81
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,150
in 2000.

82
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,570
They conducted three experiments to look at whether sometimes jurors fall back on cognitive

83
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:11,350
short cuts when thinking about expert testimony in the context of the hired gun effect. This

84
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,740
is the idea that if an expert appears to be a gun for hire, in that they testify relatively

85
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,250
frequently for a fee, their testimony might be less convincing because it looks like they

86
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,919
are just in it for the money.

87
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,930
This is essentially what the studies found. Participants who heard from a well paid expert

88
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,759
who frequently testified, found that expert less trustworthy and were less persuaded by

89
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:35,710
that testimony. Their third study suggested that this was indeed the result of a cognitive

90
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:40,580
shortcut - the effect was present when the testimony was presented in complex, but not

91
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,539
simple, language.

92
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:46,330
As we heard previously, shortcuts such as heuristics, are most prominent when perceivers

93
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,419
are not able to think systematically about the information. The complex language made

94
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:54,880
it difficult for participants to systematically evaluate the expert&#39;s testimony, so they fell

95
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,080
back on a short cut - if the expert is doing it for money, he or she is a hired gun and

96
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,130
shouldn&#39;t be trusted so much!

97
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:06,360
So, complex testimony seems to be problematic. What about some of the most complex information

98
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:12,060
that the lay juror might have to grapple with? What about statistics and probability?

99
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:17,030
There has been some concern expressed by various courts that testimony including probabilities

100
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:22,370
would unduly influence jurors. Kaye and Koehlerin 1991 reviewed the research conducted up to

101
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:27,500
that point and concluded, however, that jurors actually under-weigh statistical testimony

102
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,039
when it is presented in the context of other evidence.

103
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:34,789
Kaye and colleagues&#39; research suggests that while jurors are susceptible to some fallacies

104
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:39,840
when reasoning about probabilities, these tended to favour the defence compared to the prosecution.

105
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,669
In this study, 480 people called for jury service were shown a 70 minute film about

106
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:51,669
a mock trial that included DNA evidence that suggested that only 1 in 5,072 Caucasian men

107
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:56,319
had DNA types that matched the sample from the scene of the crime. Participants then

108
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,370
deliberated in groups of eight. Rather than being overly persuaded by the probability,

109
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,810
Kaye and colleagues found that jurors generally coped with the evidence, and if anything were

110
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:11,919
conservative in estimating the likelihood that the sample came from the defendant.

111
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,889
How statistical evidence is presented matters though, and it can make the evidence

112
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:21,129
more or less persuasive. Koehler reported three experiments in 2001 that manipulated

113
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:26,360
how statistical evidence was presented, and was able to show that when presented one way

114
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,419
the evidence convinced legal decision makers that the suspect was almost certainly the

115
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:35,800
source of the DNA material. But when presented another way, led a substantial proportion of

116
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:41,069
the people to conclude that the suspect could not have been the source of the DNA material.

117
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:46,790
Koehler was testing his theory about how people make sense of probabilistic statistical evidence--specifically

118
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:52,630
that the cognitive availability of coincidental match exemplars determines what the evidence

119
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:58,250
says about guilt. In other words, if we can easily think of examples of other people who

120
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:03,630
might match the DNA sample by chance, then we think the defendant or suspect is less

121
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,060
likely to be guilty.

122
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,170
Koehler was able to manipulate how easy it was for people to think of such exemplars

123
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:15,300
by changing the framing of the statistical information. The probability of a match was

124
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:22,050
presented either as a percentage in relation to a single target, such as 0.1% likelihood

125
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:27,370
of a chance match with this specific defendant. Or an equivalent frequency in relation to

126
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:32,820
multiple targets, 1 in 1,000 people in the specific city.

127
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,850
The first presentation is designed to make it difficult to think of examples of other

128
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:43,200
chance matches to the DNA sample--the probability that it is a chance match seems like a very

129
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,140
small number, in fact close to zero, so the defendant must be the source of the DNA.

130
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,920
With the second form of presentation, it&#39;s easy to reason that if the probability of

131
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:58,190
a chance match is 1 in 1,000, and let&#39;s assume there are 1 million people in the city, that

132
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:03,390
means there&#39;s about 1,000 people who would match the DNA by chance alone. Now this sounds

133
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:08,220
like it&#39;s pretty easy to find someone to match the sample by chance, and so it&#39;s quite possible

134
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,870
that the defendant matches the sample by chance, not because he or she is the actual source

135
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,830
of the DNA.

136
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:19,230
So, despite both of the statistics in these examples being equivalent, the first was much

137
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,329
more persuasive and led people to conclude that the defendant was the actual source of

138
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:25,120
the DNA.

139
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,640
Koehler found that this effect of presentation did, however, disappear as the probabilities

140
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,720
became smaller and smaller. This is because as a reference group used to describe the

141
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,899
probabilities approaches the size of the population being used for context, or becomes so large

142
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:44,790
that we are basically referring to the entire population of the earth, it becomes harder to imagine

143
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,880
chance matches.

144
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,950
So, for example say the probability was 1 in 1 million, and we presented that probability

145
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:57,750
as either 0.0001% that the sample matched the defendant by chance, or that the sample

146
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,760
would match 1 in 1 million people in the city of 1 million people by chance. There would

147
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,290
be very little difference in the persuasiveness of each frame, as it seems very hard to imagine

148
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,430
matches by chance alone in either form of presentation.

149
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:15,480
Next we are going to talk about how the media portrays expert testimony, in particular expert

150
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,140
forensic testimony, and how that might influence how jurors perceive their testimony. Now we

151
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,410
could have easily talked about these effects in the media exposure video as they are another

152
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:31,899
form of what we call media exposure effects, this time specific to how experts are perceived.

153
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:36,350
Often, these types of effects are called the ‘CSI effect’. When we are talking about

154
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,480
the ‘CSI effect’ we need to be clear about what we mean, however. There are three possible

155
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,380
ways that this effect could be defined according to Podlas in 2006.

156
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:50,430
The first is that CSI increases the lay public&#39;s interest in forensics and science.

157
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:55,600
The second that CSI creates unreasonable expectations about forensic evidence on the part of the

158
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,920
jurors, making a conviction less likely.

159
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:04,579
And the third is that CSI raises the credibility of scientific evidence so that it is seen

160
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:08,910
as almost infallible, making a conviction more likely.

161
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:13,149
As you can see, those last two effects are actually opposite in direction.

162
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:19,899
Podlas in 2006 surveyed 306 university students, asking them about how often they viewed CSI-related

163
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:25,579
television shows. Participants were asked to also consider a hypothetical case of rape

164
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:30,490
and reach a decision about what the verdict should be. In this study, there was no difference

165
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,760
in verdicts for those who watched CSI-related television shows compared to those who did

166
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:40,490
not watch those shows. Thus, Podlas concluded that there was no effect of watching CSI-related

167
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,350
shows, in terms of the first two definitions we mentioned before.

168
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:49,420
In contrast, Schweitzer and Saks in 2007 used a very similar paradigm and found that watching

169
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:54,980
CSI and crime programs made participants more critical of forensic evidence in some circumstances,

170
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,040
such as when that evidence is ambiguous.

171
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,610
Those studies used university students. What about with real jurors? What do they think

172
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,959
about CSI-related evidence?

173
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:09,510
Shelton and colleagues in 2006 conducted a study of actual jurors. They did not find

174
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:16,320
this type of effect, however. They found that watching CSI-type shows didn&#39;t actually influence verdicts.

175
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,160
Now given that sometimes we find evidence of a CSI effect, and sometimes we don&#39;t, this suggests

176
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,180
that there might be other variables which are involved in the relationship between watching CSI shows

177
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,660
and outcomes such as conviction rates. One possibility is that CSI exposure has its

178
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:37,300
effect through raising expectations about evidence, and it is these expectations that

179
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,380
have an influence on verdicts.

180
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:45,370
Kim and colleagues set out to test this in their 2009 study. In that study, they surveyed

181
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:50,480
1,027 actual jurors in Michigan, USA. Participants were asked to read about three different case

182
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,480
types and asked how willing they would be to convict a defendant when there was no scientific

183
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:01,250
evidence and only (a) circumstantial evidence or (b) eyewitness testimony. Participants

184
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:06,980
were also asked to report how often they watched CSI drama shows, along with their expectations

185
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,480
about receiving scientific evidence of some kind.

186
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,990
What they found was that watching CSI shows had an indirect effect on convictions through

187
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:19,600
raising expectations about scientific evidence, but only for circumstantial evidence.

188
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,470
So, while jurors do seem to be able to make sense of some pretty complex and difficult

189
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:28,670
to understand testimony and they don&#39;t seem to be too badly misled by the media portrayal

190
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:33,610
of forensic evidence or statistical information, sometimes they rely on short cuts when the

191
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:38,480
going gets tough. One potential way to alleviate that is for experts to use the simplest and

192
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:38,990
clearest language possible.
