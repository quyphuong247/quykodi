So who can become a juror?

1
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,740
In Australia, which is fairly typical of countries that use juries, the jury consists of members

2
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,349
of the general public aged between 18 and 70. A computer is used to select names at

3
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:32,049
random from the electoral rolls. A questionnaire is sent out to potential jurors to determine

4
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:38,190
their availability and eligibility to serve on a jury. From this, a ballot is conducted

5
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,489
and a summons is sent to those who are selected. Some people, such as those who have served

6
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:47,370
prison sentences, are actually not eligible for jury service.

7
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,189
Once potential jurors turn up to the courthouse, there are two further processes. Groups of

8
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:57,540
potential jurors will be called to attend a courtroom for selection onto a trial.

9
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,860
How are they chosen once they turn up in the courtroom?

10
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,099
Well, I will describe the process that applies in many jurisdictions, although the details

11
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:09,210
may change from place to place. In some jurisdictions, more information is known about jurors during the

12
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,860
selection process. Cards showing the names, addresses and occupations of potential jurors are placed

13
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:20,680
in a rotating box and picked out at random. When called, each person walks to the bailiff

14
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,690
to take an oath on the bible or make an affirmation.

15
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:29,580
During this part of the trial, called voir dire, potential jurors can be rejected.

16
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,220
At any time before the bailiff begins to recite the oath or affirmation, either the prosecution

17
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,940
or the defence can raise an objection to a juror. A juror can be challenged because the

18
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,780
prosecution or defence simply doesn&#39;t like the look of that juror. This is called a peremptory challenge.

19
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,750
In some jurisdictions there are limitations on how peremptory challenges can be used.

20
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,860
For example, in the United States of America you can not use this type of challenge on

21
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:58,110
the basis of race alone. Although, some research by Sommers and Norton in 2007 suggests that

22
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,600
this race based challenge still occurs, even when lawyers are able to give non-race based

23
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,240
reasons for their selections in such cases.

24
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,840
A juror can also be challenged for a different reason. They can be challenged because of

25
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,030
a presumed or actual partiality. This is called a challenge for cause. The defence

26
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:20,620
and prosecution can only make a limited number of each of these types of challenges. 

27
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,040
The number varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

28
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,380
The Judge may also ask potential jurors questions to determine whether they will be able to

29
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,599
discharge their duty as a juror effectively.

30
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,700
For example, the Judge might ask if anyone knows the defendant in this particular case,

31
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,650
or has read media coverage about the case, or has already formed an opinion about the

32
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,110
guilt or innocence of the defendant.

33
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:49,200
In some jurisdictions, such as in some states in the United States of America, potential

34
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,430
jurors can be asked to complete lengthy questionnaires that are designed to assess prior attitudes

35
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,870
and potential biases that jurors might hold. For example, potential jurors in the trial

36
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:05,870
of Phil Spector were asked to complete a fifteen page questionnaire. Those jurors in the O.J.

37
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:11,970
Simpson criminal trial were actually asked to complete a seventy-five page questionnaire.

38
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,900
These questionnaires can be informed by additional surveys of the community prior to the selection

39
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,910
process to identify the links between the characteristics of potential jurors and how

40
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:27,780
positively or negatively they view arguments and evidence specific to the present case.

41
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,690
Trial consultants sometimes also make use of mock jurors (which are people pretending

42
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:36,069
to be jurors in the case) and focus groups to further enhance their understanding of

43
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:39,430
how different types of people might react to the case.

44
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:44,000
With this additional information prior to jury selection, trial consultants are supposedly

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,280
in a better position to identify those potential jurors in the jury pool who will react most

46
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,420
favourably to their side of the case.

47
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:56,730
In addition, in cases involving the death penalty in the United States of America, jurors

48
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:02,150
have to also be ‘death qualified’ to serve on such trials. This means they have to have

49
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:07,580
no moral objection to imposing the death penalty should the defendant actually be found guilty

50
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,060
of the charge.

51
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,310
If the defendant changes his or her plea to guilty, or there is some change in scheduling,

52
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,209
or perhaps enough jurors have already been chosen, it is actually quite possible for

53
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:23,909
a potential juror to go through all of these processes and turn up to court for jury service

54
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:27,099
but never actually be selected onto a trial.

55
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:32,009
So, take a look at the image of potential jurors in the next section and read the basic

56
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:36,540
description for each. Who would you select for the case you have been following so far

57
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:43,120
in this course? Think about why you might select or object to each person. You can indicate

58
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,500
the people you would challenge, that is, reject, in the poll that follows.
