So how did you go? How well do you think you understood what the judge was asking jurors to do?

1
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,400
Well, we can give you pretty clear feedback about whether you understood what the burden

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,639
of proof was. In this case, the burden of proof was wholly on the prosecution. This

3
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:18,050
means that it is up to the prosecution to prove that the defendant is guilty by presenting

4
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,390
evidence that shows that it was the defendant who committed the crime and that the defendant

5
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,830
meant to cause serious harm or death to the victim.

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,519
The correct interpretation of this direction recognises that the defendant does not have

7
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,590
to prove that he is innocent, so the defendant does not have to provide any evidence at all.

8
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,190
It is completely up to the prosecution to make the case.

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,920
However, giving you a clear explanation of the standard of proof, and so feedback on

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,640
whether you understood it or not, is a bit trickier. There is often no agreed definition

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,480
of what beyond reasonable doubt means in many jurisdictions.

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,050
In some jurisdictions this is defined as meaning that you are sure that the defendant is guilty,

13
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,580
or you are sure that there is no other plausible or reasonable explanation for the evidence

14
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,950
presented in the case.

15
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,320
In other jurisdictions, it is simply defined as just meaning that you have no doubt that

16
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,450
is reasonable, which is a circular definition.

17
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,220
One misconception that our research has identified., however,

18
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,940
is that beyond reasonable doubt means that you have no doubt at all, this is not

19
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,320
actually the case.

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,920
A correct interpretation of beyond reasonable doubt can mean that you can have some doubt

21
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,150
about the defendant&#39;s guilt, but that that doubt just can&#39;t be a reasonable, or perhaps

22
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,020
sensible, doubt. In Queensland at least, it has been suggested that beyond reasonable

23
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,690
doubt be clarified by making it clear to jurors that it doesn&#39;t mean no doubts at all.

24
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:38,790
So how did you go with your explanations of these two instructions? Did you get them both correct?

25
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,540
And were your feelings about whether you got them correct in line with whether you actually

26
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,310
got them correct?

27
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,240
We will return shortly to consider whether people&#39;s perceptions of their understanding

28
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,170
of such instructions matches their actual level of understanding of those instructions

29
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,490
in a minute.

30
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,430
So how important are instructions for how a jury decides its verdict?

31
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,520
In our drama, you obviously heard a very abbreviated version of this phase of the trial - we only

32
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,729
had a few minutes to show you what happened in the trial, not several days, weeks or perhaps

33
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:07,840
months as happens in real trials.

34
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,489
In some jurisdictions, the summing up and instruction part of a trial can take a substantial

35
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:18,159
period of time - even as long as the presentation of evidence itself during the trial!

36
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,760
This is one of the reasons that law reform bodies and researchers have focussed on understanding

37
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,680
the effect of this part of the trial. Longer summing ups and instructions to jurors make

38
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,019
the trial more expensive and create unnecessary delays in the legal system.

39
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:35,450
Let&#39;s ignore the summing up part of the trial for a second and focus on the issue of judicial

40
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,079
instructions.

41
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:41,310
Are those instructions, or directions as they are sometimes called, useful for jurors in

42
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,930
making their decisions?

43
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,459
Well, to answer that question, we have to first of all ask whether jurors can actually

44
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:48,359
understand what they are being asked to do.

45
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:54,590
McCabe and Purves, reporting on the London School of Economics Jury Research Project in 1974,

46
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,079
asked shadow jurors about their experiences. A shadow jury is when members of the public

47
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:03,019
attend a real trial, and form a second jury for the purposes of the research project.

48
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:06,950
They are not actually deciding the verdict in the case, but they experience the same

49
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:11,340
evidence as the real jury. Typically they sit in the public gallery.

50
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,700
Because they are not the real jury, researchers are allowed to record their deliberations

51
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,930
and ask them lots of questions about how they made their decisions.

52
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,719
This research suggested that jurors are conscientious about their task - they try really hard to

53
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:28,980
do what they are asked to do. However, research by Stephenson in 1992 suggested that this

54
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,159
conscientiousness fades away during the trial unfortunately.

55
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,249
This doesn&#39;t say a lot about jurors&#39; comprehension of what they are asked to do, only that they

56
00:03:37,249 --> 00:03:40,859
appear to be motivated to do what they think they are being asked to do.

57
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:47,859
Zander and Henderson&#39;s 1993 study reported that 90% of 8000 jurors had been able to understand

58
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:52,900
and remember the evidence, and that the prosecution and defence barristers thought jury would

59
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,559
have no trouble understanding or remembering the evidence.

60
00:03:57,559 --> 00:04:01,829
That research relied on jurors&#39; own self reports of comprehension - whether they thought they

61
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:05,919
could understand the evidence and judicial instructions - and also the reports of the

62
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:08,230
lawyers involved in the case.

63
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,260
Other self report data agrees with these findings.

64
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:16,870
In a study by Jackson in 1992, 65% of jurors said they understood all of the judge&#39;s instructions,

65
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:22,270
and a further 25% said they understood most of the instructions - so that&#39;s a total of

66
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,520
90%, much the same as Zander and Henderson found.

67
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,069
Consistent with this, Cutler and Hughes in 2001 reported that 96.6% of the jurors in

68
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:35,620
their study said that the judges’ instructions were clear and understandable.

69
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:40,090
Now from a research perspective, even though this is interesting in that it tells us what

70
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:46,720
jurors think they understand, it might not be a very reliable indicator of actual comprehension.

71
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,800
So why can&#39;t we rely on juror&#39;s self-reported understanding of instructions?

72
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,250
There is pretty strong social pressure on a juror to say that he or she understands

73
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,240
the task at hand. To return a verdict and then admit to a researcher that you didn&#39;t

74
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,300
understand what you were meant to be doing would look pretty bad really.

75
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,330
The research relying on more direct measures of comprehension is generally pretty consistent,

76
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:12,650
and unfortunately it paints a different picture about jurors&#39; comprehension of instructions.

77
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,639
Such research has either asked jurors and mock jurors to paraphrase what the judicial

78
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,889
instructions mean — this is a test developed by Charrow and Charrow in 1979 — or has

79
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,379
given jurors and mock jurors a multiple choice test.

80
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:30,189
When we asked you what the judge&#39;s instruction meant at the start of the episode, we asked

81
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:32,509
both of these types of questions.

82
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:36,210
The short version is that jurors struggle to understand what they are asked to do. For

83
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:42,379
example Reifman, Gusick and Ellsworth in 1992 reported that only 41% of jurors actually

84
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:47,460
understood substantive law when they were tested objectively. They also showed that

85
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,750
those jurors who were given instructions performed just as well as those who were not given instructions.

86
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,360
So either comprehension was poor, or jurors didn&#39;t rely on the instructions.

87
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,039
In terms of understanding both of the instructions we spoke about earlier in this presentation,

88
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:05,939
our own research suggests that only about a third of jurors correctly interpret both

89
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:10,550
of the instructions to do with standard of proof and burden of proof. Two thirds understand

90
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,580
one or the other.

91
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,729
These are not unusual findings. Work by Severance and colleagues in 1992 also shows that jurors

92
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:23,139
display serious difficulty comprehending differences between legal concepts.

93
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:28,550
As reported by Sarat in 1995, jurors who were surveyed as part of the Capital Jury Project

94
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:32,199
could remember the details of the defendant, but they could not understand or remember

95
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:36,069
the legal rules relating to their decision to impose the death penalty.

96
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:40,039
This difficulty in remembering the legal rules is part of a more general issue where jurors

97
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:44,560
have difficulty in remembering information about trials. For example, Hastie and colleagues&#39;

98
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,539
1983 study found that jurors had poor recall of trial information. This problem is made

99
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:55,639
worse in complex cases, according to some research by Nathanson, in 1995.

100
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:00,389
Jurors themselves have some insight into the problems with evidence and instructions. Heuer

101
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:05,830
and Penrod found in 1995 as well that as case complexity increased, jurors felt less sure

102
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,999
that their verdict reflected a proper understanding of instructions.

103
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:15,999
Heuer &amp; Penrod in 1994 also surveyed 81% of jurors in 160 trials. They found that as the

104
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:20,599
amount of information increased, jurors admitted that it was harder to decide the case.

105
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:26,009
And so difficulties in remembering trial details and also the legal instructions about how

106
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:29,930
to decide the verdict, make it difficult for jurors to do their job.

107
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:34,710
There is additional evidence from Sandys&#39; 1995 study that jurors fail to separate judgements

108
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:38,650
of guilt and punishment in capital cases in the United States. Although the guilt and

109
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,900
punishment phases of capital trials are meant to be separate, and the decisions based on

110
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,919
different sets of evidence, it seems that both decisions are made at the same time.

111
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:52,370
We also know from Casper and Benedict&#39;s 1993 research that jurors do not ignore extra-legal

112
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:57,849
or inadmissible evidence, even when instructed to do so. We spoke about some of these issues

113
00:07:57,849 --> 00:07:59,370
in a previous presentation.

114
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:04,639
So, overall, while there is some variation in comprehension from study to study, according

115
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,949
to Bornstein and Greene in 2011, figures of about 50% of people actually understanding

116
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:13,110
directions seem to be about typical.

117
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,889
From Rose and Ogloff&#39;s 2001 research, we also know that deliberating as a group doesn&#39;t

118
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:19,909
seem to improve the state of affairs.

119
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:22,710
So, this is obviously somewhat concerning!

120
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,039
The point of this research is not to suggest that jurors are incapable of acting as deciders

121
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,099
of fact as they are instructed to do so, but rather to highlight that there is a problem

122
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,700
with how they are being asked to do their job. So there is a problem with the instructions,

123
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,550
not with the jurors themselves.

124
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:42,230
Just to give you an example of how complex the instructions have become in some cases,

125
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,970
here is an instruction about motive to lie:

126
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:49,250
There are a number of matters that arise out of that line of questions and the argument

127
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:54,810
about which I must give you direction. The first is this. The defence argued to you

128
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:59,610
that there are a number of reasons why Complainant A might be telling lies about the conduct

129
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,180
of the accused to him. The prosecution on the other hand of course, argued that Complainant

130
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,390
A was a truthful witness and you should accept him as a witness of truth in relation to what

131
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:12,600
he says the accused did to him. The prosecution argues that even accepting the combination

132
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,070
of events occurring in Complainant A’s life at the time, that this does not make his evidence

133
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,780
untruthful or unreliable.

134
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,200
It is very important that you understand that if you accept the prosecution argument that

135
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,820
notwithstanding all of these things were happening to Complainant A at the time, and therefore

136
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,690
that you reject the defence argument that Complainant A was lying because he wanted

137
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,740
to divert attention away from his own wrongdoing and to get himself back into the School, and

138
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,490
because people were trying to induce him to say things about [name withheld]; if you reject

139
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,120
that defence argument all that means is you have rejected one of the arguments advanced

140
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,650
by the defence as to why you should reject the evidence of Complainant A. It is not the

141
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,110
same by rejecting an argument that these were motives that induced Complainant A to lie;

142
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,010
it is not the same as saying, “Because I have rejected these motives, therefore I find

143
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,390
he was telling the truth.” So it is one thing to say, “I reject the argument that

144
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,940
he lied because he had the motive” but it does not automatically convert Complainant

145
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,700
A’s evidence into the truth. That is a separate and independent assessment that you must make.

146
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,290
Two things flow from that. First is the one I have mentioned. All you have done if you

147
00:09:59,290 --> 00:09:59,730
reject the argument, is reject one possible basis for rejecting Complainant A’s evidence.

148
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,060
It may still be possible that was lying for a motive that you do not know about and that

149
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,580
the defence did not know about. So just because you reject, if you reject the possible motives

150
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:00,930
advanced by the defence, does not mean that there could not be other motives. So the rejection

151
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:01,240
of arguments about motive to lie do not make Complainant A’s evidence by that reason

152
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,500
alone, any more credible. You must assess Complainant A’s credibility on the basis

153
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:01,750
of his evidence and consideration of all of the other evidence in the case and the arguments

154
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:01,600
that have been put to you about it; not on the basis of what the accused might be able

155
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,140
to point to, to suggest a reason for lying.

156
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,390
Remember, at all times it is for the prosecution to prove that Complainant A is telling the

157
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,250
truth about the acts, the subject of Count 1. It is one of the aspects of the accused

158
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:10,250
not being required to prove his innocence, that he does not have to prove to you any

159
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:15,650
particular motive on the part of Complainant A to lie. You can only convict the accused

160
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:21,060
on Count 1 on the basis of all of the evidence, if you are satisfied of his guilt beyond reasonable

161
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,310
doubt.

162
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,510
Now right, obviously we had to speed up the instruction. If we had read the instruction

163
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,920
out at normal speed, it would have taken about thirty or forty minutes.

164
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,490
So why have instructions become so complex when this complexity seems at odds with the

165
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,750
very purpose of helping jurors make their decisions correctly?

166
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:42,610
Well, the reason why this is, is because instructions are often designed and given with two purposes

167
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,750
in mind.

168
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:48,170
The first purpose should be pretty obvious. To help jurors make decisions in the legally

169
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,550
correct way.

170
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:54,090
The second purpose however, is to protect the jury&#39;s verdict against appeal. Courts

171
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:57,050
are generally arranged in a hierarchy. The lower courts will generally hear the less

172
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:01,310
serious matters, and also the preliminary matters for more serious cases. The higher

173
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:05,890
courts, such as the District and Supreme courts in my jurisdiction, will run the jury trials

174
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,980
for the serious crimes.

175
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,660
At the conclusion of a trial, if a defendant is convicted, he or she may instruct their

176
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,270
lawyers to appeal to the Court of Appeal or even the High Court, if the result of the

177
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,360
first appeal is to be appealed - The High Court is the highest court in Australia, the

178
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,960
equivalent in other jurisdictions will likely have a different name.

179
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,850
Because a jury doesn&#39;t provide written reasons for their verdict, as in a Judge only trial,

180
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:33,830
the only basis for appeal is generally mis-instruction or mis-direction. That is, that the judge gave an incorrect

181
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,920
instruction, or failed to give an appropriate instruction.

182
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,580
Because jury trials are very time consuming and expensive, and they can be traumatic for

183
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:46,020
witnesses and victims, judges generally want to avoid avenues for appeal in jury trials.

184
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:50,140
One way they do this is to rely on directions that have been written to protect against

185
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,470
appeal.

186
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,450
These might be standard instructions that have survived previous appeals, or instructions

187
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:58,840
that cover every possible verdict option and defence, even if not raised in the actual

188
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,070
case. Such instructions can be very lengthy and contain a lot of technical legal language

189
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,510
which is aimed at the appeals judges, not the jurors.

190
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,560
Entities such as the American Bar Association and law reform commissions in other jurisdictions

191
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,570
have recommended rewriting instructions in simpler terminology so that they are easier

192
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,520
to understand.

193
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,170
So does simplification work?

194
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,810
Well some of the earlier research in this area suggested that it does. Elwork and colleagues

195
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:27,070
in 1977 found that when they rewrote instructions using psycholinguistic principles, jurors&#39;

196
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,140
comprehension of those instructions improved.

197
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,710
Now, the findings have been criticised because they assessed comprehension using

198
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:38,890
the paraphrase test, which critics such as Severance and Loftus argue tests memory

199
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,950
rather than comprehension. Other types of test--such as the multiple choice test that

200
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:46,600
has been used by researchers like Brewer and colleagues in 2004 (Brewer, Harvey, &amp; Semmler,

201
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,870
2004), and looking at whether jurors use the directions such as in the research by Rose

202
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,950
and Ogloff in 2001--also suggest that simplification can improve comprehension.

203
00:12:54,950 --> 00:13:00,020
Now it&#39;s quite possible though, that even if jurors understand directions they&#39;re given they might

204
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:04,800
not follow them. It&#39;s also possible that jurors might reach good or reasonable decisions even

205
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,370
if they don&#39;t understand the directions themselves. It&#39;s true though that some legal commentators

206
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:14,000
would argue that a decision isn&#39;t sound unless it is based on the correct legal principle.

207
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,420
So will jurors follow the instructions if they have been simplified?

208
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,310
Well this depends on what we assume about how jurors make decisions. We spent some time

209
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:26,220
talking about this in a previous presentation. The focus on simplification of judicial instructions

210
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,250
assumes a fairly mechanistic decision making process for jurors.

211
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:36,030
A and B in this example are bits of information or evidence, D is the directions and V is

212
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,420
verdict.

213
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:41,630
This is an abstract representation of an algebraic model of jury decision making, similar to

214
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:45,170
the algebraic models of person perception that were popular for a while.

215
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,810
Now according to this model, as long as jurors can understand directions, they will combine

216
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:53,330
the evidence (A and B) in the appropriate manner, taking into account the ways they

217
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:57,830
are meant to use that evidence as indicated in the directions (D), to arrive at a verdict

218
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,490
(V).

219
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:03,420
The assumption that just simplifying instructions should fix the issue unfortunately doesn&#39;t

220
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,320
deal with any of the later stages of information processing that perceivers are thought to

221
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,070
engage in when evaluating judicial instructions - which are really just actually persuasive

222
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,160
messages.

223
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,820
According to McGuire&#39;s Model of persuasion, there are additional steps before and after

224
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,960
comprehension, that a message must survive to have an impact. Crucially, not only do

225
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,360
jurors have to comprehend what they are being asked to do, but they have to accept that

226
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,740
this is the correct way to make the decision, and then also be able to remember the instruction

227
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,840
and apply that in their decision making.

228
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,240
This assumption is also inconsistent with what we know about how jurors make decisions

229
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,520
and what they are asked to rely on — which is their common sense.

230
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,300
In an earlier video, we talked about Pennington and Hastie’s (1992) story model of jury

231
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,710
decision making. Remember that in this model, jurors create a story to help make sense of

232
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,570
the evidence as it is presented in the trial.

233
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:53,820
This model implies that merely understanding directions will not necessarily lead to information

234
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,780
being combined in the desired way. Even if jurors understand directions, they might not

235
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:03,350
actually use those directions in making a decision if doing so would be incompatible

236
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,400
with the story they have generated to understand the evidence.

237
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,740
So perhaps the best way to encourage jurors to make decisions in legally appropriate ways

238
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,880
is not to tell them what to do, but to set up their decision-making task in a way that

239
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,070
naturally guides them to make their decision in the appropriate way.

240
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,700
Question trails, which turn the problem of applying abstract legal rules to the facts

241
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,700
of the case into direct questions of fact about the current case, are being used in

242
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,730
some jurisdictions like New Zealand. These look like a promising way to address the issue

243
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,780
with jurors&#39; comprehension of judicial instructions.

244
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:37,070
Of course, as this is a relatively recent development, we need to wait and see what

245
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:42,420
the research says about the efficacy of this innovative way of helping jurors to make decisions.

246
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,160
The promising thing about question trails is that this approach acknowledges that the

247
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,510
problem with comprehension of instructions is with the instructions themselves, not the

248
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,190
jurors.

249
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:55,410
And importantly, they appear to provide support to jurors in a way that doesn&#39;t rely on jurors

250
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:59,360
having to understand complex legal rules and concepts.

251
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,500
Researchers have also tested a range of other techniques as well, including flow charts

252
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,930
and diagrams with varying levels of success.

253
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,120
What the research on instructions tells us though, is that a jurors&#39; task is a complex

254
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,800
one, and we have to accept that jurors are human too and come with all of the cognitive

255
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,340
capacities and limitations that humans in general have — they aren&#39;t decision-making

256
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:18,730
machines.

257
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:23,520
With these two things in mind, our best avenue for facilitating legally correct decisions

258
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:28,140
by jurors is to support them in their task and not expect them to be experts about legal

259
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:33,800
concepts and rules. They are deciders of fact after all, and their task and the instructions

260
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,390
they are given need to be structured around that reality.
