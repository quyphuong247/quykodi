Here we can see a traditional photographic line-up. However, there are a few key aspects

1
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:29,269
of the set up here that psychological research has identified as being problematic. Before we talk

2
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,610
about those issues, I’m going to ask you to imagine that you’re the eyewitness to

3
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:39,989
the crime that we’ve shown in our drama. Imagine you’ve been called to the line-up,

4
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:46,280
and we’ll see if you can pick out the perpetrator of the crime. So which of these individuals

5
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,879
committed the crime? Maybe pause the video at this point so you can decide on your answer.

6
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:57,299
Start the video again when you’ve decided. So, we’ll come back to whether you got the

7
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:58,460
correct answer later.

8
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:04,920
Let’s look at how this line up was carried out and what psychological research has identified

9
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,920
as being problematic with this way of doing things. The first issue is that the administrator

10
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,210
knew, in advance, who the suspect was. This is known as a single-blind procedure, where

11
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,450
only the eyewitness doesn’t know in advance who the suspect is.

12
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:30,740
The problem with this is that, even with the best intentions in the world, it is possible

13
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:36,760
that the administrator might accidentally provide cues to the eyewitness as to which

14
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:43,740
person is the suspect. That is, the eyewitness might end up choosing the suspect not because

15
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,420
they saw them committing the crime, where of course the suspect might be innocent, but

16
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:55,010
because they’ve been subtly “tipped off” by the administrator as to who to pick.

17
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:59,720
The administrator isn’t necessarily doing this deliberately – the cues they’re providing

18
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,020
may be involuntary.

19
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,509
Sarah Greathouse and Margaret Kovera of the

20
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:11,039
City University of New York found that situations, in which the administrator knew who the suspect

21
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:18,039
was, did indeed lead to increased false identifications of the suspect as being the criminal. So – what’s

22
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,090
the solution?

23
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,750
The solution is to employ what’s known as a double-blind procedure – where you ensure

24
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,599
that the administrator doesn’t know who the suspect is. That is, you essentially treat

25
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:36,060
the line-up as if you were running a behavioural experiment. Sarah Greathouse and Margaret

26
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:42,959
Kovera found that what they called the “diagnosticity” of the eyewitness, essentially a measure of

27
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:49,959
how accurate their overall judgement was, doubled when the administrator didn’t know

28
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:57,150
who the suspect was – when the double blind procedure was used. That is, we’ve got evidence

29
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,450
that the double-blind procedure leads to better outcomes.

30
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,190
The next issue that I’m going to talk about is related to the first. Greathouse and Kovera

31
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:13,190
found that the administrators who knew who the suspect was, also performed a higher proportion

32
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:20,120
of what they called biasing behaviours. Biasing behaviours refer to anything the administrator

33
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:26,700
does that might prejudice the eyewitness towards identifying the suspect – remembering that

34
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:33,030
the suspect may, of course, be innocent. However, even when the administrator doesn’t know

35
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,890
who the suspect is, bias can be introduced through the instructions that are given to

36
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:44,099
the eyewitness. For example, it’s likely that the eyewitness will assume, given the

37
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:48,519
police have bothered with a line-up in the first place, that there’s a good chance

38
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:55,030
that the perpetrator is present. That is, their judgement will be coloured by the expectation

39
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:01,010
that the criminal is somewhere in the line-up and their job is to choose the person in the

40
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,300
line-up who most closely resembles the criminal.

41
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:11,300
In fact, Lorraine Hope of the University of Portsmouth and her colleagues report evidence that 90% of eyewitnesses

42
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:18,940
in a simulated line-up situation expected the suspect to be in the line-up. So – how

43
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:24,069
should we deal with this? Fortunately this is one problem for which there appears to

44
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:30,110
be an easy solution. It turns out that simply instructing the witness that the person they

45
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:36,639
saw committing the crime may or may not be present in the line-up is sufficient to undermine

46
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,210
this expectation and substantially reduce the chance of a false identification.

47
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:48,339
In a classic study by Roy Malpass and Patricia Devine of the State University of New York,

48
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:55,020
they compared the effect of biased and unbiased instructions to eyewitnesses on the percentage

49
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:02,020
of judgement errors in a line-up situation. So, the unbiased instructions included reminding

50
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:09,869
people that the person they saw committing the crime may or may not be in the line-up.

51
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:15,749
They found that when the suspect was in the line-up, it didn’t seem to matter whether

52
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:20,659
biased or unbiased instructions were given. Eyewitnesses were pretty similar in their

53
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:27,029
chance of correctly ID’ing the criminal. However, when the criminal was not in the

54
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:34,029
line-up, an innocent person was identified as the criminal nearly 80% of the time. This

55
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:41,449
compares with only 33% of eyewitnesses who had received the unbiased instructions.

56
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:45,399
This finding has been confirmed by plenty of other studies since then, although I should

57
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:52,270
point out a point of contention here was raised by Steven Clark of the University of California,

58
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:59,270
Riverside. He argued that, based on a meta-analysis, there was evidence that biased instructions

59
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:06,639
might increase correct ID’s when a perpetrator is in the line-up.

60
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,469
One way of conceptualising what Clark is arguing is by showing the outcomes in a 2x2 contingency

61
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:19,469
table. Here we can see the four possible outcomes of a line-up. Two are good. There’s a correct

62
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:27,550
ID. So the criminal is in the line-up and the eyewitness correctly identifies them as

63
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:34,550
the criminal. There’s a correct lack of ID, where the suspect in the line-up is innocent

64
00:06:35,179 --> 00:06:40,800
and the eyewitness correctly does not indicate that they are the criminal.

65
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,469
The other two options are bad. There’s a false ID, where the suspect in the line-up

66
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:52,300
is innocent but the eyewitness incorrectly identifies them as the criminal. Finally,

67
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:59,300
there’s an incorrect failure to ID, where the criminal is in the line-up but the eyewitness

68
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:03,399
fails to identify them.

69
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:09,939
So, biased instructions, where the eyewitness believes the perpetrator is in the line-up

70
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:16,110
have the effect of increasing false ID’s. Meaning that we increase the chance of an

71
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:22,789
innocent person being identified as the criminal. That is, we’re moving judgements from this

72
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:26,149
box to this box.

73
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:32,419
However, Clark argues that, in principle, biased instructions would also have the effect

74
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:39,419
of increasing the chance of a correct ID if the criminal is actually in the line-up.

75
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:47,159
We’re essentially moving judgements from this box to this box. To put it another way,

76
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:53,619
the instructions are affecting what we call the response bias of the eyewitness, making

77
00:07:53,619 --> 00:07:59,379
them more likely to identify the suspect as the criminal. That is, all judgements are

78
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:04,129
being moved from the bottom row to the top row.

79
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:08,520
This is good if the suspect really is the criminal but bad if the suspect is actually

80
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:15,469
innocent. Steven Clark argued that his analyses, in contrast to previous analyses, confirmed

81
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:22,009
this theory. That is, biased instructions can be both good and bad.

82
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:28,330
So, does this mean it’s okay to use biased instructions under the right circumstances?

83
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,059
Well – no.

84
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:35,490
The problem, of course, is that in real life you could never be sure that the perpetrator

85
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:42,120
was actually in the line-up. So by using biased instructions you’re always risking sending

86
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,740
an innocent person to prison.

87
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:51,740
So, even Steven Clark’s conclusion is that police should still always use unbiased instructions

88
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:59,190
despite the understandable temptation to do otherwise if the officers involved are convinced

89
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:04,519
they have the right person. So what we have here is some disagreement

90
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:10,709
between researchers as to the underlying mechanisms, which is valuable in understanding what is

91
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:17,709
actually going on, but the end result is that they still agree on what best practice ought

92
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,779
to be.

93
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:24,800
In the next presentation we’ll turn our attention now to how the members of the line-up

94
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,449
are presented to the eyewitness.
