There are lots of different ways that we can come to understand things about the world.

1
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,759
Typically we rely on our own insight and experience, and what others tell us, and this is fine

2
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:32,040
most of the time. However it can also lead to serious mistakes because these everyday

3
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,530
methods are sometimes prone to bias.

4
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,870
Let’s take the example of psychic ability. Some people claim to have a psychic ability

5
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:46,300
to predict crime or uncover who the perpetrator of a particular crime is.

6
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,180
When these claims are looked at more carefully, however, we often find that a psychic might

7
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:57,479
make any number of predictions about crimes. However, they then only publicize the predictions

8
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:03,820
that turn out to be true. So what looks like an uncanny ability to predict the unpredictable

9
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:08,510
might just be down to chance, as they only highlight those outcomes that happen to be

10
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,780
confirmed.

11
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,310
Richard Wiseman of the University of Hertfordshire and colleagues conducted an experiment in

12
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,950
which they asked psychics to make predictions about some real life crimes.

13
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:25,000
They found that the proportions of accurate predictions were no better than chance. However,

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,030
tellingly, the psychics involved in the study appeared to believe they had successfully

15
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,829
demonstrated their psychic powers.

16
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:37,729
One even went on national television claiming that the experiment proved that he did have

17
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:43,979
psychic powers, despite the opposite being the case. Wiseman argued that people might

18
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,689
get this false impression of success because of the tendency to forget about all of the

19
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:55,509
inaccurate predictions while at the same time highlighting and elaborating on predictions

20
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:59,119
that turned out, by chance, to be correct.

21
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,889
That is to say – the psychics here aren’t necessarily charlatans in the sense that they

22
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:07,439
genuinely appeared to believe in their own powers.

23
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,970
So, how can we strip away the sort of biases that can mislead us regarding the truth of

24
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:19,140
what’s going on? One answer is that we can employ the scientific method.

25
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,280
The scientific method is just about observing things in a systematic way. So how can we

26
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,560
do this?

27
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,510
First, we would bring in some independent observers.

28
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:35,360
Second, we would make sure that we completely controlled everything about the situation

29
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,700
that we could.

30
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,270
Third, we would run lots and lots of trials.

31
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:46,650
Fourth, we would use statistical techniques to test our predictions about what it is that

32
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,350
we are studying. We don&#39;t just focus on those outcomes that support our predictions, we

33
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:56,870
look at all of the outcomes and use statistics to tell us whether any differences we observe

34
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,780
are likely to be due to chance alone or some other factor.

35
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,690
We then publicly report our methods and results after peer review so that other researchers

36
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:12,230
can critically analyse what we’ve done, in order to identify any flaws or alternative

37
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,730
explanations for our findings.

38
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:21,580
And then, ideally, we&#39;d repeat the whole process lots of times under different contexts and

39
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,560
with different researchers. This is called replication.

40
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,840
Fundamentally, the scientific method is a much more reliable way of determining what’s

41
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,040
likely to be true about the world than relying on our own experiences, anecdotal evidence,

42
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,540
and the like.

43
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,320
There are drawbacks to using the scientific method of course: it’s expensive, it’s

44
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,040
time consuming, and it’s not always possible to control things to the degree required.

45
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,670
However, if we’re dealing with issues where knowing the truth of the matter really matters

46
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,840
– for example, where the truth could mean the difference between a dangerous criminal

47
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,319
being captured or not being captured, or someone going to prison or not going to prison

48
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,460
– then it’s worth seeing what the scientific method can tell us.

49
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,180
And that’s what this course is about.

50
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,930
We’ll be reviewing a range of behavioural studies published in the scientific literature

51
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:21,470
to see what they can tell us about how we should run our criminal justice systems.

52
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:26,180
And what we’ll discover is that sometimes what even criminal justice professionals believe

53
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:32,550
to be true, a belief that could be based on decades of personal experience, can turn out

54
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:39,550
to be wrong.
