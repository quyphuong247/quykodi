The importance of the time and space of the offence highlighted by Canter in his Investigative

1
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,960
Psychology approach, is a theme picked up in the speciality of geographical profiling.

2
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,040
So while in both Criminal Investigative Analysis and Investigative Psychology the main practical

3
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,640
emphasis of the offender profile is to provide information about the kind of person the offender

4
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,160
may be, in geographical profiling the practical emphasis of the profile is to tell you where

5
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,810
the offender is likely to be based. So like the more traditional criminal profiles it

6
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:54,000
is a tool that investigators can use to help prioritize their search areas.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,880
Geographical profiling is typically used to give estimates of the most likely geographic

8
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:03,030
location of an offender&#39;s home, but can also be used to identify work sites or just

9
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:09,420
areas that the offender is highly familiar with. So broadly, geographical profiling works

10
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,810
on the principle that most crimes are not random. There is a reason or logic that they

11
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,000
take place in the location that they do.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,440
The various approaches to geographical profiling are based on a variety of observations of

13
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,380
human behaviour and the resulting principles and theories. The first of these is the least

14
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:33,800
effort principle. That is, as its name suggests, given two or more alternatives people

15
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:39,039
will take the option that requires the least effort, or is easiest. So at a basic level,

16
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:43,810
in terms of where a crime is committed, if there are two identically attractive options

17
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,330
then the offender will choose the one closest to him or her.

18
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:53,610
Related to this is distance decay. This is the idea that crimes will decrease in frequency

19
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,890
the farther away the offender travels from their home. So you may expect that an offender

20
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,000
will show a preference for crime scenes closer to their home. However, they are unlikely

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,190
to be too close because that would increase the chance of recognition. So close to home,

22
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,959
but not in the &#39;buffer zone&#39; where the person is comparatively well known.

23
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,640
But both of these principles are a bit of an oversimplification. If I am an offender

24
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,900
and I&#39;m thinking that a dark shadowy corner would be ideal in which to commit a crime

25
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,420
and I can identify two locations, then it is highly probable that other aspects will

26
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,740
impact my choice when I&#39;m considering relative desirability.

27
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,500
What if one doesn&#39;t have an easy access route, but is closer to my home?

28
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,310
What if the other doesn&#39;t have a ready stream of people who may pass by, on whom I can commit

29
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,950
my crime?

30
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,560
What if the other has too many people so I might get caught?

31
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,860
All of these aspects come to bear on my choice of crime site and these may be unknown when

32
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,530
looking at where I committed my crime and trying to make some sensible inference about

33
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,560
where my base is. This is where the importance of mental schemata or mental maps

34
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,980
comes into play. Now these are internal representations of an area and reflect how the person typically

35
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,580
interacts with their environment.

36
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,120
So aspects highlighted as significant in the area will vary depending on how you interact

37
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,890
with that particular area. For example, a car driver may have a very different mental

38
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:21,810
map of a city centre than someone who routinely uses public transport. Similarly, as Canter

39
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,470
and Youngs in 2002  noted &#39;experience shapes understanding of places which in turn

40
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,900
influences where a person does what.&#39;

41
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,620
So in the context of an offender, where they commit their crime is not random. For example,

42
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,820
offenders choose areas where familiarity of some sort, through being close to home, related

43
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,990
to work or leisure activities, leads them to feeling &#39;safe&#39; to commit their crime

44
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:51,620
there. But as Canter and Youngs in 2008 pointed out, this may not simply be a passive learning

45
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,990
of opportunity through engaging in &#39;routine activity&#39;. Rather, this feeling of safety

46
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:01,310
might come about through seeing possibilities and, if you like, &#39;testing&#39; the area or

47
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:07,200
deliberately interacting with the area to build up the necessary mental maps or schemata.

48
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,709
That is, if you like, seeing what is possible in an area they are becoming increasingly

49
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:15,620
familiar with and increasingly feel safe in.

50
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,239
Now in terms of practical applications the centrality of the base for an offender was

51
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:24,960
used by Canter &amp; Larkin in 1993 to propose two types of offending which was directly

52
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,069
linked to the degree that the offender is tied to their home in their offending. So

53
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:35,069
a marauder is someone who uses his or her home location as a base. So the hypothesis

54
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:40,180
here is, if you can identify the two offences that are furthest away from each other and

55
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,870
that you are sure have been committed by the same person, you can draw a cycle around them

56
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,279
and then the perpetrator&#39;s home will be somewhere in that circle.

57
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:54,189
The alternative type of offender is the commuter. Someone who leaves their home and commutes

58
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:59,449
to a different region in which to offend. So this is useful if you can determine whether

59
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:03,139
you&#39;re dealing with a marauder or commuter, but that of course raises the question of

60
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:08,330
how could you know this at the outset? While Canter and Larkin in a 1993 analysis said

61
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:14,259
that 87% of offenders were marauders; subsequent studies have found some variability by crime

62
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:21,259
and by country. So for example, Meaney (2004) found that only 35% of burglars in a state

63
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:28,129
in Australia were marauders, whereas 93% of sex offenders in the same state were marauders.

64
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:32,509
Drawing on research by Warren and colleagues and Lundrigan and Canter, Canter and Youngs

65
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:37,400
noted that commuters tend to commit their crimes geographically closer together while

66
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,370
marauders will, in contrast, spread out across the area in which they commit their crime.

67
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:47,520
And so looking at the distance over which crimes are being committed may give some practical

68
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,580
insight into whether your offender is a commuter or marauder. However, just like the least

69
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,370
effort and distance decay principles, there are some complications in this differentiation

70
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,240
between marauders and commuters. First, it may not apply if there are other contextual

71
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,069
features of the crime at play. For example, the need to have a particular type of victim

72
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:10,800
who can only be found in discrete locations.

73
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,059
A more general complication is that you need to be fairly certain that all the crimes you&#39;re

74
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:19,740
looking at have been committed by the same person. And this can be tricky, particularly

75
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,789
if the perpetrator&#39;s mode of offending is evolving as they commit their crimes. In addition,

76
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:29,719
you also need to be sure that you have captured in your analysis the majority of crimes committed

77
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:34,520
by that particular offender. If you have not, then there is the potential that you will

78
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,729
have some spatial bias in your sampling and this will distort the conclusions that you

79
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:42,699
can draw from your analysis.

80
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:46,990
Now despite the potential problems with some of the logic in geographical profiling, computer

81
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:52,129
programs to assist with the process have been developed. The various programs differ somewhat

82
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:56,839
in terms of calculations, cost, interface and output, and some, to a degree, can be

83
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:02,259
customised to the area in which they are applied. Based on the geographical distribution of

84
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:08,229
crimes, these programs show which geographical areas to prioritize in investigations. Further,

85
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:12,559
these programs allow investigators to explore the impact of any given case on the highlighted

86
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:18,449
prioritization map. So for example, as an investigating officer if you&#39;re not sure

87
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:23,059
whether case X has actually been committed by the same individual as cases A, B and C,

88
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:27,770
you can explore the impact on the geographical map by omitting case X from your analysis.

89
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:32,610
However, a general limitation that applies to these programs is that they can only be

90
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:38,169
as good as the input. So, for example, Rossmo in 2000 suggested that you needed five distinct

91
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:43,169
but accurate locations and you assume the offender hasn&#39;t moved residence in the time

92
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:47,499
and you&#39;re fairly confident that it is the same offender. And this may be problematic

93
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:51,189
if you are dealing with an offender whose offence pattern is escalating as their fantasies

94
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:57,460
that may be associated with the offending evolve. So in practice, geographical profiling,

95
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,499
like offender profiling more generally, may not be seen as adding anything to investigations

96
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:05,660
if investigators feel that their existing methods are at least as good.
