00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,123


2
00:00:04,123 --> 00:00:06,039
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER:
Architecture is a language.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,519
And you know how when you
learn a new vocabulary word,

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,089
you start to notice it, for
the first time, everywhere?

5
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:13,580
Well, the same thing
happens with architecture.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,970
When you learn a new
architectural form,

7
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,297
you start to see it everywhere.

8
00:00:17,297 --> 00:00:18,879
DR. BETH HARRIS: And
that's especially

9
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,009
true of the classical orders.

10
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,980
Because these are
what are, essentially,

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,199
the building blocks of
Western Architecture.

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,544
And they've been
used for 2,500 years.

13
00:00:27,544 --> 00:00:28,960
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER:
We're basically

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,160
talking about styles
of architecture

15
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,520
that the ancient Greeks
had developed mostly

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,580
for their temples.

17
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:36,860
And you're right, that
we've continued to use.

18
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,359
DR. BETH HARRIS: And we've got
several contemporary examples

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:40,426
up along the top.

20
00:00:40,426 --> 00:00:42,550
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: But
what's important to remember

21
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:45,409
is that it's just a
fancy dressing, really,

22
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:48,549
of a basic, ancient
building system.

23
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,549
DR. BETH HARRIS: So we've
brought in Stonehenge,

24
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:53,409
to illustrate that ancient,
building system called

25
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:55,669
post and lintel architecture.

26
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,079
This is the most fundamental,
most basic, oldest kind

27
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,809
of architectural system.

28
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,140
The posts are the
vertical elements

29
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,759
and they support a horizontal
element called a lintel.

30
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:09,299
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER:
And you know what?

31
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,299
We still use this
basic system when

32
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:13,546
we nail two-by-fours together.

33
00:01:13,546 --> 00:01:15,129
And that's what the
Greeks were doing.

34
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:17,338
But they were doing in a
much more sophisticated way.

35
00:01:17,338 --> 00:01:18,295
DR. BETH HARRIS: Right.

36
00:01:18,296 --> 00:01:20,096
They developed
decorative systems.

37
00:01:20,096 --> 00:01:21,719
And that's what we're
referring to when

38
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:24,019
we use the term
classical orders.

39
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:27,599
There are three basic
orders, the Doric, the Ionic,

40
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:28,549
and the Corinthian.

41
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:29,869
There's a couple
extra, but we're not

42
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,890
going to go into those today.

43
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,347
But we've listed
them here for you,

44
00:01:32,347 --> 00:01:34,989
just so you know what they are,
the Tuscan and the Composite.

45
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:37,469
So the Doric and
Ionic and Corinthian

46
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:39,750
are illustrated,
here, in this diagram.

47
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,459
First the Doric, and the
Ionic, and then, the last two

48
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:44,459
are Corinthian.

49
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:48,000
These are just slight variations
of these three orders.

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,790
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: And the
Doric is really the most simple.

51
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,359
The Ionic, a little
bit more complicated.

52
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,527
And then, the Corinthian,
completely out of control.

53
00:01:55,527 --> 00:01:57,483
DR. BETH HARRIS: So let's
start with the oldest

54
00:01:57,483 --> 00:01:58,809
order, the Doric order.

55
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,393
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER:
Right, and we think

56
00:02:00,393 --> 00:02:02,840
that this order began
in the seventh century,

57
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,750
on the mainland in Greece.

58
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,810
And we're looking at
an actual Greek temple

59
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,460
that happens to be in Italy.

60
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,860
But nevertheless, is
just a great example

61
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,690
of the Doric in
the classical era.

62
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:16,400
DR. BETH HARRIS: Let's start
at the top, with the pediment.

63
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,969
The pediment isn't,
officially, part of the order.

64
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:22,280
But since Greek
temples had, at one end

65
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,270
or the other, a
pediment, we just

66
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,909
thought we would
name that for you.

67
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:28,568
And that's that triangular space
at the very top of the temple.

68
00:02:28,568 --> 00:02:29,609
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Right.

69
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,144
These are gabled roofs.

70
00:02:31,144 --> 00:02:33,060
Sometimes they would be
filled with sculpture.

71
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,539
DR. BETH HARRIS: The next
area, below the pediment,

72
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:38,349
is actually, officially
part of the order.

73
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:40,489
And that's called
the entablature.

74
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,990
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER:
OK, so that would

75
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,120
be the area from
about here to here.

76
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,390
DR. BETH HARRIS: And the
top part of the entablature

77
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:47,689
is called the frieze.

78
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:51,812
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: OK, so
only this part, right here,

79
00:02:51,812 --> 00:02:52,770
is known as the frieze.

80
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,580
So in other words,
this whole section.

81
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,538
DR. BETH HARRIS: Right,
and in the Doric order,

82
00:02:56,538 --> 00:02:59,780
it is decorated in a
very specific way, using

83
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,697
triglyphs and metopes.

84
00:03:00,697 --> 00:03:02,070
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER:
Now, actually,

85
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,620
if you look at
the word triglyph,

86
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,879
you'll notice that
the prefix is tri.

87
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,840
Just like tricycle,
it means three.

88
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,170
And its suffix,
glyph, means mark.

89
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:13,879
So a triglyph, literally,
means three marks.

90
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:17,079
And you can see patterns of
three marks moving all the way

91
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,740
across the frieze.

92
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,890
DR. BETH HARRIS: And then,
in between the triglyphs

93
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:23,629
are spaces that
are called metopes.

94
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:25,460
And in ancient
Greek architecture,

95
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,175
these were often
filled with sculpture.

96
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:29,300
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Now the
triglyphs we don't think

97
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,490
are just arbitrary.

98
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,060
We think that they
probably came from a time

99
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,159
when temples were
built out of wood.

100
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,750
And these would
have been the ends

101
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,250
of planks that would
have functioned

102
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,960
as beams in the temple.

103
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,330
And they would have, of
course, been supported directly

104
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,140
over the columns.

105
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:46,189
You'll notice that every
other one, at least,

106
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:48,550
is aligned directly
over the columns.

107
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,280
DR. BETH HARRIS: So as
we move down the temple,

108
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,322
the next area we come
to is the Capital.

109
00:03:53,322 --> 00:03:55,280
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: And
this is a Doric capital.

110
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,530
It's very simple.

111
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,069
It's got a flare.

112
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:01,150
And then it's got a
simple slab on top.

113
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,920
DR. BETH HARRIS: So the Doric
is the oldest, and most severe,

114
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,089
and was associated, according
to the ancient Roman

115
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:12,129
architectural historian,
Vitruvius, most masculine form.

116
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:15,210
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: It
is broad, it's not tall,

117
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,658
and it feels heavy.

118
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:17,699
DR. BETH HARRIS: It does.

119
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,659
As we continue to move
down, we come to the area

120
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,910
that we commonly call the
column but art historians

121
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,150
call the shaft.

122
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:26,940
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: And
if you look closely,

123
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,069
you can see that it
is not entirely plain.

124
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,889
There are, actually,
vertical lines

125
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:34,039
that move across the entire
surface known as flutes.

126
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,750
Now, in the Doric, a
flute is very shallow.

127
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,319
And really, what it is,
is it's a kind of scallop

128
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,909
that's been carved
out the surface.

129
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,660
DR. BETH HARRIS: And
what fluting does is,

130
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,050
it creates a nice,
vertical, decorative pattern

131
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:46,838
along the shaft.

132
00:04:46,838 --> 00:04:49,254
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Now, one
of the other defining features

133
00:04:49,254 --> 00:04:52,959
of the Doric order is that,
at the bottom of the shaft,

134
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,889
there is no decorative foot.

135
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:57,519
The shaft of the
column goes straight

136
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,176
into the floor of the temple.

137
00:04:59,177 --> 00:05:01,010
DR. BETH HARRIS: And
you can see that really

138
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,259
well in the detail on the
lower right, where there

139
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,379
is no molding there
to make a transition.

140
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:10,935
So let's have a look at what
these look like in person.

141
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,560
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER:
Capitals are up high

142
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,980
so we would never see
a person next to them.

143
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,319
But I think it's easy to not
realize just how big they.

144
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:19,709
But I snapped this
terrific picture of you

145
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:23,359
at the British Museum next to
a capital that actually comes

146
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,170
from the most
famous Doric temple,

147
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,547
on the Acropolis in Athens.

148
00:05:27,547 --> 00:05:29,130
DR. BETH HARRIS:
Right, the Parthenon.

149
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,199
And they really are massive.

150
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,159
And this photo is good,
also, for seeing--

151
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,439
in this case, a
reconstruction-- but giving you

152
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,930
a sense of the entablature
with that frieze with triglyphs

153
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,709
and metopes.

154
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:45,120
And we've got an
example, on the right,

155
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,649
of a relief sculpture
that was for one

156
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:49,129
of the metopes on the Parthenon.

157
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:51,088
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Right,
so this metope, here,

158
00:05:51,088 --> 00:05:54,040
would have actually fit right
in one of these squares.

159
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,230
DR. BETH HARRIS: Let's
talk about one last element

160
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,090
that we find in
Doric architecture.

161
00:05:58,089 --> 00:05:59,589
And that's something
called entasis.

162
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:01,589
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Now,
this is a little tricky.

163
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:03,199
Because I think
most people assume

164
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,639
that a column is
straight up and down.

165
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,149
That is, the sides of a column
are parallel with each other,

166
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:12,500
and the base of a column
is just as wide as the area

167
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,439
directly below the capitol.

168
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:16,819
But in fact, the
ancient Greeks didn't

169
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:18,166
build their temples that way.

170
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,000
DR. BETH HARRIS: No.

171
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,759
It's fascinating to
think about all the ways

172
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,259
that the ancient
Greeks are thinking

173
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:25,589
about how to make their
buildings beautiful,

174
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:28,479
and speak of the
realm of the gods.

175
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,069
And so, when we look at
an ancient Doric temple,

176
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:36,649
we see that the shafts swell a
little bit toward the center.

177
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:39,259
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: So right
about a third of the way down,

178
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:41,430
they would be at their widest.

179
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,449
And it would taper, ever so
slightly, towards the bottom,

180
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:49,469
and taper much more so
as we move up the top.

181
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,410
So that the narrowest
point of the column shaft

182
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,860
would be right at the top.

183
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,150
And the widest part
would be about one third

184
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:58,628
of the way from the base.

185
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:00,170
DR. BETH HARRIS:
And so, the building

186
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,390
has a sense of
liveliness that I think

187
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:05,409
it wouldn't have if
the column was exactly

188
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,201
the same width at the
top as at the bottom.

189
00:07:07,201 --> 00:07:08,992
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER:
Architectural historians

190
00:07:08,992 --> 00:07:11,709
have debated why the
Greeks bothered to do this.

191
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:13,329
Because this was expensive.

192
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:14,529
This was difficult.

193
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:18,000
It meant that every drum
that makes up this column

194
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,649
has to be an individual,
unique piece.

195
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,500
These could not be
mass-measured and mass-produced.

196
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
DR. BETH HARRIS: So you
just used the word drum.

197
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,959
So the columns
are not, actually,

198
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,251
carved from one piece of stone.

199
00:07:29,252 --> 00:07:31,293
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: And if
you look very carefully

200
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:33,420
at this photograph,
you can just make out

201
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,639
the seams between those drums.

202
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,180
They would, also,
have generally been

203
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,030
a hole that would have gone
through the center of each

204
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:42,229
of these pieces.

205
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,860
So that a piece of wood,
sometimes, would actually

206
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,870
string them together, almost
like beads on a necklace.

207
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,810
One of the other things
that entasis does

208
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,860
is to emphasize the
verticality of the temple.

209
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,569
Because they get narrower
as they go further up,

210
00:07:57,569 --> 00:07:59,899
it seems as if the
shaft of the column

211
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:02,069
might actually be taller
than it really is.

212
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:04,290
Because of course, as
things move away from us,

213
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,374
they get smaller in scale.

214
00:08:05,374 --> 00:08:06,790
DR. BETH HARRIS:
So the Greeks are

215
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,640
thinking about human perception.

216
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,629
They're thinking
about how we see,

217
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:14,449
not just an abstract idea
of math and geometry,

218
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:16,139
but actually, human
experience, which

219
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:18,110
says something about
ancient Greek culture.

220
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,609
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER:
One last detail--

221
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:21,949
the entasis gives the
shaft of the column

222
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:25,800
a sense of, almost,
elasticity, that it is bearing

223
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,520
the weight of the
stone above it.

224
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,389
DR. BETH HARRIS: It's really
fascinating to think about all

225
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:32,100
of these decisions
that the Greeks

226
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,808
are making as they build.

227
00:08:33,808 --> 00:08:36,629
So let's look at the Ionic
order, which emerges shortly

228
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:38,519
after the Doric order.

229
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,418
Here's another building
of the Acropolis,

230
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:41,840
this is the Erechtheion.

231
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,158
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: This is
such a different aesthetic.

232
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:46,120
There's such a sense
of delicacy here.

233
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,500
There is not that sense of mass,
that sense of the muscularity

234
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,059
of the buildings that we
associate with the Doric.

235
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:54,629
DR. BETH HARRIS: And in fact,
Vitruvius the ancient Roman

236
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:56,470
architectural
historian, saw this

237
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,740
as a more feminine order--
it's taller, it's thinner.

238
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,529
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Now, one of
the columns from this building

239
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:05,819
in Greece is in the
museum in London.

240
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,320
We have some good
photographs of it.

241
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,778
DR. BETH HARRIS: And you can
see the distinguishing feature

242
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:12,120
really is at the top,
at the capital, where

243
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,060
we see these scroll-like
shapes, also known as volutes.

244
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:21,139
We also see a slightly
different type of fluting.

245
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:23,639
And we also,
importantly see a base.

246
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,899
Let's move to the
Corinthian order.

247
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,350
This looks really different
and is the most decorative.

248
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,180
And the distinguishing
feature here

249
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:34,959
is, again, the capital, where
we see leaf-like shapes.

250
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,759
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER:
They also have bases.

251
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:39,980
They tend to be taller than
the Doric, just like the Ionic.

252
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,180
But they are highly decorative.

253
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:45,349
There's a great myth about
the origin of the Corinthian

254
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,980
capital.

255
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,730
DR. BETH HARRIS: It's
a kind of fun story.

256
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,779
Of course, we have no
idea whether this is true.

257
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:53,120
But the story is that there
was a young girl who died.

258
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,750
And her possessions
were placed in a basket

259
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,330
and put on top of her grave.

260
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,940
Underneath that basket
was a acanthus plant that

261
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,130
began to grow.

262
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:04,689
And because the heavy
basket with the tile on top

263
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,122
was on top, the acanthus
leaves grew out the side.

264
00:10:08,121 --> 00:10:10,579
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Well, if we
look at a Corinthian column,

265
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,940
it really does look like that.

266
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,480
DR. BETH HARRIS: It
looks exactly like that.

267
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,210
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: And so, it's
a great myth, whether or not

268
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,230
it's true.

269
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,399
So the Corinthian order
is the most complex.

270
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,549
It includes both
the scroll, that we

271
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:22,001
would expect to
see in the Ionic.

272
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:23,209
DR. BETH HARRIS: The volutes.

273
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,251
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Right.

274
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,100
But also these very
complex leaf-like

275
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,889
forms, which you
can just make out

276
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:30,490
here, which is actually
from the acanthus leaf.

277
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,539
And we have a photograph of an
acanthus leaf right down there.

278
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:35,831
DR. BETH HARRIS: And these
grow wild so it makes sense.

279
00:10:35,831 --> 00:10:37,914
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: What's
important to remember is

280
00:10:37,914 --> 00:10:40,189
that the ancient Greeks,
although they developed

281
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,030
these three classical orders,
were just the genesis.

282
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:46,399
The Romans took
these ideas over.

283
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,929
And then, subsequently,
people who've

284
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:50,879
looked back to the
classical tradition

285
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:53,120
have borrowed from
them yet again.

286
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,600
And we still do this today.

287
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,830
And there you have it.

288
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,509
The Greek orders.

289
00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:07,269
