1
00:00:04,793 --> 00:00:06,518
- [Steven] Throughout history in the West,

2
00:00:06,517 --> 00:00:08,583
there's this tension, this conflict

3
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:11,648
between naturalism and abstraction.

4
00:00:11,648 --> 00:00:12,856
And it goes back and forth.

5
00:00:12,856 --> 00:00:14,663
- [Beth] So what we
wanted to do in this video

6
00:00:14,663 --> 00:00:17,115
is trace some of that tension.

7
00:00:17,115 --> 00:00:18,309
We're going to begin by looking

8
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,794
at an ancient Roman copy
of a Greek sculpture.

9
00:00:20,794 --> 00:00:22,280
So we're going back to the period

10
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,743
of classical antiquity.

11
00:00:23,742 --> 00:00:26,574
The period when ancient
Greece and then ancient Rome

12
00:00:26,574 --> 00:00:28,641
dominated the Mediterranean,

13
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:30,684
and dominated European culture.

14
00:00:30,684 --> 00:00:31,644
- [Steven] This is a sculpture

15
00:00:31,644 --> 00:00:33,238
by an artist named Polykleitos.

16
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:34,442
It's called the Doryphoros,

17
00:00:34,442 --> 00:00:36,512
which just means the spear bearer.

18
00:00:36,512 --> 00:00:38,463
He would have originally held a spear.

19
00:00:38,463 --> 00:00:39,647
But the reason we're looking at it,

20
00:00:39,648 --> 00:00:42,632
is it's just this amazing representation

21
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:44,655
of the human body, in a position

22
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:45,987
that we call contrapposto.

23
00:00:45,987 --> 00:00:49,539
- [Beth] It's incredibly
naturalistic or realistic.

24
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:51,861
Naturalism is word that art
historians use all the time

25
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,601
to talk about the way that something looks

26
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:55,227
close to nature.

27
00:00:55,228 --> 00:00:57,759
Similar to what we see
in the world around us.

28
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,710
- [Steven] And in this case,

29
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,753
we're looking at the proportions.

30
00:01:00,753 --> 00:01:03,632
The understanding of the
contours of the body,

31
00:01:03,633 --> 00:01:05,465
of the muscles of the body.

32
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:08,764
An understanding of the
bones under the flesh.

33
00:01:08,763 --> 00:01:11,155
- [Beth] And how the body moves in space

34
00:01:11,156 --> 00:01:13,849
and how it distributes weight as it moves.

35
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:15,846
And how that weight
shifts as the body moves.

36
00:01:15,846 --> 00:01:18,679
This is a complicated
understanding of the body,

37
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:21,581
that gets translated into
this marble sculpture.

38
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,764
That looks so life like,
we almost expect it

39
00:01:23,763 --> 00:01:25,226
to move and talk to us.

40
00:01:25,227 --> 00:01:26,713
- [Steven] Now clearly this was made

41
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:29,185
by somebody who cared a lot about

42
00:01:29,186 --> 00:01:31,171
what the human body looked like,

43
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:33,887
about the mechanics of the human body.

44
00:01:33,887 --> 00:01:37,576
This is based on careful
direct observation.

45
00:01:37,576 --> 00:01:39,897
And so here we have not only an artist

46
00:01:39,897 --> 00:01:42,338
but a culture that cared about science,

47
00:01:42,338 --> 00:01:44,638
that cared about human potential.

48
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:45,892
- [Beth] And so those are good ways

49
00:01:45,891 --> 00:01:48,421
to describe the culture of
ancient Greece and Rome.

50
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:50,813
- [Steven] So let's fast
forward more than 1500 years

51
00:01:50,813 --> 00:01:53,181
and to the town of Chartres,
just south of Paris,

52
00:01:53,182 --> 00:01:54,343
to a huge cathedral.

53
00:01:54,343 --> 00:01:55,667
And on the front of that cathedral

54
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:58,591
are some very highly stylized figures

55
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:00,539
that we call jamb figures.

56
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:02,591
- [Beth] These are
attached to architecture.

57
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,903
So immediately we notice
a significant change

58
00:02:04,903 --> 00:02:06,158
from the Doryphoros.

59
00:02:06,158 --> 00:02:08,967
The Doryphoros, the spear
bearer, was free-standing.

60
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:10,941
In other words, we could walk around him.

61
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:12,891
And that's important
because when the sculptor

62
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:14,284
thought about rendering him,

63
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:15,514
he thought about what it would look like

64
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:16,838
from all points of view.

65
00:02:16,838 --> 00:02:18,254
But when you're sculpting something

66
00:02:18,254 --> 00:02:20,181
that's attached to the architecture,

67
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,923
in this case to columns,

68
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:23,641
the medieval sculpture,
because here we are

69
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:24,686
in the Middle Ages.

70
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:26,335
The sculptor thought about making

71
00:02:26,335 --> 00:02:29,682
the figures match the columns behind.

72
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:32,046
So the figures are tall and elongated,

73
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:33,695
like the columns behind them.

74
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,925
- [Steven] When look at the Doryphoros,

75
00:02:34,925 --> 00:02:37,317
we get a sense of a man
who's really walking.

76
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:40,847
Here we look at figures
that are not really

77
00:02:40,847 --> 00:02:42,031
in our world.

78
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:45,979
They are high above us,
they are otherworldly.

79
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:47,465
And they're not looking at us,

80
00:02:47,465 --> 00:02:49,276
they're not noticing things around them.

81
00:02:49,276 --> 00:02:51,481
They are symbols of the human body.

82
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:53,780
- [Beth] We can say that
they're transcendent.

83
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,775
That they transcend earthly existence.

84
00:02:56,775 --> 00:02:58,912
After the fall of the Roman Empire,

85
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,514
what happens in Western Europe

86
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,346
is the ascendance of Christianity.

87
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:05,366
- [Steven] The human
body was less important

88
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:06,644
than the spiritual sense.

89
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,963
And so, the Christian art
often in the medieval period

90
00:03:09,963 --> 00:03:12,889
focused on ways of abstracting the body

91
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:15,397
to create a symbol of the spirit,

92
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:18,137
which of course by definition has no form.

93
00:03:18,137 --> 00:03:20,900
And so, it's not a surprise
that Christian artists

94
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,454
then turned to this kind
of abstracted rendering.

95
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,521
- [Beth] So what do we mean by abstracted.

96
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,127
Well first of all the figures

97
00:03:27,127 --> 00:03:29,026
are tall and elongated like columns.

98
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:33,275
They don't resemble a body,
so much as a columnar shape.

99
00:03:33,276 --> 00:03:36,054
You could also notice that
when we look at the drapery,

100
00:03:36,054 --> 00:03:38,663
the clothing that covers the figures,

101
00:03:38,663 --> 00:03:40,597
we don't have much of a sense

102
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:42,531
of the body underneath the drapery.

103
00:03:42,531 --> 00:03:44,467
- [Steven] Instead there's
a real focus on pattern.

104
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:46,046
And you see that in the drapery,

105
00:03:46,045 --> 00:03:50,283
you also see it in the platforms
directly below the figures.

106
00:03:50,283 --> 00:03:53,127
So there's this equating
perhaps of decorative beauty

107
00:03:53,127 --> 00:03:54,543
with the spiritual.

108
00:03:54,544 --> 00:03:56,146
- [Beth] Those decorative forms we can see

109
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:58,537
in the beautiful wavy lines at the bottoms

110
00:03:58,538 --> 00:03:59,560
of their drapery.

111
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,346
We could also say that these
figures lack a sense of weight.

112
00:04:02,346 --> 00:04:04,527
One of the things about
being a human being

113
00:04:04,527 --> 00:04:06,131
is that we have bodies.

114
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:09,149
We move through space
and we have weight to us.

115
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:11,842
And we sense that when we
look at the Doryphoros.

116
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:14,095
He stands firmly on the
ground, he moves through space.

117
00:04:14,094 --> 00:04:18,064
But these figures have feet
that point slightly down.

118
00:04:18,064 --> 00:04:21,060
There's no way they could
really stand in this way.

119
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,220
And so they have a
sense of weightlessness,

120
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,562
that I think matches their
abstract transcendent qualities.

121
00:04:27,562 --> 00:04:29,187
- [Steven] Well also just
look at the proportions

122
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:29,930
of the bodies.

123
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,136
Look at the length of their legs compared

124
00:04:32,136 --> 00:04:34,504
to the length of their
torsos or their heads.

125
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:36,501
There's nothing naturalistic about this.

126
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,474
They are so elongated.

127
00:04:38,475 --> 00:04:42,165
But are these less beautiful,
are they less well done

128
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:43,605
then the Doryphoros?

129
00:04:43,605 --> 00:04:46,252
They're just different,
the goals were different.

130
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,459
- [Beth] It's not that
the artist is less skilled

131
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:51,360
or somehow wanted to make the Doryphoros

132
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,798
but ended up making these figures

133
00:04:53,798 --> 00:04:55,656
on the outside of Chartres Cathedral.

134
00:04:55,656 --> 00:04:59,510
These were an expression of the deep faith

135
00:04:59,511 --> 00:05:01,229
of the people of the Middle Ages.

136
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:03,788
- [Steven] And so the
Doryphoros and the figures

137
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:05,849
at Chartres are both spectacular

138
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:06,918
but they are both responding

139
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:09,401
to very different cultural needs.

140
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:11,305
- [Beth] We can see that again

141
00:05:11,305 --> 00:05:13,093
when we move to the Renaissance.

142
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:16,158
Now we're looking about
200 years or so later,

143
00:05:16,158 --> 00:05:18,356
at a sculpture by the great

144
00:05:18,357 --> 00:05:20,826
Italian Renaissance sculptor, Donatello.

145
00:05:20,826 --> 00:05:23,612
And here we are in the early
Renaissance in Florence

146
00:05:23,612 --> 00:05:26,561
and boy do we see how the
artists of the Renaissance

147
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,041
are looking back, not to
the figures on the cathedral

148
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:34,733
from the MIddle Ages, but
rather to ancient Greek

149
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:36,335
and Roman art, like the Doryphoros.

150
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,519
- [Steven] Note that
Donatello has stripped off

151
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,538
virtually every stitch of clothing,

152
00:05:40,538 --> 00:05:42,279
just like the Doryphoros.

153
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:44,601
This is not a rendering that is concerned

154
00:05:44,601 --> 00:05:46,343
with the patterning of drapery.

155
00:05:46,343 --> 00:05:48,762
This is about the mechanics and the beauty

156
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:49,757
of the human body.

157
00:05:49,757 --> 00:05:51,011
- [Beth] Very much like the Doryphoros.

158
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:54,225
Now we should say that
Donatello's not specifically

159
00:05:54,225 --> 00:05:56,257
looking back at the sculptures of Chartres

160
00:05:56,257 --> 00:05:57,209
and rejecting them.

161
00:05:57,209 --> 00:05:59,555
He's rejecting the ways that the artists

162
00:05:59,555 --> 00:06:02,458
of the Middle Ages
approached the human body.

163
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,639
- [Steven] And in doing so,
Donatello is really embodying

164
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,311
the idea of the Renaissance.

165
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,235
Renaissance is a French
word which means rebirth.

166
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:12,418
And it refers to a renewed interest

167
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:13,927
in classical humanism.

168
00:06:13,927 --> 00:06:16,574
In this case, the rendering
of the human body.

169
00:06:16,574 --> 00:06:18,640
- [Beth] And a big part of the humanism

170
00:06:18,641 --> 00:06:20,197
of the Renaissance is
also just an interest

171
00:06:20,197 --> 00:06:21,985
in the secular world.

172
00:06:21,985 --> 00:06:23,750
An interest in the natural world.

173
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,211
And art once again, becomes based

174
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:28,672
on observation of the visual world.

175
00:06:28,672 --> 00:06:30,064
- [Steven] So the story is complicated.

176
00:06:30,064 --> 00:06:31,923
In the Renaissance, we have a return

177
00:06:31,923 --> 00:06:34,175
to an earlier kind of naturalism.

178
00:06:34,175 --> 00:06:36,125
And it gets even more complicated

179
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,797
when you move into the modern world,

180
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,438
where artists can choose between

181
00:06:40,437 --> 00:06:43,901
naturalism and abstraction
or any variant in between.

182
00:06:43,901 --> 00:06:45,353
And a great example of that

183
00:06:45,353 --> 00:06:48,105
is the 20th century artist, Giacometti.

184
00:06:48,105 --> 00:06:50,497
- [Beth] Giacometti had at his disposal

185
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:52,726
a world of reproductions.

186
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:55,373
In the 20th century, we
have images around us.

187
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,439
We have a perspective on history

188
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,343
that wasn't available to many generations

189
00:07:00,343 --> 00:07:02,107
and centuries of artists before.

190
00:07:02,107 --> 00:07:04,592
- [Steven] So when Giacometti
renders the human body,

191
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,383
he's not seeking fidelity to nature.

192
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:09,629
He's not trying to solve the problems

193
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,671
that Polykleitos, the
sculptor of the Doryphoros

194
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:13,787
was trying to solve.

195
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:15,875
He can do that, he knows this is something

196
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:16,943
that we're capable of.

197
00:07:16,944 --> 00:07:19,040
Instead, he's looking for
something more emotive,

198
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,822
something perhaps more philosophical.

199
00:07:20,822 --> 00:07:24,766
He's looking to make that
body symbolize something.

200
00:07:24,766 --> 00:07:27,718
And in some ways, he is closer
to Chartres as a result.

201
00:07:27,718 --> 00:07:30,342
But he also knows what
the Renaissance did,

202
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:32,175
he knows what the classical world has done

203
00:07:32,175 --> 00:07:34,800
and he's making very conscious decisions.

204
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,472
- [Beth] Giacometti's
sculpting in the period

205
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:38,305
after World War II.

206
00:07:38,305 --> 00:07:39,907
There are many reasons why Giacometti

207
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:42,346
choose to return to this
kind of abstraction.

208
00:07:42,346 --> 00:07:44,877
But, you know what,
that's probably a subject

209
00:07:44,877 --> 00:07:47,057
