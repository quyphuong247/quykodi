1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,017
(piano music)

2
00:00:03,017 --> 00:00:03,663
- [Voiceover] We're at the

3
00:00:03,664 --> 00:00:04,851
Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum

4
00:00:04,851 --> 00:00:05,551
in New York City.

5
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:07,216
- [Voiceover] We're in
the Templo Mayor Museum,

6
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:09,552
the main temple of the Aztecs.

7
00:00:09,553 --> 00:00:10,951
- [Voiceover] We're in the Mauritshuis,

8
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:11,852
in The Hague.

9
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:12,884
- [Voiceover] We've just walked up

10
00:00:12,884 --> 00:00:14,519
a very steep hill.

11
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:15,584
- [Voiceover] In the American Museum

12
00:00:15,585 --> 00:00:16,387
of National History.

13
00:00:16,387 --> 00:00:18,419
- [Voiceover] In the Basilica of San Zeno.

14
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:19,753
- [Voiceover] At the top of the Acropolis

15
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:20,620
in Athens.

16
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,044
- [Voiceover] I'm standing inside

17
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:23,451
of the RÃ¼stem Pasha Mosque

18
00:00:23,451 --> 00:00:24,885
here in Istanbul.

19
00:00:24,885 --> 00:00:25,952
- [Voiceover] You didn't even have

20
00:00:25,952 --> 00:00:26,985
to tell me it was a god.

21
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:28,317
He's so powerful.

22
00:00:28,318 --> 00:00:30,286
He looks so in control.

23
00:00:30,286 --> 00:00:32,185
- [Voiceover] We're now flying low

24
00:00:32,185 --> 00:00:33,052
over the city,

25
00:00:33,052 --> 00:00:34,019
over the Tiber.

26
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,052
- [Voiceover] It's a good place to start

27
00:00:35,051 --> 00:00:37,134
because the Tiber does divide Rome

28
00:00:37,134 --> 00:00:37,908
into two parts.

29
00:00:37,908 --> 00:00:39,157
- [Voiceover] This is a great example

30
00:00:39,156 --> 00:00:42,017
of late Byzantine work.

31
00:00:42,018 --> 00:00:43,285
It might even remind us

32
00:00:43,284 --> 00:00:45,451
of what's going on in
Italy at the same time

33
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:46,951
with artists like Duccio.

34
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:48,083
- [Voiceover] Christ forms

35
00:00:48,084 --> 00:00:49,152
an equilateral triangle.

36
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,785
His head is in the center of a circle.

37
00:00:51,784 --> 00:00:53,817
The window that frames his head

38
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:55,184
reads as a halo.

39
00:00:55,185 --> 00:00:57,618
There's that calm center.

40
00:00:57,618 --> 00:00:59,318
And then, human beings

41
00:00:59,317 --> 00:01:00,784
with all of their faults

42
00:01:00,784 --> 00:01:02,753
and fears and worries

43
00:01:02,753 --> 00:01:04,784
around that divine center.

44
00:01:04,784 --> 00:01:06,384
- [Voiceover] The subtle shifts

45
00:01:06,385 --> 00:01:08,552
in the architecture of that face.

46
00:01:08,552 --> 00:01:09,952
I want to figure out

47
00:01:09,951 --> 00:01:11,518
how he's done it.

48
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:12,117
- [Voiceover] Her eyes

49
00:01:12,117 --> 00:01:13,152
are the most important part.

50
00:01:13,152 --> 00:01:15,218
She has the spiritualability almost

51
00:01:15,218 --> 00:01:16,483
of second sight.

52
00:01:16,483 --> 00:01:18,084
- [Voiceover] What did
the work of art mean

53
00:01:18,084 --> 00:01:18,850
to the artist,

54
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,018
what did it mean to the culture

55
00:01:20,018 --> 00:01:21,552
for which it was originally made,

56
00:01:21,552 --> 00:01:23,252
and how did that meaning change

57
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:24,584
up to the present moment?

58
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,217
- [Voiceover] After the completion

59
00:01:26,218 --> 00:01:27,352
of this altar piece,

60
00:01:27,352 --> 00:01:29,484
it begins to influence architecture

61
00:01:29,484 --> 00:01:30,819
that is seen as,

62
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:32,984
they're expressing this new patriotism

63
00:01:32,983 --> 00:01:35,050
or, let's say, Creole nationalism.

64
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:36,150
- [Voiceover] This is an image of a king

65
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,384
who is also a god.

66
00:01:38,384 --> 00:01:42,918
(piano music)
