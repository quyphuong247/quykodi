1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,370
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,370
SPEAKER 1: So this is a
video about the elements

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,629
of linear perspective with
a little bit of history

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:09,370
thrown in.

5
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:11,113
SPEAKER 2: I love
linear perspective.

6
00:00:11,114 --> 00:00:13,280
SPEAKER 1: It's hard not
to love linear perspective.

7
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,275
It's like this magic formula.

8
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:17,149
SPEAKER 2: Well, look
what even Paolo Uccello

9
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:19,649
was able to do
just a few decades

10
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:22,321
after linear perspective
was first discovered.

11
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:23,779
SPEAKER 1: So linear
perspective is

12
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,740
a way of recreating the
three-dimensional world

13
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:29,179
on a two-dimensional surface.

14
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:31,109
And it's really accurate.

15
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:33,140
SPEAKER 2: Well, look
at this Paolo Uccello.

16
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,200
Look at this Study of a Chalice.

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,140
This wasn't done on a computer.

18
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,679
This was done with
pen and ink on paper.

19
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,679
SPEAKER 1: No Photoshop.

20
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:41,759
SPEAKER 2: No Photoshop.

21
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:42,879
SPEAKER 1: So let's
give a little bit

22
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,545
of historical background,
and then we'll

23
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:45,926
talk about how it's done.

24
00:00:45,926 --> 00:00:46,509
SPEAKER 2: OK.

25
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:49,126
So let's start first with
what the problem was.

26
00:00:49,127 --> 00:00:49,710
SPEAKER 1: OK.

27
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,125
So here we have a painting
from the early 1300s

28
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:55,299
by an artist named Duccio,
who's painting at Siena.

29
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:59,329
And you can see that Duccio's
interested in creating

30
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:03,269
an earthly space for his figure
of the Angel Gabriel and Mary,

31
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,557
but that the space
doesn't really make sense.

32
00:01:05,557 --> 00:01:06,140
SPEAKER 2: OK.

33
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,280
So what you're saying is that we
have kind of a real room here.

34
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,079
We can see the beams
in the ceiling.

35
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,510
We can see the architecture.

36
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,940
We can see the doors.

37
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:16,670
And so he's really interested
in putting these figures

38
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,739
in a real place.

39
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:20,339
The problem is-- and by the
way, don't get me wrong.

40
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,280
I love Duccio.

41
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,930
But the problem is
is that Duccio is not

42
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,460
constructing that
architectural space

43
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:28,899
in a way that looks
logical to our eye.

44
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,359
SPEAKER 1: And I
think it probably

45
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:32,109
wasn't a problem for Duccio.

46
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:35,290
But it was a problem for
artists about 100 years later

47
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,120
who had a different goal.

48
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,930
And their goal was a kind
of really accurate realism

49
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,117
on that flat surface.

50
00:01:42,117 --> 00:01:42,700
SPEAKER 2: OK.

51
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,320
But before we leave
the Duccio, let's

52
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,119
spend just a moment
being kind of unfair

53
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,162
and finding what's wrong.

54
00:01:48,162 --> 00:01:48,745
SPEAKER 1: OK.

55
00:01:48,745 --> 00:01:49,410
SPEAKER 2: OK.

56
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,640
So for one thing, the
beams of the ceiling right

57
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,299
up here don't agree
spatially with the seat

58
00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:00,870
that the Virgin Mary is on
or with this little stand

59
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,609
for the Bible that we see
here, or, for that matter,

60
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:05,349
with the lines that
are constructed

61
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:08,038
by the top of the capitals
of these balusters.

62
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,959
So none of this is
really making sense.

63
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,668
SPEAKER 1: Right.

64
00:02:10,668 --> 00:02:12,390
It's not a rational space.

65
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:15,099
And there's this
increasing interest

66
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:17,358
in the 1400s in rationalism.

67
00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:19,150
SPEAKER 2: That's the
period that we really

68
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,025
call the Renaissance.

69
00:02:20,025 --> 00:02:20,733
SPEAKER 1: Right.

70
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:21,730
The early Renaissance.

71
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:26,419
And so in Florence in 1420,
Brunelleschi-- and let's

72
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:27,869
put up a picture
of Brunelleschi.

73
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,453
SPEAKER 2: OK.

74
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:30,800
So he's right here,
Filippo Brunelleschi.

75
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,750
SPEAKER 1: And he discovers--
or some would say rediscovers,

76
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,860
because some think that
maybe the ancient Greeks

77
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,740
and Romans had this
before-- but he

78
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,150
discovers linear perspective.

79
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,599
SPEAKER 2: So he was a genius.

80
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,819
SPEAKER 1: He was
a Renaissance man.

81
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:43,840
SPEAKER 2: He was an architect.

82
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,700
He was an engineer.

83
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:45,939
He was a sculptor.

84
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:49,750
And according to tradition,
he had gone down to Rome,

85
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,949
and he was studying ancient
Roman buildings, ruins,

86
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:55,739
and he wanted to be able
to sketch them accurately.

87
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,860
And he developed this
system, linear perspective,

88
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,150
as a way of doing that.

89
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,129
SPEAKER 1: And in
1420 in Florence, he

90
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:03,389
demonstrated this system.

91
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:07,599
And 15 years later, another
brilliant Renaissance man,

92
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,299
Alberti, codified what
Brunelleschi had discovered.

93
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,719
He explained the system of
linear perspective for artists.

94
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:18,310
SPEAKER 2: So he publishes
a book called On Painting

95
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,469
in 1435, and we
have a later version

96
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:23,060
of that book right here.

97
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,490
And inside that book, he
really gives the formula

98
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,110
for linear perspective, and
that's what we have here.

99
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,720
So let's just spend
a moment talking

100
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,539
about how this system works.

101
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:34,169
SPEAKER 1: OK.

102
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:36,429
So let's go down here,
and let's actually

103
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,277
do a diagram of
linear perspective.

104
00:03:38,276 --> 00:03:38,859
SPEAKER 2: OK.

105
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,270
Now I cannot do Paolo
Uccello's chalice,

106
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,999
but I can draw a basic linear
perspectival structure.

107
00:03:44,998 --> 00:03:46,039
SPEAKER 1: OK, go for it.

108
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:46,289
SPEAKER 2: OK.

109
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:47,959
So first of all, we
need to understand

110
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,740
that one-point linear
perspective, sometimes called

111
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,985
scientific perspective, is made
up of three basic elements.

112
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:57,870
There's a vanishing point,
there is a horizon line,

113
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,509
and there are orthogonals.

114
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:03,250
So let's start off with just
creating a simple interior.

115
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm going to draw
just a rectangle here.

116
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,500
SPEAKER 1: So this
is your painting.

117
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,819
This is your flat surface.

118
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:11,152
SPEAKER 2: That's exactly right.

119
00:04:11,152 --> 00:04:15,679
And I'm going to decide that
the vanishing point needs

120
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,316
to be pretty much in the middle.

121
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:17,899
SPEAKER 1: OK.

122
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,509
SPEAKER 2: So I'm putting
the vanishing point right

123
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,161
about here.

124
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:20,744
SPEAKER 1: OK.

125
00:04:20,744 --> 00:04:21,327
SPEAKER 2: OK?

126
00:04:21,326 --> 00:04:22,370
Now let's see.

127
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,079
SPEAKER 1: Why don't
you label that VP

128
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,579
so we remember it's
vanishing point.

129
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:26,163
SPEAKER 2: OK.

130
00:04:26,163 --> 00:04:27,629
So that's the vanishing point.

131
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:32,329
Now what I want to do is I
want to create a series of rays

132
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:37,169
that move down to
the bottom line.

133
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,439
And these, one could think of as
kind of floorboards in a room,

134
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,160
right?

135
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,790
And artists had been
able to do this long

136
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,210
before linear perspective.

137
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:48,341
Artists had never had
a problem with this.

138
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:49,050
SPEAKER 1: Right.

139
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,670
Well, that's because they were
constructing it intuitively.

140
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,470
And intuitively, when you
look around at the world,

141
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,280
you see walls in a room
that look as though

142
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:00,469
if they continued
they would meet.

143
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,220
Or the floorboards look
as though they would meet.

144
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,627
So it's kind of intuitive.

145
00:05:04,627 --> 00:05:06,960
SPEAKER 2: So I'm actually
going to add not only a floor

146
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,779
to this room, but I'm going
to put in a couple of windows.

147
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:10,278
We'll just make it
very simple here.

148
00:05:10,278 --> 00:05:14,540
So I'll put in a couple
more verticals right here.

149
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,860
And then I'm simply
going to have all of this

150
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,360
meet in the middle at
that vanishing point.

151
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,240
Now I'm going to use
an eraser here just

152
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,740
to clean this up
just a little bit so

153
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,290
we can get rid of some
of the extraneous lines

154
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,080
just to make things
a little more clear.

155
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,769
And voila.

156
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:34,276
You can sort of see a window--

157
00:05:34,276 --> 00:05:34,860
SPEAKER 1: OK.

158
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,350
I've got a window.

159
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,641
SPEAKER 2: --beginning to form.

160
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:38,250
But now here's the problem.

161
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,660
The problem was if you didn't
want to have floorboards

162
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,520
and instead you wanted to have
a tile floor, you had a problem.

163
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:48,229
Because you know intuitively
the horizontal lines

164
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,020
have to get closer together
as they go back in space.

165
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:55,000
The problem is it's hard
to exactly figure out

166
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,329
what those proportions
are as they get denser

167
00:05:58,329 --> 00:06:01,240
and denser as they go back in
space so that the floor doesn't

168
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,480
look like it's popping up.

169
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,230
SPEAKER 1: Which
happened often, actually,

170
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,790
in paintings from the Trecento.

171
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,057
So the idea is that the
tiles get smaller and smaller

172
00:06:08,057 --> 00:06:10,390
because things generally get
smaller and smaller as they

173
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:11,683
move away from us in space.

174
00:06:11,684 --> 00:06:13,350
SPEAKER 2: Or appear
that way, at least.

175
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:13,710
SPEAKER 1: Right.

176
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:16,199
SPEAKER 2: So what Alberti
wrote down in On Painting

177
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,139
was that you need to have
a second point in space

178
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:20,689
outside of the
picture plane that

179
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:22,594
was at the level of your eye.

180
00:06:22,595 --> 00:06:23,970
So I'm just going
to put it here.

181
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,310
It's at the same level as
the vanishing point, right?

182
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,600
And so we would call
this, of course, what?

183
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,439
This is H. This is
the horizon line.

184
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,300
And I missed it,
but there it is.

185
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,139
SPEAKER 1: OK.

186
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:35,414
SPEAKER 2: OK.

187
00:06:35,415 --> 00:06:37,498
And then what I would do--
and I would, of course,

188
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,620
do this more accurately
with a ruler--

189
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,370
is I would draw another series
of rays from that second

190
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:44,870
point--

191
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,328
SPEAKER 1: From
the exterior point.

192
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:47,789
SPEAKER 2: That's right.

193
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:52,069
And have it connect to each
of those floorboards, right?

194
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:54,300
And so as you can
see, what's happening

195
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,540
is that that angle becomes
more extreme as I move across.

196
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,040
Right?

197
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,770
And I'm doing it freehand, so
it's a little bit hard to see,

198
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:03,079
but you get the point.

199
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:05,800
Now something really
interesting just happened,

200
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,509
which is I can now create a
horizontal line that is at that

201
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:14,093
first intersection-- do
you see that right there?--

202
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:15,009
going straight across.

203
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:15,843
SPEAKER 1: I see it.

204
00:07:15,843 --> 00:07:17,800
SPEAKER 2: Then I
can draw a second one

205
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,970
at that second intersection
right there, and so forth.

206
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,150
And they get more
and more compressed

207
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:28,439
as I go back in space.

208
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,980
And the illusion
should be, then,

209
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,629
a kind of compression in space.

210
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:36,060
So I think this will
become more clear if I just

211
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,351
do a little bit of erasing now.

212
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:37,935
SPEAKER 1: OK.

213
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:40,627
While you're erasing, I want to
talk about that word illusion.

214
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,210
SPEAKER 2: OK.

215
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:44,560
SPEAKER 1: Because I think
it's key to everything here.

216
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,649
SPEAKER 2: Absolutely.

217
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:47,108
SPEAKER 1: What
artists are looking

218
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:50,439
to do is to create an
illusion of reality

219
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:52,230
on this two-dimensional surface.

220
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,250
Alberti said a painting
should be like a window.

221
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,406
So in a way, you don't see
the two-dimensional surface.

222
00:07:58,406 --> 00:07:59,780
A two-dimensional
surface becomes

223
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:03,129
something you look
through to a world that

224
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:06,040
is a continuation
of our own world.

225
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,720
So the idea of the illusion
being incredibly convincing

226
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,100
was so important to the
artists of the Renaissance,

227
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,740
artists like Masaccio
or later Piero della

228
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,389
Francesca or Andrea Mantegna.

229
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:21,175
SPEAKER 2: And so
now I'm just going

230
00:08:21,175 --> 00:08:25,009
to fill in a few of these tiles
alternating so that you really

231
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:27,959
can get a sense of
that floor in space.

232
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:28,529
Whoops.

233
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:29,609
So is that working?

234
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,980
SPEAKER 1: So even in this
rough way here on this tablet,

235
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,850
this is working, basically.

236
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,529
SPEAKER 2: It actually
couldn't be rougher, could it?

237
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:39,788
But I think it still
makes the point.

238
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:45,470
If I were then finally
to get rid of these lines

239
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,420
and, in fact, get rid
of the vanishing point

240
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:53,949
entirely and instead
now draw in a back wall,

241
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,100
we have something
that comes fairly

242
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,779
close to looking like
an interior space.

243
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,903
SPEAKER 1: Now what
about putting figures in?

244
00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:04,200
SPEAKER 2: Ah.

245
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,076
So now you're really
asking for trouble here.

246
00:09:06,076 --> 00:09:06,950
SPEAKER 1: I'm sorry.

247
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:07,764
Can you do that?

248
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:09,000
SPEAKER 2: I don't know.

249
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,710
Let's see.

250
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,820
So if I were to draw a figure,
what I would like to do

251
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,680
is make sure that the
eye level of the figure

252
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:19,789
is approximately at
the horizon line.

253
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:23,746
So I would put that
figure in just about here.

254
00:09:23,746 --> 00:09:26,329
SPEAKER 1: And what if you put
a figure more in the foreground

255
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,413
or more in the background?

256
00:09:27,413 --> 00:09:29,870
SPEAKER 2: So if I put
a figure that was more

257
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,870
in the foreground, I would
still want their eye level

258
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,750
to be at that
imaginary horizon line.

259
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,792
But of course, now
they would be larger.

260
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:39,500
SPEAKER 1: Right.

261
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,039
So I think this is the part
that's counter-intuitive.

262
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,659
The heads are on the
same level, and it's

263
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:47,057
the feet that are
on different levels.

264
00:09:47,057 --> 00:09:48,389
SPEAKER 2: That's exactly right.

265
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:53,279
And Alberti also said that that
eye level, that horizon line

266
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,509
would ideally also be
the viewer's eye level

267
00:09:56,509 --> 00:09:59,317
so that the perspective
would really work perfectly.

268
00:09:59,317 --> 00:09:59,899
SPEAKER 1: OK.

269
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,549
So we have orthogonals,
the diagonal lines

270
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:04,740
that meet at the
vanishing point.

271
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:10,019
We know the vanishing point is
a point on the horizon line,

272
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:13,500
and we understand how these
correspond to the viewer

273
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,230
and to creating an
illusion of space.

274
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,759
SPEAKER 2: Let's
take a look at what

275
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,947
somebody who can really
draw does with this.

276
00:10:18,947 --> 00:10:19,529
SPEAKER 1: OK.

277
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:21,689
SPEAKER 2: Let's take a
look at Leonardo da Vinci's

278
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,510
The Last Supper.

279
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:23,092
SPEAKER 1: OK.

280
00:10:23,092 --> 00:10:23,860
So not you.

281
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,529
SPEAKER 2: Not me at all.

282
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:25,740
SPEAKER 1: Someone
who can really draw.

283
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,239
OK.

284
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:28,194
So here is Leonardo's
Last Supper.

285
00:10:28,193 --> 00:10:29,610
Immediately, the
interesting thing

286
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,810
is that after Brunelleschi
discovers linear perspective,

287
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:34,729
artists like Masaccio
begin to use it.

288
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,822
But they realize
that in addition

289
00:10:36,822 --> 00:10:38,279
to creating an
illusion of space it

290
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,720
has a way of
bringing the viewer's

291
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,600
attention to the
vanishing point.

292
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,629
So artists begin to use it not
just to create that illusion,

293
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:48,240
but they begin to
use it expressively.

294
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,320
And that's what we really
see here with Leonardo.

295
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,180
SPEAKER 2: So not only
is Leonardo creating

296
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:54,289
this beautiful
perspectival space,

297
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:56,360
but he's also
focusing our attention

298
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,822
on Jesus Christ at the center
who is the vanishing point.

299
00:10:59,822 --> 00:11:00,529
SPEAKER 1: Right.

300
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:03,929
It brings our eye, our
attention to the divine.

301
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,284
SPEAKER 2: So here we see
Leonardo's Last Supper,

302
00:11:06,284 --> 00:11:09,079
and we can certainly
just intuitively make out

303
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,370
the orthogonals and
the vanishing point.

304
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,659
But let's go down and
really look at the diagram.

305
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:14,242
SPEAKER 1: OK.

306
00:11:14,243 --> 00:11:15,169
Here we are.

307
00:11:15,168 --> 00:11:16,460
SPEAKER 2: So it's interesting.

308
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:20,790
Their eye level all across is
basically at the horizon line.

309
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:22,539
And of course, we see
the vanishing point,

310
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:25,939
the point where all of
the orthogonals intersect,

311
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,080
which is right here.

312
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,290
And so we have all
of these lines that

313
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:34,279
are moving across the
surface of this wall,

314
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,480
and they are all
bringing our eye right

315
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,529
to Jesus Christ in the center.

316
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:41,610
SPEAKER 1: And those lines
are orthogonal lines.

317
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,250
And there you have it.

318
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:43,759
SPEAKER 2: That's how it works.

319
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:45,009
SPEAKER 1: Linear perspective.

320
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:55,428
