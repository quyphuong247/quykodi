1
00:00:00,106 --> 00:00:04,575
(jazz piano)

2
00:00:04,575 --> 00:00:06,689
- [Voiceover] Artists love
to portray the human body,

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:08,903
but there's a lot of decisions to make,

4
00:00:08,903 --> 00:00:10,527
and when you portray the human body

5
00:00:10,526 --> 00:00:12,478
on a two-dimensional surface,

6
00:00:12,478 --> 00:00:14,510
those decisions come to the fore.

7
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,317
- [Voiceover] Bodies exist in space,

8
00:00:16,318 --> 00:00:19,407
and so there are various
ways of representing

9
00:00:19,407 --> 00:00:22,435
three-dimensional forms on
a two-dimensional surface,

10
00:00:22,696 --> 00:00:24,425
and when you're representing the body,

11
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:26,152
there's lots of other complicated things

12
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:28,387
like how do you represent movement,

13
00:00:28,387 --> 00:00:30,451
the weight of the body, and do you?

14
00:00:31,027 --> 00:00:32,999
Or do you choose to represent the body

15
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:35,661
in a more abstract and transcendent way?

16
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:38,099
- [Voiceover] One of the
first great naturalistic

17
00:00:38,098 --> 00:00:39,986
renderings of the human body came about

18
00:00:39,987 --> 00:00:43,036
in the classical tradition,
that is, the art work

19
00:00:43,036 --> 00:00:45,453
of the ancient Greeks
and the ancient Romans.

20
00:00:45,453 --> 00:00:49,054
Now most ancient Greek painting is lost,

21
00:00:49,054 --> 00:00:51,387
but we do have some
ancient Roman painting.

22
00:00:51,387 --> 00:00:52,469
A great example of that can be seen

23
00:00:53,216 --> 00:00:55,979
in a fresco, that is a wall painting,

24
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:59,283
of a woman and her daughter
who's standing behind a chair.

25
00:01:00,164 --> 00:01:01,182
- [Voiceover] We think is her daughter,

26
00:01:01,344 --> 00:01:02,583
and this is a very old image,

27
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:04,941
so it's hard to know
exactly what's being shown.

28
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:05,793
- [Voiceover] That's true.

29
00:01:05,793 --> 00:01:07,602
This is more than 2,000 years old.

30
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:09,613
- [Voiceover] So, just
like we see in sculpture

31
00:01:09,614 --> 00:01:12,457
in ancient Greece and Rome
in two-dimensional art

32
00:01:12,457 --> 00:01:14,225
and fresco paintings like this one,

33
00:01:14,225 --> 00:01:16,280
we see an interest in
representing the correct

34
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:18,980
proportions of the human body,

35
00:01:18,097 --> 00:01:20,902
and interest in representing,
although a clothed figure,

36
00:01:21,784 --> 00:01:23,842
a sense of a nude figure that makes sense

37
00:01:24,364 --> 00:01:25,805
underneath that drapery.

38
00:01:25,805 --> 00:01:27,147
- [Voiceover] Well, we
get a sense for the mass,

39
00:01:27,147 --> 00:01:28,772
of the volumes, of the body,

40
00:01:28,772 --> 00:01:30,783
and remember, all of this is represented

41
00:01:30,784 --> 00:01:32,593
on a two-dimensional surface,

42
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,496
so the ability to create a sense of a form

43
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:37,545
turning in space is quite an achievement.

44
00:01:37,977 --> 00:01:39,009
- [Voiceover] And when
you say turning in space,

45
00:01:39,296 --> 00:01:42,140
you mean light playing over the surface

46
00:01:42,013 --> 00:01:45,305
of a form to make it
appear three-dimensional.

47
00:01:45,432 --> 00:01:47,037
- [Voiceover] Well, look
at the edge of the pillow

48
00:01:47,037 --> 00:01:48,195
that she sits on.

49
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:49,516
The bottom of it has shadow,

50
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:51,225
the top of it has a highlight,

51
00:01:51,225 --> 00:01:54,028
and so we get a sense
of that object in space.

52
00:01:54,028 --> 00:01:55,125
- [Voiceover] So the artist has created

53
00:01:55,126 --> 00:01:58,174
a convincing illusion on
this two-dimensional surface

54
00:01:58,174 --> 00:01:59,698
of a three-dimensional form.

55
00:01:59,697 --> 00:02:01,750
- [Voiceover] Look at the
instrument that that woman holds.

56
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:03,046
We're seeing it at an angle

57
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:05,712
so that it looks foreshortened.

58
00:02:05,712 --> 00:02:07,621
- [Voiceover] It appears
to be coming out in space

59
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,805
toward us, and by creating
a foreshortened form,

60
00:02:11,806 --> 00:02:13,960
the artist further helps to convince us

61
00:02:13,096 --> 00:02:14,213
of an illusion of space.

62
00:02:15,078 --> 00:02:17,881
There's a lot going on here, in fact,

63
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:20,318
where the artist is trying to give us

64
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:23,610
a sense of naturalism, of
an illusion of reality.

65
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,667
We have the foreshortened
musical instrument,

66
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,588
the foreshortened arm of the chair,

67
00:02:28,588 --> 00:02:30,620
the naturalism of her body,

68
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:33,557
the sense of her weight
as she sits on that chair.

69
00:02:34,115 --> 00:02:36,187
- [Voiceover] And, of course,
the child that is behind

70
00:02:36,187 --> 00:02:38,402
the chair so that we
know that there is space.

71
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:40,149
It's a relatively shallow space.

72
00:02:40,149 --> 00:02:41,915
We have a wall behind the child.

73
00:02:41,915 --> 00:02:44,699
Nevertheless, we do
see the woman in front,

74
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:46,709
the chair in the middle,
the girl behind that,

75
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,209
and the wall behind her.

76
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,085
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

77
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,102
We have an illusion of space

78
00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:52,748
and we have an illusion
of three-dimensional

79
00:02:52,747 --> 00:02:55,590
figures that exist within that space.

80
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:56,588
- [Voiceover] But throughout history,

81
00:02:56,587 --> 00:02:59,614
that wasn't always the primary
consideration of an artist.

82
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:02,033
- [Voiceover] If we look
at a Medieval mosaic

83
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:04,835
when Europe was dominated by Christianity,

84
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:06,929
by Christian thought,
we see a very different

85
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:08,635
approach to the human figure.

86
00:03:08,635 --> 00:03:11,032
- [Voiceover] Here we're
looking at an apse mosaic.

87
00:03:11,032 --> 00:03:14,019
That is, this is made of tiny
pieces of stone and glass

88
00:03:14,002 --> 00:03:16,460
that's in a church called Hagia Sophia.

89
00:03:16,478 --> 00:03:17,270
This is huge.

90
00:03:17,026 --> 00:03:19,607
It's about 16 feet tall,
but it's so much more

91
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,308
stylized than the Roman painting.

92
00:03:22,308 --> 00:03:24,544
The image itself is quite symmetrical.

93
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,210
- [Voiceover] By symmetry
we mean that if you

94
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,153
cut it down the center it would be

95
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:30,658
pretty much the same on both sides,

96
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:32,873
and the figures are very frontal.

97
00:03:32,873 --> 00:03:36,103
This is a kind of view
that's not very realistic.

98
00:03:36,103 --> 00:03:38,359
If you walked in a room, for example,

99
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:42,219
how many people would you
actually see exactly frontal?

100
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,504
- [Voiceover] And you
would generally not see

101
00:03:43,703 --> 00:03:45,836
figures that have halos around their heads

102
00:03:45,836 --> 00:03:48,173
or gold backgrounds behind them.

103
00:03:48,173 --> 00:03:49,939
This is a spiritual representation.

104
00:03:49,093 --> 00:03:52,895
This is an image of the Virgin
Mary and her son, Christ.

105
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:57,022
So what we're looking at here
is a heavenly representation.

106
00:03:57,022 --> 00:04:00,218
This is a symbolic representation.

107
00:04:00,218 --> 00:04:04,765
Although there is some
reference to light and shadow,

108
00:04:04,765 --> 00:04:06,066
especially in the drapery

109
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:07,448
and especially in the cushions,

110
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:08,605
this is an image that is coming

111
00:04:08,605 --> 00:04:10,474
out of the late Roman tradition.

112
00:04:10,474 --> 00:04:13,096
Nevertheless, this is primarily concerned

113
00:04:13,096 --> 00:04:15,575
with abstracting the human body.

114
00:04:15,574 --> 00:04:16,956
- [Voiceover] And abstracting space,

115
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:18,723
and so we can say that the artists

116
00:04:18,723 --> 00:04:20,817
of the ancient Roman fresco

117
00:04:20,817 --> 00:04:22,564
was doing everything
he could to convince us

118
00:04:22,564 --> 00:04:24,620
of the reality of his illusion.

119
00:04:25,124 --> 00:04:27,765
Here, in the Middle Ages, the artist

120
00:04:27,764 --> 00:04:29,572
is doing everything he can to convince us

121
00:04:29,572 --> 00:04:33,149
of the unreality of his image.

122
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:36,033
He has removed it from
any earthly setting.

123
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,617
We have that gold background.

124
00:04:37,617 --> 00:04:39,975
The figure is elongated.

125
00:04:39,975 --> 00:04:42,617
The drapery describes the body a bit,

126
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:44,100
but is very abstracted.

127
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:47,697
By abstracted, we mean
removed from reality.

128
00:04:47,797 --> 00:04:49,708
- [Voiceover] So the
lengthening of that body

129
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,571
is a way of signaling to the viewer

130
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:53,812
that the figure that we're seeing

131
00:04:53,812 --> 00:04:56,817
is not somebody that we would
meet in our daily lives,

132
00:04:56,817 --> 00:04:59,891
that this is somebody who
exists in the spiritual realm.

133
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:01,776
Christians at this point in history

134
00:05:01,776 --> 00:05:04,091
are much less concerned
with the importance

135
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:06,589
of the physical, of the
realm in which we live,

136
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:08,762
and are much more
focused on the hereafter,

137
00:05:09,293 --> 00:05:10,857
on the spiritual realm.

138
00:05:10,857 --> 00:05:12,463
Now, that changes.

139
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:14,088
If we move to the Renaissance,

140
00:05:14,088 --> 00:05:16,485
we see Christian art that is concerned

141
00:05:16,485 --> 00:05:18,314
with the here and now.

142
00:05:18,314 --> 00:05:20,086
- [Voiceover] And see that in so much work

143
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,057
of the Renaissance.

144
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:23,256
In this beautiful painting
by Giovanni Bellini,

145
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:25,246
we have a spiritual image,

146
00:05:25,247 --> 00:05:27,461
this is the Madonna and the Christ child,

147
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,533
but in a beautiful earthly setting

148
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:31,442
with a landscape behind them.

149
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:34,246
The figures no longer wear those big halos

150
00:05:34,247 --> 00:05:36,319
indicating their divine status.

151
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,321
Their bodies are in much
more natural proportions,

152
00:05:40,321 --> 00:05:41,406
and move much more naturally.

153
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:45,300
So we have that interest
in both the natural world

154
00:05:45,002 --> 00:05:47,064
and the naturalism, the
realism, of the body.

155
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:49,260
- [Voiceover] So here's
an artist that is finding

156
00:05:50,088 --> 00:05:52,834
kind of spirituality in
the beauty of nature,

157
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:55,149
in the beauty of the human body.

158
00:05:55,014 --> 00:05:57,961
In this way, we have an
artist who has an interest

159
00:05:58,096 --> 00:06:02,300
in returning to that older
Greek and Roman tradition.

160
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,844
I'm not saying that Bellini was looking

161
00:06:03,845 --> 00:06:05,979
specifically at Roman wall painting,

162
00:06:05,978 --> 00:06:07,664
that would have been hard to see,

163
00:06:07,665 --> 00:06:09,160
but there was a general interest

164
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:11,891
in the classical interest
in the natural world.

165
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:13,357
- [Voiceover] And that's one of the ways

166
00:06:13,357 --> 00:06:14,385
that we define the Renaissance,

167
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:16,891
the Renaissance as a
rebirth of the culture

168
00:06:16,891 --> 00:06:17,968
of ancient Greece and Rome

169
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:21,585
and artists looking back to
that naturalistic tradition.

170
00:06:21,584 --> 00:06:23,271
- [Voiceover] But I think
it's important to be cautious

171
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:25,954
not to look at the
Bellini and say that it is

172
00:06:25,954 --> 00:06:28,716
more successful than the Medieval mosaic.

173
00:06:28,716 --> 00:06:29,810
These are works of art
that were responding

174
00:06:30,646 --> 00:06:32,332
to the needs of its culture,

175
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,405
to the interests of its culture.

176
00:06:34,404 --> 00:06:36,456
Both of them are
spectacular representations,

177
00:06:36,925 --> 00:06:40,419
but very different kinds of
issues are important to them.

178
00:06:40,418 --> 00:06:42,064
- [Voiceover] The artists
who created the mosaic

179
00:06:42,064 --> 00:06:44,238
in Hagia Sophia had no
interest in creating

180
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,753
an illusion of reality.

181
00:06:45,754 --> 00:06:47,501
In fact, their goal was to not create

182
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,834
the illusion of reality!

183
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:51,230
We see that happen again
in the 20th Century

184
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,531
with some artists.

185
00:06:52,531 --> 00:06:54,379
We're looking at a Madonna and Child

186
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,004
by a 20th Century artist named Eric Gill.

187
00:06:57,346 --> 00:06:59,520
- [Voiceover] This is a print,
and it is so simplified.

188
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:00,882
It is so abstracted.

189
00:07:00,882 --> 00:07:02,887
We can clearly see the intimacy between

190
00:07:03,482 --> 00:07:05,595
the Virgin Mary and the Christ child,

191
00:07:05,595 --> 00:07:07,200
very similar to the intimacy that exists

192
00:07:07,002 --> 00:07:08,403
in all of these images,

193
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:10,796
but it is stark black and white.

194
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,808
It is simple line and contour.

195
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:13,901
The artist has reduced it.

196
00:07:14,737 --> 00:07:17,305
This is a kind of economy of line

197
00:07:17,305 --> 00:07:18,798
that is interesting and important

198
00:07:18,798 --> 00:07:20,403
to artists in the 20th Century,

199
00:07:20,403 --> 00:07:22,800
and to artists who have, in a sense,

200
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:24,750
the entire sweep of
history at their disposal,

201
00:07:25,543 --> 00:07:27,514
that can pick and choose the styles

202
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,180
that they want to work in,

203
00:07:29,017 --> 00:07:31,516
and who try to create
a new kind of meaning

204
00:07:31,678 --> 00:07:33,242
through those choices.

205
00:07:33,242 --> 00:07:36,209
- [Voiceover] So gone
is the use of modeling,

206
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:38,540
or chiaroscuro, that
movement of light to dark

207
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:41,491
to create an illusion of
three-dimensional form.

208
00:07:41,492 --> 00:07:44,539
We have no sense of
atmospheric perspective

209
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:46,002
like we have in the Bellini,

210
00:07:46,002 --> 00:07:49,252
where we have a sense of
deep space in that landscape.

211
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:52,747
- [Voiceover] And even more
abstracted than the mosaic,

212
00:07:52,747 --> 00:07:54,088
but this is an artist who is familiar

213
00:07:54,088 --> 00:07:56,019
with every image we've looked at.

214
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:57,379
- [Voiceover] And you
could say that in the era

215
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,167
of photography, why create reality?

216
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:02,317
- [Voiceover] So like
every artist before him,

217
00:08:02,317 --> 00:08:05,364
Eric Gill is making
choices and producing art

218
00:08:05,363 --> 00:08:08,899
that answers questions that
are relevant to his culture.

219
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:10,447
- [Voiceover] That answers
the needs of the 20th Century.

220
