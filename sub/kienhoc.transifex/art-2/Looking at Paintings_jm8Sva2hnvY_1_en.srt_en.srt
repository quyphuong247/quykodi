1
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:04,964
Voiceover: How do you
tell a story in a picture

2
00:00:04,964 --> 00:00:06,665
and indicate that one thing happened

3
00:00:06,665 --> 00:00:09,432
and then another and then another?

4
00:00:09,432 --> 00:00:10,830
Figuring out how to arrange subjects

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,541
so that a composition
makes sense to a viewer

6
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:16,469
is a crucial part of
the painter's process.

7
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:19,330
The artist who painted this
scene used architectural

8
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:22,079
elements to divide the
story into sections,

9
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:27,251
describing a sequence of
events in a Pope's dream.

10
00:00:27,251 --> 00:00:28,995
If you showed the story like a cartoon,

11
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:31,106
it would look like this.

12
00:00:31,106 --> 00:00:34,499
In the first event, Pope
Sergius dreams of an angel

13
00:00:34,499 --> 00:00:36,740
bringing him an important message.

14
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:41,774
A bishop has been assassinated
and he must appoint a replacement.

15
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:45,811
The second scene takes
place a little farther away

16
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:47,768
within a brick enclosure where two

17
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:52,030
figures kneel beside the Pope.

18
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,135
In the top right corner of the painting,

19
00:00:54,136 --> 00:00:57,637
the Pope is seen again
blessing a new bishop.

20
00:00:57,637 --> 00:01:00,783
Events in the painting
progress from the present

21
00:01:00,783 --> 00:01:04,891
in the foreground to the
future in the background.

22
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:07,340
To draw our attention to distant events,

23
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,703
the artist omitted part
of the courtyard wall

24
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:12,500
and arranged the second
scene to take place

25
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,778
within two narrowing lines.

26
00:01:14,778 --> 00:01:16,828
He positioned the third scene along a line

27
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:19,733
formed by a river and a road.

28
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:22,099
These tapering lines lead
us into the painting,

29
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:24,734
while strong horizontal and vertical lines

30
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:28,656
provide a sense of balance.

31
00:01:31,855 --> 00:01:34,904
Composition does more than lead our eye.

32
00:01:34,903 --> 00:01:36,378
The placement of figures and events

33
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:39,167
can tell us who or what is important.

34
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:42,149
When Pierre Auguste-Renoir
painted this scene,

35
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:44,585
he wasn't interested in
recording a specific place.

36
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:48,106
He wanted to capture a
single moment in time.

37
00:01:48,106 --> 00:01:50,195
Renoir lavished much more attention

38
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:52,358
on the young woman than on her companion,

39
00:01:52,358 --> 00:01:56,995
who is crowded into the
top of the painting.

40
00:01:56,995 --> 00:01:59,374
Notice how the diagonal
line of sight from the

41
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:02,488
man to the woman echoes
their clasped hands

42
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,438
and is repeated again by the trail.

43
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:07,507
This diagonal emphasis
leads us to consider

44
00:02:07,507 --> 00:02:09,694
what might happen if she follows him

45
00:02:09,694 --> 00:02:13,707
to the secluded area
he is gesturing toward.

46
00:02:13,707 --> 00:02:16,538
Renoir arranged the figures to
convey a feeling of openness.

47
00:02:16,538 --> 00:02:19,183
Follow the lines formed
by the figure's arms

48
00:02:19,183 --> 00:02:21,543
and by their gazes.

49
00:02:21,543 --> 00:02:24,074
These implied lines help us focus on the

50
00:02:24,074 --> 00:02:27,020
interaction between the man and the woman.

51
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,864
See how the relationship
between the two figures

52
00:02:28,864 --> 00:02:32,771
is disrupted when their
positions are reversed?

53
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,140
Renoir's painting is balanced and unified

54
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,456
because it has a well
thought out composition.

55
00:02:43,657 --> 00:02:46,667
There is something curious
about this birdseye view.

56
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:48,756
Philips Koninck painted this landscape

57
00:02:48,756 --> 00:02:51,877
as if he was looking at it
from the top of a mountain.

58
00:02:51,877 --> 00:02:54,628
But there aren't any mountains in Holland.

59
00:02:54,627 --> 00:02:57,383
In a picture artists
use a variety of devices

60
00:02:57,383 --> 00:03:02,280
to create the illusion of
space on a flat surface.

61
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:04,322
Koninck, like other artists,

62
00:03:04,322 --> 00:03:06,556
used a mathematical
system for representing

63
00:03:06,556 --> 00:03:09,919
three-dimensional objects on
a two-dimensional surface.

64
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,838
This system, called perspective,

65
00:03:11,838 --> 00:03:14,144
is based on the realization that our eye

66
00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:18,382
reads parallel lines as coming
together as they recede.

67
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:20,856
Here you can see how the lines converge

68
00:03:20,856 --> 00:03:24,667
at a single point on the horizon.

69
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:26,590
Notice how things at
the bottom of the canvas

70
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,093
appear closer to us?

71
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:31,393
Instead of looking into the painting,

72
00:03:31,394 --> 00:03:33,105
which is the natural thing to do,

73
00:03:33,104 --> 00:03:35,008
look at the painting from bottom to top.

74
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:36,937
As your eye moves up the canvas,

75
00:03:36,937 --> 00:03:38,868
the landscape seems to recede

76
00:03:38,868 --> 00:03:42,121
and things appear farther away.

77
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,358
Comparing these two figures shows us

78
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,700
how artists paint obects in the foreground

79
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:49,899
larger and with more detail
than objects in the background.

80
00:03:49,899 --> 00:03:51,894
This also helps achieve the illusion

81
00:03:51,894 --> 00:03:55,158
of space receding away from us.

82
00:03:55,157 --> 00:03:57,629
If Koninck had recorded
actual observations

83
00:03:57,629 --> 00:03:59,110
of the Dutch landscape,

84
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,443
the picture would have
looked more like this.

85
00:04:01,443 --> 00:04:03,200
Trees and hills would have obstructed

86
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,290
his view over the horizon.

87
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,979
Instead, Koninck painted the illusion

88
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:11,740
of a panoramic countryside.

89
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:15,991
What might this painting look
like if the figures were removed?

90
00:04:15,991 --> 00:04:17,329
Without the romantic
couple there is little

91
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:18,794
sense of depth.

92
00:04:18,795 --> 00:04:21,528
Pierre-Auguste Renoir painted the figures

93
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:25,386
so that they carve out the space.

94
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:27,439
But only as long as branches and vines

95
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,764
fall before them.

96
00:04:28,764 --> 00:04:30,788
Without the vines climbing in front of the

97
00:04:30,788 --> 00:04:32,617
woman's dress and the branches falling

98
00:04:32,617 --> 00:04:35,355
over the man's shoulder,
the space appears shallow.

99
00:04:35,355 --> 00:04:40,371
The figures look as if they
could easily slide down the path.

100
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,173
Put the foliage back
and the figures appear

101
00:04:42,173 --> 00:04:46,101
fully integrated into the landscape.

102
00:04:47,117 --> 00:04:49,953
Look closely at this
painting by Paul Sazon.

103
00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:53,239
Do things seem like they're
tilted forward a little too much?

104
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,638
Sazon intentionally depicted these objects

105
00:04:56,637 --> 00:04:58,268
from multiple viewpoints.

106
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:01,817
That's why everything seems askew.

107
00:05:01,817 --> 00:05:03,474
In more realistic perspective,

108
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:08,168
this scene would look something like this.

109
00:05:08,168 --> 00:05:09,067
Look again.

110
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:12,559
Sazon's perspective.

111
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:15,637
More realistic perspective.

112
00:05:15,637 --> 00:05:18,507
The green vase would look
more like this in reality.

113
00:05:18,507 --> 00:05:20,369
But watch how drastically different

114
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:22,236
Sazon's view is.

115
00:05:22,235 --> 00:05:24,170
We could only see the vase from this angle

116
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:27,007
if we were looking into it from above.

117
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:29,702
The views that Sazon
shows us are all possible

118
00:05:29,702 --> 00:05:32,988
but not at the same time.

119
00:05:32,988 --> 00:05:35,522
If the table really existed
the way Sazon shows it,

120
00:05:35,523 --> 00:05:38,398
the apples would roll right off.

121
00:05:38,398 --> 00:05:40,684
Sazon played with
proportions and viewpoints

122
00:05:40,684 --> 00:05:43,103
to make us aware that in paintings

123
00:05:43,103 --> 00:05:48,668
depth is an illusion on a flat surface.

124
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:53,044
Artists use color to
unify elements to draw

125
00:05:53,045 --> 00:05:56,086
our attention to specific
details and to express emotion.

126
00:05:56,086 --> 00:05:59,023
This is especially
evident in this painting

127
00:05:59,023 --> 00:06:00,844
of Christ's entombment
by Peter Paul Rubens.

128
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:03,747
His use of color dramatizes the suffering

129
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:07,509
of those surrounding Christ.

130
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:12,958
Rubens used a palate
of red, blue and white.

131
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,197
But the white of Christ's
body is vastly different

132
00:06:15,197 --> 00:06:18,012
than the fabric wrapped around him.

133
00:06:18,012 --> 00:06:20,512
Rubens painted Christ's
flesh with blue undertones

134
00:06:20,512 --> 00:06:22,846
to convey his cold and lifeless state

135
00:06:22,846 --> 00:06:26,894
encouraging viewers to
contemplate his death.

136
00:06:26,894 --> 00:06:29,112
Notice how Christ appears thrust toward

137
00:06:29,112 --> 00:06:31,100
us on the left where John the evangelist

138
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,122
supports his upper body?

139
00:06:33,122 --> 00:06:35,232
This effect is achieved
partly through composition,

140
00:06:35,232 --> 00:06:39,443
the way that Christ is slumped
diagonally across the canvas.

141
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:42,786
But the effect is increased
by John's flushed cheaks

142
00:06:42,786 --> 00:06:44,585
and brilliant red robe.

143
00:06:44,586 --> 00:06:46,790
This is because warm colors like red

144
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,868
appear to expand and move toward us.

145
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:54,083
When the robe is changed
to another color like blue,

146
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,430
Christ doesn't appear
to come so far forward.

147
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,129
Cool colors appear to recede visually.

148
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:03,508
This helps create depth.

149
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:07,067
Behind Christ, the three
Mary's are all draped in blue.

150
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:08,959
The cool blue color
keeps them firmly fixed

151
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,605
in the background.

152
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:14,848
Rubens emphasized the relationship between

153
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:16,874
Christ and the virgin
Mary through his treatment

154
00:07:16,874 --> 00:07:18,105
of their faces.

155
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,908
The grieving virgin Mary's face,

156
00:07:19,908 --> 00:07:20,992
and especially her lips,

157
00:07:20,992 --> 00:07:26,521
appear even more blue
than that of her dead son.

158
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:30,026
Her pink hand contrasted
with the blue of Christ's arm

159
00:07:30,026 --> 00:07:32,406
and her tearful eyes convey
that she is physically

160
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:37,055
alive while her pallor
expresses her bereavement.

161
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:40,187
Rubens used extremely
intense and saturated colors

162
00:07:40,187 --> 00:07:42,572
to help tell the story
of Christ's suffering

163
00:07:42,572 --> 00:07:49,050
and the grief of those who
were closest to him in life.

164
00:07:51,466 --> 00:07:54,167
When light radiates from a central point,

165
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:57,413
it creates strong highlights and shadows.

166
00:07:57,413 --> 00:07:59,563
This is especially evident on and around

167
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:04,530
the central figures in this
painting by Garrit Van Honthorst.

168
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:07,610
Without the dark shadows
on and behind Christ's leg,

169
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,980
his figure seems less substantial.

170
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,769
The shadows help convey volume,

171
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:15,894
enhancing the solidity of Christ's form.

172
00:08:15,894 --> 00:08:17,745
Notice how the light is reflecting off

173
00:08:17,745 --> 00:08:20,227
the armor of the man across from Christ?

174
00:08:20,226 --> 00:08:21,564
Like shadows, highlights and reflections

175
00:08:21,564 --> 00:08:25,507
provide clues about surface and shape.

176
00:08:25,507 --> 00:08:28,665
Honthorst used light to
indicate who was important,

177
00:08:28,665 --> 00:08:32,504
to add drama, and to create depth.

178
00:08:32,504 --> 00:08:36,423
Can you see where the light is
coming from in this painting?

179
00:08:36,423 --> 00:08:39,339
It's not as obvious as in
Honthorst's night scene.

180
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:41,408
Here the light is scattered suggesting

181
00:08:41,408 --> 00:08:44,212
the movement of foliage.

182
00:08:44,212 --> 00:08:47,704
The man is so hidden that
we can hardly see his face.

183
00:08:47,705 --> 00:08:50,262
Branches in the brim
of his hat cast shadows

184
00:08:50,261 --> 00:08:52,640
across most of his form.

185
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,285
The woman on the other
hand seems surrounded

186
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:55,633
by light.

187
00:08:55,634 --> 00:09:00,423
She is especially radiant in
contrast to the thicket behind her.

188
00:09:00,423 --> 00:09:02,582
Renoir made clear that
the woman is the prime

189
00:09:02,582 --> 00:09:05,430
focus of the picture.

190
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:07,317
The path to the right of the figures

191
00:09:07,317 --> 00:09:09,307
is also largely in sunlight.

192
00:09:09,307 --> 00:09:11,034
This helps lead us into the picture

193
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:12,500
and makes us wonder what will happen

194
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,677
if she follows her companion
into the secluded area

195
00:09:15,677 --> 00:09:17,724
at the end of the trail.

196
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,576
Renoir orchestrated the
lighting to give this scene

197
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:22,970
of a casual walk in the
park a sense of movement

198
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:28,060
and spontaneity.

199
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:31,423
When you look at a painting like this one,

200
00:09:31,423 --> 00:09:32,991
you can tell that the artist worked hard

201
00:09:32,991 --> 00:09:35,608
to convey the tactile
qualities of each leaf,

202
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,720
flower and butterfly.

203
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,105
The artist, Jan Van Huysum,

204
00:09:39,105 --> 00:09:41,825
was so concerned with creating a realistic

205
00:09:41,825 --> 00:09:44,602
picture that he included
a fly and drops of dew

206
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:47,990
on flower petals.

207
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,701
He did all this while
concealing his brushwork,

208
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:52,543
so we get little sense of the pressure

209
00:09:52,543 --> 00:09:54,970
and movement of his
hand across the surface

210
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,475
of the painting.

211
00:09:57,505 --> 00:09:59,794
The tactile quality of
Vincent Van Gogh's irises

212
00:09:59,794 --> 00:10:01,274
is quite different.

213
00:10:01,274 --> 00:10:03,399
Clumps and dashes of
thickly built up paint

214
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:05,557
create texture on the surface

215
00:10:05,557 --> 00:10:08,067
so the paint itself takes on a sensuous

216
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:12,283
three-dimensional quality.

217
00:10:12,283 --> 00:10:14,733
How an artist treats
the surface is important

218
00:10:14,732 --> 00:10:17,344
because smooth surfaces reflect the light

219
00:10:17,345 --> 00:10:20,502
differently than textured surfaces.

220
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:21,955
When a painting has a glassy surface,

221
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:24,735
color rather than texture
is used to create highlights

222
00:10:24,735 --> 00:10:27,265
like the white highlights on the underside

223
00:10:27,265 --> 00:10:30,072
of this red flower.

224
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:33,446
Can you tell which
artist had more training

225
00:10:33,446 --> 00:10:35,202
or was more skilled?

226
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:37,261
We often make hasty
assumptions about an artist's

227
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,524
ability based simply on how the surface

228
00:10:39,524 --> 00:10:40,785
of the painting appears.

229
00:10:40,785 --> 00:10:43,622
Both artists strive to depict qualities

230
00:10:43,623 --> 00:10:45,358
found in nature but
one was more interested

231
00:10:45,357 --> 00:10:48,332
in depth and details while the other

232
00:10:48,332 --> 00:10:52,332
was more interested in
vitality and movement.
