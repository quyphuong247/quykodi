1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:04,833
(jazz piano)

2
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:06,384
- [Voiceover] Contrapposto.

3
00:00:06,384 --> 00:00:09,147
It's a word that gives people problems.

4
00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:11,445
- [Voiceover] Because it's
Italian, it's not English?

5
00:00:11,452 --> 00:00:13,264
- [Voiceover] And it's a
word that's just unfamiliar,

6
00:00:13,265 --> 00:00:15,926
but it means something very simple.

7
00:00:15,926 --> 00:00:18,693
It is the pose that the human body takes

8
00:00:18,693 --> 00:00:21,516
when it is relaxed and standing.

9
00:00:21,516 --> 00:00:24,585
- [Voiceover] So it's a standing pose.

10
00:00:24,585 --> 00:00:27,673
We can say that, first of all, number one,

11
00:00:27,673 --> 00:00:31,414
but it's relaxed, and naturalistic.

12
00:00:31,414 --> 00:00:34,286
- [Voiceover] And if you think
about the way that you stand,

13
00:00:34,286 --> 00:00:36,036
you generally, when you're relaxed,

14
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,475
put all your weight on one leg.

15
00:00:38,475 --> 00:00:40,487
Then when that leg gets tired,

16
00:00:40,487 --> 00:00:43,106
you shift your weight to the other leg.

17
00:00:43,106 --> 00:00:45,016
- [Voiceover] So, it's a standing pose

18
00:00:45,017 --> 00:00:46,987
that's relaxed and naturalistic,

19
00:00:46,987 --> 00:00:49,262
and you have your weight on one leg

20
00:00:49,262 --> 00:00:51,884
and the other leg is not weight-bearing.

21
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:54,057
Clearly, looking at these two images

22
00:00:54,057 --> 00:00:55,277
that we have on the screen,

23
00:00:55,277 --> 00:00:57,837
one of the figures is
standing in contrapposto

24
00:00:57,837 --> 00:00:58,752
and the other isn't.

25
00:00:58,752 --> 00:01:00,763
I think it's pretty clear, right now,

26
00:01:00,762 --> 00:01:04,155
that this figure is the one
standing in contrapposto.

27
00:01:04,156 --> 00:01:04,846
- [Voiceover] Right.

28
00:01:04,846 --> 00:01:06,207
That's the Doryphoros.

29
00:01:06,207 --> 00:01:08,504
This is by an artist
whose name is Polykleitos.

30
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:11,450
It's ancient Greek, both
figures are ancient Greek,

31
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,984
but this figure is from
the Early Classical Period.

32
00:01:14,983 --> 00:01:17,117
By this time, artists had figured out

33
00:01:17,117 --> 00:01:18,580
how to observe the body

34
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:20,897
and represent it naturalistically.

35
00:01:20,897 --> 00:01:24,412
Their culture was one that wanted art

36
00:01:24,412 --> 00:01:26,728
that represented the naturalistic body.

37
00:01:26,727 --> 00:01:28,373
- [Voiceover] So it's the ancient Greeks

38
00:01:28,373 --> 00:01:31,147
who invented this pose in the West.

39
00:01:31,147 --> 00:01:33,219
That means they are the
first culture to create

40
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:36,775
in the West naturalistic
images of the human figure.

41
00:01:36,775 --> 00:01:39,091
- [Voiceover] Before that,
the Greeks had produced

42
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:40,513
a series of standing figures

43
00:01:40,513 --> 00:01:43,215
like the kouros that we see on the left.

44
00:01:43,215 --> 00:01:44,820
- [Voiceover] So this is earlier.

45
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,310
This is from the 500s B.C.E.,

46
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:52,344
from a period we call the Archaic.

47
00:01:52,343 --> 00:01:55,492
This is a figure which is
not standing in contrapposto

48
00:01:55,492 --> 00:01:57,646
and we can tell because his weight

49
00:01:57,646 --> 00:01:59,921
is equally placed on both feet.

50
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:01,649
One foot is in front of the other,

51
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:03,680
but his weight is equally placed.

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,346
- [Voiceover] And the knees are locked.

53
00:02:05,346 --> 00:02:06,076
Look at that.

54
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:08,758
It looks so wildly
uncomfortable, doesn't it?

55
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,323
- [Voiceover] He looks
like he's in some sort

56
00:02:10,324 --> 00:02:13,270
of performance or parade or something.

57
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,362
- [Voiceover] He looks frozen, absolutely.

58
00:02:15,362 --> 00:02:17,068
Whereas the figure on the right,

59
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:20,625
the body is so much more
complicated, if you look at it.

60
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,737
It seems so much more natural,

61
00:02:22,737 --> 00:02:25,216
as if he's taking a step forward.

62
00:02:25,216 --> 00:02:27,259
- [Voiceover] So we can
say that this figure

63
00:02:27,258 --> 00:02:28,863
looks like he can move,

64
00:02:28,864 --> 00:02:30,734
so he's capable of movement.

65
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,908
This figure looks like
he's frozen and he's stiff,

66
00:02:32,907 --> 00:02:35,792
and in a way, kind of timeless, right?

67
00:02:35,793 --> 00:02:39,022
He seems like he could be here
tomorrow in this position,

68
00:02:39,022 --> 00:02:40,850
yesterday in this position.

69
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,801
There is something that transcends
time about this position.

70
00:02:44,801 --> 00:02:45,646
- [Voiceover] And that's appropriate

71
00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:48,776
because we think this figure
was originally a grave marker.

72
00:02:48,776 --> 00:02:49,873
- [Voiceover] Right.

73
00:02:49,873 --> 00:02:53,062
So, in a way, it transcends time.

74
00:02:53,062 --> 00:02:57,227
In a way, this figure does
not exist in our world

75
00:02:57,228 --> 00:02:59,991
the way that this figure does.

76
00:02:59,991 --> 00:03:01,556
- [Voiceover] Let's take a
look at the kouros for a moment

77
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,100
a little more carefully,
and see if we can figure out

78
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:06,168
what actually causes that
sense of timelessness.

79
00:03:06,168 --> 00:03:09,134
For me, I think, it's
the symmetry of the body.

80
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:10,637
- [Voiceover] So let's
write down that word.

81
00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:13,055
because that's a kind of
word that we don't use

82
00:03:13,055 --> 00:03:14,193
every single day.

83
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:16,651
Symmetrical means that
if you cut something

84
00:03:16,651 --> 00:03:19,415
down the middle, one side
is the same as the other.

85
00:03:19,414 --> 00:03:20,917
- [Voiceover] So a kind of mirror,

86
00:03:20,918 --> 00:03:22,584
a left-right mirror.

87
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:24,860
- [Voiceover] So if we
drew a line down the center

88
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,825
of his body, one side would essentially

89
00:03:27,824 --> 00:03:28,923
be the same as the other,

90
00:03:28,923 --> 00:03:31,421
except for that left foot
being a little bit forward.

91
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:33,413
- [Voiceover] So it is
not a representation

92
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,423
of a person in the world, as you said.

93
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,960
It is much more this notion
of a kind of ideal figure.

94
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,921
Now what's interesting is
the figure on the right

95
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,793
is also an idealization,
but a more complicated

96
00:03:44,794 --> 00:03:46,246
kind of idealization.

97
00:03:46,246 --> 00:03:47,439
- [Voiceover] What do
you mean by the figure

98
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:49,531
on the left being ideal?

99
00:03:49,531 --> 00:03:52,396
- [Voiceover] I think that
it is the idea of a human

100
00:03:52,395 --> 00:03:55,706
as opposed to a representation of a human.

101
00:03:55,706 --> 00:03:57,514
Look, for instance, at the eyes.

102
00:03:57,514 --> 00:03:59,790
You have these big almond shapes.

103
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,782
Now we know they're in
the place of the eye

104
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:04,525
so that we know they represent the eye.

105
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:06,658
But they don't look like human eyes.

106
00:04:06,657 --> 00:04:07,835
- [Voiceover] So in a way, this is

107
00:04:07,836 --> 00:04:10,945
a symbolic representation of a human being

108
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:12,955
and not a real representation.

109
00:04:12,955 --> 00:04:14,500
- [Voiceover] When the artist
was producing the kouros,

110
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,877
I don't think they were
looking at a model.

111
00:04:16,877 --> 00:04:18,483
They didn't need to because, you're right,

112
00:04:18,483 --> 00:04:20,778
they were representing through symbol.

113
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:23,460
But on the right side,
I think that the artist

114
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:25,796
was definitely observing the human body

115
00:04:25,797 --> 00:04:27,767
and looking specifically at the forms,

116
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:31,038
at the muscles, at the
bone structure of the body.

117
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:33,619
- [Voiceover] So we can say
that this is a sculpture

118
00:04:33,619 --> 00:04:36,849
based on the observation
of the human body,

119
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:39,968
and how human bodies look when they move.

120
00:04:39,968 --> 00:04:41,451
- [Voiceover] And that's essential.

121
00:04:41,451 --> 00:04:44,296
Contrapposto is the result of studying

122
00:04:44,295 --> 00:04:48,298
the complex way in which our body aligns

123
00:04:48,298 --> 00:04:50,411
when we stand on one leg.

124
00:04:51,512 --> 00:04:53,504
- [Voiceover] Can you
unpack that a little?

125
00:04:53,504 --> 00:04:54,377
- [Voiceover] Sure.

126
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,901
Let's take a look at the Doryphoros,

127
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:58,451
at The Spear-Bearer, on
the right by Polykleitos.

128
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:00,810
What you see is a figure
that is asymmetrical,

129
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,177
as you said, in a sort of
wonderfully complex way.

130
00:05:05,177 --> 00:05:07,028
Take a look at the ankles for a moment.

131
00:05:07,028 --> 00:05:08,572
The left ankle is up,

132
00:05:08,572 --> 00:05:12,359
and you can draw an axis line
right through the ankles.

133
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,687
The axis line of the knees
is in opposition to that.

134
00:05:15,687 --> 00:05:18,246
The axis line of the hips is parallel

135
00:05:18,245 --> 00:05:20,388
to the axis line of the knees.

136
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,610
Sometimes, in some
representations of contrapposto,

137
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,612
the shoulders are in opposition
to the hips and the knees,

138
00:05:30,612 --> 00:05:31,892
although more slightly.

139
00:05:31,892 --> 00:05:35,285
And in this case, we have the
figure looking to the right.

140
00:05:35,286 --> 00:05:37,927
Now this has some important ramifications

141
00:05:37,927 --> 00:05:39,736
for the representation of the body.

142
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:41,766
If you look at the kouros for a moment,

143
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:45,272
the height of the waist on the left

144
00:05:45,273 --> 00:05:49,391
is the same as the height
of the waist on the right.

145
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,286
- [Voiceover] Right.

146
00:05:50,286 --> 00:05:52,064
- [Voiceover] If you
look at the Doryphoros

147
00:05:52,064 --> 00:05:53,891
on the right side, you can see

148
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:56,983
that the weight-bearing leg

149
00:05:56,983 --> 00:05:58,860
has a hip that juts up,

150
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,182
it pushes upward,

151
00:06:00,182 --> 00:06:02,640
and that compresses the side.

152
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,627
- [Voiceover] Mm-hmm, so this
side of his body is shorter,

153
00:06:05,627 --> 00:06:07,598
and this side of his body is longer.

154
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:09,780
- [Voiceover] Because his left side

155
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:12,255
where the free leg is,

156
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:14,005
allows the hip to sag,

157
00:06:14,005 --> 00:06:15,508
and so there's a kind of hanging

158
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:18,800
and a kind of expansion,
extension, of the side.

159
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,653
- [Voiceover] Yup.

160
00:06:19,653 --> 00:06:20,730
- [Voiceover] And so the result is

161
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,802
that you actually have a kind of swaying

162
00:06:22,802 --> 00:06:24,634
of the vertebrae,

163
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,478
and you have, then, a
kind of complex alignment

164
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:29,692
that results from this opposition

165
00:06:29,692 --> 00:06:32,800
of one side of the body to the other.

166
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,075
- [Voiceover] To me, it's
fascinating that the Greeks

167
00:06:36,076 --> 00:06:37,348
were the first culture in the West

168
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:39,603
to decide to make a human figure

169
00:06:39,603 --> 00:06:44,134
who existed like we do in the world.

170
00:06:44,134 --> 00:06:47,834
We breathe, we move,

171
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:50,149
we sense what's around us.

172
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:51,820
The figure of the kouros
doesn't look as though

173
00:06:51,821 --> 00:06:55,281
it's engaging with the
world around it at all.

174
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,723
- [Voiceover] There is a
sense that the Doryphoros

175
00:06:56,723 --> 00:07:00,848
on the right is responding
to stimuli around him.

176
00:07:00,848 --> 00:07:03,347
That is, he's turned his
head to look at something.

177
00:07:03,346 --> 00:07:05,399
It is as if he is sentient.

178
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,851
He is responding to the world.

179
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:07,765
- [Voiceover] He's thinking.

180
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:08,437
- [Voiceover] Absolutely.

181
00:07:08,437 --> 00:07:09,615
- [Voiceover] And I think that the kouros

182
00:07:09,615 --> 00:07:12,947
doesn't seem to be thinking
in the same way that we do.

183
00:07:12,947 --> 00:07:13,903
- [Voiceover] That's right.

184
00:07:13,903 --> 00:07:15,836
The kouros is an object
of our observation,

185
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,826
whereas the Doryphoros seems as if

186
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:20,650
he has taken on a life
of his own in some way.

187
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,397
- [Voiceover] But there's
a kind of sympathy

188
00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:24,307
that happens with the Doryphoros,

189
00:07:24,307 --> 00:07:27,391
because when we look at
him, we look at ourselves.

190
00:07:28,024 --> 00:07:31,520
When we look at the kouros,
we don't quite see ourselves,

191
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:34,447
or we see a kind of different version,

192
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:35,949
perhaps, of ourselves.

193
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:38,103
- [Voiceover] I think we see
a different kind of ideal.

194
00:07:38,103 --> 00:07:39,850
I think we see, perhaps, a representation

195
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,209
of ourselves in another world.

196
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:45,701
- [Voiceover] So what is it
about ancient Greek culture

197
00:07:45,701 --> 00:07:48,648
that makes them take this humongous leap?

198
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:52,386
I mean, it's a small thing, a bent knee,

199
00:07:52,386 --> 00:07:53,769
and so you would think, "Well, why didn't

200
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:56,045
"anyone come up with that sooner?"

201
00:07:56,045 --> 00:07:59,245
In art history we know that
artists in cultures make things

202
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:02,333
that are reflections of
the values of the culture,

203
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,808
so we know that before
the 400s there just wasn't

204
00:08:05,807 --> 00:08:09,627
the need to make a figure
like the Doryphoros.

205
00:08:09,627 --> 00:08:12,105
So what happens in the 400s?

206
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:14,645
That's the meat of the
art history question.

207
00:08:14,644 --> 00:08:16,046
- [Voiceover] Well, if
we look at what happens

208
00:08:16,047 --> 00:08:18,505
in Greek culture outside
of the visual arts,

209
00:08:18,504 --> 00:08:20,617
we see an explosion in literature,

210
00:08:20,617 --> 00:08:22,692
we see an explosion in philosophy,

211
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:25,292
we see a culture that is self-aware

212
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:29,089
and that is pushing the
boundaries of human knowledge.

213
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:30,838
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I think
there's a real interest

214
00:08:30,838 --> 00:08:34,892
in the Classical Period in expanding

215
00:08:34,892 --> 00:08:38,345
human knowledge based on

216
00:08:38,345 --> 00:08:40,785
our own observations of the world,

217
00:08:40,784 --> 00:08:44,375
a kind of confidence in human ability

218
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,772
to understand the world as it exists,

219
00:08:46,772 --> 00:08:51,343
not to say this is some
unexplained phenomenon

220
00:08:51,342 --> 00:08:53,690
that the gods created and all we can do

221
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:56,210
is sort of pray and hope
it all works out okay,

222
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,176
but a world that human beings have some

223
00:08:59,176 --> 00:09:03,057
control over and some innate
ability to understand.

224
00:09:03,057 --> 00:09:05,739
- [Voiceover] One of the
clichés about Greek culture

225
00:09:05,739 --> 00:09:08,298
is that the Greek gods and goddesses

226
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:11,732
are a reflection of all the
complications of human life.

227
00:09:11,732 --> 00:09:13,462
- [Voiceover] And they
are! They're just like us.

228
00:09:13,462 --> 00:09:15,798
- [Voiceover] And so we
really have within this Greek

229
00:09:15,798 --> 00:09:18,461
culture the idea of human capability,

230
00:09:18,461 --> 00:09:20,553
human achievement, at its center.
