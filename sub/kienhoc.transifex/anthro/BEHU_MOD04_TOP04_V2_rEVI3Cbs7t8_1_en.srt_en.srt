[PLAYING MUSIC]

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,769
In this topic, we're going to
look at the benefits of having

4
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:14,859
an immature brain and
some about tool use.

5
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:17,269
In our ancestors' tools, we
can really see how their

6
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:18,719
brains changed.

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,299
Up until about 1.8 million years
ago they had what we

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,920
call Olduwan tools
or pebble tools.

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,830
And they could have looked sort
of like river cobbles,

10
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:32,699
with one edge worked or knocked
off through some hard

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,920
hand percussion, that is
striking some stones together.

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,660
We can clearly see
how our ancestors

13
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:39,494
built a useful object.

14
00:00:39,494 --> 00:00:42,729
But we're not really seeing
modern tools.

15
00:00:42,729 --> 00:00:45,689
Oldulwan tools are so simple
that you'd be forgiven if you

16
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:48,354
just walked past one and you
didn't realise it was a tool.

17
00:00:48,354 --> 00:00:51,819
Now about 1.8 million years ago,
things start to change.

18
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,240
Somebody, either Homo habilis
maybe or Homo erectus, starts

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,895
to build or make what we call
Acheulean or Acheulean tools.

20
00:00:59,895 --> 00:01:02,510
Now, these are profoundly
different.

21
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:05,804
Acheulean tools, these are a
couple of replicas I have in

22
00:01:05,805 --> 00:01:09,690
my hands, we start to see a
much more worked object,

23
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:10,890
symmetrical.

24
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,680
It's obviously made with
a model in mind.

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,500
It's not just a stone that's
picked up and made useful.

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,890
But it's a stone in which
somebody's image or idea of a

27
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,430
tool has been imposed.

28
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,270
We see the beginnings of design
and the ability to pass

29
00:01:25,269 --> 00:01:28,959
on a model or a custom from
one group to another.

30
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,619
Perhaps the most amazing things
about Acheulean tools

31
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,170
is how long they last.

32
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,500
Some of these tools are
remarkably similar or

33
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,989
remarkably consistent across
a very long period of time.

34
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:44,149
With Acheulean tools, we see
the beginnings of design.

35
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,359
These two things are key,
regularity and the

36
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,870
imposition of design.

37
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,410
In one, we see our ancestors'
cognitive powers.

38
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:56,289
In the other, we see their
cognitive limitations.

39
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:00,140
That is, they were able to pass
on information with high

40
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,049
fidelity over generations.

41
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:04,319
But they weren't innovating
so much.

42
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,008
Creativity and innovation may
have taken bigger brains.

43
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:11,329
But remember, bigger alone
isn't necessarily better.

44
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,960
After all, Neanderthals, one
of our cousins that went

45
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,150
extinct about 30,000 years ago,
had bigger brands than

46
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,849
modern humans have, as
much as 20% larger.

47
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:26,109
In fact, over the last 80,000
years, our ancestors' brains

48
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,160
have actually become smaller.

49
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,049
Organisation of the brain
managed just as much as size,

50
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,750
as we mentioned in
the last topic.

51
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,710
As the brain grows in size,
certain parts of it grow

52
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,840
disproportionately, just
like our brain grows

53
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,270
disproportionately
to our body.

54
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,300
In particular, these midbrain
areas, the older automatic

55
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,860
functions, and the brain stem,
grow less that the cortex and

56
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,130
the extreme outside, the
neocortex of the brain.

57
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,750
The cortex and neocortex are
important, not only because

58
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,770
they allow us to pull together
different functions and

59
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,070
different ideas from different
parts of the brain, but

60
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:01,449
because the cortex and
neocortex allow us to

61
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:04,679
override, as we mentioned
in the last topic--

62
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,300
neocortex--

63
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,080
allow us to override some of the
things that are happening

64
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,270
under here, in the midbrain
and in the brain stem.

65
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,950
Overriding instincts may not
sound like a big deal.

66
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:19,419
But it creates a whole lot
of space for responding

67
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:21,769
creatively to stimuli.

68
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,290
For example, if every time
something made you upset, you

69
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:28,120
could only fight it or run from
it, well not only would

70
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,539
you be hard to live with, but
you'd have a hell time

71
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:32,049
learning things.

72
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,340
Every time you get frustrated,
you'd feel like running off or

73
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,750
attacking the person who
was teaching you.

74
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,330
The cortex and neocortex
don't make us human.

75
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,390
We share those traits, those
parts of the brain, with all

76
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,449
other mammals, more-so
with primates.

77
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:49,619
But the disproportionate growth
of the cortex and

78
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,960
neocortex means that the balance
of powers shift and

79
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,210
we're able to recruit these
parts of the brain into new

80
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,040
functions, into a new
structures, into new

81
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,939
behaviours.

82
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,449
Let's give you an example.

83
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,459
The visual parts of the brain
that respond to images that

84
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,349
appear on the retinas get
repurposed in the human brain

85
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:11,049
and used extensively in things
like visual imagination.

86
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,090
So you can use them for example
to envision what might

87
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,819
happen if you do an activity, to
test out and run scenarios

88
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:20,778
so hat your strategy gets more
sophisticated, or so that you

89
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:23,480
can imagine places
that don't exist,

90
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,870
events that never happened.

91
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,990
Our brains allow us to in a
sense run that visual area

92
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,810
top-down or backwards.

93
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,360
That is, not from the eyes to
the visual area to the parts

94
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,689
of our brains that are
conscious, but in reverse.

95
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:41,379
From consciousness, into the
visual areas, to create images

96
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:43,209
of the things we can imagine.

97
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:45,979
How did our brains our
brains get this way?

98
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,069
The key is changing the
developmental programmes of

99
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:50,360
our brains.

100
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,759
That is, you don't need new
parts to the brain.

101
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,139
You don't need necessarily
whole new genes.

102
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:58,029
What you need instead is
a slight change in the

103
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:00,989
trajectory of the way
our brains mature.

104
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,759
In most mammals, brain growth
is over relatively early in

105
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,839
their lives.

106
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:07,310
That is by the time they're
born, most of the building of

107
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,250
their brain is pretty
much done.

108
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,685
In humans, that's
not the case.

109
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:15,540
A human infant is immature for
a very long period of time.

110
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,670
We stay immature, which allows
our brain to grow faster,

111
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,300
longer, especially the last
parts of the brain that

112
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,139
developed, which are the cortex,
and the neocortex

113
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,079
especially.

114
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:29,849
In fact, if you compare a human
skull and a chimpanzees

115
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,840
skull, a human skull looks
a lot like an immature

116
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,509
chimpanzee skull.

117
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:36,509
If you were a chimp looking at
a human skull, you might be

118
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:39,139
like hey, where's
your fangs, man?

119
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,469
Why you haven't got
a snout yet?

120
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,460
When are you going to grow up?

121
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:45,759
From a chimpanzee's perspective,
a human preserves

122
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,319
infantile characteristics
into adulthood.

123
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,189
We call this prolongation, this
lengthening of immaturity

124
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:57,810
and the preservation of these
immature traits neoteny.

125
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,759
And we can see something similar
in domesticated dogs,

126
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,689
who seem to preserve
the traits of

127
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:05,829
immature wolves into adulthood.

128
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:08,889
Neoteny or the preservation of
immature traits isn't just

129
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:10,579
affecting human faces.

130
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,180
It's really affecting
our brains.

131
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,189
When we're born, we only
have 25% of our

132
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:17,879
eventual brain size.

133
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,290
In contrast, chimpanzees
have about 40%.

134
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,920
And macaques, who are pretty
brainy for mammals, have about

135
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,400
65% of their adult
brain capacity.

136
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,539
When we're born, we have about
the same encephalisation ratio

137
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,590
or brain size compared to
weight as chimpanzees.

138
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:36,139
But the difference is we
maintain that explosive,

139
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:38,919
immature growth rate
after we're born.

140
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,069
And so what we find is that
although humans and

141
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:42,980
chimpanzees track together
until birth,

142
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,180
afterwards things change.

143
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,300
This is especially important
because human brains are

144
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,600
maturing, not inside the womb,
where they're protected by the

145
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,879
mother's body from the
outside world.

146
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,240
Human brains are maturing at
this explosive immature rate

147
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,980
in the world, surrounded by
language, and tools, and

148
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,310
social interaction.

149
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,519
What it means is that when our
brains are most plastic, most

150
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:09,835
liable to be influenced by
things around us, well, we're

151
00:07:09,836 --> 00:07:12,170
out in the world, learning.

152
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,199
So the next time somebody
tells you that you're

153
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,539
immature, well, you point out
to him, yup, that's kind of

154
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,040
what makes us human.

155
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,560
The next topic is the brain,
expensive tissue, or how we

156
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,810
pay for this thing.

157
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,007
