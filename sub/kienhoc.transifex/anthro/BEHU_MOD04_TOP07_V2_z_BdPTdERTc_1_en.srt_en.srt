[PLAYING MUSIC]

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,400
In this topic, we're going to
discuss how brains change

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,589
well, everything.

5
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:15,410
Brains really change
everything.

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,440
They affect the selective
pressures our ancestors faced.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,900
They affect how we
have inheritance.

8
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:22,259
They affect what we pass on.

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,920
And they affect technological
change.

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,280
But to really understand them,
we have to understand

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,510
something really curious.

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,240
A curious fact which is that, we
see large brains in humans

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,260
that look like us, appear well,
170,000, maybe as early

14
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:38,399
as 200,000 years ago.

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,560
About 70,000 years ago, maybe a
little more recently, humans

16
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,640
start to move out of Africa.

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,689
About 30,000 years ago, humans
are living all over the place.

18
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:52,500
They're on the shores of the
other Bering Straits.

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,049
They're around in
coal regions.

20
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:56,570
They're even moving into
Europe and settling.

21
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,359
So one of the questions is
what was happening here?

22
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,620
If the brains were already
large, what took them so long?

23
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,800
To really understand this,
we have to understand the

24
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,959
selective pressures that
probably drove the rise of

25
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,689
this big brain.

26
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:15,750
There are really two types of
theories that explain why we

27
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,209
got such big brains.

28
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:20,140
The first is external theories
that focus on

29
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,780
environmental pressures.

30
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,400
And the second are internal
theories, that focus more on

31
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,490
internal competition and
pressures among human beings.

32
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:30,579
The external pressures are
some of the things we've

33
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:34,789
already been talking about,
the need for diet change,

34
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,170
hunting and gathering, and
changes in our foraging

35
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,359
behaviour, dealing with
predators, so self-defense.

36
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,859
All of these are external
pressures, things like a

37
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:47,609
changing climate.

38
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:50,849
All of these forces helped to
drive the increase in the

39
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:52,919
human brain according
to these arguments.

40
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,750
But they also have
big payoffs.

41
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,299
So that although getting new
food and diet is a pressure,

42
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:01,079
once you get new food, it
actually causes you to have

43
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:01,750
more calories.

44
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,180
And it releases some
of that pressure.

45
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,760
So all of these entered into
what's likely a dynamic, where

46
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,729
an improvement, because of one
pressure, would then make

47
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,940
humans better able to cope
with the other pressures.

48
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:13,939
I don't think there's any way
to dispute the importance of

49
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:14,729
these forces.

50
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:16,780
I mean all of these are so
important in the development

51
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,650
of the human brain.

52
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,849
And we know that our behaviours,
our ancestors'

53
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:23,319
behaviours changed in
relationship to these traits.

54
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:26,430
All these ecological forces,
we might call them, are

55
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,969
clearly important.

56
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:32,210
But they don't really explain
why we got the big brains.

57
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,310
Because all kinds of animals
went through the same exact

58
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,939
ecological pressures and they
didn't adapt by developing

59
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:41,219
such a disproportionately high
encephalisation rate.

60
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:43,969
They didn't get such big
noggins for this.

61
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:46,590
Increasingly, many evolutionary
theorists think

62
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,009
that we need to really examine
the internal forces to

63
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:51,840
understand the evolution
of the human brain.

64
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,439
That is instead of thinking
about how we dealt with the

65
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,889
environment, to think about
how we dealt with

66
00:02:56,889 --> 00:03:00,219
intraspecific competition.

67
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:02,800
Intraspecific competition is
competition with other humans.

68
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,380
It's humans versus humans.

69
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,710
It's things like, not just
plotting against them and

70
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:12,960
deceiving them and things like
that, but also cooperating.

71
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,030
Sometimes we call these social
forces that lead to evolution

72
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,310
of the brain.

73
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,180
One of the earliest versions
of the social forces

74
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,280
explanation is called
the Machiavellian

75
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,180
intelligence thesis.

76
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,520
Now, it's named after Niccolo
Machiavelli, who was a

77
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,370
political philosopher, who
wrote a book called The

78
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,349
Prince, back in the 1500s.

79
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:41,930
In The Prince, Machiavelli
advises a political leader to

80
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,580
ruthlessly keep power through
every means at his disposal,

81
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,940
alliance, betrayal, deceit, all
of the tricks that could

82
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:52,490
possibly be used to keep
yourself in power.

83
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:56,920
The primatologist, Frans de
Waal, studied chimpanzees.

84
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:59,649
And he realised that chimpanzee
social life

85
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,730
required the same sorts of
skills that Machiavelli tried

86
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:04,169
to teach to the prince.

87
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:09,049
That is, alliance building,
cooperation, deception showing

88
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,260
false fronts, not expressing
anger when you felt it.

89
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:15,459
And so Frans de Waal said that
the chimpanzee social life,

90
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,389
just like our ancestors' social
life, would have needed

91
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:20,519
Machiavellian intelligence.

92
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,310
It's not just that primates
lived in groups.

93
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,030
I mean ants live in groups and
they don't get extravagant

94
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:26,979
intelligence.

95
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,370
It's that primates, like
chimpanzees, us, and our

96
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,629
ancestors, live in complex
social groups, with shifting

97
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:35,980
alliances and changing roles.

98
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,129
Your role one day may not
be role the next.

99
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:40,500
The person who stands by you one
day, may not be the same

100
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,870
person who stands
by you the next.

101
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,879
So you have to keep track
of a lot of information.

102
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:47,219
And so in some ways,
Machiavellian intelligence is

103
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,540
a form of social intelligence.

104
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,319
The reason we tend to call it
social intelligence now,

105
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,699
rather than Machiavellian, is
we try to recognise the

106
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:57,719
cooperation is just as important
as deception and

107
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,240
ruthlessness.

108
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,480
Social intelligence theory
suggests that human brain

109
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,340
evolution has been driven by a
kind of cognitive arms race.

110
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,839
That is, one individual's gain
becomes a pressure on other

111
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,429
individuals.

112
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,530
If you get to be trickier, then
all of the people in your

113
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:16,399
group, all of the individuals
in your group, have to also.

114
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,000
And this drives a
kind of cycle.

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,339
You might think of
it this way.

116
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:24,099
Our obsessive interest in each
other's business, gossip and

117
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,850
spying on each other, well,
that's kind of what drove our

118
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,600
ancestors to get more
intelligent.

119
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,340
The next time you see a gossip
magazine, it's interesting to

120
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:33,569
recognise that in some ways that
interest in each other's

121
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:36,199
business and talking about
each other, communicating

122
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,959
about each other, that might
have been what drove the very

123
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,579
intelligence that allows us to
read in the first place.

124
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:46,039
The advantage to a social
intelligence theory is because

125
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,330
of that intraspecific
competition, it can drive

126
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:51,159
really rapid change.

127
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,300
Each advance in the group
drives the next advance,

128
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,600
especially if you relax one of
the constraints on the trait.

129
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,350
Like for example, you get much
better at getting food for the

130
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,129
energy, you can really get a
rapid directional selection or

131
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:08,129
a change in a trait, much like
we see in the course of the

132
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:11,029
last 2 million years in human
and brain evolution.

133
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:13,879
Some theorists suggest that one
possibility of explaining

134
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,980
this large, this really
rapid human brain

135
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,350
growth, is sexual selection.

136
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,450
That is that mate preference
or direct competition among

137
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,245
males might have driven the
brains to get larger.

138
00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:29,449
Now, a problem with this is,
as we discussed in the last

139
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:32,589
module, what would you expect
if sexual selection or made

140
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:34,574
choice was really the
thing that was

141
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:35,370
driving brain evolution?

142
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,840
Well, you'd expect human brains
to be asymmetrical,

143
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:41,859
much like a silverback gorilla's
muscles or a

144
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,600
peacock's tail.

145
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,840
You'd expect males to have much
larger brains, especially

146
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,679
considering the explosive
growth in the

147
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,600
last 2 million years.

148
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,730
But what do you really find?

149
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:53,020
Well, you don't find that
kind of change.

150
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:55,539
Human brains are actually pretty
close, male and female,

151
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,950
once you take into account the
fact that males are just

152
00:06:57,949 --> 00:06:59,599
bigger than females.

153
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,730
You find that brains
are pretty close.

154
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,140
But the reason I think it's
worth considering sexual

155
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,740
selection is that if we think
about it, what would females

156
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,805
need in order to be able to
pick intelligent males?

157
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,759
Well, they'd need intelligence
too.

158
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:15,409
I mean the only way to really
figure out if a male is

159
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,420
actually intelligent or if he's
just faking it, is if

160
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,480
you're intelligent too.

161
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,660
So the tool for the selector
is the same as the trait

162
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,060
that's being selected.

163
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:30,120
And we call this symmetrical
sexual selection.

164
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,990
That is that the tool being
used to select is the same

165
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,639
trait that's being selected.

166
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,139
In this case, both males and
females would be applying

167
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:41,750
sexual pressure to this
trait of intelligence.

168
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,279
At this point, I think that the
best explanation for human

169
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:46,369
brain growth is some combination
of all of the

170
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,600
forces we've been discussing,
external pressures, changes in

171
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,170
diet, ecology, our range;
internal pressures, social

172
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,830
competition, cooperation,
even sexual selection.

173
00:07:56,829 --> 00:08:00,459
All of these together would go
towards pushing our ancestors'

174
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:03,819
brains to develop more and more
advanced, more and more

175
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:05,259
elaborately.

176
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:07,529
Now, the next topic we're going
to talk about, what this

177
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,299
actually means for the changes
in our technology.

178
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,270
We're going to talk about how
the brain escalates the need

179
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:15,519
for intelligence.

180
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,487
