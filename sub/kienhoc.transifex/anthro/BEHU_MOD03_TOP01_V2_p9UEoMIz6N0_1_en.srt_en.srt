[PLAYING MUSIC]

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,135
Why bother to have sex at all?

4
00:00:12,134 --> 00:00:13,550
Now, I know what you're
thinking.

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,600
You're thinking he's probably
doing it wrong.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,780
But from an evolutionary
perspective, we could

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,890
reproduce without sex.

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,589
There are lots of species
that do it.

9
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:24,789
They reproduce asexually
or through what we call

10
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:26,050
parthenogenesis.

11
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,789
In some cases, there are
species of lizards,

12
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:31,890
amphibians, reptiles,
that simply have no

13
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,380
males in the species.

14
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,050
And there are some spaces that
can, under duress, produce

15
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:40,349
either sexually or asexually,
like hammerhead sharks or

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,570
Komodo dragons.

17
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,850
Although asexual reproduction
may not sound like a lot of

18
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,890
fun, from an evolutionary
perspective

19
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,520
it's kind of a win.

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,590
Sexual reproduction means that
you're mixing your DNA with

21
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,630
the DNA of the other parent,
whether it's male or female.

22
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,859
So really, your offspring only
have half of your DNA.

23
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:01,829
If your genes were just being
selfish, well then sex kind of

24
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,549
doesn't make sense.

25
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:06,629
In addition, sex limits the
rate of reproduction.

26
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:09,009
It means that half of the
population is just

27
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,020
contributing to the
reproduction

28
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:10,890
of the other half.

29
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,159
So it halves the reproductive
rate of a species.

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,979
More importantly, there's some
circumstances in which you

31
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,240
simply can't find a mate.

32
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,489
If you're washed up alone on
a desert island and you

33
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:22,609
reproduce through
parthenogenesis, you can

34
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:23,950
repopulate that island.

35
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,829
But if you reproduce sexually,
the island is going to be a

36
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:28,950
desert again as soon
as you pass away.

37
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:35,040
Put simply, the cost of sexual
reproduction is males.

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,430
If you reproduce asexually,
you just don't need them.

39
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,360
But sex has been around
for a billion years.

40
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,540
So it must be good
for something.

41
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,660
We don't really know any more
why it first arose.

42
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,090
But over time, we've accumulated
a number of

43
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,510
advantages because we
reproduce sexually.

44
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,770
The key to understanding the
importance of sexual

45
00:01:53,769 --> 00:01:56,469
reproduction is that first of
all, it's not just about fun.

46
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:59,939
There are ecological and
evolutionary reasons why

47
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,679
sexual reproduction
is an advantage.

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,840
The first is recombination.

49
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,620
Recombination is the mixing of
your DNA, if you're one of the

50
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,689
parents, with the DNA
of the other parent.

51
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:14,259
From an evolutionary
perspective, recombination

52
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,599
means you pass on less of your
own DNA, but you may be

53
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,590
passing it on into more
viable offspring.

54
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,550
First and probably foremost,

55
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,960
recombination produces variation.

56
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,640
Because of recombination,
offspring are not identical

57
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:29,409
clones of either of
their parents.

58
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:31,409
They're a new mixture
of the DNA.

59
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:34,049
And even in the case of
identical twins, there are

60
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,280
slight genetic differences
between all the offspring.

61
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,930
Recombination also allows new
genetic variation, new traits

62
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,560
that are selectively
advantageous to get passed on,

63
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,655
including to cross, so that
multiple new traits can emerge

64
00:02:48,655 --> 00:02:51,330
from different parents in
these family trees.

65
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,610
This facet of recombination is
such an advantage that some

66
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:59,180
asexually reproducing, single
cell animals, will actually

67
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,409
pass genetic material laterally
from one to another

68
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:04,539
to try to get the
same advantage.

69
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:06,699
Recombination can also
act as a kind of

70
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:08,549
genetic repair mechanism.

71
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,830
Because you can get copies of
a gene from both of your

72
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,469
parents, if one of them is
defective, there's a

73
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:16,020
possibility that it won't
be a fatal flaw.

74
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,719
This allows us to kind of
clean up certain genetic

75
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:22,270
defects over time through
recombination.

76
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,600
In the cases where we don't
have it, like with the Y

77
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,889
chromosome, because you only
get it from your father in

78
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:31,709
males, well, the defects and the
copy errors can actually

79
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,120
accumulate over time.

80
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,969
And in fact, the Y chromosome
in males is likely to become

81
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:39,020
defective in a few million years
time because of the slow

82
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,450
accumulation of genetic
defects.

83
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:43,780
The advantage of sexual
reproduction and genetic

84
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,009
recombination, however, is not
just this kind of variation

85
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:48,239
and genetic repair.

86
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,000
It also makes a species a
kind of moving target.

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,889
Genetically, each individual
is distinct.

88
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:57,299
Now, there are other animals out
there, other living forms

89
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,630
that are trying to crack
your code right now.

90
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:00,829
There are viruses.

91
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,990
There's bacteria.

92
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,980
There's parasites.

93
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:04,319
Don't look behind you.

94
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,250
And they're trying to
figure out your DNA.

95
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,849
But because each individual
is distinct, each one is

96
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,989
different, it makes it harder
for those fast reproducing

97
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,370
species to figure out
what's going to

98
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,949
get through our defences.

99
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:21,209
We call this the Red Queen
theory, named for the Red

100
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,500
Queen of Wonderland in Lewis
Carroll's book, Through the

101
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,000
Looking Glass.

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,920
In the book, Alice and the Red
Queen are in a race, running

103
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,629
as fast as they can.

104
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:32,719
And Alice at one point realises
that she doesn't seem

105
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,820
to be changing places.

106
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:36,079
Everyone is staying in exactly
the same place, even though

107
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,699
she's panting and running
as fast as she can.

108
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,519
Alice says, well in our country,
you generally get to

109
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,269
somewhere else, if you ran very
fast for a long time.

110
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:48,639
The queen responded to her,
a slow sort of country.

111
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,449
Now here, you see it takes all
the running you can do to keep

112
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:53,329
in the very same place.

113
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:56,399
Evolution is a bit like this
race between Alice and the Red

114
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,649
Queen, where species have to
run as fast as they can to

115
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:01,049
stay in one place.

116
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,939
Even a species that looks like
it's not changing, in fact may

117
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:08,540
be undergoing constant variation
and change, or else

118
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:13,300
the predators, the viruses, the
bacteria will catch up.

119
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,270
A species like the horseshoe
crab, which is apparently

120
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:19,609
unchanged over millions of
years, in fact if we look at

121
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,600
it more closely, has a
surprising amount of

122
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,730
underlying genetic variation.

123
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,560
The reason is quite simple.

124
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,240
If a species reproduces through
cloning, unless its

125
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,910
generations go incredibly fast,
it can be a kind of

126
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,130
sitting target.

127
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:35,689
And it'll take on a heavy
parasite load.

128
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:38,649
It's be quickly infected by
viruses and other sorts of

129
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:42,129
things if it doesn't have some
kind of genetic defence.

130
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:44,740
Sexual reproduction also
produces its own kind of

131
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,040
selective pressure.

132
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,030
We call this sexual selection.

133
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:53,039
Sexual selection is the
intraspecific competition,

134
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,850
that is the competition
with members of your

135
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,950
own species to reproduce.

136
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:00,170
Sexual selection arises because
there's a chance that

137
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,280
not every member of a species
will get to reproduce.

138
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,449
For an example of sexual
selection, imagine a peacock.

139
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,360
This is an example that
gave Darwin fits.

140
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,069
During the height of mating
season, the male peacock drags

141
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:14,430
around an enormous plume
of feathers.

142
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,410
Bright, incandescent, the tail
is so long it makes it

143
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,670
difficult for it to fly or get
away from competitors.

144
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,030
And it's so bright that it's
easy to pick out in the bush

145
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:24,319
or in the forest.

146
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,939
You can see it very clearly.

147
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:28,939
Darwin at first couldn't
understand how an animal with

148
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:32,129
this kind of trait could
possibly survive.

149
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:34,202
If you've ever been around them
during mating season, you

150
00:06:34,202 --> 00:06:36,439
know that peacocks are even
more absurd in person than

151
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,589
they are in photos.

152
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:40,419
Because when they see a peahen,
or something they

153
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,020
think vaguely resembles a
peahen, like a dog or a horse

154
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:46,180
or even their own reflection
in a plate glass mirror, it

155
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,199
shrieks and it does this
sort of shimmying

156
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,279
dance back and forth.

157
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,689
It looks absurd.

158
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:55,189
But it turns out that the male
peacock is engaged in a kind

159
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:57,529
of competition for
the attentions of

160
00:06:57,529 --> 00:06:59,449
the peahen, the female.

161
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:02,079
We realise what they're doing is
they are engaged in a kind

162
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,729
of sexual display.

163
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,310
The males in a sense are
auditioning for the females.

164
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,889
They are engaged in a kind of
sexual selection that we call

165
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,199
mate choice.

166
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,829
The females choose which
males they mate with.

167
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:20,050
And so the preferences of the
females become accentuated in

168
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,470
the males that successfully
reproduce.

169
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,400
To successfully reproduce if
you're a male, you need a very

170
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:28,329
bright, fancy tail.

171
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:30,800
We know how mate choice
affects peacocks.

172
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,270
Because in some cases,
researchers have taken

173
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:36,729
peacocks who have been very
successful and they've cut off

174
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,110
some of the eyes of their tails

175
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,870
during one mating season.

176
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,170
And the peacock studs kind
of turn to peacock duds.

177
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,120
And they don't get to reproduce
because their tails

178
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,410
aren't as impressive.

179
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,460
Now, it's not just tails that
animals use for this.

180
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:52,629
In all kinds of species we find
mate choice for traits

181
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:57,250
like elaborate songs, for
decoration of their nests, for

182
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,279
very fancy mating dances.

183
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,369
These are all forms of sexual
display, of reproductive

184
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,509
display, that are affected
by mate choice.

185
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:07,189
This is one way that
sexual selection

186
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:09,529
can affect a species.

187
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:12,449
In the next topic, we're going
to be talking about another

188
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:15,219
way that sexual selection can
affect a species, which is

189
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,470
through direct competition.

190
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,207
