[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,995 --> 00:00:06,839
How to explain variation
and inheritance?

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,689
Genetics.

4
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:12,669
During Darwin's lifetime,
although he had supporters,

5
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:15,710
many of them didn't accept the
centre piece of his theory,

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,320
natural selection.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,620
The reason was Darwin had a
hard time explaining how

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,570
variation and inheritance
worked.

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,580
It's not surprising.

10
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:24,459
Nobody could explain
it at the time.

11
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,179
Darwin, like a lot of his
contemporaries, believed in

12
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:28,940
mixed inheritance.

13
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,420
They believed that an offspring
basically inherited

14
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,539
part of its traits from its
mother and its father.

15
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:34,909
They mixed together.

16
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:38,829
The problem with this is that,
over time, if you keep mixing

17
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:43,349
inheritance, you actually
get decreased variation.

18
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,070
Think of it this way.

19
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,829
If you bring together a mother
and father who are different,

20
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:50,269
all the offspring would be an
intermediate between the

21
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,590
mother and the father.

22
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,720
Its like if you mixed paints.

23
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,129
If you kept mixing paints over
and over again, eventually you

24
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,719
basically wind up with one muddy
brown colour, right in

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,109
the middle.

26
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:03,619
This problem didn't
escape Darwin.

27
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:04,929
And it didn't escape
his contemporaries.

28
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,210
In fact, one of the early
critics of On the Origin of

29
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:10,159
Species pointed out the problem,
that with mixed

30
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,609
inheritance, you basically
get rid of variation.

31
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:15,760
The problem wasn't evolutionary
theory, or the

32
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,920
theory of natural selection.

33
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,060
It was this understanding
of inheritance.

34
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,469
It took the discovery of
genetics, basically, to

35
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:25,329
realise that offsprings
we're not a pure mix

36
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:27,170
of their two parents.

37
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,049
At the same time that Darwin
was writing his books, and

38
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:33,659
being a famous naturalist in
London, a monk, a German Friar

39
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,859
named Gregor Mendel was doing
the research that would help

40
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:38,989
us to understand inheritance
and genetics.

41
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:41,059
But he was laboring
in obscurity.

42
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,019
Mendel planted thousands of pea
plants in a experimental

43
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:46,549
garden in his monastery.

44
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:48,709
He wanted to understand how
inheritance worked.

45
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:52,219
And so he carefully controlled
how the peas reproduced.

46
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:53,450
Peas reproduce sexually.

47
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,700
So he controlled which pea
plants pollinated the other

48
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,480
plans to produce offspring.

49
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,620
His project was unprecedented.

50
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,480
In less than a decade, he
planted and carefully studied

51
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,790
over 30,000 pea plants.

52
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,310
Mendel discovered that the
plants reproduced in a kind of

53
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,599
fixed and predictable way.

54
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:13,599
For example, if you took a plant
that was pure bred, and

55
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,780
had a smooth skinned pea on
it, and took another plant

56
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,319
that had a wrinkly skin pea on
it, and you cross bred them,

57
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,530
the children were always
smooth skinned.

58
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,860
We call this the
dominant trait.

59
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,450
Because if you've got a parent
with the dominant trait,

60
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:33,959
you're always going to get
that dominant trait.

61
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,480
However, this is where
it gets interesting.

62
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,909
Mendel discovered that if he
took these second generation

63
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,810
pea plants and he cross bred
them, what he got in the next

64
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,090
generation was pretty
surprising.

65
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,629


66
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:52,019
He got three smooth skinned
pea plans and one wrinkle

67
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,670
skinned pea plant.

68
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:56,049
That was pretty surprising.

69
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,520
What he realised was that the
second generation, even though

70
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,010
they looked like their father
or their mother with the

71
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:05,560
dominant, in fact they were
carrying hidden within them

72
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,729
the traits that were masked
by this trait.

73
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:12,229
We call this the recessive
trait.

74
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:16,329
The recessive trait, turns out,
is being carried masked,

75
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,830
unexpressed, in that
second generation.

76
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,040
If you keep crossing these pea
plans, the unexpressed

77
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,340
recessive trait keeps
popping up.

78
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,800
Why this is important
is that the

79
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,360
inheritance is not blending.

80
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,450
It's what we now call
particulate inheritance.

81
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:37,159
Particulate inheritance
means you get the

82
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,849
trait, whole or not.

83
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:40,519
You don't get a mix.

84
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,870
Darwin and his contemporaries
were wrong.

85
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,219
Sexual reproduction didn't
cause a muddying

86
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:48,099
or erasure of variation.

87
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:49,769
The variation, in fact, you
could be carried on

88
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,969
unexpressed in the genes
of what looked like

89
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:54,009
the dominant trait.

90
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:56,719
The simplest example of
particulate inheritance is

91
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,539
actually whether you're
male or female.

92
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:01,780
In the vast majority of cases,
you don't get a mixture of the

93
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,870
mother's and father's traits.

94
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,750
You either get a male
or a female.

95
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,180
That's a kind of particulate
inheritance.

96
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,550
Mendel gave up his research when
he got promoted to the

97
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,150
head of his abbot.

98
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,480
But his research was essential
when it was discovered later.

99
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,649
Because these ratios helped
Mendel to figure

100
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,620
out what was happening.

101
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,810
We now call Mendel's discoveries
the theories of

102
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,730
Mendellian inheritance.

103
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,300
And there's two basic points.

104
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,160
The first is this idea of
dominance and recessiveness,

105
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,040
the idea that if you get a
trait, you get a trait

106
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,040
particulately.

107
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,230
And the dominant can
mask the recessive.

108
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,310
So you can pass on a trait, even
though it's not expressed

109
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,720
in yourself.

110
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,570
The second law of Mendellian
inheritance is what we call

111
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:46,569
independent assortment.

112
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:49,219
Independent assortment is the
idea that you don't pass on

113
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,310
all your traits as a package.

114
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,829
You can get one dominant
trait from one parent,

115
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:55,050
and one from another.

116
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,340
And so the traits tend
to shuffle from one

117
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,750
generation to the next.

118
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,540
You don't look exactly like your
father, or exactly like

119
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:01,920
your mother.

120
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,810
You combine traits from both.

121
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,959
That's independent assortment.

122
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:08,449
Only some traits behave
in exactly the way

123
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:09,740
described by Mendel.

124
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,810
That is, they have these
discrete states where you're

125
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,389
just one or the other.

126
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:17,779
You're either smooth skinned
or you're wrinkled skin.

127
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:20,159
Most traits are a little more
complicated than this.

128
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,490
Oftentimes they're continuous.

129
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,920
Continuous traits are not just
one state or the other.

130
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,439
Like for example, human
skin colour.

131
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,819
We don't have two colours.

132
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:31,069
We have a whole spectrum
of colours.

133
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:34,459
These traits tend
to be polygenic.

134
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,259
They're controlled by
more than one gene.

135
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:40,569
Multiple genes contribute
to that expression.

136
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:42,759
In the next topic, we're going
to talk about the modern

137
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,730
synthesis, how we pulled
together the stuff from

138
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,550
genetics with evolutionary
theory.

139
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,800
