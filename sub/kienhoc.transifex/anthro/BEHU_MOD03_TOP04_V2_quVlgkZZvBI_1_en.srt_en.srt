00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:12,629
This topic is Bodies
Don't Lie--

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,100
the Truth About Monogamy.

5
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:17,570
Comparison helps us to see
more clearly what kind of

6
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,310
selective pressure, especially
sexual selective pressure, our

7
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:21,549
ancestors were under.

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,589
So let's take a close look
at men's bodies,

9
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:24,759
but not just humans--

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,770
of our closest cousins, too.

11
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:30,070
First, gorillas--

12
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,189
male gorillas really have small

13
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,960
testicles and short penises.

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,899
No one brings it up, though,
with them, because they're

15
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,719
such huge piles of muscle.

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,449
In contrast, a male chimpanzee
has huge testicles.

17
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,990
And in fact, even though it's
a quarter of the size of a

18
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,679
gorilla, the chimpanzee male
testicles are four times the

19
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:51,740
size of its cousins.

20
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,079
These impressively large
testicles allow the male chimp

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,329
to have sex four or five times
a day without its sperm count

22
00:00:58,329 --> 00:00:59,399
really dropping off at all.

23
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,609
Now, that sounds pretty
impressive until you hear that

24
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,140
a lion can mate 75 times a
day during mating season.

25
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,670
Why this huge difference
between gorillas' and

26
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,280
chimpanzees' testicles?

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,180
Well, it's because chimpanzees
engage in something we call

28
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,750
sperm competition.

29
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,390
When a female is fertile, she
will mate with multiple

30
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,099
different males in the group.

31
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:22,729
A dominant male may try to keep
the other males away, but

32
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,910
it's pretty much a lost cause.

33
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:28,219
For example, primatologist
Jane Goodall observed one

34
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:32,510
fertile female who mated 84
times with seven different

35
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,329
males over the eight days
that she was fertile.

36
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:39,909
With all of this mating going
on, for the males extra sperm

37
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:43,030
is kind of like more raffle
tickets in a raffle.

38
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,920
If his sperm is the one that
successfully fertilises the

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,540
egg, he has an offspring.

40
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,680
Chimpanzees have been engaged
in so much sperm competition

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,820
since we last shared an ancestor
that a lot of their

42
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:57,299
sperm doesn't even look suitable
to fertilise an egg.

43
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,049
It looks more like it's there
in order to compete with, or

44
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:04,659
to fight with, the sperm
from the other males.

45
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:08,689
As much as 99% of chimpanzee
sperm may actually be there

46
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:12,359
just to impede the progress of
other chimpanzees' sperm.

47
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,500
Another way to look at the
difference is that the sexual

48
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,870
competition between male
gorillas gets settled head to

49
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,200
head, first to fist, before
the mating even occurs.

50
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:26,280
In contrast, with chimpanzees,
females just mate with all the

51
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,490
males and let the sperm sort out
which one is the fittest.

52
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,700
Since chimpanzees and gorillas
shared a common ancestor,

53
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:35,819
they've been engaged in very
different sexual selection

54
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,340
over the course of their
evolutionary development.

55
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,110
Human males don't
look like either

56
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,600
chimpanzees or gorillas.

57
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,710
On the one hand, we don't have
the sperm competition.

58
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,890
Or clearly, our ancestors
didn't have the sperm

59
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:47,759
competition.

60
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,439
The chimpanzees did, because
we don't have nearly their

61
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:52,400
testicular endowment.

62
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,980
On the other hand, our bodies--
male bodies--

63
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:58,280
seem to anticipate the
possibility that our partners

64
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,129
have actually had other
pairings, other matings, while

65
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:03,159
we were away.

66
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:05,759
If we're apart from our partner
for a long period of

67
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,969
time, our sperm count we come
back is as much as three times

68
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:13,280
higher than when we are mating
with them normally.

69
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,849
It's as though our bodies
anticipate the possibility

70
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:18,789
that we've been cuckolded, or
that our partner has taken

71
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:21,189
another partner while
we were way.

72
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:23,789
On the other hand, males aren't
terribly endowed,

73
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:25,459
really, testicularly--

74
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,800
no offence.

75
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,790
You can try to go multiple times
a day, but you're no

76
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:30,969
chimpanzee.

77
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:33,169
After the first time you have
sex, your sperm count is going

78
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:34,819
to drop off precipitously.

79
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:36,430
The second and third time--

80
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:41,569
by the third time, you're
basically infertile.

81
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:44,759
If you have six more than three
and a half times a week,

82
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:47,689
your sperm count is going to,
on average, be lower.

83
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:51,219
Our cultural ideals may be that
men are supposed to sow

84
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:52,849
their wild oats.

85
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:57,219
But evolution has actually given
us very few oats to sow.

86
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:59,189
But an even more interesting
little detail that tells us

87
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:03,579
something about our ancestors'
mating is penis size.

88
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,340
Gorillas have a three
centimetre penis.

89
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,806
Chimpanzees are more in the
neighbourhood of eight

90
00:04:11,806 --> 00:04:13,260
centimetres.

91
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:18,009
And humans, on average, have
about a 13 centimetre penis,

92
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:22,740
if you ask the scientists and
not the men themselves.

93
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,840
So the human penis is
pretty unusual.

94
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,689
Not only is it
disproportionately long and

95
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:31,250
thick for a primate,
but it also doesn't

96
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,980
have a penile bone.

97
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,530
Most primates have a penile
spine that actually keeps the

98
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:37,449
penis stiff.

99
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:42,349
In contrast, humans have these
really odd hydraulic-powered,

100
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,100
long, thick penises.

101
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,510
Now, we don't really know
for sure why we have

102
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:48,099
such unusual equipment.

103
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,629
It may be for sperm
competition.

104
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:52,560
It may be a way of removing
the sperm of a competitor.

105
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,610
But one possibility is that,
actually, human penises have

106
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,819
been subjected to mate choice.

107
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:01,420
Female humans have been
choosing, in essence, that

108
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,550
males develop this really
unusual plumbing.

109
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,290
If we look at the evidence from
male humans' bodies, we

110
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,150
find some evidence about how our
ancestors may have mated.

111
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:12,500
And it may not be what
some people think.

112
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,680
In 1967, for example, Desmond
Morris, in the book The Naked

113
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,850
Ape, argued confidently that the
whole evolutionary purpose

114
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,129
of human sexuality, which is
pretty unusual, was to

115
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:24,629
strengthen the family
bonds and to

116
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:26,810
maintain this pair coupling.

117
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,899
He thought that human sexuality

118
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:31,419
was to maintain monogamy.

119
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,199
In fact, now that we have
genetic research, we look at

120
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,759
other species, even, that we
thought were monogamous, and

121
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,889
what we find instead is often
extra pair couplings,

122
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:43,409
especially in times when
the females are

123
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,840
at their most fertile.

124
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:49,649
For example, we now know that
gibbons, a primate species

125
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,689
that we used to think was
extremely monogamous--

126
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:55,410
the females are most likely to
engage in extra pair couplings

127
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,030
at the time of their season when
they are most fertile.

128
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:01,839
Some researchers have
controversially argued that

129
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,909
this is actually a kind
of strategy--

130
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,540
that a female will find a male
partner for long term support

131
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,420
in raising children, but at
times, she will actually go

132
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,819
and find other males who may be
superior genetically to the

133
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:15,980
superior children.

134
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,270
So she will, in essence,
have a kind of

135
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:20,639
diversified mating strategy.

136
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,310
Supporters of this theory
actually look to evidence from

137
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,129
Western societies like
the United States,

138
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:26,550
Australia, and the UK.

139
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,689
Some of the evidence was
discovered inadvertently in

140
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,129
medical studies.

141
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:32,540
Researchers have often found
that when you look at birth

142
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,510
certificates and the biology
of the children, sometimes,

143
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:38,129
the father listed on the birth
certificate could not possibly

144
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:40,519
be the biological father
of the child.

145
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:43,779
As many as 5% to 10% of all
the birth certificates in

146
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,899
these research projects have
shown to have been the result

147
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:51,060
of what we're euphemistically
calling extra pair couplings.

148
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,060
Even when we look at something
like female orgasm, it may

149
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,959
possibly be a kind
of adaptation to

150
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,449
having multiple partners.

151
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:00,569
During orgasm, the sperm of a
preferred partner may be more

152
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:02,550
likely to impregnate a woman.

153
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,949
The point of all this is to
suggest that when we look at

154
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:07,800
our bodies, what we find is
evolutionary evidence of

155
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,840
complex mating strategies that
aren't necessarily what we

156
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:14,609
think based upon our cultural
ideals, our norms, even our

157
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,509
dreams of what marriage
should be like.

158
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:20,039
If we look more closely, what we
find is that our bodies are

159
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,670
telling us one thing, but that
doesn't necessarily tell us

160
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,400
what we have to do.

161
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,060
Our next topic is going to be
about our babies and how

162
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,569
they've really shaped
what we become.

163
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:29,932
