[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:12,589
The German evolutionary
biologist August Weismann

3
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:14,820
rediscovered Gregor
Mendel's research.

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,699
And he realised that what was
going on was that you could

5
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,230
only pass on what was
in your germ cells.

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,089
That is, your sperm
or your eggs.

7
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:26,210
Nothing that happened to you
during your life, unless it

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,199
affected the sperm or
eggs, would get

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,809
passed on to your children.

10
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:32,679
The child of a weight lifter
wouldn't pass on that bodily

11
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:35,450
adaptation, because it wasn't
in his sperm or eggs.

12
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,230
Lamarck was dead wrong.

13
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:40,509
We call this the Weismann
barrier.

14
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:43,119
The Weismann barrier means
acquired traits can't be

15
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:45,000
passed on genetically.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,280
To prove it, Weismann
took mice.

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,429
And he cut off their tails.

18
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:50,100
And then he cut off their
children's tails.

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,960
And he did it over and over
again, generation after

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,789
generation.

21
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:56,700
Six generations of mice,
and still mice

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,179
were born with tails.

23
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:00,409
We now know it's a little bit
more complicated than this.

24
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:03,750
But Weismann's ideas really
shaped the way we understood

25
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,129
genetic inheritance
and evolution.

26
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:09,509
By the 1940s, biologists working
across a wide realm of

27
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,280
disciplines, from genetics to
evolution, could see their

28
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,430
research flowing together in
what Julian Huxley called the

29
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,440
modern synthesis.

30
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:22,429
The modern synthesis was the
coming together of Darwinian

31
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,560
evolutionary theory with
Mendellian genetics.

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,920
According to the modern
synthesis, to understand

33
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,250
evolution, you didn't focus
on the individual.

34
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,519
You focused instead on the
population, the total group of

35
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:38,030
a species, over time, over
many generations.

36
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,590
To go back to our example of
the staphylococcus, what

37
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,630
really mattered was not what
happened to any one individual

38
00:01:44,629 --> 00:01:47,259
microbe or bacteria.

39
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,750
What was more important was
whether they reproduced.

40
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,109
What they did during their
lifetime didn't

41
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:53,280
really affect the genes.

42
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,349
All that really mattered was
whether they reproduced a

43
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:58,829
little, or whether they
reproduced a lot.

44
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:01,959
If they reproduced a lot, then
the gene pool would have lots

45
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:06,479
of their genes in the
next generation.

46
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,229
If they were unsuccessful at
reproducing, then their traits

47
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,070
might disappear from the
population in the next

48
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:13,229
generation.

49
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:15,819
This was the modern synthesis
perspective.

50
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:19,229
Evolution was natural selection
working not on the

51
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:22,539
individual, but on the
total gene pool.

52
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:25,269
What you did during your life
didn't really matter.

53
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,980
What mattered is, did you pass
your genes on to the next

54
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:28,989
generation?

55
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,080
Did your germ cells
gets passed on?

56
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,120
Because that's what shaped the
gene pool of the future.

57
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,080
The gene pool was this total
genetic variation of the

58
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,630
population.

59
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:42,129
The discovery of DNA helped
convince biologists they were

60
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,879
on the right track.

61
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:48,000
DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid,
which is a complicated way of

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,930
saying it's a very
complex molecule.

63
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,040
It's composed of two spines,
like a letter.

64
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,379
And in between which
there are steps.

65
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:58,064
These are sugar phosphate
chains.

66
00:02:58,064 --> 00:03:01,340
But what's really important
is what's in between them.

67
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,129
These are the base pairs.

68
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:07,740
They form a code, which is
used by the cell to build

69
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,340
amino acids.

70
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,879
These molecules are huge.

71
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,289
A DNA in a human has 3 billion
base pairs, these little steps

72
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:17,189
on the ladder of the molecule.

73
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:19,900
The DNA molecule is like a
giant pattern book for

74
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,650
building amino acids.

75
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,590
Biologist realised that new
variations could be introduced

76
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,150
if there was a mutation
in the DNA.

77
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,990
A mutation arises when, as the
DNA molecule opens up in order

78
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,920
to produce a copy of itself,
sometimes a section either

79
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,619
gets deleted, it gets
transcribed erroneously.

80
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,200
Sometimes it gets flipped.

81
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:43,539
Or it can even get copied
multiple times, accidentally.

82
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:46,219
This can create new traits,
or modify the

83
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:48,590
existing traits of a species.

84
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,830
For example, we know that our
ancestors, as they begin to

85
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,600
lose their body hair in Africa,
developed dark skin.

86
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,479
They had to, to protect
themselves from the sun.

87
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,259
At least three times since then,
a kind of mutation has

88
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:04,590
happened that's affected the
melanin production in the skin

89
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,590
that has led to white coloured
skin, or light coloured skin.

90
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,780
There's at least one separate
variation that's happened in

91
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,159
Neanderthals, one that's
happened in Europeans, and a

92
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,409
separate one that's happened
in Asians.

93
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:16,959
A slight change in this DNA
code has affected the

94
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,930
production of the pigmentation
in our skin, which has allowed

95
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,709
our ancestors, who got light
skin, to survive in areas

96
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:25,359
where there wasn't enough light
to produce the vitamin D

97
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,449
they needed if they
had dark skin.

98
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:29,189
This genetic code is crucial.

99
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:31,639
And sequencing the human genome
it's probably one of

100
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:34,099
the greatest scientific
achievements of the past 20

101
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,580
years, really.

102
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:38,990
But the surprising thing was,
when it was sequenced in 2003,

103
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,110
and scientists looked for areas
of the genome that were

104
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:47,569
coding that produced proteins,
they found only 21,000 protein

105
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:50,589
coding areas on this
gigantic molecule.

106
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:51,769
That may sound like a lot.

107
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:54,209
But it's basically the same as
for any complicated life

108
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:56,044
form-- for fruit bats--

109
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,350
it just wasn't that much.

110
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,110
And the vast majority of DNA
didn't seem to be coding for

111
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,819
any proteins.

112
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:04,810
At first, scientists thought
that these non coding parts of

113
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,530
the DNA, the parts
that weren't this

114
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:08,829
21,000, we're junk DNA.

115
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:12,279
As much as 98.5% of
our DNA was junk.

116
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,769
We now know that's not true.

117
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:16,279
A lot of this DNA a is doing
all sorts of things.

118
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:19,250
For example, some of it
regulates the activity of the

119
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,589
areas that actually
produce proteins.

120
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:24,500
Parts of the DNA molecule
actually regulate other parts

121
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
of the DNA molecule.

122
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,189
We're making enormous strides
in understanding how this

123
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:32,600
genetic code expresses itself,
and how evolution works on

124
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,470
this code to shape every
species on the planet.

125
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,765
We're a little less confident
now than Weismann was back in

126
00:05:38,764 --> 00:05:41,250
the early part genetics that
the things we do during our

127
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,899
life can't affect our DNA.

128
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:44,839
But I would say that nothing
we've learned has

129
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:47,699
fundamentally changed the modern
synthesis, that we need

130
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:51,259
to understand evolution as
natural selection working on a

131
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:54,139
population, not just
individuals.

132
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:58,360
On some fundamental level, being
human just really means

133
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,319
contributing your DNA, or not,
into the gene pool that is our

134
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,050
species, into the future.

135
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,250
Our next topic is going to be
that we're going to talk about

136
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,139
other forms of inheritance,
including epigenetic

137
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,389
inheritance.

138
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:11,889
