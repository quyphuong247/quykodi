00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,199


2
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:13,149
Reproductive confusion, or the
benefits of not knowing when

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,480
to have sex, Getting help with
childcare, passing your baby

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,609
around to other adults, isn't
possible unless a mother has

5
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:24,119
real good confidence in
the adults around her.

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,800
If a rival female might kill it,
or if a male might neglect

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,199
it, well, it's just not possible
to do alloparenting.

8
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,570
Our nearest relatives aren't
very good at socially

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,520
cooperating to raise infants.

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,240
In fact, chimpanzees, for
example, have trouble sharing

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,990
food with their own children,
let alone with

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,810
somebody else's children.

13
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,840
However, there are primates that
do cooperatively parent,

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,360
and they're much better
at sharing.

15
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:49,789
We know, for example, human
foragers, are very good at

16
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:52,350
sharing food with an entire
group or tribe.

17
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,579
Cooperative parenting allowed
our infants to

18
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:56,100
grow up more slowly.

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,770
It provided the mother with
more support to keep the

20
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,609
infant provisioned as it
grew into childhood.

21
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:03,969
But it also allowed the mothers
to go back into the

22
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:07,679
reproductive pool more quickly
than their children became

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,810
independent.

24
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,299
This allowed that developmental
window, that

25
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:14,879
time when children are growing
so rapidly and their brains

26
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,869
are developing to extend and
actually become longer.

27
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,270
Without this change in
reproduction, we wouldn't be

28
00:01:20,269 --> 00:01:22,489
able to learn as much as we
do, we wouldn't be able to

29
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:24,500
develop our brains the way we
do, we wouldn't have the

30
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,989
technology that we have.

31
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:29,869
The change in reproduction was
a precondition for developing

32
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,620
our human way of life.

33
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,320
But our ancestors didn't know
they were doing this.

34
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,529
They were completely unaware
that there was this long, slow

35
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,189
sexual revolution happening.

36
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:41,090
They didn't know what
they were doing.

37
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,180
One of the most productive forms
of confusion that humans

38
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,210
have developed is that we
do not know when we are

39
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:48,449
reproductively viable.

40
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,370
We don't know when
to have sex.

41
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,420
I live on a farm with horses and
nothing could be clearer

42
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,739
to a horse than when
a mare is fertile.

43
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:58,599
In fact, kind of all
hell breaks lose.

44
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:01,750
The stallions are nuts, even the
geldings get excited, and

45
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,150
they've got to do.

46
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,109
But even the mares themselves,
they start to fight more than

47
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:09,479
usual, they'll spray each other
with a kind of pheromone

48
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,380
laced urine, which all
signals when they're

49
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:14,109
reproductively viable.

50
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,720
If you actually let a stallion
into a paddock with a mare in

51
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:20,250
heat, it's complete chaos.

52
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,159
Nothing else will matter to
the two of them except

53
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,329
deciding whether they're
going to mate until

54
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,090
they settle the question.

55
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,860
In many species, mating
is like this.

56
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,030
The females, they signal
when they're fertile.

57
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,099
They go through something
we called estrus.

58
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:37,009
This makes mating a compulsory
affair, even a kind of

59
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:38,419
temporary insanity.

60
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:40,679
In humans, it's not obvious.

61
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,280
Females don't signal very
clearly when they're

62
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,039
ovulating, when they're
most fertile.

63
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,169
In fact, in many cases, we have
no idea what's going on.

64
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,319
This can make women slightly
different during their period

65
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,319
of the month when they're
fertile, but for the most

66
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,739
part, I think the real takeaway
is that humans are

67
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,120
concealing their estrus.

68
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,379
They have concealed
their fertility.

69
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:06,389
We can go through a day
completely oblivious to

70
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:08,619
whether the woman sitting
alongside us in a cafe is

71
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,819
fertile or not.

72
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:12,519
I can even have a lecture with
hundreds of students in it,

73
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,469
and nobody is signalling to
the other students that

74
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:17,210
they've got an egg ready
to fertilise.

75
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,670
We're not the only species
does this, but given our

76
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:22,869
intelligence and our
perceptiveness, the degree to

77
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,530
which we conceal estrus, we
conceal fertility from

78
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,349
ourselves, would seem to be
maladaptive, unless something

79
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:30,109
else is going on.

80
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,370
The first thing to notice about
concealed estrus is it

81
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,259
in humans, females don't really
need to signal when

82
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,379
they're fertile for males to
be interested in them.

83
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:42,329
In some species, the males can
be genuinely ambivalent about

84
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,890
the presence of females, except
during that time of the

85
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:46,539
month when the females
are signalling

86
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:47,840
that they're fertile.

87
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,509
The same thing is true
for human women, too.

88
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:53,179
Just like men, they don't need
to be drunk on pheromones to

89
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,980
be interested in sex.

90
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:57,179
This isn't the case
with all species.

91
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,950
This kind of readiness for sex
may have acted as a kind of

92
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:01,289
social glue.

93
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:04,359
That is, males may have had
a more successful time

94
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,940
reproducing if they stuck
around the females.

95
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:10,129
First, to make sure that the
females didn't mate with

96
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:12,900
another male when they were
fertile, but also perhaps even

97
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,900
to share in the parenting.

98
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,100
Although remember, the mothers
had other alloparents, so they

99
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,740
didn't have to have males.

100
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,420
The third thing is estrus
has a cost.

101
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,580
In those species that have
it, the metabolic cost of

102
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:27,529
maintaining a large swelling,
the danger that you have,

103
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:29,959
getting extra diseases
or infections, you

104
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:30,870
pay a price for it.

105
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,920
So if you don't need it in some
cases, evolution might

106
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,009
actually make sense for
it to get rid of it.

107
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,579
Finally, concealing estrus
may have also

108
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,449
helped to confuse paternity.

109
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:44,009
And if females were using
concealing paternity to

110
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:46,240
protect their infants from the
chance that a male might

111
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,110
actually kill it, well this
would be a further insurance.

112
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,240
Concealing estrus would confuse
the potential fathers

113
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,389
about who was actually the
father of a child.

114
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:59,519
Concealing estrus, however,
had other social effects.

115
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,819
During female fertility in the
kinds of species that have

116
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:04,980
estrus, it can be a
pretty rough time.

117
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,620
Males fight with males for
dominance and for access to

118
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,340
females, males bully females
sometimes, trying to isolate

119
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:13,750
them from other males, or keep
them out of the group.

120
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,500
It can be a pretty rough time
to interact socially.

121
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,029
By concealing estrus, it may
have made it possible for

122
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:21,819
humans to spend more
time together.

123
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:24,509
With estrus, it's not just that
the lady next to its got

124
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:26,969
swollen buttocks, or she's
changed colours, or she's

125
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,160
pumping out pheromones.

126
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,080
It's what that estrus does
to the whole group.

127
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,949
In contrast, humans can gather
in large numbers without the

128
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:36,839
males fighting over the
ovulating females, if you know

129
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,649
what I mean.

130
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:40,370
We can tell when we compare
ourselves to our closest

131
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,040
relative, to the chimpanzees and
gorillas, that we haven't

132
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,939
been reproducing, and our
ancestors haven't been

133
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:48,439
reproducing like them for
millions of years.

134
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:52,529
We have the evidence of this
long, slow sexual revolution,

135
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:55,739
how the needs of our babies,
their extreme altricial

136
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,939
nature, has actually shaped us
to keep them alive, these

137
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:00,550
fragile babies.

138
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,949
And the way that we took care of
them, and the way that they

139
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:08,039
asked us for our support, has
shaped our social skills and

140
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,530
developed our social
intelligence to

141
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:11,649
unprecedented levels.

142
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:15,589
In this way, our babies
made us human.

143
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:17,439
Our next topic is sexuality.

144
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,689
Because it's just not natural.

145
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:20,202
