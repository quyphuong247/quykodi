[PLAYING MUSIC]

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,669
So where to from here,
for human evolution?

4
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:16,780
When we look around, if we live
in certain pockets of

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,660
wealthy countries, we could be
forgiven for thinking that

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,699
natural selection has
been abolished.

7
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:25,109
Infant mortality in some
places is below 1%.

8
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,739
Childhood killers like malaria,
tuberculosis,

9
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:31,669
diarrhoea, gastrointestinal
problems, they've been

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,780
virtually extinguished
in that population.

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,810
That's a huge accomplishment
and I don't

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,810
want to belittle that.

13
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,550
But even the way that we've
abolished certain selective

14
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:43,799
pressures, diseases,
malnutrition, well, the way

15
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:46,309
that we've done it can sometimes
rebound back upon us

16
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,690
and form its own kind of
selective pressure.

17
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:50,759
And besides which, there are
other pockets of the human

18
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,759
population in the world today
that are still exposed to

19
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:55,710
those selective pressures.

20
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,939
For example, as you probably
know, we use antibiotics to

21
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:00,379
keep ourselves healthy
in many ways.

22
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,620
We even use them on
our animals, our

23
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:03,689
domesticated animals.

24
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,959
But the use of those antibiotics
has made it

25
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:08,879
particularly hard to be an
infectious bacteria.

26
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,420
We've created a world in which
only the toughest of those

27
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,280
bacteria can survive
those threats.

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,329
And in the process, we are
breeding super bugs.

29
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:20,129
In our hospitals and in our
cattle yards, we are providing

30
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:23,369
the conditions where the next
selective pressure on humans

31
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,340
may be being born right now.

32
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,609
Among the wealthiest people,
we may have abolished

33
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:30,810
nutrition through agriculture.

34
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,840
But at the same time, we've
created a new selective

35
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,700
pressure, which is adapting to
an entirely changed diet.

36
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,570
The foods that we eat, the
nutrient profile we get, well

37
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:43,429
all of these are kind of
human-made selective pressure,

38
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,970
even if we don't realise we're
subjecting ourselves to it.

39
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:49,049
Remember 10,000 years ago,
virtually no one was adapted

40
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,489
to digesting lactose or milk
products and into adulthood.

41
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:57,959
The advent of domesticated
animals and dairy farming has

42
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,599
really changed the selective
pressures on our

43
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,409
gastrointestinal tract.

44
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,849
And the genetic evidence is
that this is a profoundly

45
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:08,409
important change in terms
of our genetic profile.

46
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:10,810
We're also staring down the
barrel in some parts of the

47
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,699
world of an obesity epidemic.

48
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,699
Our body's way of telling us
that we haven't really adapted

49
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:18,969
all that well to this new diet
that we've discovered.

50
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:22,590
It's especially interesting
because fatty tissue produces

51
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,710
its own hormones.

52
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,820
It produces oestrogen
in some cases.

53
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:28,219
And this can lead to lower
male fertility.

54
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:31,150
We also know that extreme
obesity in women can actually

55
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:36,330
produce amenorrhea, or the
extinction of a woman's cycle

56
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,590
of fertility.

57
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,120
Now, we don't know if
there's some genetic

58
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,930
component to that.

59
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,569
But if there is, then certain
people are more susceptible to

60
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:47,530
having their fertility
suppressed by our modern diet.

61
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,830
And this would constitute an
obvious selective pressure if

62
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,600
our diet made it harder for you
to pass on your genes to

63
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,259
next generation.

64
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,329
We suspect that male sperm count
today has been dropping

65
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,430
since previous generations.

66
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,170
Boys today have fewer sperm
per ejaculate than their

67
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:04,339
grandfathers did.

68
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,400
We don't know why male sperm
counts are dropping, but some

69
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,480
in the European Science
Federation worry that as many

70
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:14,849
as 20% of all boys, sperm counts
are getting so low

71
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:17,909
they're in what's classified
as a subfertile category,

72
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:20,560
where conceiving children
becomes more difficult.

73
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,390
And we don't know if this is
because of the obesity or

74
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:24,139
other health problems.

75
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:27,339
Or maybe because some of the
synthetic chemicals that we

76
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,020
now produce may mimic the
effects of different hormones

77
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,020
and cause a kind of endocrine
disruption.

78
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,030
We know these kinds of endocrine
disruptions or

79
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,060
hormonal irregularities happen
in other animals when they're

80
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,420
exposed to synthetic
chemicals.

81
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:43,559
And they might be
happening in us.

82
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,949
If this fertility change
is happening, and it's

83
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:49,000
controversial, it may not
be that everybody in the

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,270
population is equally
susceptible.

85
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,810
If that's the case, this could
be the new selective pressure,

86
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,819
that our modern lifestyles are
actually affecting our

87
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,069
fertility in different
degrees.

88
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:02,310
Some of us may be more
resistant, more resilient

89
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,710
against the effects of
a modern lifestyle.

90
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,760
Remember, it's not just a single
individual, whether he

91
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:11,849
or she reproduces, it's the
population as a whole over

92
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:12,989
many generations.

93
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,300
And so your choices may
not be affecting it.

94
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,079
But if this process is
occurring, it could be

95
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,838
influencing us over the next
dozens or scores or hundreds

96
00:04:21,838 --> 00:04:23,500
of generations.

97
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,829
We may not see what's happening,
even though we're

98
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:27,769
undergoing evolutionary change,
even though we're

99
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:29,859
undergoing accelerated
evolutionary change.

100
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,480
Because it's not like somebody's
going to change in

101
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,040
front of you on a street corner
into another species.

102
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,550
This is a very slow process.

103
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,340
If the gene pool is shifting, if
some of us are more capable

104
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:42,429
of surviving and reproducing
in current conditions, then

105
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,560
over time, inevitably this
is going to have

106
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,040
effects on our species.

107
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,330
Even though evolution is
really slow, some UK

108
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:53,050
researchers may have caught in
motion, in a recent study that

109
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,840
took some basic health measures
and bodily measures

110
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,569
of UK women.

111
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:01,389
What they found out among UK
women is there was a change in

112
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:02,819
the stats over time.

113
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:07,939
They were becoming shorter,
stouter, had lower blood

114
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:12,060
pressure, had lower cholesterol
levels,

115
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:18,899
cholesterol, and they had longer
fertility windows than

116
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:22,250
women in the UK had even
a few decades earlier.

117
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,910
What we may be seeing there is
actually these women were

118
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,450
adapting to the changes
of a modern lifestyle.

119
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:30,939
For example, extending their
fertility window as our

120
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:33,569
patterns of having children
have changed.

121
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:36,610
Getting a better ability to
metabolise and deal with

122
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,009
cholesterol in spite of the fact
that their diet haven't

123
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:41,620
got much better.

124
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,750
All of these changes punch
huge holes in any simple

125
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,250
distinction between natural
selection and what we might

126
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,430
think of as artificial or
human driven selection.

127
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,790
It's impossible to draw a line
between these two anymore.

128
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,475
It's hard to think of
anything around us

129
00:05:56,475 --> 00:05:57,350
that's fully natural.

130
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,990
Although we may think of parks
and flowers and birds as

131
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,780
nature, we're affecting them.

132
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,529
What we're getting is a kind
of complicated relationship

133
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:08,849
between what we're doing and
the natural selective

134
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,150
pressures that are coming back
on us, even though it's not

135
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:12,849
intentional.

136
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,640
For the purposes of natural
selection, everything around

137
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,399
you right now is nature.

138
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:20,609
It doesn't matter whether it was
human made or whether it

139
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,230
arose on its own power.

140
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,090
We're not used to thinking
of evolution this way.

141
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:27,689
We're used to thinking of our
technology and what we do as a

142
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:30,029
kind of bubble that
insulates us.

143
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:32,909
But increasingly, it's the
pressures that are actually

144
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,230
being applied to our
pool of genes.

145
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,300
It's the future.

146
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,829
It's what's affecting how
we're going to be in the

147
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:39,259
future as a species.

148
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:41,409
On the discussion board, I'm
going to be really interested

149
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,810
to see what you all
think about the

150
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,759
future of human evolution.

151
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,819
It's virtually impossible to
know what's going to happen.

152
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,980
But it's worth thinking about.

153
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,660
As the great philosopher, or
baseball player, Yogi Berra

154
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,030
put it, it's tough to make
predictions, especially about

155
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:57,549
the future.

156
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,930
In spite of the difficulty of
predicting the future, I

157
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,620
really want you to
think about it.

158
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,470
And I want to leave you with
the words of Jonas Sulk.

159
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,150
Sulk invented the
polio vaccine.

160
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:09,310
And he refused to patent the
invention because he thought

161
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,689
it was for the good of
all of humankind.

162
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:16,165
Sulk was of the opinion that the
most meaningful activity

163
00:07:16,165 --> 00:07:19,129
in which a human can be
engaged is one that is

164
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:21,290
directly related to
human evolution.

165
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,350
This is true because human
beings now play an active and

166
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,090
critical role, not only in
the process of their own

167
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:29,779
evolution, but in the survival
and evolution

168
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:32,369
of all living things.

169
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,670
Awareness of this places upon
human beings a responsibility

170
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:38,879
for their participation
and contribution to

171
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,420
the process of evolution.

172
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,400
Evolution shows us how we are
all stitched together at the

173
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,279
start, how all humans are
descended from common

174
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,839
ancestors, how all living things
are descended from our

175
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,359
earliest ancestors.

176
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,670
But it also shows us that
our futures are

177
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,180
stitched together too.

178
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,470
What we do now, especially now
that we know and have the

179
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,720
power to change the planet,
affects how living things will

180
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,000
be in the future, how all living
things will evolve.

181
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,040
And it affects whether our
descendants will recognise us

182
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,560
or whether they wouldn't
want to know us.

183
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,420
Thanks all for participating
in this.

184
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,430
I hope you've had as much fun
on this journey as I have.

185
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,009
And I hope that you continue
to explore.

186
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:23,000
It's a fascinating subject and
one that well, there's just no

187
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,250
end to evolution.

188
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,658
