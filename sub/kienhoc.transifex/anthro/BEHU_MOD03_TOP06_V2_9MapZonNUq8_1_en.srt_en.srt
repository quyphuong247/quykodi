00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:12,390
The Struggle With
Our Children.

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,750
From an evolutionary
perspective, the goal of

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,980
reproduction isn't just to
produce babies, it's to

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,670
produce grandchildren, and
preferably a lot of them.

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,960
The way that women do this is
in part by recruiting other

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,380
help, because our infants
are so altricial.

8
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:29,529
But it also may involve choosing
how to allocate your

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,359
resources very carefully.

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,969
Not consciously, but making
tough choices about how to use

11
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:37,240
the energy and the resources
you have.

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,760
One example of how the mother's
body makes these

13
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:42,530
kinds of choices and tests
infants to make sure they're

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,429
worth investing in is actually
menstruation.

15
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:48,299
In menstruation, a woman's body
builds up the uterine

16
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:50,659
lining, and then, if it doesn't
get a fertilised egg,

17
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,729
she expels the uterine lining.

18
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:55,799
Now, you don't have to
menstruate to reproduce.

19
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:58,959
There are species that either
don't build a uterine lining

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,100
unless they get a fertilised
egg, or if they build one and

21
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,849
a fertilised egg doesn't show
up, they recycle that uterine

22
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:07,680
lining, they don't lose so much
blood, including iron.

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,440
We now think there's at least
two good reasons why, from an

24
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,609
evolutionary perspective,
women menstruate.

25
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:15,659
The first is menstruation is
kind of an early viability

26
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:16,989
check for an embryo.

27
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:21,649
Menstruation stress tests that
embryo as it's trying to embed

28
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,650
in the uterine lining, and if it
hasn't firmly embedded, if

29
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,000
it hasn't sufficiently attached
itself, the act of

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,560
menstruation will tend to flush
out those embryos which

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,799
may be less viable.

32
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,109
We know that at least 30%
of eggs go out in the

33
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:34,799
menstruation--

34
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,840
fertilised eggs--

35
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,760
and as many as 50% of all
conceptions, all acts that

36
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,870
could result in pregnancy get
terminated well before a woman

37
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,030
reaches term.

38
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,340
The second reason that
menstruation is important

39
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,630
evolutionary perspective is
because, in some sense, the

40
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:52,500
woman's body gets the uterine
lining prepared so that the

41
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,250
embryo doesn't get too
deeply embedded.

42
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,540
Because the human embryo is so
demanding, it can get kind of

43
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,210
hot wired into a
woman's system.

44
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:05,229
And having the uterine lining in
place means that the embryo

45
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,230
doesn't get its claws completely
into the mother's

46
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,530
metabolic system.

47
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,509
Evolutionary biologist David
Haig, who teaches at Harvard

48
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:14,060
now, but is originally from
Australia, argues that some of

49
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,650
the complications that arise
early in pregnancy actually

50
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,189
arise because as a kind of
silence struggle between the

51
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:23,139
foetus and mother, especially
after the placenta forms at

52
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:26,409
the end of the first
trimester.

53
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:30,699
The placenta works with the
foetus to invade the blood

54
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:33,429
system of the mother and
try to extract as much

55
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,990
nutrition as it can.

56
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,800
In addition, once the placenta
is formed, the foetus can

57
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,750
actually introduce hormones into
the woman's body try to

58
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,439
control the metabolism for the
benefit of the infant.

59
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,384
The foetus and the mother get
in a kind of food fight.

60
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:51,429
That is, each time the mother
eats, the foetus is trying to

61
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,300
get as much of the glucose,
or the sugar, out of

62
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,460
the blood as possible.

63
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,450
And the mother's trying to
metabolise as quickly as

64
00:02:57,449 --> 00:03:00,409
possible, so that she saves
enough for herself.

65
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:02,900
This can cause an early problem
and can contribute to

66
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,610
the onset of gestational
diabetes.

67
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,585
We may think of gestational
diabetes, or the diabetes that

68
00:03:09,585 --> 00:03:12,640
can come with pregnancy, as
a kind of health problem.

69
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,119
In addition, it produces really
fat babies, but in

70
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,700
fact, it's a sign that the
placenta and the foetus are

71
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,799
getting a kind of metabolic
upper hand on the mother, and

72
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,060
extracting more resources
for the foetus.

73
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,890
Once that baby is born,
it's still terribly

74
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:29,639
demanding on its mum.

75
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:32,489
So much so that it may actually
impede the mother's

76
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,180
ability to have other babies.

77
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,750
So this relationship can make
it difficult for her to

78
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,229
reproduce as much as possible.

79
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:42,399
Unless the mum can get a break,
she's not be able to

80
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,110
reproduce as much as possible.

81
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,820
And the way she'll do that is
actually pulling in other

82
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:47,519
people to help.

83
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:55,200
She might pull in a sister, or
the dad, or an auntie, even an

84
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,379
older sibling, or
perhaps grandma.

85
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:02,240


86
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,770
All of these may end
up helping he.

87
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,090
Anthropologists Sarah Hrdy
points out that with other

88
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,700
primates, the baby tends to
cling very possessively to the

89
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:15,139
mother, and the mum won't let
other adults near its baby.

90
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:18,959
In contrast, in humans, mums
tend to get all this help from

91
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,170
these other adults, from thee
other care providers, and even

92
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,550
from other children.

93
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,040
We call this alloparenting.

94
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,470
Alloparenting is a distinctly
human pattern of having

95
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,160
parents rely upon
others-- allos--

96
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,950
whether those are the father, or
whether it's a whole group

97
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:38,769
of potential supporters, like
grandmothers, and aunties, and

98
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:41,259
older siblings.

99
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:44,670
Sarah Hrdy realised that, in
a sense, humans evolved--

100
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,720
she's argued-- that humans
evolved to need all of these

101
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,780
other parents.

102
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:51,000
If you're going to raise a human
brain, it has to get

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,060
beyond the usual primate single
family, child rearing.

104
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,399
Hrdy really pointed out that
motherhood, just like

105
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,139
fatherhood, involves strategic
decisions.

106
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:04,639
Hrdy wasn't the first to argue
that parenting-- because of

107
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,110
our altricial infants--

108
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,000
needed help.

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,120
But she's one of the first to
point out that help didn't

110
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,180
have to be the dad.

111
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,389
The nuclear family wasn't, in
fact, the natural unit of

112
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:16,209
evolution, that you could
pull and all these

113
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:17,449
other potential people.

114
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:20,199
This helps us to explain all
sorts of things, including,

115
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,129
for example, the survival
of grandmothers.

116
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:26,920
In humans, women live far past
their reproductive viability.

117
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,360
That's pretty strange when you
think about it, until you

118
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,230
realise that in this case,
grandmothers can help their

119
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,750
daughters make sure that their
grandchildren survive.

120
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,339
And this is a distinctive
evolutionary advantage.

121
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:41,089
The bottom line is that
all this discussion of

122
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:43,569
alloparenting and maternal
strategies remind us that

123
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:45,750
babies aren't just
packets of DNA.

124
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,589
They're also ongoing investments
of parents, and of

125
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:50,649
grandparents.

126
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:53,099
To keep them alive, to get them
to survive until they're

127
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,439
are viable, takes more than
just a reproductive act.

128
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,079
Although people may believe
that maternal love is

129
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:02,259
unconditional and instinctual,
what we realise when we look

130
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:05,009
not only at our own history, but
even at other species, is

131
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:08,920
that in fact, this reproductive
act in humans,

132
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,480
like in a lot of primates, is
shot through strategies and

133
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,180
really hard choices.

134
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,810
In the next topic we'll discuss
how all of this adds

135
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,360
up into a long, slow sexual
revolution in the history and

136
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,610
evolution of our species.

137
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,802
