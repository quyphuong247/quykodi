3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,920
Inheritance also takes more
circuitous routes.

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:14,740
It's not just biological
processes passed directly from

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,429
your mother and father to you.

6
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:18,449
When you were born, you weren't
just sort of chucked

7
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:21,039
out a window with your genes,
to fend for yourself.

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,899
No, like a lot of animals,
you were cared for.

9
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:24,579
You were fed.

10
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:25,779
You were protected.

11
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,200
You came into a world that was
shaped by generations upon

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,059
generations of your ancestors.

13
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:33,879
Otherwise, you'd have more
predators to be worried about.

14
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,320
Some evolutionary theorists
argue that an important way to

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,730
think about this nongenetic
inheritance is to recognise

16
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:42,140
that organisms are shaping
their environment.

17
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,359
They're doing what we
call niche creation.

18
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,299
In niche creation, we
get a feedback.

19
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:49,409
It's not just that the

20
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:52,549
environment impacts the organism.

21
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:56,489
It's also that over the long
term, the organism can affect

22
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,580
the environment.

23
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:01,030
This creates a situation where
one generation shapes the

24
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,840
selective pressures on
the next generation.

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,500
Not every species affects
its niche profoundly.

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,829
And it's not always necessarily

27
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:09,950
in a positive direction.

28
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,310
That is, some species can
actually create conditions

29
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,310
that make it harder for
them to survive.

30
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,219
But in some species, you really
have to take into

31
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:19,219
account this complex
interaction.

32
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:21,819
Some of the most dramatic
examples of niche creation

33
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:24,769
come from animals like
termites and ants.

34
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:26,319
In the Northern Territory
of Australia,

35
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,089
termites build huge mounds.

36
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:32,150
These mounds are designed to
collect energy, solar energy,

37
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,050
to protect the insects.

38
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,939
The chances of surviving are
radically different if you are

39
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:39,739
a termite or an ant who is born
to one of the colonies

40
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:42,699
who built these giant mounds,
than if you're a termite or

41
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,870
ant who is born in a
circumstance where you don't

42
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,520
have this kind of protection.

43
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:48,359
Another example is beavers.

44
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,439
Beavers build these
amazing dams.

45
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:54,539
The dam actually creates a kind
of artificial wetland on

46
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,990
a river or a creek.

47
00:01:55,989 --> 00:01:58,609
This allows the beaver who is
born into this environment to

48
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:01,739
enjoy a plethora of food that
they wouldn't have.

49
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:03,929
It's defended by this
extra wetland.

50
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,790
Every beaver doesn't just
inherit genes, the beaver

51
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,430
inherits an environment that's
been transformed by the hard

52
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,159
work of beavers generations
before.

53
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,169
With humans, the niche creation
dynamics are even

54
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,189
more dramatic, especially in
about the last 10,000 to

55
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:18,849
15,000 years.

56
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:22,349
But we've been really hard for
example on predators that

57
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:23,560
feast on our children.

58
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,930
We've been really hard on
tigers and bears and

59
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,650
all kinds of wolves.

60
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,830
The fact we are born in this
artificially shaped niche

61
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,030
means that you have to worry
less about being attacked in

62
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,599
the streets by any sort of
jaguars or giant anacondas.

63
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:42,229
Almost all forms of niche
creation are unintentional.

64
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,734
Species don't realise, even
humans don't realise sometimes

65
00:02:44,735 --> 00:02:46,675
how they're impacting the
environment and the way that

66
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:48,100
that's going to circle
back and effect

67
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:49,669
to them as an organism.

68
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,449
For example, the birth of
agriculture has created

69
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:55,144
perfect breeding conditions in
some areas for the mosquitoes

70
00:02:55,145 --> 00:02:56,740
that carry malaria.

71
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,230
They need stagnant water
and irrigation canals.

72
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:02,199
And places where the forests
have been cleared are the

73
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,619
perfect environment.

74
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,670
This means that the organisms
infected environment to make

75
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:10,379
malaria more of a pressure on
us, as a selective pressure.

76
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,759
Both epigenetic inheritance,
which we talked about in the

77
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,280
last topic, and niche creation,
are ways that

78
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,740
acquired traits can
be passed on.

79
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,580
Maybe Lamarck wasn't
totally wrong.

80
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,230
In each case, the experience of
one's parents or ancestors

81
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:25,539
can be acquired as a trait
in the offspring.

82
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,439
But maybe one of the most
important forms of nongenetic

83
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:31,710
inheritance is actually
learning.

84
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,520
All kinds of animals learn.

85
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,490
In fact, one of the most
important reasons to have a

86
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,640
brain at all is that you
can learn new things.

87
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,919
And all kinds of
species do it.

88
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,189
Song birds, for example,
will start chirping

89
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,310
when they're young.

90
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,580
But they won't form
adult songs unless

91
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,800
they hear adult songs.

92
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,000
They won't get the complex
melodies that they need to

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,099
mate unless they have the
influence of other

94
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,729
adults to listen to.

95
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:56,500
They come into the world kind
of expecting to learn.

96
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,969
They even experiment
with chirping.

97
00:03:57,969 --> 00:04:01,219
But they need that influence
to complete the cycle and

98
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:04,180
fully acquire that trait
of their species.

99
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,409
I think the key difference with
humans, however, isn't

100
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:08,930
just learning, it's
also teaching.

101
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,000
All kinds of animals
learn by observing

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,310
other adults for example.

103
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,629
And some species will
even do what we can

104
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:16,709
kind of call teaching.

105
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,800
A mother lion for example will
give her cubs wounded prey or

106
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,370
small prey to play with,
to begin to learn.

107
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,730
But the complex relationship
between learning and teaching

108
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,240
in humans is really
well developed.

109
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,949
Learning doesn't obey the strict
inheritance patterns

110
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:32,550
that we were talking about
with genetics.

111
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,500
It doesn't just get passed on
from parents to children.

112
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,199
With chimpanzees, it does.

113
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,490
Chimpanzee children seem to
only be able to learn from

114
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,389
their mother certain skills
like getting food.

115
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:46,569
But in humans, it's
more complex.

116
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:49,269
You can actually learn from
unrelated adults.

117
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:52,709
We get lines of transmission,
which are nongenetic.

118
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,789
In humans we don't just get
this kind of vertical

119
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,340
transmission or even diagonal
transmission.

120
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,879
Sometimes we even get kind of
lateral transmission, where

121
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:06,019
you get children or members of
a single generation sharing

122
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:07,079
information among themselves.

123
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:10,709
For example, think about the way
that fads in language or

124
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:13,269
text-speak have spread
among kids.

125
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:15,529
And their parents have no
idea what they're doing.

126
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:17,879
Humans are especially
good at teaching.

127
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,480
We create special kind of social
structures or even

128
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,610
cognitive environments that
shape what our children learn.

129
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,580
You may not even realise you're
doing it for example,

130
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:29,289
but when it's time for a child
to learn language, you don't

131
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,300
sit down and think
oh, I've got to

132
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,600
teach this kid language.

133
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,439
Instead, you almost
automatically change the

134
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:36,009
learning environment
for the child.

135
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:37,889
You change the way you
talk to a kid.

136
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:39,889
In fact if you listen, from the
outside it sounds like the

137
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:42,069
adult has kind of gone crazy.

138
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:43,149
Yes, you do.

139
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:44,579
You change your language.

140
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:46,039
You repeat things.

141
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,180
You change the tone
of your voice.

142
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,340
All of that is a kind of
instinctual way that we help

143
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:52,409
children to learn language.

144
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,620
We simplify.

145
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,780
We cut language down to a kind
of child-sized version.

146
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:59,719
We even alter the pitch of our
voice when we do baby talk.

147
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,040
It turns out that it's easier
for infants to hear when we're

148
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,530
talking that way.

149
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:07,259
Children are primed when they
come into this world for this

150
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:08,089
kind of action.

151
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:09,569
They're hypersocial.

152
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,370
They're fascinated by adults.

153
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,569
They're ready to interact
with us.

154
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:16,519
In addition, new parents
are primed too.

155
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,529
Sure, they might be sleep
deprived and exhausted.

156
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:19,959
But they're fascinated
by babies.

157
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,759
And so they're really focused
on these lines of

158
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,509
transmission, even parents
that are not related.

159
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,745
This builds up a really robust
learning environment.

160
00:06:27,745 --> 00:06:30,189
Now, if something goes wrong
with a child's social

161
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,750
abilities, for example they're
not good at noticing whether

162
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,279
the people are paying attention
to or they get

163
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,189
overwhelmed by social
interaction, this whole

164
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,889
process can go off the rails.

165
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:44,060
The good news, however, is
that it's very robust.

166
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,800
Because there are all these
potential channels, not just

167
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,055
from mother to daughter
or mother to son.

168
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:53,079
You have a very resilient
niche in which to create

169
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,359
human-like consciousness.

170
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,180
The bottom line is if you really
want to understand what

171
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,930
makes humans distinct, you've
got to realise it's

172
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,699
not all in our genes.

173
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:06,670
Our genes make us distinctly
susceptible to other kinds of

174
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,199
nongenetic influences.

175
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:11,029
They build these powerful other
channels that shape our

176
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,719
development.

177
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,060
We can find those channels
in other animals.

178
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,240
But they are uniquely well
elaborated and really strong

179
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,340
in human beings.

180
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,310
The complete instructions
to build a human

181
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,780
aren't all in our DNA.

182
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:25,679
They're not just in our biology,
but they're actually

183
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,314
carved into the world around
us by the generations that

184
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,600
have come before.

185
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,390
In our next topic, we're going
to talk about symbiosis or how

186
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:34,529
you get cooperation between
different species.

187
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:35,779
