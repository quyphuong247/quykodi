3
00:00:10,012 --> 00:00:11,839
In this topic, we're going to
talk about brain functions,

4
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:13,699
old and new.

5
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:16,399
We have to realise that brains
were designed by evolution to

6
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:17,619
help us survive.

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,679
So there's some tasks that we're
really good at and some

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,030
that we're not so good at or we
can sometimes find a way to

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,890
use our skills to do stuff in
kind of strange brain hacks.

10
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,469
Let me give you an example.

11
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:32,879
My colleague Ken Cheng at
Macquarie University studies a

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,420
really fascinating
set of ants.

13
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,710
One of them is called
Cataglyphis fortis,

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,140
Cataglyphis fortis.

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,380
Now, Cataglyphis fortis
lives in the desert.

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,155
This particular species lives
in the desert of Tunisia.

17
00:00:49,155 --> 00:00:53,969
And what it can do is it lives
on salt pans, featureless.

18
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,170
Almost infinite planes, that
if you were ant height, you

19
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,240
would see no features.

20
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,870
Cataglyphis fortis, the little
ant, starts off at home.

21
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:05,420
And he or she goes out wandering
all over the place,

22
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,359
this way and that,
looking for food.

23
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,099
And eventually, at some point,
finds let's say a tasty little

24
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:13,949
fly out here.

25
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,180
And that tasty little
fly, he or she wants

26
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,940
to bring back home.

27
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,969
Cataglyphis fortis can go
straight from where they are

28
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:22,379
here, directly back to home.

29
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:25,420
Even though their brains are
tiny, very few neurons,

30
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,530
they're extremely good at
this one type of task.

31
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,950
We call that modular
intelligence.

32
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,969
Modular intelligence is a kind
of intelligence that's good at

33
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:39,579
doing very specialised tasks,
but doesn't get repurposed or

34
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:42,090
reused for other
kinds of tasks.

35
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,070
Evolution has shaped Cataglyphis
fortress until it

36
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:47,269
has some really amazing
perceptual

37
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:48,519
and cognitive abilities.

38
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:51,310
It can calculate each
step and sum up the

39
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,490
directions it's going.

40
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:56,259
It's eyes can see in the sky the
pattern of polarised light

41
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,810
that tells us north, south,
east, and west.

42
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,049
Cataglyphis fortis can do a task
that's well beyond the

43
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:03,799
cognitive abilities of humans.

44
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:06,689
And yet, this intelligence
is strictly modular.

45
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,329
There's lots of other
tasks it can't do.

46
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,440
Evolution specifically shaped
it to life on a 50 degree

47
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,810
Celsius salt pan.

48
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,250
Some researchers and
evolutionary psychologists

49
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,680
argue that human brains are
kind of like ant brains.

50
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,860
They have modules for doing
special purpose tasks.

51
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,130
In fact, some human intelligence
does seem

52
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:26,139
to work this way.

53
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:29,319
We're very good for example at
reading each other's emotions

54
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,750
or learning by imitation.

55
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,490
But one of the most interesting
things about the

56
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,939
human brain is actually that we
take what look like special

57
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:39,870
purpose modules and
we repurpose them.

58
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:47,759
We do something we sometimes
call neural recycling or

59
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,319
neural reuse.

60
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,219
In this case, we take sometimes
very old functions,

61
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:56,599
very old circuits of the brain
and we put it to new purposes.

62
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,710
For example, when we learn to
read, we use parts of our

63
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,050
brain that could not possibly
have evolved for that purpose.

64
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,950
Reading is just too recent of an
innovation for our brain to

65
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:07,479
have been shaped by it.

66
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,189
Instead, we take parts of the
brain, and circuits, and

67
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,840
functions that look like the
parts of the brain that in

68
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,689
animals are used to identify
very small objects.

69
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:19,370
And we build them up
into a new skill.

70
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,599
And that's how we build reading
on what are really

71
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,519
very ancient parts
of the brain.

72
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,159
One thing we have to realise is
that evolution has achieve

73
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,120
some of the huge gap in
cognitive ability between us

74
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,930
and other animals by adding
new functions to old brain

75
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,700
areas or by layering
new controls

76
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:38,409
over ancient functions.

77
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:41,189
For example, some of the oldest
parts of the brain are

78
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:45,460
down here, the brain stem.

79
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,700
They control some of the most
basic and important functions,

80
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:51,859
things like breathing, and
sleeping, and pain perception,

81
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,260
and the control of your
bodily systems.

82
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:57,169
If you get some damage to the
outside, to the cortex of your

83
00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:01,089
brain, you can get some weird
memory losses and some

84
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,039
function losses.

85
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:05,259
But if you get damage to the
brain stem, you're lucky to be

86
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:08,280
breathing or have your heart
beating after that.

87
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,770
These parts of the brain, the
brain stem, are highly

88
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,920
conserved across species.

89
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,930
That means they don't really
change all that much.

90
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,930
Some people might say they're
not evolving.

91
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,509
But they're completely essential
to our lives.

92
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:25,849
In humans, we find that parts of
the brain that we consider

93
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,300
higher, that are more conscious,
can actually end up

94
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,180
affecting these automatic
functions.

95
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,600
For example, you can
hold your breath.

96
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,790
You can cause yourself to panic
by imagining things.

97
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,980
What you're doing in these cases
is you're using what

98
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,439
they call more evolved or more
recent evolutionary add-ons to

99
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,860
actually affect the functioning
of these highly

100
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,800
conserved, basic parts
of your brain.

101
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,009
This is a really important in
the history of evolution.

102
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:55,139
Because what it allows us to
do is to override perfectly

103
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:58,279
sensible commands from the brain
stem, like breathe, and

104
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:01,469
instead to assert control
from a higher level, to

105
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,920
do things like talk.

106
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,540
We wouldn't be able to talk were
we not able to override

107
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,170
our automatic systems that cause
our throat and our mouth

108
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,770
and our lungs to work.

109
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,519
Every time you speak, it's a
part of your brain that's more

110
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,939
recently evolved, doing
something completely new with

111
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:19,050
a very old function.

112
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,050
It's been really important in
our evolutionary history too

113
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,160
because we've had to override
all kinds of impulses.

114
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,220
Our ancestors, for example, went
from being vegetarians,

115
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,960
from being scavengers, to
becoming predators.

116
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,019
To do that, they had to override
some very sensible

117
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:38,529
advice coming from the brain
stem, to panic and run.

118
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:41,329
Had one of our ancestors not
been able to override that,

119
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:43,859
we'd still be just eating
vegetables.

120
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,900
It takes an enormous impact of
imagination for one of our

121
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:50,399
ancestors to look at an animal
that was terrifying, and

122
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,224
onrushing, a huge animal,
and to imagine that

123
00:05:53,225 --> 00:05:54,360
it could be a meal.

124
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,090
And then it took an enormous
active of will to override all

125
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:00,339
those sensible panic impulses
that were coming from the

126
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:01,619
brain stem.

127
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,430
Over the course of evolution,
we've taken these primitive,

128
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,759
evolutionary ancient brain
stem responses and we've

129
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,779
repurposed them.

130
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:12,019
We've recruited them to
whole new responses.

131
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:18,149
So that now, things like love,
things like creativity, all of

132
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:20,329
these recruit these
older processes.

133
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:23,060
In fact, you could say that what
we've done is we haven't

134
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,790
overruled our evolutionary
heritage.

135
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,300
What we've done instead is we've
co-opted or repurposed

136
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,389
all these ancient responses
into a whole

137
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:32,789
new world of functions.

138
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,560
We can long for justice.

139
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,250
We can fall in love with
things we imagine.

140
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,779
We can be terrified of things
that don't really exist.

141
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:43,079
All of these are because of the
cooperation between the

142
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:46,849
ancient brain stem and all these
new cognitive functions.

143
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,460
One of the enduring myths about
the brain is that we

144
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:51,789
only use a small
portion of it.

145
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,700
In fact, we're constantly using
the entirety of the

146
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:57,439
human brain, not just the brain
stem and the cortex, but

147
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:59,719
also things like the midbrain.

148
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,740
In our everyday activity in our
lives, you're breathing,

149
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,579
you're adjusting the way you're
standing, your hormone

150
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:09,370
levels are changing, you're
responding to stress.

151
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,389
All of that is being
done by your brain.

152
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,839
Your brain is doing for us what
it did for our ancestors.

153
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,500
It's keeping you alive.

154
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,279
So in the next topic, we're
going to be talking about the

155
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,969
size of your brain and how it's
not just bigger that's

156
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,630
better, but a whole lot
of other change.

157
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:24,127
