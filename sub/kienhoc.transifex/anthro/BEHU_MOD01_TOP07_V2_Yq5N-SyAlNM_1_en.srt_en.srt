[MUSIC PLAYING]

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,830
This is important.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,379
Sometimes people think that
evolution has a goal, or that

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,730
it's a form of progress.

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,690
They commit what we called
teleological error.

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:24,050
Teleological error comes
in or telos, or goal.

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,769
And it's the mistake of thinking
that evolution is out

9
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:27,730
to do something.

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,690
That things become more
evolved over time.

11
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,689
The truth is, everything
is always evolving.

12
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:36,379
Every creature on the planet.

13
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,890
There's no goal to it.

14
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,679
The point is not to produce
certain types of creatures.

15
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,799
And it's certainly not
to produce humans.

16
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:46,739
This is an anthropocentric
error.

17
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,990
Anthropocentric means assuming
that humans are kind of the

18
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,340
centre of the universe, we're
the goal of evolution to

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,110
produce something like us.

20
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:57,619
It's true humans are
really unusual.

21
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:01,489
We're highly intelligent, we're
quite sophisticated,

22
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,020
we're very destructive.

23
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,210
But that doesn't necessarily
mean we're the most evolved.

24
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:08,809
The expression doesn't really
make sense, most evolved.

25
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,430
Every animal's descended
from shared life forms.

26
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,210
Every living thing has been
on the planet the

27
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:15,589
same amount of time.

28
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,100
The only way you could be more
evolved is if somehow you got

29
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:20,359
sent back from the future.

30
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:23,370
In fact, believing that humans
are somehow the most evolved

31
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,219
form of life is not really an
evolutionary way of thinking.

32
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,890
It's actually a hold over
of an earlier idea.

33
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,609
That's the Great
Chain of Being.

34
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:35,750
The Great Chain of Being was a
Christian concept that humans

35
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,340
were kind of like the most
god-like or most divine of all

36
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,180
living things.

37
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,930
Sort of between the angels and
all other living things,

38
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,120
humans have been created by the
divinity to be in charge.

39
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,760
The most sophisticated,
the most holy.

40
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,260
All kinds of religions have
concepts like this.

41
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,200
But they're not evolutionary
concepts.

42
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,060
This anthropocentric way of
thinking about evolution has

43
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,240
sort of crept over from religion
and folk ideals, into

44
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,819
some people's popular
understandings of evolution,

45
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:05,639
but it's not accurate.

46
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,620
You can only really say an
animal is most adapted to

47
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,699
particular situations.

48
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:13,500
You can't say any one species
is most evolved.

49
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,090
In fact, there are cases when
adaptation actually leads an

50
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,920
animal to become simpler
over evolutionary time.

51
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:21,759
There's no guarantee that
humans won't follow the

52
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,009
countless other species, the
98% of living things, at

53
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:26,909
least, that are extinct.

54
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:29,049
We might be replaced
by a tinkered

55
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,140
with version of ourselves.

56
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:33,169
Or we might simply be the last
of this 6 million to 7

57
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:36,500
million-year-old branch on our
particular evolutionary tree.

58
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,680
We don't really know.

59
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,150
There's no special place
for us in evolution.

60
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,530
Studying human evolution, well,
it actually takes a bit

61
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,050
of humility.

62
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:48,280
Humility to realise that we're
not perfectly designed.

63
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,180
Humility to realise that the
purpose of evolution wasn't to

64
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,219
produce us.

65
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:54,590
Humility to realise that even
though we've got some really

66
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,360
unusual traits, we're truly an
extraordinary animal, there

67
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,540
was a planet full of life
before we ever arose.

68
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:03,519
And there's really no guarantee
that they need us to

69
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,810
stick around.

70
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,250
In the next module, we're going
to go a bit deeper into

71
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,719
evolutionary theory to
understand how evolution

72
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:12,789
works, how genetics work, and
to understand the specific

73
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:15,109
quirks of the processes
that produced us.

74
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,417
