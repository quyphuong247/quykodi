[PLAYING MUSIC]

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,730
In the last topic, we talked
about homologies.

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,890
We saw how evolution doesn't
usually give you a special

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,519
purpose organ, something
specifically

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,050
designed for a purpose.

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,030
It uses the same basic
structures and it adapts them

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,490
to new functions.

9
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:26,399
In effect, what really happens
is that generation after

10
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:27,929
generation, the best

11
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:29,780
variations tend to get preserved.

12
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,560
And so you get slow and steady
refinement, until you can get

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,350
some quite extreme structures.

14
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,370
We call this directional
selection.

15
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:40,899
When evolution favours the
extremes of a trait, like for

16
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:44,009
example the thinnest possible
bones for a wing or the

17
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:46,649
thickest possible wrist for a
flipper, what you tend to get

18
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:49,780
is that a trait will go from
being distributed kind of like

19
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,719
this, it will skew out
to either extreme.

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,460
And that's the directional
selection.

21
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,649
We can say that directional
selection clearly at work in

22
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,659
tetrapod evolution.

23
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:02,319
But tetrapod are all animals
with four limbs.

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,420
It doesn't matter whether
they've got four legs, or arms

25
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,760
and legs, or wings and legs.

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,010
But a tetrapod has four limbs.

27
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,940
Directional selection has caused
tetrapods to assume all

28
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:12,469
different kinds of forms.

29
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:15,349
We call this adaptive
radiation.

30
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:19,479
In adaptive radiation,
directional selection doesn't

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,609
just work in two directions.

32
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:22,239
It works in all kinds
of directions.

33
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:24,769
So you start off with a small
set of animals and what you

34
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:29,079
get is radiation or the
adaptation of the same

35
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:32,340
structures into all kinds
of new forms.

36
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,189
Each species that radiates
in a sense becomes highly

37
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:38,500
specific or highly specialised,
adapting to a

38
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,239
particular niche.

39
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:42,759
With adaptive radiation,
however, we can also see how

40
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,980
constrained evolution can be.

41
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,310
The animals have four limbs.

42
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,750
If they're going to get wings,
if one of their sets of limbs

43
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,599
is going to specialise for
flying, well they're going to

44
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,089
lose a set of arms.

45
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,299
Evolution doesn't produce
a whole new

46
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:54,939
structure so they can fly.

47
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:56,340
It's not like Santa Claus.

48
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,109
It doesn't just give you what
you have on your wish list.

49
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:01,560
Not every similarity between
species, however, arises

50
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,060
because of homologies.

51
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,760
In some cases, you have
convergent evolution.

52
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,250
Convergent evolution happens
when different species are

53
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,669
subjected to similar selective
pressures or they adapt in

54
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:13,349
similar ways to a niche.

55
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:15,579
This can produce structures
that don't have the same

56
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,770
origin, but they have
many shared traits.

57
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:23,360
We see a clear example of this
in the evolution of wings.

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,930
Different sorts of animals
have wings.

59
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,530
Birds and bats and pterodactyls
and insects, they

60
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,960
all have wings that are
quite different.

61
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,510
Unlike homologies, convergent
evolution produces difference

62
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:35,759
structures if you
look underneath.

63
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,419
For example, with wings, if you
look at a pterodactyl's

64
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:41,879
wing, it basically has
a kind of massively

65
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,569
elongated fifth digit.

66
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:44,939
And the wing stretches
from that digit.

67
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:47,280
It means they have a little
claw on top of their wing.

68
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,129
In contrast, with bats, the wing
membrane is essentially

69
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,280
between the digits.

70
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,539
And so they have bones actually
in the middle of

71
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:55,479
their wings.

72
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,959
Birds have a different
structure.

73
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,439
They have kind of a radically
simplified limb.

74
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,620
And this creates a different
sort of skeletal structure.

75
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,330
Without feathers, their
wing wouldn't work.

76
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,940
And finally, insects are a
completely different ballgame.

77
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:08,099
They're not even tetrapods.

78
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:09,430
They don't have bones.

79
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,159
They're only skeleton.

80
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,460
So there's no bones
in their wings.

81
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,110
They use a completely different
kind of structure.

82
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,190
But in each case, wings have
to have certain shared

83
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:19,879
characteristics because of
the demands of flying.

84
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,949
That's convergent evolution.

85
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:24,089
With convergent evolution,
we call those

86
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,259
similarities, analogues.

87
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:28,579
They're not homologues because
they don't come

88
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,840
from the same origins.

89
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,120
Instead, they arise because of
this process of sort of shared

90
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,150
selective pressure,
pushing the trait

91
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,860
in a similar direction.

92
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,890
Convergent evolution can
produce some really

93
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:40,619
fascinating similarities.

94
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,789
For example, here in Australia,
we don't really

95
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,879
have a lot of placental
mammals.

96
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,509
Before humans came and brought
dingos and later rats and

97
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:52,340
other invasives, basically we
had bats and a few mice.

98
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,150
But what happened in Australia
is that marsupials instead

99
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,400
evolved in parallel.

100
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,230
They converged.

101
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:00,219
So we have a marsupial mouse.

102
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:02,060
We have a marsupial possum.

103
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,240
We have a marsupial mole.

104
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,180
We have some marsupial
predators.

105
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,230
One, the Tasmanian tiger, looks
a bit like a bobcat.

106
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:10,119
And there's even an
extinct marsupial

107
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,170
saber-toothed predator.

108
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,409
Similar selective pressures
produced these parallels

109
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:18,750
between placental mammals and
marsupials in Australia.

110
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,250
But they also worked because
of deeper underlying

111
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,410
homologies, homologies between
placental mammals and

112
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,720
marsupials that are because of
that common book of life that

113
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,280
I talked about, those underlying
deep genetic

114
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,769
similarities.

115
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:35,120
In fact, homologies and
convergent evolution are

116
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,470
closely related.

117
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,900
We now realise with genetic
research that a lot of the

118
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:42,500
underlying biological structures
are highly

119
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,120
conserved across a wide
variety of species.

120
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,420
That is, they are retained
because the basic biological

121
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,410
processes function in
all living things.

122
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,750
We can really see this complex
interplay between underlying

123
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,079
similarity and convergent
evolution by the similar

124
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,500
selective pressures in things
like the Hox genes.

125
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,860
The Hox genes are
pretty amazing.

126
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,509
They're highly conserved
genes.

127
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:08,089
They occur across all living
things with complex bodies.

128
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:11,219
And basically they tell the
genetic material, the tissue,

129
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,510
which part of the
body they are.

130
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:15,365
They say hey, build a mouth,
and then build a head, and

131
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:18,610
then build a neck, and then a
thorax, and than an abdomen.

132
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,014
It gives the sequence
of the structure.

133
00:05:21,014 --> 00:05:23,560
What we find is that some of
the same basic tools out of

134
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,129
this tool box get used
over and over again.

135
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:28,634
For example, there's a Hox
gene called Pax6/eyeless.

136
00:05:28,634 --> 00:05:31,389


137
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:35,120
If it's mutated, an insect will
be born without any eyes.

138
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,920
What we find is that even though
there's a really wide

139
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,009
variety of different types of
eyes across all species, in

140
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,805
fact what you always
find is Pax6.

141
00:05:44,805 --> 00:05:48,689
You always find this control
gene that produces light

142
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:50,250
sensitive cells.

143
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,180
Although these discoveries
have all kinds of

144
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,280
implications, one of the most
interesting is it shows how

145
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,199
the basic building blocks of
life are highly conserved.

146
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,269
And they sort of get reinvented
in a different

147
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:04,689
species as variation occurs
and as species explore the

148
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:06,219
space of adaptation.

149
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,440
This helps us to understand how
evolution has produced a

150
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:12,279
multitude of complex forms from
very simple beginnings.

151
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,039
Charles Darwin expected
as much.

152
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,530
He wrote in On the Origin of
Species, "Therefore I should

153
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:20,519
infer from analogy that probably
all the organic

154
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:23,269
beings which have ever lived on
this earth have descended

155
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:27,209
from some one primordial form,
into which life was first

156
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:30,609
breathed." We are all related,
not just all humans to

157
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,259
another, but even animals that
look like they have different

158
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,029
structures.

159
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:37,379
Evolution has continually
brought back over and over

160
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:39,920
again, innovations, in order
to adapt to every

161
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,620
situation on Earth.

162
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,110
In our next topic, we're going
to look really closely at the

163
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,360
design of the human body.

164
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,560
