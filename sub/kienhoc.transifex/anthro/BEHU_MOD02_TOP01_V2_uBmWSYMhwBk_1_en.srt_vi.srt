[ÂM NHẠC]

3
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:12,349
Cả bài này nói về 
học thuyết tiến hóa và 

4
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:15,250
những quá trình cơ bản để 
hình thành sự sống.

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,579
Chủ đề của chúng ta lúc này là Charles Darwin
ngoài biển khơi.

6
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:21,059
Charles Darwin được cho là đã
viết nên cuốn sách

7
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:23,259
với tầm quan trọng đứng thứ hai
trong lịch sử phương Tây, chỉ

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,220
đứng sau Kinh Thánh.

9
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:29,269
Vào năm 1859, ấn bản đầu tiên của
"Nguồn gốc các loài qua

10
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:32,158
con đường chọn lọc tự nhiên, hay
sự bảo tồn những chủng ưu thế

11
00:00:32,158 --> 00:00:34,409
trong đấu tranh 
sinh tồn" được xuất bản.

12
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,109
Ngày nay, ta chỉ nhắc đến nó bởi
cái tên "Nguồn gốc các loài", hay

13
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:39,159
thỉnh thoảng chỉ là "Nguồn gốc".

14
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:41,419
Vào thời điểm ông cho xuất bản "Nguồn gốc
các loài", ông vốn đã là một

15
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,570
nhà khoa học nổi tiếng lúc bấy giờ,
được biết đến bởi các thuyết

16
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,799
địa chất của mình, đặc biệt là cách hình thành
các đảo san hô và sự thật

17
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:50,109
là đất có thể dâng cao.

18
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:52,719
Nhưng vì "Nguồn gốc các loài",
ông đã phải suy nghĩ trong

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,739
suốt 20 năm, tìm kiếm
các ý tưởng, lo lắng phần nào

20
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,270
vì ý nghĩa 
của những gì ông đang chứng tỏ.

21
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,370
Ông muốn chắc chắn rằng 
ông có thể chứng minh điều đó.

22
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:03,479
Nhưng ông cũng lo lắng về
ý nghĩa đạo đức, thậm chí là tôn giáo

23
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:05,229
của những điều
ông đang nói.

24
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,340
Darwin không phải là người đầu tiên
mô tả rằng

25
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,219
giống loài có thể thay đổi.

26
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:10,879
Ông không phải người đầu tiên chứng minh
rằng chúng không được quyết định bởi

27
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:13,069
Chúa, bất biến hay không thay đổi.

28
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:16,169
Nhưng "Nguồn gốc các loài" là
một cuốn sách hoàn toàn khác.

29
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,560
Nó nắm bắt được trí tưởng tượng
phổ biến và thay đổi

30
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,500
cách ta hiểu về sự tiến hóa.

31
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,500
Cụ thể là, "Nguồn gốc
các loài" giới thiệu học thuyết của

32
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,049
Darwin về sự chọn lọc tự nhiên.

33
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:29,519
Sự chọn lọc tự nhiên là cách Darwin
giải thích như thế nào và tại sao

34
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,030
giống loài thay đổi theo thời gian.

35
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,710


36
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:37,599
Darwin was not an enthusiastic
rebel against the predominant

37
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,114
ideas of the day.

38
00:01:38,114 --> 00:01:41,379
In fact he said, writing about
natural selection felt a bit

39
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:43,949
like confessing to a murder.

40
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,159
Darwin's start in life wasn't
terribly auspicious.

41
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,399
Ông là con trai của một bác sĩ và
cháu trai của một nhà tự nhiên học

42
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,130
nổi tiếng và một nhà thần học 
tự nhiên.

43
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:54,359
He was sent off to Edinburgh
Medical School, the

44
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,579
fifth of six sons.

45
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:58,200
Ông đã được kì vọng sẽ tiếp nối
công việc của bố minh.

46
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,519
Nhưng ông có vẻ sợ phẫu thuật
và ông cũng không quá

47
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,719
giỏi trong việc học của mình.

48
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,590
Ông lại cảm thấy hứng thú hơn nhiều
đối với mùa gà

49
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,159
lôi và việc đi săn.

50
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,170
And so his father other kind of
pulled him out because he

51
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,759
didn't think his grades
were good enough.

52
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,209
His father decided to send him
off to Christ's College in

53
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:15,849
Cambridge, to turn his fifth of
six children into something

54
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:16,250
worthwhile.

55
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,550
He might be a parson,
a country parson.

56
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,680
Và Darwin cũng không quá hứng thú 
đối với thần học,

57
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,159
nhưng ông thích
sưu tập ong, thứ vốn

58
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,419
là "mốt" lúc bấy giờ.

59
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:26,819
Thần học và sưu tập ong,
chúng có vẻ khác biệt hoàn toàn

60
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,620
nhưng thực tế, nhiều 
nhà tự nhiên học thời đó

61
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,629
nghĩ rằng những gì họ đang
làm chính là nghiên cứu

62
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:33,060
công trình của Chúa.

63
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,719
Tự nhiên học cũng là một loại
thần học.

64
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:38,859
Khi Darwin về nhà cho kì nghỉ hè
năm 1831, ông

65
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,330
gần như đã sẵn sàng lấy súng của mình
và đi săn.

66
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,570
Trong khi thực tế, ông nhận được lời nhắn
từ một trong những giáo sư của mình,

67
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:46,189
người đã sắp xếp để ông
trở thành nhà tự nhiên học của đoàn tàu

68
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:47,800
HMS Beagle.

69
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,330
He would voyage on what was
planned to be a two or three

70
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,890
year voyage on the Beagle and
keep the captain, Captain

71
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:54,209
Fitzroy, company.

72
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,129
It was actually a pretty
important role because the

73
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:58,210
previous captain had gotten so
depressed that he had locked

74
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,830
himself in his cabin
and shot himself.

75
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,480
Darwin's primary duties would
be as a collector, as a

76
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:06,169
geologist, making
observations.

77
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:09,379
But he was really there as a
companion of the captain, who

78
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:11,509
couldn't be expected to
socialise with the crew, being

79
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:14,909
of such a higher class than
the members of the crew.

80
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:18,090
Although his father was not
happy about this either, he in

81
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,490
fact agreed to finance
the entire trip.

82
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,330
And Darwin went off.

83
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,480
The voyage in fact extended
to five years.

84
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:26,619
And during that time, Darwin
went from being interested in

85
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,110
geology, to becoming one of the
most prominent geologists,

86
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,430
even naturalists of his day.

87
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,510
The Beagle departed in
December of 1831.

88
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:36,689
And it began its journey,
sailing over to South America,

89
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:38,650
charting the coastlines
as it went.

90
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,030
Darwin turned out to be very
good at observations.

91
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,169
He wrote long journal entries
about the geology,

92
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:45,589
the things he saw.

93
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,930
He collected specimens of
animals and fossils.

94
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,520
Everywhere he went, he
accumulated more and more

95
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,500
information.

96
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,409
He observed coastlines
in Africa.

97
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:56,750
He went and looked at the
jungles in Brazil.

98
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,000
He lived through an earthquake
while he was in Chile, sailed

99
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,319
across the Pacific, where he
saw the Coral Islands, and

100
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,979
even made it to Australia.

101
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,629
Darwin didn't always realise
the importance

102
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:07,769
of what he was seeing.

103
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:11,350
For example, the crew ate the
turtles, that would prove to

104
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:13,819
be so important to his
evolutionary theory later on.

105
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:16,709
But he took a lot of notes and
he was sending specimens back

106
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,709
the entire time while
he travelled.

107
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,790
By the time he actually got back
to England in 1836, his

108
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,069
mentor had already started to

109
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:24,569
circulate some of his journals.

110
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:27,480
And he was excited to help
Darwin organise, to get the

111
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,780
naturalists, who would dissect
and classify and examine all

112
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:32,750
the specimens he had found.

113
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,069
Because he had brought back
specimens of extinct animals

114
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:36,079
from fossils.

115
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,939
He had brought back undiscovered
species.

116
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:40,009
There was a lot of excitement
around Darwin's voyage in

117
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:41,930
1836, by the time he got back.

118
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,000
The leading anatomists of the
day competed to analyse

119
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,439
Darwin's specimens.

120
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:48,689
And he started to put together
his own geological

121
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:51,100
observations in one of his first
papers, which describes

122
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,470
how he thought South America
was actually rising, the

123
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,950
continent was getting
taller, higher.

124
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:58,279
His travel memoir of his voyage
on the Beagle turned

125
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:00,109
out to be kind of
a best seller.

126
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,689
He was a bit of a sensation,
a kind of a gentleman,

127
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:05,589
naturalist scholar, elected into
the leading scientific

128
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:07,829
societies of the day,
particularly

129
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:09,589
for his work on geology.

130
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:11,899
But to truly understand Darwin's
importance, you have

131
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:14,969
to realise that it wasn't the
discoveries on the Beagle, it

132
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,520
wasn't what he found on the
voyage, it was what happened

133
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:20,699
after he came back, as
he sat and thought.

134
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:24,920
Darwin's great achievement
in a sense was his just

135
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,319
incredible imagination,
his big picture view.

136
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,300
As he started to put together
the details, he begin to see a

137
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,750
pattern emerging from what was
up to that time just kind of a

138
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,480
collection of different
species.

139
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,170
Darwin was the one who began
to see the relations among

140
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,410
these species.

141
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,730
For example, as Darwin was
voyaging, he took the first

142
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:47,030
volume of George Lyell's book,
Principles of Geology.

143
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:50,500
And Lyell had laid out a kind
of general understanding for

144
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,930
all of what you see
in geology.

145
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,090
He talked about the natural
forces that shaped continents,

146
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:58,419
erosion, upthrust, volcanic
processes.

147
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,689
As Darwin went along the
coastlines of South America,

148
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:03,639
he was very excited
to see some of

149
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,289
Lyell's theories proven.

150
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,930
And he wrote his first
papers using this

151
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,040
kind of frame of mind.

152
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,490
But what Darwin's achievement
was was to begin to take that

153
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:15,340
kind of understanding of the
world, that the world is

154
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:18,709
shaped by uniform processes,
natural laws that don't

155
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:20,889
change, and start to apply
it, not just to

156
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:22,939
geology, but to biology.

157
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:26,480
Lyell had pointed out that it
wasn't catastrophes, one-off

158
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,520
events that had shaped
the planet, but

159
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:30,279
slow and gradual processes.

160
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:33,489
If for example, geologists found
fossils of sea creatures

161
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,139
on the sides of mountains, as
they were in the Alps, then

162
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:38,889
they had to have somehow gotten
there by processes we

163
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:42,659
could still see today, slow
movement of the Earth.

164
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,280
When Darwin came back, he begin
to talk to the other

165
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,879
scientists of the day, the other
naturalists, not just

166
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:50,230
about geology, but also
about biology.

167
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,410
And he began to see a similar
sort of pattern, how gradual

168
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,850
change over long periods of
time could produce this

169
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,930
incredible variety of
species that we see.

170
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,290
But it took a while for him to
truly understand the scope of

171
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,439
what he was observing.

172
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:08,500
Instead of God creating each
species, separate in its

173
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,519
present form, he begin to see
how the species could change.

174
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,430
Darwin wasn't the first person
to argue that God hadn't

175
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,050
created every single species
independently,

176
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,240
in its current form.

177
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,110
But he was the first to pull
together all the evidence, to

178
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,400
give the big picture.

179
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:26,339
In the next topic, we're going
to talk about that big picture

180
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:28,839
and his theories of natural
selection and On the Origin.

181
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,089
