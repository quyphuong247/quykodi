[PLAYING MUSIC]

3
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:11,899
So is this the end
of evolution?

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,429
So that's how evolution
made human beings.

5
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,149
I mean we've blown through the
details and we've covered

6
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:17,894
things so fast.

7
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:20,100
But in the last four modules,
we've played out some of the

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,710
basics for how we got to
become the way we are.

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,089
The question you're probably
asking though is,

10
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:27,600
so is it all over?

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,100
Is human evolution done?

12
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,570
Are we finished?

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,179
I mean natural selection
is over, right?

14
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:35,539
We've got hygiene.

15
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:37,850
We've got advanced medicine.

16
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,130
I mean it's not like there's
bears roaming in the streets,

17
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,490
picking off the weak
and the old.

18
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,590
For a long time, anthropologists
thought that

19
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,140
evolution was over.

20
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,850
That our technology and our
sophisticated culture so

21
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,760
buffered us against the forces
of natural selection that we

22
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,210
were basically not evolving.

23
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,969
If I could diagram it, it's
sort of like evolution had

24
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:57,589
come along.

25
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,720
And at a certain point with
culture, it just stopped.

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,140
From then on out, it would just
be our technology and our

27
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,920
culture and our language and
our symbols that would

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,900
continue the evolutionary
trajectory.

29
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,510
But our bodies were basically
finished.

30
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,460
The book on human biological
evolution was written.

31
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:15,750
That's what anthropologists
thought was happening.

32
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,540
But the genetic evidence
has come back

33
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,850
in the last 10 years.

34
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:21,869
And it turns out,
it's dead wrong.

35
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,350
It turns out the last 20,000
years, there's been a lot of

36
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:26,269
evolutionary change,
a lot of biological

37
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:28,030
change in human beings.

38
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,250
If anything, it appears that
the last 20,000 years,

39
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,510
evolution might actually be
accelerating, extraordinary

40
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,109
pressures on our immune systems,
our brains, our

41
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:40,010
metabolism, our ability
to digest foods.

42
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,420
And this kind of makes sense if
we really think about it.

43
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,689
It turns out that the only time
a species stops evolving

44
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,039
is when it goes extinct.

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,260
And we're not dead yet.

46
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:54,080
If we think back to Module 2,
the five things we talked

47
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,579
about, that we need for
evolution to occur, are

48
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:03,099
variation, inheritance,
selection, time, and this

49
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:05,169
leads to adaptation.

50
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,659
Well, we've still got them.

51
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:10,520
Variation, if anything we've got
more variation than we've

52
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,310
ever had before.

53
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,740
There's more than 7 billion
humans on the

54
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,310
planet right now.

55
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,610
That's a thousand times more
than we had 9,000 years ago,

56
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,600
when agriculture was just
getting the ball rolling.

57
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,439
In fact, it's about 3 and 1/2
times as many people as there

58
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:27,409
were just at the beginning
of the 20th century.

59
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:30,409
All those people, means
all that variation.

60
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:32,579
If anything, we're in a
kind of evolutionary

61
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,990
hot house for that.

62
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,560
The spread of humanity over
the globe, over the last

63
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,830
70,000 years, has produced all
kinds of really interesting

64
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,640
variation and quirks.

65
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,419
Anthropologist John Hawks, for
example, points out that it

66
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:47,829
would have only been maybe
20,000 years ago at most,

67
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,780
maybe as little as 6,000 years
ago that we first get people

68
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,539
with blue eyes.

69
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:56,609
So there's a whole new
possibility for variation now

70
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,900
that our species has expanded
to the whole globe.

71
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,010
In fact, the rate of mutation
may actually be

72
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:03,500
going up right now.

73
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,030
Because as fathers get
older, well, their

74
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,319
sperm has more mutations.

75
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,439
And in a lot of countries, it
looks like the average age of

76
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,629
fathers has simply
gotten older.

77
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:14,674
So in that case, we may have
more genetic mutation than

78
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:16,020
we've ever had.

79
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,790
The rules of inheritance
also haven't changed.

80
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:20,650
We may understand what's
happening now.

81
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,150
And we may even counsel parents
who have a certain

82
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,969
kind of genetic propensity for
diseases or risks for having

83
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:29,599
children born with congenital
birth defects.

84
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,949
But inheritance hasn't
changed.

85
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:33,769
But, you figured it out.

86
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:34,860
The high, you say.

87
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,200
Selection isn't happening.

88
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:38,379
I mean after all, everybody
survives into adulthood.

89
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:41,632
And we all have children
if we want to, right?

90
00:03:41,632 --> 00:03:44,170
Well, actually that's
not entirely true.

91
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:45,809
If you want to know where
selection is occurring, you

92
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,870
have to look carefully.

93
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,860
You have to know
where to look.

94
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,680
And the first thing to notice
is that the pace of

95
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,640
environmental change under
human influences has

96
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:01,029
accelerated incredibly over
the past 10,000 years.

97
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,629
We know that any time the
environment changes really

98
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:06,870
rapidly, any time you get
upheaval environmentally, you

99
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,830
can often throw a species
into suddenly

100
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,620
shifted selective pressures.

101
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,939
If they were stabilised before
or they were in some sort of

102
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:14,669
equilibrium, that's gone.

103
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:16,620
And that's what's happening
right now with human

104
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,389
environmental change.

105
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:22,019
Right now, for example, in the
United States, erosion, the

106
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,310
national forces of environmental
change, of earth

107
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,149
change, are only moving 1/10 as
much as anthropogenic earth

108
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:32,009
moving, that is bulldozers
and mining.

109
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:35,279
In fact, there's 30 tonnes of
earth moved every year for

110
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,689
each person alive in
the United States.

111
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:38,600
It's not just that though.

112
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,570
It's also that we're dumping new
metals and new chemicals

113
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:43,240
into the environment
constantly.

114
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,710
So much, that a billion tonnes
of garbage were produced last

115
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:49,969
year by humans, some of which
has no foreseeable way of

116
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,500
degenerating in the
sort of biosphere.

117
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,079
Most biologists are convinced
right now that we're

118
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,389
undergoing a sixth mass
extinction event.

119
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:01,719
Five times before in the history
of life on planet

120
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,110
Earth, some event has happened
that's wiped out at least half

121
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,960
of the forms of life
that existed.

122
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,239
And it's usually taken about
10 million years for the

123
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,250
diversity of life to recover,
to bounce back.

124
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,779
Most biologists now think that
we're going through a sixth

125
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:15,899
kind of those events.

126
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,219
Species go extinct
all the time.

127
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,880
That's just part of evolution.

128
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:23,469
But right now, the extinction
rate has accelerated.

129
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,390
It's estimated that 40% of all
species right now may go

130
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:28,189
extinct in the near future,
over the next 100

131
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:30,000
years or 200 years.

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,019
This extinction rate
may be a hundred

133
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:34,159
times faster than normal.

134
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,030
The biologist E.O. Wilson has
estimated that it may be 1,000

135
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:41,259
or even 10,000 times above
the normal rate.

136
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:43,339
It looks like we're going
through the same sort of rate

137
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:46,469
of extinction that the dinosaurs
saw when the

138
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:51,130
asteroids struck the Earth
65 million years ago.

139
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:53,319
You'd have to be pretty
confident about our situation

140
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,790
as a species to look around at
all this extinction and say

141
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,890
well, nothing is happening
to us.

142
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:00,899
In addition, you'd have to be
pretty geographically focused.

143
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:03,669
Because for a lot of the world,
infant mortality and

144
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,600
child death hasn't
disappeared.

145
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,570
Last year, 7 million
children died.

146
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,290
That's 5% of all children
under the age of five.

147
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,189
And in some parts of the world,
like Afghanistan and

148
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:15,740
Somalia, where conditions,
living conditions are really

149
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,870
rough, as many as 10% of
all children under

150
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,399
the age of one died.

151
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:23,560
That means that although in
some rich countries, we've

152
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,439
abolished certain killers of
children, in some places,

153
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:29,949
tuberculosis, malaria,
diarrhoea, a whole series of

154
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:33,019
other medical problems of
diseases, are still working

155
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:36,649
their way mercilessly through
the human gene pool.

156
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:39,609
It's true in the last 100 years,
in some parts of the

157
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,920
world we've managed to
get rid of a lot

158
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,050
of selective pressures.

159
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,629
We have to look back to the
age of Darwin, when child

160
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:46,560
mortality was 50%.

161
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,280
London, through most of its
history, has been a population

162
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,779
sink, where populations
continually had to come from

163
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:54,729
the countryside because living
conditions were so bad that

164
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,950
the natural population growth
rate was negative.

165
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:00,849
At the same time though, our
technology and our new living

166
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,360
conditions have produced all
new selective pressures.

167
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,009
By living in large cities,
close together, with our

168
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:10,599
domesticated animals, we
have bred new diseases.

169
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,870
Just ask the American Indians.

170
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,310
When Native Americans
encountered the diseases from

171
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,389
Europe that were brought over by
Columbus and the Portuguese

172
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:22,659
and the English, they were
decimated by those diseases.

173
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,930
They had no immunity.

174
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,939
Some estimate that the mortality
rate was 90% for

175
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:31,420
Native Americans between the
Colombian discovery and 200 or

176
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,199
300 years later.

177
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,959
Now, although to us that may
seem like ancient history,

178
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,039
from an evolutionary
perspective, the 500 years or

179
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,629
the slightly more than 500
years, is the blink of an

180
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,219
evolutionary eye.

181
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,810
We are going through a kind of
cataclysmic upheaval in the

182
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,600
conditions of natural
selection.

183
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,870
So to go back to our VISTA
model, if we think about the

184
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:55,889
last 10,000 years, which really
for evolution is a very

185
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:58,659
short period of time, the
selective pressures and the

186
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,330
changes in those selective
pressures have been intense.

187
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:05,359
If anything, we have to be
asking a serious question

188
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,020
about where evolution
is going.

189
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,899
And that in fact is our next
topic, where to from here?

190
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:11,149
