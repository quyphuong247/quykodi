1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000


2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,390
Sexuality, it isn't natural.

3
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,679
Whenever I teach about human
evolution on a variety of

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,750
topics, students will
always ask me

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,780
what I think is natural.

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,510
It's a, kind of, trick question,
even though I don't

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,650
think they mean it that way.

8
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:27,189
By natural I think they
mean right or normal.

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,150
They may just be genuinely
curious.

10
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:30,919
They may have heard something
on the news about how a

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,359
particular diet is more natural
for humans or that

12
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:37,869
monogamy is what nature intended
or polyamory, having

13
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:39,299
multiple mates, is.

14
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:41,989
They may have read a story by
an evolutionary psychologist

15
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,440
saying that rape is natural or
being attracted to certain

16
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,169
colours is natural or
certain tastes.

17
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,020
I think it can be a little
bit confusing.

18
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,679
Because we hear so often
about what's

19
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,350
natural for human beings.

20
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,870
The problem is that antonym of
natural, the opposite of

21
00:00:55,869 --> 00:00:59,579
natural, is really human made.

22
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,569
So how can anything that's
done by human be natural?

23
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,519
Whether it's our emotional life,
like a maternal instinct

24
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:08,729
or aggression.

25
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,890
Whether it's hierarchy, or
inequality, or preferences for

26
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,140
certain foods, or preferences
for something else in a mate.

27
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,060
How could anything
human be natural?

28
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,480
I try to tell them that I don't
think we've really been

29
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,450
natural since we've
been human.

30
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,990
Since we've been human, we're
the self made species.

31
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:27,979
We've been shaping our own
development, changing the way

32
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,430
that we relate to the world.

33
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,500
And if life by nature is diverse
if variation is the

34
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,049
precondition of evolution even
happening, then why would our

35
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:40,200
sexuality or our diet or
anything be any different?

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,159
Why would it be that there
would be only one way to

37
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,539
search for a mate or only one
thing to prefer in a possible

38
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,230
partner, for example?

39
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,990
Isn't our variation our only
real insurance policy against

40
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:54,799
the diversity of selective
pressures?

41
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,144
And why would peeling away what
makes us distinctly human

42
00:01:58,144 --> 00:01:59,829
get to human nature?

43
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,250
How does that make sense?

44
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,370
Would trying to peel away
language get to our natural

45
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,920
way of thinking or would it
deprive us of one of the

46
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,900
things that really makes
us distinctly human

47
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,390
in the first place?

48
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:13,314
Students are never really happy
with this kind of answer

49
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:15,159
to the question about
human nature.

50
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:17,750
So let me try a little
different tack.

51
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,169
Roberts Sapolsky is a brilliant
neuroscientist who

52
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:22,549
has a background in biological
anthropology.

53
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,980
Among other things, he studies
the relationship of the brain

54
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:28,239
and nervous system to the
endocrine system in baboons.

55
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,650
He's just an amazing guy and
an amazing lecturer.

56
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,610
If you want to, you
should definitely

57
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,580
check him out on YouTube.

58
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,820
Bob tells this amazing story.

59
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:38,509
He was following a troop of
baboons in Africa and studying

60
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:40,109
them and their behaviour.

61
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,240
And they pretty much behave
like normal baboons, which

62
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,710
meant the dominant male
were just ghastly.

63
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,580
They spent their time fighting
with each other, pushing

64
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,180
around the subordinate males,
making life hell for the

65
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,020
females, battling with
neighbouring troops, and

66
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,710
generally making life miserable
for any of the lower

67
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,740
ranking baboons in the group.

68
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,215
Eventually, the baboons, the
dominant males, conquered a,

69
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:02,969
kind of, trash dump
near a resort.

70
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:05,819
And they wouldn't let any of the
subordinate baboons at all

71
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,340
near the tasty piles of trash.

72
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,370
Which was great for a while
until they started catching

73
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,009
bovine tuberculosis.

74
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:14,689
It ripped through the dominant
males and, basically killed

75
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:17,449
all of the most aggressive males
in the baboon troop.

76
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:20,039
If I had been Bob, I would
felt devastated.

77
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:22,530
I mean, he had been following
this baboon troop for years,

78
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,009
tracking their cortisol, their
stress hormone levels.

79
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:25,909
And here they were.

80
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:28,020
The sex ratio is totally
screwed up.

81
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,070
Their behaviour is bizarre.

82
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:32,479
But here's where it
gets interesting.

83
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,310
The male behaviour in the group,
after those aggressive

84
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,240
males died off, had changed.

85
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,629
But it stayed the same even as
the males migrated out and new

86
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:42,139
males migrated in.

87
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,099
That is the new males
started to behave

88
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,629
like subordinate males.

89
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:48,650
There were no dominant males in
terms of their behaviour.

90
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,840
They all behaved much
more peacefully.

91
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,210
They groomed the females, they
approached them without being

92
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,340
so aggressive.

93
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,270
The disease, in a sense, had
totally shifted the social

94
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,830
dynamics of the baboon troop.

95
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,969
And it stayed this way even
after the males generation

96
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:06,840
after generation changed for
more than seven years.

97
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,140
And the baboon's stress levels,
measured by their

98
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:11,039
cortisol levels, had changed.

99
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,219
The new social dynamics started
to biologically change

100
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:15,030
those baboons.

101
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,540
Their bodies were
adopting to the

102
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,550
shifted behavioural pattern.

103
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,470
And this behavioural pattern was
maintained socially even

104
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,130
while the members
were changing.

105
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:26,310
The pattern of aggressive male
behaviour that's pretty

106
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,300
typical in baboons was just
missing from this group.

107
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,329
The point is that even animals
that are simpler than us

108
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:37,259
cognitively, situations, social
interactions can cause

109
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,740
animals to shift their behaviour
with resulting

110
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,470
changes to their endocrine
system and

111
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,900
their nervous system.

112
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:46,649
Our behaviour is not hard wired
or written into our

113
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:47,819
genes and instincts.

114
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:50,259
But, in fact, responds to
the situations we're in.

115
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:53,819
We adapt behaviorally and even
biologically to the social

116
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:56,680
dynamics, not just
the ecology.

117
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,030
Anthropologists like to draw a
distinction between biological

118
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:03,889
sex and cultural gender.

119
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:06,430
Sex is the equipment you're born
with, its what you are

120
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,810
biologically endowed with.

121
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,009
Gender are the behavioural
traits and the expectations

122
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:12,680
that go along with
that equipment.

123
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,209
And these can vary.

124
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:16,529
Now, the distinction between sex
and gender is a bit messy,

125
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:18,279
and there are lots of traits
that seem to cross over

126
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,709
between one and the other.

127
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:22,310
But in general, the distinction
is a useful one to

128
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,959
think about how we experience
being male or being female.

129
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:29,069
Being male or female in
different places doesn't

130
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:31,050
entail the same things.

131
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,460
As anthropologist Agustin
Fuentes says, who we think we

132
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,519
are matters.

133
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,389
It changes our behaviour and
this feeds back on our

134
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:40,000
experiences.

135
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,600
Even in many of our society's
gender expectations have

136
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,020
changed markedly over
recent generations.

137
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:47,299
Things that we thought were
inherent or innate to being

138
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,680
male or female, have turned
out to be a lot more

139
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,840
flexible over time.

140
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,799
Think about the difference
between your

141
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,090
grandparents and you.

142
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:56,109
Gender roles don't feel
variable to us.

143
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,199
They feel completely natural.

144
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,750
The irony is that's a sign
of our adaptability.

145
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,610
Whatever standards are expected
of us, we adapt to

146
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,580
them so well that they
feel like they

147
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:06,419
were there all along.

148
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,120
They feel like they're
inherent.

149
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,370
But that says more about our
ability to adapt than it says

150
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,660
about any essential difference
between males and females.

151
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,060
Our next topic is sexuality,
getting busy.

152
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,531
