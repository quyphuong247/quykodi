[PLAYING MUSIC]

3
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:11,820
This topic is all about
the difference

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,330
between males and females.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,910
Our popular culture wants us
to believe that males and

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,769
females are opposites,
completely different.

7
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:21,230
That men are from Mars, women
are from Venus; that boys are

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,120
made of snips and snails and
puppy dog tails, girls are

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,370
sugar and spice and everything
nice; all that pink and blue

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,580
stuff, opposites attract,
it's really confusing.

11
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:34,039
The truth is that men are not
from Mars and women aren't

12
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:34,560
from Venus.

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,840
We're both from Earth.

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,230
We're way more similar to each
other than we are different.

15
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:41,309
Even some of the things that
are different between males

16
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,179
and females, are, to go back to
something we talked about

17
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:46,659
in the very first module,
homologies.

18
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:49,959
They're shared structures that
develop in different ways.

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,399
If we have a lot in common
with other species, like

20
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,420
chimpanzees and gorillas, we had
even more in common with

21
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,920
the opposite sex.

22
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,630
There's just so much similarity
between us.

23
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,020
And the biology of our bodies
tells us something quite

24
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,709
different to what our popular
culture often tells us.

25
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,900
The first thing is that
male and female bodies

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,980
start out the same.

27
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,040
We are basically the same
design, with different

28
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,790
tweaks as we go.

29
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,050
Most of the research that looks
at sexual differences

30
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:16,599
starts from the assumption that
sexual differences are

31
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,199
the most important
thing to study.

32
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,530
And it confirms what it starts
with at the very beginning.

33
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,640
But male and female bodies
are surprisingly similar.

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,370
And some of the organs actually
match up perfectly.

35
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,770
They're homologies, one
to the opposite sex.

36
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:33,420
We've got to remember this
similarity if we look at sex

37
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,299
difference research.

38
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:37,340
Because so often sex difference
research is really

39
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,290
doing research on differences
that we're taught to believe

40
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,750
from our earliest days.

41
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,280
Let me give you an example.

42
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,099
Sometimes students are really
surprised to find out that the

43
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:49,000
sexual organs themselves
match up.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,379
For example, the labia and the
testes start life identically.

45
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:56,899
Over time, in the male body, the
labia, or what becomes the

46
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,100
labia, will fuse.

47
00:01:58,099 --> 00:02:01,979
And the testes will descend from
the abdomen down into the

48
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,299
testicular sack.

49
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,539
But it's basically the same
tissue, male and female.

50
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,410
The same thing with things like

51
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,198
testosterone and oestrogen.

52
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,670
I think from popular culture,
that us people assume that

53
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:12,849
only boys have testosterone.

54
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:14,370
It's kind of like boy juice.

55
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,050
It makes boys, boys.

56
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,530
But in fact, males and females
have testosterone.

57
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,080
One of the most disruptive
things about going through

58
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,660
hormonal changes for women is
when they lose testosterone.

59
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:27,120
Because it causes a complete
change in their behaviour and

60
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,504
experience.

61
00:02:27,504 --> 00:02:29,069
The same thing with oestrogen.

62
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:30,250
Boys have oestrogen as well.

63
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,539
Now the balance, the ratios
are different.

64
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:34,819
But the underlying substances
exist in both

65
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:37,009
male and female bodies.

66
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:39,399
The homologies between male
and female bodies are so

67
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,680
close, that up until about six
weeks in utero, you can't tell

68
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,260
the difference between males and
females without going in

69
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:47,079
and doing a test of
the chromosomes.

70
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,500
That is, from conception, down
to about six weeks, the sexes

71
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,669
look identical from
the outside.

72
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:56,899
And you can't tell without
looking for that Y chromosome.

73
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,180
At six weeks of normal
development in boys, they will

74
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,060
begin to become masculinised.

75
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,979
In about week six, if you have
a male infant, something

76
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:09,899
called the sex determining
region of the Y chromosome,

77
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,189
which is abbreviated as SRY, or
the sex determining region

78
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:17,009
of the Y chromosome, will
initiate a change.

79
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:18,959
And the male development
will go off on a

80
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,159
masculinisation train.

81
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,289
Cells will begin to appear
because of the sex determining

82
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:28,989
region of the Y chromosome, that
by about week eight, will

83
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,050
start pumping out
testosterone.

84
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,820
This will lead to the formation
of male genitalia.

85
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:35,069
You'll get gonads.

86
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:37,209


87
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,110
You'll get the penis
beginning to form.

88
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:46,940
And by about week 14, 8 and
14, you'll have sperm.

89
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:49,379
It's only about down here, as
you get into the third month

90
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,419
of development, that you could
really tell from something

91
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:52,869
like an ultrasound if
you've got a boy.

92
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,020
Females' bodies start out just
a little bit slower.

93
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,659
But about eight weeks, you'll
start to see them become

94
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:00,299
sexualised as well.

95
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,795
So that by the time they get
to be four months old, they

96
00:04:02,794 --> 00:04:05,799
have developed ovarian
follicles.

97
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:11,430
Now, if the infant, if the
foetus has a Y chromosome, but

98
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,620
for some reason it's
insensitive to the

99
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,509
androgenising, the male making
hormones, it'll kind of wind

100
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:20,879
up in an intermediate area.

101
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,069
Conservative estimates place
this as 1 in every 500, or

102
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:26,939
maybe as little as 1
every 2,000 births.

103
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:29,339
But it's not unusual.

104
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,779
In this case, the infant will
tend to look female.

105
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:34,464
But it will never develop the
full reproductive capacity of

106
00:04:34,464 --> 00:04:35,949
the female body.

107
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:39,159
Now, what those intersexed
individuals remind us is that

108
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,730
sex in humans isn't just a
switch, a clean switch between

109
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,590
male and female.

110
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:46,089
It's a process that produces
males and females.

111
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:48,839
And it can have other
outcomes as well.

112
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:51,259
Now, this process isn't
finished really.

113
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:54,889
Because when the child becomes
9, 10, 11, 12, and starts to

114
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:58,269
go through puberty, a whole
other wave of masculinisation

115
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:02,709
and feminisation will take
place as puberty.

116
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:05,519
Now in puberty for example, a
change in female hormones will

117
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:08,359
produce the secondary sex
characteristics, things like

118
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,250
the breasts, the change in the
body shape that we know when

119
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,529
girls start to turn
into women.

120
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:16,289
And it'll also begin the onset
of fertility, menarche, the

121
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,680
first menstruation.

122
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,810
In boys, a spike in
testosterone, in male

123
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,459
hormones, will produce the
secondary sex characteristics

124
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:27,120
of men, deeper voices, beards,
change in the hair pattern on

125
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,769
their bodies, enlargement in
general of the genitalia.

126
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:33,849
We see this as the kind of
completion of a process that

127
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,830
started back around week six
and seven really, of the

128
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:38,810
embryonic development.

129
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,280
And even after we reach puberty
and mature, males and

130
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,759
females are not opposite.

131
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,170
They're actually still quite
similar in terms of their

132
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,449
underlying biology.

133
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:49,599
Even things like sexual
stimulation produces

134
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,760
homologous responses in
males and females.

135
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,439
Blood, for example, rushes
either into the penis or the

136
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:56,379
clitoris, which are
homologous organs.

137
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:59,459
The same pattern of excitation
and metabolic changes happens

138
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,189
in both men and women.

139
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:03,670
There are some differences,
don't get me wrong.

140
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,040
Males tend to have higher
upper body strength.

141
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,150
And they have higher
metabolisms, as well.

142
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:11,439
Females, in contrast, tend to
have bodies that fight off

143
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,295
infection better.

144
00:06:12,295 --> 00:06:14,540
They have higher body fat
percentages and other

145
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,240
significant differences.

146
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,120
A lot of evolutionary theorists
and primatologists

147
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,319
say that if you look at other
primates, males and females in

148
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,740
humans are less dimorphic than
the really, truly polygynous

149
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,490
species, like orangutans
or gorillas.

150
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,180
But we're a bit more sexually
dimorphic than some other

151
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,970
species, like gibbons
for example.

152
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,100
With a size differential
that--

153
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,430
females for example are about
80% of the size of males.

154
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,400
For about the past 3 million
years, it looks like our sexes

155
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,519
have been evolving
to become less

156
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,469
dimorphic, closer together.

157
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:50,570
Now, this doesn't mean we're
necessarily evolving equality.

158
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:53,649
What it does mean is that if
males are competing, they're

159
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:56,019
not competing in kind of direct
competition that we see

160
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:57,579
in orangutans and gorillas.

161
00:06:57,579 --> 00:07:00,430
If they were, we would expect
the dimorphism to be growing,

162
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,060
but it's not.

163
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,865
This trend, since we parted
company with the gorillas and

164
00:07:05,865 --> 00:07:08,790
the chimpanzees 8 to 10 million
years ago, the trend

165
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,000
towards less dimorphism, only
really make sense however if

166
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,300
we look more closely at the
sexual reproduction of our

167
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,600
closest cousins.

168
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,480
Then we can see a bit better
what kind of sexual

169
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,410
competition, what kinds of
reproductive pressures our

170
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,340
ancestors have been under.

171
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:27,089
And that's our next topic,
how our bodies don't lie.

172
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:28,607
