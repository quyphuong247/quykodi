[PLAYING MUSIC]

3
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:12,629
This topic is how our
babies made us.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,100
When a horse is born,
it's almost ready

5
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:16,140
to get on its feet.

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,949
Within the hour it's standing,
within a week it's running.

7
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:22,689
Now, it's awkward, but
you try to catch one.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,679
We call this a precocial
infant.

9
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,629
It's precocious.

10
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:29,439
That is, it's advanced.

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,130
It can take care of
things for itself.

12
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:34,129
Sure that foal or that horse
will nurse on its mother for

13
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:34,660
six months.

14
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,500
But it can take care of a
lot of things by itself.

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,969
And in a pinch, it
could even maybe

16
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:39,659
survive without its mother.

17
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:42,219
In contrast, check out a human
infant when it's born.

18
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:43,859
Yeah, it's magical, it's
cute, all that

19
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:46,589
stuff, but totally helpless.

20
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,890
Can't feed itself, can't find
food, can't dress itself, or

21
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,039
clean itself.

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,670
Can't take of itself at all
for what, six months, five

23
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,670
years, 18, seriously?

24
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,050
Studies of hunters and gatherers
have found that

25
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:05,609
until a child is 18, even a fit
adult male, 18, they still

26
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:08,640
haven't yet produced as many
calories as they're consuming.

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,420
That is until they're 18,
they're relying on others for

28
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,359
at least part of their
food intake.

29
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:18,189
This is because it takes 13
million calories to get a

30
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:21,349
child from birth
into adulthood.

31
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:24,159
Only when its had about 13
million calories, will it

32
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,450
cross that threshold where it's
producing more food than

33
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,340
it's taking in.

34
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,430
This is an extraordinary ask.

35
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,320
And a lot of animals, basically
as soon as they're

36
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,449
weened, they can take
care of themselves.

37
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,659
Even other great apes who
might nurse longer than

38
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,079
humans, once the child stops
nursing, the infant is pretty

39
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,129
much on its own to
get its own food.

40
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:46,739
Not in humans, in humans among
foraging groups, the food

41
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,670
gathering techniques are so
information intensive, they

42
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,500
demand so much learning, that a
child has to continue, even

43
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,430
after it's weened, to have
help getting food.

44
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,030
What this means is our children
start to overlap.

45
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,480
So one is weened and then the
next is already there.

46
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,329
But that child that's been
weened is still dependent upon

47
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:07,760
adults for calories, for care.

48
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,189
Children will actually be taking
care of other children,

49
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:12,629
their younger siblings, helping
with their care, in

50
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:14,609
spite of the fact that they
are essentially still

51
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,370
receiving all the support
from adults.

52
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,500
The orangutans can wait from
one child to be totally

53
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,590
independent before they
start the next.

54
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,890
This gives them about an
eight-year window between one

55
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:26,989
child and the next.

56
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,570
Humans don't wait that long.

57
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:31,109
Even though our children take
until they're 18 to become

58
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,770
fully self-sufficient, we can
have children every four or

59
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,170
five years.

60
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:37,859
If we waited until our children
were independent, we

61
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,900
might have children only
every 15 years.

62
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,569
Our fertility is already so low,
every 18 years, a birth

63
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:47,379
spacing of 18 years, that might
drive us to extinction.

64
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:51,849
This pattern of dependency
marks humans as extremely

65
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:54,780
altricial, as opposed
to precocial.

66
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,520
Altricial means requiring the
altruism or the help of others

67
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,700
to survive.

68
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:02,789
And humans are possibly the
most altricial animal.

69
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:05,959
We don't really know for sure
why we give birth to such

70
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,280
immature, demanding,
needy infants.

71
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,099
Anthropologists used to be
confident about this.

72
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,081
We talked about the obstetrical
dilemma.

73
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:19,259
The obstretical dilemma is the
conflict that arises because

74
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:24,239
of the demands of bipedalism,
making the pelvis narrower,

75
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,600
and the size of this head
and that brain growing.

76
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:29,090
That in a sense, we gave birth
to immature infants because we

77
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,909
had to get this head out before
the baby's brain got to

78
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:33,000
be too large.

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,379
Now, we're not so convinced
about that.

80
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:37,719
Now, we're increasingly thinking
what's happening is

81
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:43,250
actually that as the infant
grows in utero, it reaches a

82
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,840
point where its energy demands,
where its calories

83
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,460
that it's demanding in order
to build this big brain,

84
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,540
reaches what we kind
of call a metabolic

85
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:53,340
ceiling for the mother.

86
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,300
That she simply cannot produce
more calories in utero for

87
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,719
this infant's growing head.

88
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:03,259
And so she has to in a sense
give birth, because she'll be

89
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:05,919
able to provide these calories
outside the body better than

90
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:08,009
she's able to provide them
inside the body.

91
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:10,949
That in a sense, they're maxed
out, the mother and infant

92
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:13,239
together, before
we give birth.

93
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,350
You may not have really thought
of it this way.

94
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:19,370
But in fact, the demands of our
infants have shaped not

95
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,259
just our mother's bodies, not
just the female of the

96
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:24,920
species, but it's really shaped
the entirety of our

97
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,240
species over evolution.

98
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,350
This is part of our change
in understanding

99
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,920
how evolution works.

100
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,540
About 20 or 30 years ago, if
you'd asked anthropologists,

101
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,200
they would focused on men's
roles, on hunting, on

102
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,430
gathering, and on defending.

103
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,980
But increasingly, feminist
criticism and better science

104
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,015
has made us realise that this
relationship between mother

105
00:04:44,014 --> 00:04:46,159
and infant is one of
the most important

106
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,630
for shaping our biology.

107
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:52,329
Recent research on sexual
selection may show the imprint

108
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:54,829
of female preferences
on male bodies.

109
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:57,349
But if we look closely at female
bodies, what we really

110
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:02,480
see are the impress of infant
demands on female anatomy.

111
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,439
For example, one of the most
distinguishing secondary

112
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,069
sexual characteristics of women
is the distinctive fat

113
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:11,209
deposits that they have on the
breasts and their buttocks.

114
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:13,659
Once upon a time, evolutionary
theorists thought that this

115
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,130
was primarily to
attract males.

116
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:18,350
But Trivers' hypothesis suggests
that this wouldn't be

117
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,750
something that women
would need to do.

118
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,459
They wouldn't need
to attract males.

119
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:25,579
Increasingly, instead, we think
that those fat deposits

120
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:28,399
had everything to do with
demands of our infants.

121
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,209
That our infants, because of
their extraordinary energy

122
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:34,839
needs, especially with their
rapidly growing brains, need a

123
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,589
constant supply of milk.

124
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:38,869
Now, you don't fat
to produce milk.

125
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,959
But you do need fat if you want,
to level out the ups and

126
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,209
downs of a forging lifestyle.

127
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:48,089
If, for example, one day you
don't find good food sources,

128
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:51,599
you've got a store of fat that
keeps that food supply to your

129
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,470
infant consistent.

130
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,040
The anthropologist Sarah Hrdy
has also pointed out that this

131
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,410
conflict between mother
and child continues.

132
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,400
And it's one reason that
our babies might also

133
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,469
be so fat and cute.

134
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,060
That is, babies don't always get
born in every species with

135
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,839
a lot of fat.

136
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,599
But the fat layer on the baby
may be a way that the baby

137
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,990
signals to the mother
hey, I'm healthy.

138
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:11,829
Take care of me.

139
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,339
Don't give up on me.

140
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:16,609
So that demanding infant,
kind of asks for, begs

141
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,790
for, care from us.

142
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,230
The interests of the infant
and the mother do not

143
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,650
perfectly coincide.

144
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,769
For the mother, it's choosing
how to get as many children as

145
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:26,899
possible to survive.

146
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:29,429
For the infant, it's survive
at all costs.

147
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,470
And so the infant in a sense
has to compete for her

148
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:35,230
attention, has to compete to
make sure that she focuses her

149
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,180
energy on it.

150
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,120
For a mother, her strategy
really is to ration care to

151
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,970
the infant.

152
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,320
She's got to make
hard choices.

153
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,480
She has more than one child.

154
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,040
She can't give in to every one
of the infant's demands.

155
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,470
The infant in the contrast,
their demands are potentially

156
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,510
well, infinite.

157
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:55,680
Remember until 18, 13
million calories.

158
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,240
Part of what makes it very
difficult for many of us in

159
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,660
wealthy societies to see this
struggle between mothers and

160
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,900
infants is that we've cracked
the malnutrition problem.

161
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:06,819
We have these energy-rich
diets.

162
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:09,750
And at the same time, our
fertility is quite low.

163
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,699
Women choose not to have a
large number of children.

164
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,990
In contrast, our ancestors would
have had the opposite

165
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,829
situation, a lot of children
and not a lot of

166
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:18,969
energy to go around.

167
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,910
And so they would have had to
have made some really tough

168
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,360
choices along the way.

169
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,062
If, for example, an infant was
not viable, they might have to

170
00:07:25,062 --> 00:07:28,220
neglect it to take care of the
ones who might survive.

171
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,710
For most of our existence as a
species, high infant mortality

172
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:32,399
would have been the rule.

173
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,139
It would have been a constant
evolutionary pressure on us.

174
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:39,039
In addition, before the advent
of agriculture, because of the

175
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,910
energy output that it takes to
live a foraging lifestyle, we

176
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,300
probably wouldn't have been
able to have children more

177
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,819
than every five years or
so, for the mothers.

178
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:50,319
So in a sense, we can't see
the dilemmas that it would

179
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,740
impose for mothers, the
high infant mortality

180
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,670
rate, the low fertility.

181
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,860
In some foraging groups, some
women will leave no children

182
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,650
alive when they pass away.

183
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:02,179
They may have five
or six during the

184
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,300
course of their life.

185
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,949
But by the time they die,
sometimes all of their

186
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:08,639
offspring have passed away.

187
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,939
This just shows the tough
choices mothers would have had

188
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:13,769
to have made before the advent
of agriculture and before the

189
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:16,339
advent of modern medicine.

190
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:18,919
Our next topic is going to be
the continuation of that

191
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,840
struggle, the struggle to
raise our children.

192
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,089
