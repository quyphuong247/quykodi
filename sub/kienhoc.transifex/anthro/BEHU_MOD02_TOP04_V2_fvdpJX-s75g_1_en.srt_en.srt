2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,710
This is Natural Selection,
Part 2.

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,919


4
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:12,460
Most evolutionary change,
however, isn't really driven

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,320
by interspecies competition.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,260
It's actually driven by
intraspecific competition.

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,560
Intraspecific competition
is with other

8
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,039
members of the same species.

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,359
Let's say we're talking
about bat evolution.

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,890
Competition for a bat isn't
really the fly that it eats.

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,449
If the fly gets faster, it's not
like the fly is going to

12
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:33,439
take the bat's place
in nature.

13
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,009
The real competition for a bat
in evolution is other bats.

14
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:40,049
Your flies get faster or better
able to avoid bats when

15
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:42,189
they're feeding on them--
what'll actually happen is

16
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:44,070
that some of the bats
won't make it.

17
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,670
So most of evolutionary
selection is really

18
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,079
intraspecific competition.

19
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,939
Sometimes, you have competing

20
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:53,979
directional selective pressures.

21
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:56,269
Let's say, for example,
you've got a trait.

22
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,720
This'll be the distribution
of my trait.

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,850
Let's say it's small size
and large size.

24
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,560
And this is the average
for the species.

25
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,030
In some circumstances, you can
get one directional selection

26
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,599
pushing the trait this way and
one directional selection

27
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:09,869
pushing it this way.

28
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,540
This can lead to a long period
of stability in that trait.

29
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,410
We call this stabilising
selection.

30
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:19,979
For example, with a primate,
it might make sense to get

31
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,140
larger to compete for mates.

32
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,340
But if it gets too large, then
maybe when the tigers come and

33
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,870
it has to hide in the trees, it
has a harder time finding

34
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,900
branches to stay in
to keep it safe.

35
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,100
Or maybe getting too large
makes it overheat.

36
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,329
That would tend to push the
trait in the other direction.

37
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:37,260
You may get a situation where
you get a kind of evolutionary

38
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,320
sweet spot where the costs and
benefits are weighed off

39
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,239
against each other.

40
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,099
And this can stabilise
that trait over

41
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:46,629
long periods of time.

42
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:49,319
In contrast, in some situations,
you can get a

43
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,489
selective pressure that pushes
a species in a particular

44
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:53,549
direction--

45
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:55,689
a directional selection.

46
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:59,459
Directional selection favours
one extreme of a trait.

47
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:02,809
So for example, if this was a
diagram showing the height of

48
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,510
a giraffe's neck, and it was
actually in the interest of

49
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:09,090
the giraffe or selected for the
giraffe-- it was fitness--

50
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,784
for it to have taller necks,
what we would see over time is

51
00:02:11,784 --> 00:02:14,180
that this curve would
actually move.

52
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,890
So the average giraffe's neck
over time would become longer.

53
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,959
That's a form of directional
selection.

54
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,320
No one giraffe gets taller.

55
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,689
It's just a question of which
giraffes survive and pass on

56
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,740
their genes from one generation
to the next, so

57
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,550
that over time the whole
population of giraffes would

58
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,520
move to become taller.

59
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,620
In some cases, if you have two
different competing selective

60
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,050
forces, you can actually
get a pattern of

61
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,460
diversifying selection.

62
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,849
This especially happens when,
let's say, for example, you've

63
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:49,769
got a species that's stretched
over a wide region.

64
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,670
And in one area, having a really
light coloured coat--

65
00:02:52,669 --> 00:02:55,009
let's say you've got
mice or rabbits and

66
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,120
they live in the snow.

67
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,819
Having a really light coloured
coat might be an advantage.

68
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:01,250
In another region, that might
be a terrible disadvantage.

69
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,849
Actually, being darker
makes more sense.

70
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:06,849
In that case, what you can
often get is the species

71
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:08,669
almost splits into two groups.

72
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:11,869
We call this diversifying
selection.

73
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,830
Those in the middle tend to have
a harder time surviving.

74
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,740
The two extremes are
more likely.

75
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,120
And you can actually get, in
certain circumstances,

76
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,310
speciation, where a single
species actually departs and

77
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,569
forms two separate distinctive
species.

78
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:29,039
Diversifying selection can
actually happen in multiple

79
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,329
different directions at once.

80
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,100
You can start with
one species.

81
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:33,939
And they actually have
directional selection that

82
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:36,650
drives them in all different
sorts of directions.

83
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,500
For example, when mammals
survived the disaster that

84
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,009
killed off the dinosaurs, what
started as one or two species

85
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:44,649
of mammals-- maybe a handful--

86
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,550
has actually blossomed
into thousands

87
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,840
of species of mammals.

88
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,090
And the reason is that there
have been directional

89
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,659
selective pressures on different
mammals as they've

90
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:54,900
occupied different niches
in the ecology--

91
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,240
whether that's flying or
swimming or escaping from prey

92
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,330
or being a predator.

93
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:04,340
And that leads to what we
call adaptive radiation.

94
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,000
One way to remember this process
is really, for natural

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,740
selection to happen, you need
certain key elements.

96
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,469
The first is variation.

97
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:15,560
Without variation, there's
no natural selection.

98
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,709
Clones--

99
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,389
you won't get evolution, because
you just don't have

100
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:20,509
the variation for selection
to work on.

101
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:23,430
The second thing you need
is inheritance.

102
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,019
Sometimes, you have variation,
but it's not inherited--

103
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:30,819
for example, that blacksmith's
son or technology or learning.

104
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:33,810
The third thing you need
is selective pressures.

105
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,750
No selection--

106
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,209
it's kind of hard to imagine--

107
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,930
and there's no evolution.

108
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,360
These three together--

109
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,780
variation, inheritance, plus
selection over time--

110
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:47,569
are going to produce
adaptation.

111
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:50,980
That is the equation of
natural selection--

112
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,800
variation plus inheritance.

113
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,560
Apply selective pressure over
time, and you'll get

114
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,670
adaptation.

115
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,080
It's not hard to remember.

116
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,180
Just remember this--

117
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,389
VISTA.

118
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:06,399
One question I haven't touched
on, though, is how fast can

119
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,269
this process go in?

120
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:10,250
What time is involved?

121
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,069
Is evolution just a slow and
gradual change of one species

122
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:17,279
into another, a gradual process
that may produce

123
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,279
speciation, and that species
changes tend to be gradual,

124
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,484
incremental?

125
00:05:22,485 --> 00:05:23,889
Well, that's what we
used to think.

126
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:26,560
We saw evidence, for example,
of the slow change in the

127
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,280
fossil record.

128
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,250
And a lot of evolutionary
theorists thought that

129
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,129
evolution tended
to be gradual.

130
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:33,079
But there are some examples
where evolution can actually

131
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,129
happen pretty quickly.

132
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:36,949
One of my favourites is actually
from Queensland.

133
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:41,430
In 1935, Bufo marinus, poisonous
cane toad, was

134
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,639
actually introduced into
Queensland to try to combat an

135
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,620
insect problem in
the cane fields.

136
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,560
I won't get into the
whole story.

137
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,439
But it was really dangerous if
you were a snake once cane

138
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:53,209
toads were introduced
to Queensland.

139
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:56,609
If your head was large enough
to eat a toad, the toads

140
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,110
multiplied so quickly that it
was almost inevitable you

141
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,210
would find one and you would
have a dinner of it.

142
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:04,539
The problem is that being able
to eat those cane toads killed

143
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,330
those large snakes.

144
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:09,649
What's happened in Queensland
since 1935 is that the

145
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:12,279
directional selective pressure,
the pressure on the

146
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,929
snakes, is actually making
their heads smaller.

147
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,150
The reason for that is every
snake with a head large enough

148
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:21,370
to is likely to run into a
cane toad and get killed.

149
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,470
So what's happened in Queensland
over time is a

150
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,790
really rapid evolutionary
change.

151
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,629
Since 1935, the size
of Queensland

152
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:31,029
snakes' heads are shrinking.

153
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:34,199
What we realise is that we can
have a pattern, sometimes, in

154
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,539
evolution of what we call
punctuated equilibrium.

155
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,350
In punctuated equilibrium,
instead of getting this

156
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:46,629
meandering, slow, gradual
process, what we get instead

157
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:50,144
is long periods of consistency,
and then, all of

158
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:53,079
the sudden, a quick change
in a species.

159
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,189
That's like, for example, the
new selective pressure, like

160
00:06:56,189 --> 00:06:57,839
the cane toads being
introduced.

161
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,250
And so sometimes, the tree of a
species does look like this

162
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:01,750
and gradual.

163
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,160
But sometimes, it has these
branches that come off and can

164
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,140
be stable for long periods of
time before going through

165
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:08,579
convulsive change.

166
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:11,430
The harder the evolutionary
pressure, the harder the

167
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,480
selective pressure, and the more
variation you have, the

168
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,730
quicker this process can go.

169
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,980
Natural selection is happening
all the time.

170
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,870
It doesn't go on vacation.

171
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,340
It may be harder to see it when
it's producing that kind

172
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:27,099
of stability, like with
stabilising selection, and

173
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,840
easier to see what it produces
these kinds of punctuated

174
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,799
changes, like when the snakes
encounter the frogs.
