2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,419
Epigenetic inheritance,
inheriting experience.

3
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:09,919


4
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:13,740
In 1944, the Nazi army
cut off the Dutch.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,510
They blockaded the Netherlands
to punish the Dutch for not

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,700
supporting the Germans
sufficiently in World War II.

7
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:24,320
That winter, the winter of 1944
to 1945, wound up being a

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,649
brutal famine.

9
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:28,829
It was known as the
Hunger Winter.

10
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:31,519
The Dutch ran out of food and
fuel, until eventually in the

11
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,200
spring they were resupplied
by the Allies.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,070
The mothers who were pregnant
during the Hunger Winter, they

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,679
gave birth to children who were
disproportionately small.

14
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:41,920
That's not terribly
surprising.

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,500
So some of these wound up with
proneness to certain kinds of

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,579
stress related diseases, other
kinds of health problems.

17
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:51,409
What was interesting, however,
was that in some cases, when

18
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:53,799
these individuals married and
had children of their own,

19
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:57,469
even the next generation started
to have problems with

20
00:00:57,469 --> 00:00:58,740
the same sorts of issues--

21
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,730
stress related, proneness to
diabetes, hypertension.

22
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,469
So what was happening is the
mother's experience in the

23
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:09,750
Hunger Winter up here was
affecting the gene expression

24
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,959
of her grandchildren, two
generations later.

25
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,929
Increasingly, biologists are
interested in these kinds of

26
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,730
processes, how the experience
of one generation can be

27
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,549
biologically passed on not just
to their own children but

28
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,019
possibly even the next
generation, or subsequent

29
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:24,099
generations.

30
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:26,919
The modern synthesis focused
entirely on genetic

31
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,750
transmission.

32
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,709
The reason being that they
thought, because of the

33
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:32,719
Weismann barrier, that these
experiences couldn't affected

34
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,799
an organism's genetic
inheritance to the next

35
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,429
generation.

36
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,750
And besides which, even if
something wasn't inherited, it

37
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,859
wouldn't be stable over a long
enough time period for natural

38
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,609
selection to work on it.

39
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:45,140
Some of the advocates of the
modern synthesis went so far

40
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,519
as to say that we really needed
to do in evolution was

41
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:49,859
to take a genes-eye view.

42
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:53,420
We needed to focus only
on the DNA a change.

43
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,189
If you use a genes-eye view, one
of things it will do for

44
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:59,079
you is it helps you get over
certain popular misconceptions

45
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,189
about evolution.

46
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:02,950
But they were modelling
evolution, in a sense, not as

47
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,480
a struggle between organisms,
but as a struggle between

48
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,790
different varieties
of the genes.

49
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,479
Increasingly, evolutionary
theorists are arguing in some

50
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,180
cases we need to expand
this model.

51
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,050
VISTA, Variation plus
Inheritance with Selection

52
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,719
over Time equals Adaptation
doesn't necessitate that the

53
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,400
only form of inheritance
is genetic.

54
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,879
There might be other forms of
inheritance, which things are

55
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,719
passed down from one generation
to the next that

56
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,580
are stable enough for selection
to work upon.

57
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,870
Clearly DNA a is probably the
most important form of

58
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,340
inheritance that we get
from our mother.

59
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,280
But it's definitely not
the only thing.

60
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,520
If the egg only had DNA
in it, it would be a

61
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,770
little more like sperm.

62
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,790


63
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:48,090
The egg has all kinds of
other things in it,

64
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,450
not just that DNA.

65
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:52,209
It has the mechanisms that we
need to reproduce life from

66
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,930
that DNA, including things like
the mitochondria, the

67
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,740
energy producing parts
of the cell.

68
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,590
We know now that the
mitochondria has its own DNA,

69
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,469
37 genes worth of DNA
in the mitochondria.

70
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:06,259
You'll only inherit it
from your mother.

71
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:07,780
You only get it through
one side.

72
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,080
You don't get any mitochondria
from your father.

73
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,160
And so we can actually use that
mitochondrial DNA to try

74
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,750
to estimate back how long ago
two people or two different

75
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,240
species separated
from each other.

76
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,560
We call that a molecular
clock.

77
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,710
The molecular clock counts on
the fact that since you're

78
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,900
getting your mitochondrial DNA
only from your mother, the

79
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,546
mutation rate can tell how long
that mitochondria has

80
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:34,609
been distinct from another
person's mitochondria.

81
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,610
Since you only mitochondrial
DNA from your mom, and she

82
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,580
only gets it from her mom, it's
kind of like its cloning.

83
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,130
So we can tell approximately
how long that's been

84
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:46,370
transmitted by how many
mutations occur, if we know

85
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,080
the rate of mutation.

86
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,690
We've realised that a strict
reading of Weismann's

87
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,919
principles, that nothing that
happens to the parent could be

88
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:56,399
passed on to the child, we've
realise that it's not

89
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,810
accurate, in part through the
study of epigenetics.

90
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,490
Epigenetics is understanding
how an embryo forms and

91
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,670
develops, in part by modifying
and influencing the genetics.

92
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:09,729
Most of the influence is
coming from the DNA.

93
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:11,669
But some of it, for example, is
coming from all this other

94
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,459
mechanism inside the egg.

95
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,829
We now know that this can be in
a way that something gets

96
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:19,649
inherited, passed on,
to an offspring.

97
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,339
For example, some of the
epigenetic influences include

98
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:25,799
influences that come through
your mother's breast milk.

99
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,840
A lot of the calibration
of your immune system

100
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,389
happens as you nurse.

101
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:33,789
It's almost as if your body is
getting a head start on the

102
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,560
threats it's going to face when
you're out in the world.

103
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,540
Just like those children
of those Dutch parents,

104
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,689
epigenetic influences allow your
body to anticipate the

105
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:45,040
kind of environment that
your parents are in.

106
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,180
For example, if you stress out
a mother when she's pregnant,

107
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,470
her infant's immune system will
respond to the particular

108
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,550
threats that the infant
might face.

109
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,000
For example, our bodies use
information to fight off

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,089
bacterial infection.

111
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,689
We use other kinds of
immune responses

112
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:02,370
to fight off viruses.

113
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,220
If a mother is really stressed
out before a child is born,

114
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,070
what we often see is
an exaggerated

115
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:08,649
inflammation response.

116
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:11,750
That's because the body of the
infant anticipates that it's

117
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,360
more likely to face dangers
from infection.

118
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,410
In contrast, if a mother is not
stressed out, her infant's

119
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,310
immune system will be more
attuned to fighting viruses.

120
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,439
The reason probably is that
viruses are more likely to

121
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,459
threaten an infant who's born in
a large social group, where

122
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,349
viruses are getting
passed around.

123
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,450
In contrast, a mother who's
on our own in evolutionary

124
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:35,430
context was more likely to get
injured or face threats.

125
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,350
And her child, too, was more
likely get injured, leading to

126
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,730
threats from bacterial
infection.

127
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,650
Clearly genes are the
dominant influence.

128
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:46,709
But what epigenetics teaches
us is that, in a sense, the

129
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:47,769
mother's body--

130
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:50,439
even sometimes the father's
body-- has ways of passing on

131
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:53,269
information to the infant to
allow it to anticipate the

132
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,370
kinds of threats it's
going to face.

133
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,519
In our next topic, we're going
to talk about some of the

134
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,169
other non genetic influences.

135
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,420
It's not all in your genes.

136
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,742
