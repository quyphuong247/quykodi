00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,339
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:12,619
When I started working as an
anthropologist, I didn't study

3
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:13,809
human evolution.

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,120
I went to Brazil to
study capoeira.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,030
Capoeira is an acrobatic
Afro-Brazilian martial art

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,039
with music and its
own singing.

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,349
It's incredibly demanding.

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,350
It changes your body.

9
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,660
It affects your muscles
and your

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,070
flexibility and your balance.

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,030
And I was really interested
in how different

12
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,160
cultures trained people.

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,869
How it shaped their bodies
and their senses.

14
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:35,259
I worked for years on capoeira
and wrote a book about it.

15
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:37,809
And then eventually I went back
to the United States and

16
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:42,109
studied cage fighting, the UFC,
or mixed martial arts.

17
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,820
Again, I was really interested
in how the way we train people

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,689
affects their perceptions, how
they sense pain, even in

19
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:50,019
things like yoga and dancing.

20
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,265
I've continued to
study sports.

21
00:00:51,265 --> 00:00:54,179
In fact, today I study rugby
and other topics.

22
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,250
But what I've realised over
the course of the past 20

23
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,009
years is that I'm studying one
of the most important human

24
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:01,909
abilities, which is that
we come into the world

25
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:05,018
incomplete, with a nervous
system that's ready to pick up

26
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:08,280
new abilities, with bodies that
can be shaped by other

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,070
people, by our expectations,
by our aspirations.

28
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:13,359
We change ourselves.

29
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,590
We force our bodies and our
brains to adapt not just to

30
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,079
the environment, but to the
activities that we demand of

31
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,060
ourselves, whether that's
sitting on a computer playing

32
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,420
video games, or whether it's
running ultra marathons or

33
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,510
meditating.

34
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,200
We are an unfinished species.

35
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,100
And in the process, what I
realised I was studying was

36
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:34,809
the evolutionary legacy of
our strange development.

37
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,980
So a few years ago, I realised
what I was really doing was

38
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,770
neuroanthropology, the study
of the relationship between

39
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:44,819
brain and culture.

40
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:48,069
It's not just how our brains are
shaped by our culture, but

41
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:50,409
also how the fact of the way
we have brains makes it

42
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:52,729
possible for humans
to have culture.

43
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,320
For example, being born into
a culture that speaks a

44
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:59,000
particular language means that
your brain, even your ears,

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,400
are going to become adapted
the hearing that language.

46
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,500
By the time you're a year old,
you won't be able to hear the

47
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,480
distinctions that are made
other languages.

48
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,830
And it isn't just language.

49
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,830
Your hobbies, your activities,
the things you are taught in

50
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,830
school, they'll all shape your
brain and your nervous system.

51
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,990
We get geared up, in a sense,
by culture, for different

52
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,280
kinds of capacities.

53
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,110
To learn to read or write, to
balance on your head, to fight

54
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,800
in a cage, or even to chase
down food on the savanna,

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,200
means gearing up your
nervous system for

56
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,299
a particular culture.

57
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,030
All these activities, all these
cultural behaviours, end

58
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,060
up leaving a trace on our
brains and bodies.

59
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,699
They affect the illnesses that
we get, the kinds of stresses

60
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:43,139
that we feel, even how our
senses perceive things.

61
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:45,229
The only way for me to
understand this process, I

62
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:47,030
think, is to understand
evolution.

63
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,780
Because it's evolution that
makes us a kind of unfinished

64
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,449
ape, that makes us biologically
susceptible to

65
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:56,369
inculturation, to being shaped
by these skills.

66
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,064
It, in a sense, makes us this
kind of self-made species.

67
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:05,129


68
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:07,879
To figure out how this works,
how human evolution has shaped

69
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:10,329
us, I think, takes an
anthropological perspective

70
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,590
for three reasons.

71
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,750
The first is that

72
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,909
anthropologists work in the field.

73
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:18,750
We're not afraid to go where
humans or other primates are.

74
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,150
We don't wait around in
our laboratories.

75
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,250
We chase them down.

76
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,300
Even if that means learning a
strange language, or exposing

77
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,340
ourselves this chance of
getting an illness, or

78
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,140
travelling to the ends
of the earth.

79
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:30,779
Anthropologists are
good with messy.

80
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,289
The second thing about
anthropologists is we're

81
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:34,659
specialists in human
diversity.

82
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:36,990
We may start by studying a
single group, or a single

83
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,920
tribe, or a single species of
primates, but really we're

84
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,989
interested in the full range
of what's possible.

85
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,050
And how can you really
understand human evolution

86
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,480
unless you have that kind of
whole species perspective?

87
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,269
And the third thing is
anthropologists believe in

88
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,840
holistic research.

89
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,300
Holistic research means you
don't pay too much attention

90
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,880
to disciplinary boundaries.

91
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,299
When I went to Brazil to study
capoeira, I realised that I

92
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,270
couldn't just study culture,
I had to study biology, and

93
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,110
neurology, even ethnomusicology.

94
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,510
To study human evolution
absolutely requires holism

95
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:10,750
because you can't just find the
evidence in the bones or

96
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,400
the DNA or the stones.

97
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,860
You have to really throw the
net as wide as possible.

98
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,730
So welcome aboard
and strap in.

99
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,209
I think one thing you'll realise
is that the final word

100
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:22,759
about human evolution certainly
hasn't been written.

101
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:25,069
New findings turn our
understandings upside down

102
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:26,000
from time to time.

103
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,680
I can't use the same slides and
lecture notes that I used

104
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,610
to use five years ago because
new discoveries are constantly

105
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,670
emerging that shape how we
understand our origins.

106
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,000
The exciting thing, though, is
that the more evidence we

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,120
have, the more the
picture fills in.

108
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,699
I welcome your opinions and your
interjections, even if I

109
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:45,819
don't necessarily agree with
them 100%, because I think

110
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,829
it's only by putting all the
evidence, all the possible

111
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:51,209
interpretations on the table
and having a really good

112
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:53,659
debate about it, are we going to
get closer to understanding

113
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,730
the full story of our ancestors
and our origins.

114
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,379
In the next topic, we're going
to talk about how once upon a

115
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:01,629
time you had a tail.

116
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:03,089
