[MUSIC PLAYING]

3
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:12,009
We're going to talk
about sexuality,

4
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:15,320
especially getting busy.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,719
You can't control who you're
attracted to, no matter how

6
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:19,729
much you try to talk
yourself into it.

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,140
Man, life would be so much
easier if you could.

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,190
It's one of the great tragedies
of some of our

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,170
lives, but it's also one of
the great strengths of the

10
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,030
human species.

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,270
We seem to be drawn together,
to partnerships, not just to

12
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,920
reproduce, but to build lives
together, to cooperate in all

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,230
sorts of things.

14
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:36,769
Some theorists of how evolution
has shaped human

15
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,040
psychology argue that we come
into life programmed by

16
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:43,479
evolution, with certain built
in preferences that are

17
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:46,839
determined genetically, to
help us to find the best

18
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,980
possible mates, to pass on our
DNA to future generations.

19
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:53,559
I think the evolutionary
evidence on this is not

20
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,320
terribly strong.

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,780
There are some basic
preferences.

22
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,800
We seem to be attracted to
people who are healthy.

23
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,699
We seem to be attracted to
people who are like us.

24
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,290
But in general, around the
world, people are attracted to

25
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,020
all different sorts of things.

26
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:08,869
Some people are attracted to
individuals of the same sex

27
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,200
and some people are attracted
to no one at all.

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,250
Thank God, I say.

29
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,090
If all of us had the same exact
preferences, we'd all

30
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,109
theoretically be chasing
after the same person.

31
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:19,810
And it would even more difficult
than it is now.

32
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,710
In fact if we look at the
evidence about human

33
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:25,549
fertility, what we really see
is that desire is not the

34
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:26,640
limiting factor.

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,150
There's more than enough sexual
desire in humans to get

36
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,150
the job done, from a
reproductive perspective.

37
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,180
Humans are interested in sex,
even when there's no chance of

38
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,000
reproducing.

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,909
Even when it's not viable, to
get a pregnancy out of sex.

40
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:41,450
This is different to
most other species.

41
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,670
Most other species are only
interested in sex

42
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,930
when they're fertile.

43
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,550
Whenever someone tries to argue
that there is a norm

44
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,530
that we only have sex for
reproduction, I wonder if they

45
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,939
realise just how little sex that
would involve, how little

46
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,239
sex it takes to get
the job done.

47
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,339
Let's try to put some
numbers to it.

48
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,549
How much sex is necessary
for humans to reproduce?

49
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,829
Well to figure this out, we
need to talk a little bit

50
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:07,079
about birth spacing.

51
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,579
Birth spacing is the amount
of time between viable

52
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,190
pregnancies that a woman has.

53
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:16,439
Our female ancestors who were
foraging, who were hunting and

54
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:19,370
gathering, probably never could
have had 67 babies.

55
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,530
What we have to realise is that
first of all, you've got

56
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,949
the nine months that you would
had for the pregnancy.

57
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:27,989
But then on top of that, when a
woman is nursing on demand,

58
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,520
night and day like our ancestors
would have done, it

59
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,060
turns out that most of
them will nurse for

60
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,009
four to five years.

61
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:37,329
And during this time, if you're
nursing every two three

62
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,340
hours, this suppresses
your fertility.

63
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,490
That means that if we add it
all up, it was probably at

64
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:46,250
least five years between births
for our ancestors.

65
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,650
You've got to remember they had
a very active lifestyle.

66
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,409
They would have had low body
fats, a lot of exercise.

67
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:53,819
And this five-year birth spacing
isn't that out of line

68
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,739
with our other primate
cousins.

69
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,610
For example, in orangutans,
it's even longer.

70
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,650
It's seven or eight years
between births.

71
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,469
Researchers estimate that if
a woman randomly has sex

72
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:04,680
throughout her cycle, without
aligning it with her

73
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,390
fertility, she's about 3% likely
to have a pregnancy.

74
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,639
So if you add this together,
an active lifestyle, five

75
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,649
years birth spacing, 3% chance
of fertility, you looking

76
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,240
first of all at about five to
seven pregnancies during a

77
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,480
30-year reproductive life.

78
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,099
And that's pretty generous.

79
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:28,400
So we'll do the numbers, five
to seven pregnancies, 3%

80
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,000
chance of getting pregnant.

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,340
The maximum you're probably
going to need to reach your

82
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,430
maximum fertility is about 250
heterosexual sex acts over the

83
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,439
course of your entire 30-year
reproductive life.

84
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,800
That's going to include
some periods

85
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,120
of high sexual activity.

86
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,150
But it's also includes a
very long, dry patches.

87
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,590
If you look at it that way,
that's not a whole lot of sex.

88
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,560
You're averaging less
than 10 heterosexual

89
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,180
sex acts per year.

90
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,370
I don't think humans ever had
the minimum amount of sex they

91
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,680
needed to reproduce.

92
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,360
In fact, surveys in the United
States for example, of

93
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,650
long-time married couples, who
are not even trying to

94
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,219
conceive, shows that they have
this much sex or more.

95
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:11,729
What I'm suggesting is that
desire is not in short supply.

96
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:14,379
Desire is excessive from the
perspective of purely

97
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,729
reproducing.

98
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:19,009
In other words, and to sum this
up, some of us are having

99
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:22,360
a lot more sex than we need to,
performing sex acts that

100
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,030
we know are not going to lead
to pregnancy and conception

101
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:27,659
and having sex in partnerships
that we know aren't going to

102
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,660
lead to conception
or reproduction.

103
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,820
And our ancestors probably did
exactly the same thing.

104
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:37,329
Consider the bonobo, one of our
closest cousins, sometimes

105
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:39,109
called the pygmy chimpanzee.

106
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,670
They're much beloved
by anthropologists.

107
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,850
They engage in sex acts,
nonreproductive sex acts, in

108
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,980
every conceivable combination,
male, female; female, female;

109
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,830
male, child; child,
child; female.

110
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:53,250
You get the idea.

111
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:58,079
The point is that they use sex
or reproductive like acts to

112
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,409
build social relations,
to reinforce

113
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,170
ties, to settle fights.

114
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,580
Just like common chimpanzees
use grooming and dominance,

115
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:10,069
aggression, bonobos tend to
use what looks like sex.

116
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:11,439
We're not bonobos.

117
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,279
And our prior ancestors just
didn't probably follow the

118
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,139
same pattern as bonobos.

119
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:18,689
I But bonobos show us that
sex, like virtually every

120
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:20,480
other trait of human
beings, can be

121
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,310
exapted for other purposes.

122
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,430
It can be used and readapted
to serve others functions.

123
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,389
I think it makes more sense to
recognise that human sexual

124
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:29,779
behaviour is adaptive.

125
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:32,389
It can change, depending upon
the situation and the needs of

126
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:33,560
the individuals.

127
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,920
For example, there are some
societies that are even

128
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,670
engaged in polyandry.

129
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,120
Polyandry is when one female
has multiple husbands or a

130
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,069
stable group of multiple
male partners.

131
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:47,709
Polyandry seems to happen when
females are in short supply.

132
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:49,319
But humans also engage
in other sorts

133
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,540
of patterns of mating.

134
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,100
For example, males, in male only
situations, like sailors,

135
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,960
and in the military, and in
prisons, can sometimes switch

136
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,299
their sexuality.

137
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,360
Some societies expect
that of people.

138
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,900
They assume that as people
mature, they will move from

139
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:05,659
one type of sexuality
to another.

140
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,900
The good news is that no matter
what kind of crazy

141
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:10,359
ideas we get about sex and
what's normal and what's

142
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,600
right, we seem to manage to more
than reproduce enough for

143
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,629
our population to cover
the planet.

144
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:18,759
The thing is this isn't how
sexuality feels to us.

145
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:21,379
Sexuality feels ingrained
and natural.

146
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:24,079
What we prefer in a partner,
the kind of act we're

147
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,269
attracted to, the kinds of
relationships we find

148
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:28,500
fulfilling, a they can
feel as natural to us

149
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,610
as eating or drinking.

150
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,990
And they are, because it is
essential as humans to define

151
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,240
ourselves in part through
our sexuality.

152
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,280
But we can confuse ourselves
because we often have norms,

153
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,489
how we think things should be,
and confuse ourselves between

154
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,420
the difference of what we think
is normal and what we're

155
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,640
actually doing.

156
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,699
The norm of an institution like
marriage or the family is

157
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:55,889
a complicated brew of history,
of legal structure, divorce

158
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:58,819
law, religion, all
kinds of things.

159
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:02,459
But what's normal is a kind of
fantasy, a fantasy that we try

160
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:04,569
to force on a messy reality.

161
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:07,509
For example, in a classic survey
of anthropological

162
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:11,469
research on marriage, 84% of the
societies that we had data

163
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,010
on, don't just allow polygynous
marriage.

164
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:16,360
They say it's the ideal.

165
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,710
Polygynous marriage
is the norm.

166
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:22,219
However, even in those societies
that most strongly

167
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,270
idealise polygynous marriage,
the majority of men don't have

168
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:26,569
multiple wives.

169
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:27,500
The reason is simple.

170
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,879
They can't afford it.

171
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,689
And if you think about
it, it makes sense.

172
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:33,889
Unless those societies figure
out how to switch the ratio of

173
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:36,419
male infants to female infants,
it's just not going

174
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,319
to be possible for the
majority of men to

175
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,889
live up to the norm.

176
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:44,189
In summary sexuality,
is just not the

177
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:46,180
same as sexual behaviour.

178
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,810
Once you have complicated ideas,
norms, standards for

179
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,490
what you do, well, you've got
a distinctly human way of

180
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,340
engaging in sex.

181
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:58,129
And like the social apes we
are, we find it almost

182
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:01,310
impossible not to care
about how other apes

183
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,110
are engaging in sex.

184
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,540
You can't look to what's natural
to try to clear away

185
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:11,020
the mess, because the mess
is what's natural.

186
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:12,919
In the next module, we're going
to talk about human

187
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,810
brains, how we got them and
well, what they're good for.

188
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,370
