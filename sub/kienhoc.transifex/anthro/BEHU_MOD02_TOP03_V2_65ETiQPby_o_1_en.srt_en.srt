2
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:05,719
How natural selection works.

3
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:09,929


4
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:11,419
How does evolution work?

5
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:13,910
Well, let's take an example
of natural selection, or

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,820
artificial selection, that's
going on right now around us.

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,760
In our hospitals right now,
we're breeding super bugs,

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,179
forms of bacterial infections
that are resistant to drugs.

9
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:25,699
The way we're doing that
is a form of evolution.

10
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:27,410
Let's take Staphylococcus,
for example.

11
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,160
Staphylococcus is a bacteria
that lives normally on your

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,589
skin and on your sinuses.

13
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:35,640
Let's imagine that this
is Staphylococcus.

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,109
Now, the colours represent their
different resistance to

15
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:39,810
antibiotics.

16
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,640
The yellow ones have the least
resistance to antibiotics.

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,320
Every time we douse them with
antibiotics, it's like a form

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,219
of natural selection.

19
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:51,780
The antibiotics
disproportionately take out

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,130
the staphylococcus with
the least resistance.

21
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,980
That's our little yellow guys.

22
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:00,179
Now, over time, what happens
is not that any

23
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:02,420
one individual changes.

24
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,620
It's that the force of selection
gradually changes

25
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,550
the species as a whole by wiping
out all variants that

26
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:11,890
don't have resistance
to the antibiotic.

27
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,799
In the end, you wind up with
Staphylococcus that is

28
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,349
disproportionately resistant
to antibiotics.

29
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:21,929
The Staphylococcus in this
example evolved resistance to

30
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,640
antibiotics not because it
wanted to evolve it, or

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,079
because we wanted to evolve
it, but simply because the

32
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,870
forces of selection--

33
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,750
that is that drug--

34
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,430
disproportionately removed
traits from the population.

35
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,060
The resistance to the
antibiotics is, in a sense,

36
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,240
the trait that determines
whether a Staphylococcus was

37
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:43,189
fit to survive.

38
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:45,709
This is how natural
selection works.

39
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:48,669
It's deceptively simple, but
it's essential to understand

40
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,620
this dynamic to understand
what's happening in evolution.

41
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,650
It's very easy to get
misled and to

42
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,770
misunderstand what can occur.

43
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:57,989
To help explain natural
selection, let's talk about

44
00:01:57,989 --> 00:01:59,649
one of the opposing theories.

45
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,060
Before Darwin's time,
Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, another

46
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,920
naturalist, had proposed another
theory of evolution of

47
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,640
how species change.

48
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,009
Lamarck believed in the

49
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:11,579
inheritance of acquired traits.

50
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,490
That is, that species could pass
on the traits that they

51
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,890
acquired during their lifetime
to their children.

52
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:20,409
Let me give you an example of
this kind of inheritance.

53
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:22,789
According to Lamarck's theory,
if you were the son of a

54
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:25,099
blacksmith, you would be
stronger than the son of an

55
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:27,739
accountant, because the
blacksmith's strength would

56
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,719
get passed on to
its offspring.

57
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:32,740
Use and disuse could lead
a trait to become more

58
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,340
accentuated or to atrophy
and disappear.

59
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,960
The classic example of
this is giraffes.

60
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,090
Lamarck thought that giraffes
got long necks because earlier

61
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,580
generations of giraffes had
stretched their necks and

62
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,120
reached very high.

63
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,520
Lamarck thought that over many
generations, if the giraffe's

64
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,740
kept stretching up to get the
leaves off the tall branches

65
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,710
of the trees, well, eventually,
the giraffes would

66
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,590
wind up really tall.

67
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,140
In contrast to Lamarck's
theory, Darwin's are

68
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:58,819
deceptively simple.

69
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:02,209
Natural selection is basically
four words.

70
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:06,080
Those four words are,
nature proposes

71
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,660
and selection disposes.

72
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:11,000
What Darwin realised from
reading the works of Thomas

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,169
Malthus is that life
was abundant,

74
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:15,179
constantly producing a surplus.

75
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,659
Nature proposes.

76
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:19,520
But he also realised that that
abundance, that geometrical

77
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,950
potential increase--

78
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:22,280
it's bad enough in
humans, it's even

79
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,650
worse another species--

80
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,930
was going to butt up
against limits.

81
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,930
Limits of the amount of
food, limits in the

82
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,210
terms of the climate.

83
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,820
This is selection.

84
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:34,269
Selection wasn't just predators
eating prey.

85
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,219
It was a species competing with
other members of the same

86
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:40,990
species for a limited, a finite
set of resources.

87
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:45,760
Resources were limited,
life was abundant.

88
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,250
In addition, living
things vary.

89
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,789
You don't look exactly
like your siblings.

90
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:52,699
But more importantly, you don't
exactly have the same

91
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,839
underlying abilities, immunity
to diseases.

92
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,520
Even kittens in the same litter
are not identical,

93
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,490
although they look
quite similar.

94
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,189
If every member of a species
cannot survive to reproduce,

95
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:06,849
those differences might
prove crucial.

96
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:09,460
There may be some advantage
which makes one member of a

97
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,040
species more likely to be
successful than others.

98
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,620
Darwin didn't really
know how it worked.

99
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,180
They didn't understand the
mechanisms of genetic

100
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,290
inheritance, for example,
that we understand.

101
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,600
But Darwin realised that if
certain variations were more

102
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,350
likely to make a species fit,
that over generation after

103
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,480
generation, if the unfit members
of the species were

104
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,400
slowly eliminated, that
species would adapt.

105
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,169
So, over many generations, a
population would move more and

106
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,090
more to the fittest extreme.

107
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:40,049
That's what's happening
with giraffes.

108
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,990
That's what happened with the
Staphylococcus and their

109
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,720
immunity to antibiotics.

110
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,470
The more this pressure is
applied, the longer, the more

111
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,110
the species adapts to it.

112
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,490
Natural selection, though,
requires variation.

113
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,790
No variation, no natural
selection, because there's no

114
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,170
variation for that selection
to work upon.

115
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,449
If there's no selection--

116
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:03,479
and that's kind of
hard to imagine--

117
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,850
there'd be no evolution
either.

118
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,425
If there's not some difference
in survival or fertility, then

119
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:12,449
a species won't evolve either,
because natural selection

120
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:15,659
isn't applying any pressure
to the species.

121
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,840
The expression survival of the
fittest is sometimes used to

122
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,439
describe natural selection.

123
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:23,040
And it's accurate, as long as
you realise that the meaning

124
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,645
of the word fittest in this
context is different to what

125
00:05:25,644 --> 00:05:26,789
we might usually mean.

126
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,480
It doesn't mean the
most fit in the

127
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,759
sense of physical fitness.

128
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,539
It doesn't mean the strongest
or the fastest.

129
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,120
Being the fittest means having
the trait that is selected.

130
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,379
So if you're a Staphylococcus,
it's resistance to

131
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,610
antibiotics.

132
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,590
Whatever selective pressure is
being exerted on the species

133
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:46,310
will determine what makes a
particular individual fittest.

134
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,759
Another example.

135
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,430
If the selective pressure facing
a species, let's say,

136
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,750
is famine, periodically going
hungry, then any kind of

137
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,899
variation that makes an
individual more likely to

138
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:58,979
survive that famine, well,
they're the fittest.

139
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,810
Whether that's having a slow
metabolism, or packing on body

140
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,480
fat, or maybe having a giant
sized jaw to eat food the

141
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,410
others can't, or even digging
underground and just going to

142
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,710
sleep until the famine passes.

143
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:13,949
Whatever makes animals able to
face that selective pressure

144
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:17,259
makes them fittest.

145
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:20,000
Different species sometimes
compete head to head with each

146
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,519
other for the same sorts
of resources.

147
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:25,799
We call this inter-species
competition.

148
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,910
It's one species against
the other.

149
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,230
The thing is, if two species
are competing for the same

150
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,990
exact niche, there tends to
be competitive exclusion.

151
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,680
One of them is probably not
going to be as fit as the

152
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,590
other, and it's going to have to
find some other nice where

153
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:43,799
its traits are dominant where
it's going to survive.

154
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,240
Otherwise, it will go extinct.

155
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,150
We're going to stop right there,
but we'll pick up the

156
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:50,239
discussion of natural selection
in the next topic.

157
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,490
