00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:13,160
This topic is Designed
By Evolution.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,649
I'd like to talk you about the
design of your body and the

5
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,729
evidence for evolution that
exists in the way

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,350
your body is built.

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,240
If we look all over the human
body, what we often find are

8
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:24,609
kind of glitches.

9
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:27,989
They're weird little design
choices, bad ideas,

10
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:29,299
imperfections.

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,289
And in fact, this is really
important to understanding how

12
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:33,539
evolution has produced
us over time.

13
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:36,570
In fact, the flaws and the
imperfections are so important

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,130
that I don't even really
like the word design.

15
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,160
I think it misleads us.

16
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:42,939
It makes us think that there's
some kind of plan or maybe

17
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:46,479
even a designer out there, who
is sitting behind the scenes

18
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,509
programming all of this stuff.

19
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:50,489
Evolution has no plan.

20
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,450
When it built the human body, it
was really working from no

21
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,440
design at all.

22
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,570
Instead, it's organic processes
working over

23
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,939
millions of years that
have produced

24
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:01,281
this wonderful creation.

25
00:01:01,281 --> 00:01:02,399
And let me tell you
what I mean.

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,629
I'll start with your eyes.

27
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:08,829
The eyes are actually really
poorly designed, if you look

28
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:10,789
at them from an engineering
point of view.

29
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,800
The layer of nerves that comes
out of the retina, instead of

30
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,469
being on the back of the retina,
is in fact on the

31
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:17,370
front of the retina.

32
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,530
So to get to your retina,
light has to

33
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,060
pass through the nerves.

34
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,810
It's as though the cabling for
the detectors was put in front

35
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,019
of the detectors.

36
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,729
That make your eye
less sensitive.

37
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,469
But it also creates another
structural problem, which is

38
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:33,450
that all those nerves wind up on
the inside of your eyeball.

39
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,540
And so they have to kind of come
together in a bundle and

40
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,740
go out somewhere.

41
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:39,289
This creates a little blind
spot in your retina.

42
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,300
You're not aware of it because
your brain tricks you into

43
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,530
thinking that your retina is one
smooth, complete picture.

44
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,120
But in fact, if you know where
to look, you can see that you

45
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,540
have a blind spot.

46
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,190
If you were a design student and
you brought in the design

47
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,409
for the eye, so your instructor
would probably say,

48
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:56,479
back to the drawing board.

49
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,630
Why did you put the nose
on the inside?

50
00:01:58,629 --> 00:02:00,589
You could do all kinds of other
things too to make the

51
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,460
eyes better.

52
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:03,599
You could give us a bit of
vision in the ultraviolet

53
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,530
spectrum, like reindeer have.

54
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,349
Reindeer can see lichen
and food.

55
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:10,609
They can even see predators'
urine on the ice, when to us,

56
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,980
we would be snow blind, because
they can see into the

57
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:14,879
ultraviolet part of
the spectrum.

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,189
Or you could see into a bit of
the infrared part of the

59
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:18,449
visual spectrum.

60
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:19,759
It would show us heat sources.

61
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,189
You could walk around at night
and be able to see creatures

62
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:24,520
out there because their
bodies give off heat.

63
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,540
Another flaw in the human
body is the design

64
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:28,449
of the human knee.

65
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:31,069
It's held together
by ligaments.

66
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:33,889
The bones themselves just sit
one on top of the other.

67
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:37,479
It makes the knee especially
liable to tearing.

68
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,969
If you were an engineer and you
saw this, you'd say look,

69
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:41,900
this is not structurally
strong enough.

70
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,939
Given the force that the body
is going to put on the knee

71
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:47,090
and given the fact that you have
no spare legs, well it's

72
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,599
a terrible design.

73
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,319
Every time you're at sporting
event and you see some poor

74
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:54,509
athlete crumpled on the ground,
sometimes with a torn

75
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:57,899
ACL or other ligament, simply
because of the way they turned

76
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,069
when they ran, we should realise
that's part of the

77
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:01,739
problem with the knee's
engineering.

78
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,870
The reason for it is the knee
started off as a hinged joint

79
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,129
in a fish's fin.

80
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:08,949
And for the purpose of the
fish, that structure is

81
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:11,359
totally adequate.

82
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,880
Sometimes evolutionary theorists
refer to these kinds

83
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:17,539
of weird design solutions
as kludges.

84
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:18,479
It's an engineering term.

85
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,319
And it means something that's
unnecessarily complicated.

86
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,989
It's a kind of jerry-rigged
solution to a problem, like

87
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,490
when you gaff or tape
an antenna to the

88
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,450
side of your car.

89
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:30,179
It's not really well designed,
but it's sort of put together

90
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,159
from what you've got.

91
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,689
Some people like to talk about
how they think that the body

92
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:38,050
is an example of intelligent
design.

93
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,990
But in fact when you look at all
these details, you have to

94
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,469
kind of come to the
same conclusion

95
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:42,740
that Don Weiss does.

96
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,480
Don Weiss is a former geologist
who likes to argue

97
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,349
with creationists.

98
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:49,289
And he said it's not an example
of intelligent design.

99
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:53,009
Actually what we have is an
example of incompetent design.

100
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:56,810
And that's precisely the
fingerprints of evolution.

101
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,780
In the next topic, we're going
to talk about some of the

102
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,830
errors that this kind of
thinking can lead us to, the

103
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,770
worst kind of errors for
thinking about evolution.

104
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,296
