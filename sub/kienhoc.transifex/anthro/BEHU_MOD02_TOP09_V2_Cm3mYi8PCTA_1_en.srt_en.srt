[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,140
All of life is not
just competition.

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,800
The cells of our body, for
example, they don't fight with

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,839
each other.

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,969
Giant colonies of ants and
termites get along.

6
00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:21,519
They corporate on
a massive scale.

7
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:23,399
They even lay down their
individual lives for the good

8
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:24,529
of the whole.

9
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,740
Primates and other complex
animals have social lives

10
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:29,589
where they depend
on each other.

11
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:30,699
Darwin recognised this.

12
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:33,299
And he talked about how life
didn't just involve brutal

13
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:33,890
competition.

14
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,700
It also involved
interdependence, cooperation,

15
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,350
even symbiosis.

16
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,850


17
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,359
Symbiosis occurs when species
live in close relationship to

18
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,299
each other, depending
on each other.

19
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:50,799
A parasite isn't really
symbiotic, because the

20
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:53,250
parasite doesn't really give
anything back to the animal

21
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,329
that it's living in.

22
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:56,890
And the predator prey
relationship

23
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,240
isn't really symbiotic.

24
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,120
In a symbiotic relationship,
both partners get something

25
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,279
out of the relationship.

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,909
These symbiotic relationships
can become quite close, quite

27
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:08,569
dependent on each other.

28
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,459
For example, you have a gut
full of helpful bacteria.

29
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:14,839
You actually have more gut
bacteria in weight then you

30
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,240
have brain --

31
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:18,420
100 trillion cells.

32
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,519
It's more cells than all of your
bodily cells, going on

33
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,819
inside your intestines
and your stomach.

34
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:24,279
That's right.

35
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,230
You're a walking mobile home for
this incredible colony of

36
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,260
bacteria and other
microscopic life.

37
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,560
Without them, you could
possibly survive.

38
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,189
And you do, if you have
a terrible infection

39
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:36,289
that kills them all.

40
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,900
But you have a hell
time digesting

41
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,540
certain kinds of food.

42
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,180
For the most part, you walk
around, a cooperative colony,

43
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,660
you and your mostly happy
full of gut bacteria.

44
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:49,479
Other symbiotic relationships
exist in the animal kingdom.

45
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,670
There's clownfish and
sea anemones.

46
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,239
There's bees and flowers.

47
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,637
There's large sea creatures,
and the cleaner fish that

48
00:01:56,637 --> 00:01:59,829
survive, sometimes even in their
mouths or on their skin.

49
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:03,560
The relationship can be so long
term and so intimate that

50
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,320
we get a what we call
co-evolution.

51
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,228
These species co-evolve.

52
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,810
The conditions of one
will shape the

53
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,900
evolution of the other.

54
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,620
They evolve in corporation,
or in sympathy together.

55
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,430
A more distant co-evolutionary
relationship involves the

56
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,629
oxygen in our atmosphere.

57
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:26,509
Up until about 2.4 billion years
ago, there really wasn't

58
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:29,489
much oxygen in the atmosphere,
until the rise of

59
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,780
cyanobacteria.

60
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,669
Cyanobacteria are bacteria
that can

61
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:35,079
produce energy from light.

62
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,850
They have photosynthesis.

63
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:41,120
In the process, they combine
carbon dioxide with water.

64
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,530
They produce a little sugar
that they need to survive.

65
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,050
But the waste product that they

66
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,430
produce is actually oxygen.

67
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,420
Once we had cyanobacteria
forming oxygen, at first

68
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:55,449
geological processes would've
mopped up the oxygen,

69
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:58,549
especially oxidation, which
we see as rust.

70
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,980
That would have caused a lot of
that oxygen to go back into

71
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:02,169
the Earth's surface.

72
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:04,709
However, it took about
200 million years.

73
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,370
But those oxygen sinks
eventually filled up.

74
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,069
Before this process started,
there was less than 1% of the

75
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:12,629
atmosphere that was oxygen.

76
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:15,109
But as the cyanobacteria
started to work, this

77
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,370
percentage would
start to climb.

78
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,759
Eventually it would reach
where we are today, 21%.

79
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:24,969
By that time we had plants and
all kinds of other organisms

80
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:26,280
that need oxygen.

81
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,390
But we have to realise that all
the complex multicellular

82
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:32,409
life that depends upon oxygen
to breathe, in a sense, is

83
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:35,210
living on the pollution
of the cyanobacteria.

84
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,360
Without the cyanobacteria,
there wouldn't be the

85
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,540
conditions for us to live.

86
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:41,549
But this shift in the atmosphere
would have been a

87
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,880
catastrophe at the time.

88
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,319
It would have wiped out whole
forms of life that depended

89
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,349
upon this earlier environment.

90
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:51,139
In the process, it may have also
caused a 300 million year

91
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:54,769
ice age that followed
this event.

92
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,490
An ecological change that
produced the conditions for

93
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:00,790
life as we know it was built
upon a catastrophe that

94
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:04,449
probably wiped out life is as
we could never know it.

95
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:07,509
Cyanobacteria are also really
important to understanding one

96
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:10,409
of the really important ways
that variation may have arisen

97
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:12,009
sometime in evolution.

98
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:14,810
Part of what Lynn Margulis
argued for as

99
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,360
endosymbiotic theory.

100
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,600
The late biologist, Margulis,
first proposed

101
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:19,899
[? endosymbiotic ?]

102
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:24,110
theory back in the 1960s,
against enormous opposition

103
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,970
and rejection at first.

104
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,650
What she argued was that some
forms of complex life are

105
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:32,189
formed when there's a kind of
symbiosis that requires one

106
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,949
organism inside the other.

107
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:36,370
That's why it's endosymbiotic
theory.

108
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:41,269
That complex cells were built
up buy the introduction of

109
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:44,689
smaller organisms inside, and
become permanent part of

110
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:46,779
larger organisms.

111
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:48,819
Margulis took the work of
earlier biologists who

112
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:52,159
realised that parts of complex
cells sometimes reproduce like

113
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,590
simple bacteria.

114
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:56,739
That is, parts of the cell go
through their own kind of

115
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,449
reproductive process.

116
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:00,740
Moreover, if you look at the
little parts of the cells, the

117
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,319
little organelles, the little
tiny parts oftentimes have

118
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:06,959
membranes around them, like a
Russian dolls, like parts of

119
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,870
life inside parts of life.

120
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,149
Margulis argued, in a sense,
that complex cells like we are

121
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:16,819
one started out as little tiny
colonies of cooperative

122
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:18,509
organisms working together.

123
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:21,899
But that over time, what
happened is that the larger

124
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:24,209
ones started to encase
the smaller ones.

125
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:26,750
So what was once a little
complex community of

126
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,579
cooperation became a
single cell, with

127
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,849
the parts still inside.

128
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,950
Margulis described how instead,
complex life and some

129
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:38,279
changes were brought about by
mutualism and corporation,

130
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,649
which she called
symbiogenesis.

131
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:43,819
That is new forms, or new
variation, through this kind

132
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:46,120
of symbiotic process.

133
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,030
Like the complex cell taking on
this little organism, the

134
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:53,619
chloroplast that can make energy
from light, complex

135
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,120
life was part of this
permanent symbiotic

136
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,899
relationship that arose because
of this permanent

137
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,689
corporation.

138
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:03,449
This theory took a huge leap
forward when we finally did

139
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:07,089
the genetic sequencing, and
discovered that in fact parts

140
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:10,439
like the mitochondrial DNA and
the chloroplasts in the cell,

141
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,930
they actually have
DNA of their own.

142
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,500
And it was different to the
nuclear DNA of the cell.

143
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,069
That is, the genetic
fingerprints of these earlier

144
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:21,980
forms of life were still
there inside the cell.

145
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,660
Like any radical new theory,
its proponents probably

146
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,550
overstated the importance
of symbiogenesis.

147
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,460
But I think increasingly
biologists have to acknowledge

148
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:34,409
that it was essential to the
formation of complex life.

149
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,300
Darwin wouldn't have been
surprised by this.

150
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,020
Even in On the Origin of Species
he writes about the

151
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:41,339
cooperation and the
interdependence among

152
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:43,319
different forms of life.

153
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,670
Our next topic is Friends,
Viruses, and Other Forms of

154
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,920
Cooperation.

155
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,461
