00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,240


2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,220
In this topic, we're going to
talk about some of the limits

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,269
on our big brains.

4
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:16,469
In order to afford this big
brain, one of the key

5
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:20,549
innovations was bipedalism,
walking on two legs.

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,530
Now bipedalism is an advantage
for a whole lot of reasons.

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,830
First, bipedalism is more
efficient over long ranges.

8
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:31,009
To walk on two legs takes less
energy than to walk on four.

9
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,920
By some estimates, 35%
more efficient.

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,600
So if you're hunting different
types of food over a huge

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,660
range, walking on two legs
makes it more likely that

12
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:42,139
you're able to get food
before you go hungry.

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,530
The second reason bipedalism
helps to deal with our big

14
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,000
brains is that bipedalism
frees up your

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,479
arms to carry things.

16
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:51,390
Our ancestors probably started
to find food and carry it back

17
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,130
to a home base.

18
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,760
This is especially important
because they're covering

19
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,799
bigger ranges, and they can't
necessarily take their

20
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:58,789
children with them.

21
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:00,329
So they can carry food home.

22
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,570
Gorillas and chimpanzees
don't do this.

23
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,500
Gorillas and chimpanzees are
terrible at sharing.

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,659
It wasn't all easy going in
cooperation, however.

25
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:13,140
From about 800,000 to 200,000
years ago, starvation, hunger

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,609
would've periodically stalked
our ancestors.

27
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:16,739
It was tough time.

28
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:19,500
Climate changing, food sources
that they had got used to

29
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,109
would have disappeared,
dried up,

30
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:23,030
gone south, gone elsewhere.

31
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,980
So hunger shaped their body,
not just efficiency.

32
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,350
And the efficiency became
especially important when

33
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:30,119
calories were short.

34
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,140
The most adventurous of our
hominid ancestors, the ones

35
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,310
who had got out into the
furthest part of our

36
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,370
ancestors' range, they would
have been the ones who were

37
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,859
selected for the most
severe pressures.

38
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:43,040
When the climate changed, they
would have been the first ones

39
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,145
to feel the pain of hunger,
the bite of selection.

40
00:01:46,144 --> 00:01:49,369
Genetic Innovation, the advances
that happened in

41
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,150
evolution, may not have happened
where our ancestors

42
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,550
first arose in the heartland.

43
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:55,739
They have happened out there
on the fringe, where the

44
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:57,439
living was hardest.

45
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,329
Dietary versatility may have
been an insurance policy

46
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,030
against these periodic waves
of starvation that came up

47
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,640
because of climate change.

48
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,909
Getting enough energy wasn't the
only problem that our big

49
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:09,439
brains caused for
our ancestors.

50
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,409
One of the other problems
was heat.

51
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:16,669
One of the things we may not
realise is that when tissue in

52
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:20,250
the body, whether it's muscles
or your organs or your brain,

53
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,120
consumes calories, it's also
putting off heat at the same

54
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,659
time, and our big brains crank
off a lot of heat.

55
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:29,120
We think that one of the reasons
our bodies change so

56
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,539
profoundly is to deal
with the problems

57
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:32,949
caused by or own brains.

58
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:35,939
In particular, we think we may
have gotten more sweat glands,

59
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:39,430
we may have lost a lot
of our bodily hair.

60
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,790
Bipedalism itself would've
helped with getting rid of

61
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:43,280
some of this heat.

62
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,080
As the brain produces heat, one
of the adaptations that we

63
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,850
have that's unusual among
primates is that our brain

64
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:53,250
actually shunts blood, a lot of
blood, along the surface of

65
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,569
the brain, which draws the
heat out of the skull and

66
00:02:56,569 --> 00:02:59,939
pumps it throughout the body,
kind of like a radiator.

67
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:02,439
One of the ways that bipedalism
helps our ancestors

68
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:05,180
to deal with that heat is that
the two things happen when you

69
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,310
stand up if you're otherwise
down at your forelimbs.

70
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,990
One is that when the sun is
high, actually less of your

71
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,560
body surfaces it's exposed
to the sun.

72
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,629
You're a kind of smaller
solar collector when

73
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:17,990
you're standing upright.

74
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,270
The second thing is, when you
stand upright, you put more of

75
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,530
your skin surface in the
way of a breeze.

76
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,520
And the breezes tend
to be better a

77
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,630
little bit off the ground.

78
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:28,359
The ground tends to cut down
on some of the breeze.

79
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,260
Now you've probably experienced
this and you don't

80
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:30,769
realise it.

81
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,050
If you've ever been lying on
the beach, for example, and

82
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,590
you've been really uncomfortably
hot, and you've

83
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,129
stood up and you felt much
more comfortable, you are

84
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:39,789
doing exactly the same thing.

85
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:42,419
You were a decrease in the
surface area of your body

86
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:45,250
exposed to the sun, and you are
raising your body up so

87
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,539
that you get a better breeze
to cool you by blowing over

88
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:52,500
all those extra sweat glands
that our ancestors developed.

89
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,500
One of the advantages that all
this suite of traits gives us

90
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,900
is were actually really good
endurance runners.

91
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,180
It's a controversial theory,
but one idea is that this

92
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,950
suite of traits, of changes,
actually changed our ancestors

93
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:06,459
and made it possible
for them to do we

94
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,290
call endurance hunting.

95
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,459
Endurance hunting is when
humans, even though they're

96
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,730
slower than their prey, run
their prey to death.

97
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:18,778
The trick is because other
animals have to stop pant to

98
00:04:18,778 --> 00:04:22,060
lose body heat, if you just
force them to keep moving, you

99
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,389
don't let them rest and cool
down, eventually they just

100
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:27,699
keel over from heat stroke.

101
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:29,689
Our brains aren't just a
challenge because of the heat

102
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:32,850
and the energy, they're also a
challenge because that slow

103
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,960
maturational process in a
sense imposes a risk.

104
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,189
You postpone sexual maturity,
which means you postpone

105
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:41,990
passing on your DNA.

106
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,675
If life was more risky, if there
was more of a chance

107
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:47,259
that you wouldn't make it to
adulthood and pass on your

108
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:50,670
DNA, then the big brain would
be too much of a risk.

109
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,210
Some researchers think that
that slow brain maturation

110
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,629
process even makes our children
more susceptible to

111
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,802
neural developmental problems,
problems that don't show up in

112
00:04:58,802 --> 00:05:00,450
other species.

113
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:03,389
Finally, big brains actually
have engineering problems,

114
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:04,860
communication problems.

115
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,340
The signalling mechanism that
we use to get between one

116
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:11,159
neuron and the next is actually
about 600 million

117
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,320
year old process.

118
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,279
It arose first in an animal that
didn't even have a brain,

119
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,799
probably like an ancestor to
a jellyfish, that signalled

120
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,930
across its nervous system
with no brain.

121
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,389
If you imagine this is the
brain, human brain, it's not a

122
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:26,629
very good one.

123
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:29,430
If this is the brain, the bigger
the brain gets the

124
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,454
further the signals
have to travel.

125
00:05:31,454 --> 00:05:34,180
Have to travel the distance to
process if they're going from

126
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,470
one part of the brain
to another.

127
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,710
As these distances get longer,
they get slower.

128
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:42,129
At the same time, there's more
points that you have to

129
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:44,670
connect up as the brain gets
bigger, so you need more and

130
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,189
more and more connections among
these if you're going to

131
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:48,069
connect them all.

132
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:51,509
So what happens is, as the brain
increases in size, the

133
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:54,509
number of neurons increases, but
the number of connections

134
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:57,099
actually increases faster.

135
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,310
Now the way that we've dealt
with this in our human brains,

136
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,709
is that we actually have our
brain less densely connected.

137
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:07,149
The parts of the brain the
furthest apart are not as

138
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:08,599
tightly connected as they
would be if our

139
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,750
brain was much smaller.

140
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,199
At the same time, we've also
split the brain more than some

141
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,110
other animals.

142
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,460
One half of the brain
specialises in one thing, and

143
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,349
the other half of the brain
specialises in other things,

144
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,620
and each little part of the
cortex specialises in

145
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,639
something separate.

146
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,169
It's kind of like creating
little hubs of activity that

147
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,500
communicate with each other, but
to do most of their jobs,

148
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,149
they get a lot of done right
in the individual site.

149
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:34,549
The bottom line is that we may
look at our brains and think,

150
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,810
man, they're just great.

151
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,649
But the brains impose
a real cost on us.

152
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:41,370
If it weren't for our
bipedalism, it weren't for our

153
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,160
technology, if it weren't for
our cooperation, for our

154
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,500
ability to defend our children,
this brain would

155
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,350
simply be too costly.

156
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:52,090
Whether it's the energy we need
in food, whether it's the

157
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:56,739
heat they generate, whether
it's the slow maturity, or

158
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,269
whether it's the engineering
problems, all of these are

159
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:01,339
costs for the big brains.

160
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:04,094
That's really the lesson of all
these simple brains when

161
00:07:04,095 --> 00:07:05,400
we compare ours.

162
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,459
If we didn't have all these
special human tricks, all

163
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:11,019
these costs would simply
be too high.

164
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:13,209
The fact that our brains are
so unusual means that in a

165
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:16,779
sense, we need a really good
explanation for how we got

166
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:19,069
them and how we can
afford them.

167
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:21,879
In our next topic, we're going
to talk about how this really

168
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,949
changes the human evolutionary
dynamics.

169
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:25,399
The brain's really change
everything.

170
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,842
