00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:13,269
The Long Slow Sexual
Revolution.

4
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:18,869
In 1672, Moulay Ismail Ibn
Sharif, became the sultan of

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,490
Morocco after his brother
fell off a horse.

6
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,250
He was an incredibly
ambitious man.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,620
Under his rule, Morocco
conquered its neighbours,

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,730
fought off the Ottomans.

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,449
He even tried to build a
capital, Meknes, to rival

10
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:32,339
Versailles, the capital
of France.

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,960
Ibn Sharif also had
a prodigious

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,899
capacity for cruelty.

13
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:38,579
He legendarily ordered the
walls of Meknes to be

14
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,509
decorated with the heads
of 10,000 enemy troops.

15
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:43,939
But history will most likely
remember Ibn Sharif because of

16
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:45,710
his reproductive capacity.

17
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,359
When a visitor from
Europe counted in

18
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,994
1703, he had 867 children.

19
00:00:50,994 --> 00:00:53,199
But he was only partway through
his reproductive

20
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,690
campaign at that point,
maybe only 2/3.

21
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:59,269
He continued to have children
for another 18 years.

22
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,260
It's estimated he had over 1,000
children, having sex

23
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:05,399
twice a day for the entire
60 years of his reign.

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,790
Over that time, he amassed
approximately 4,000

25
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,000
concubines and wives.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,810
In contrast, history doesn't
even really record the name of

27
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,719
the woman who had the
children on record.

28
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:19,670
We know her only as the
Mrs. Feodor Vassilyev.

29
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,950
Mrs. Vassilyev had
67 children.

30
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:29,200
This included 16 sets of twins,
seven sets of triplets,

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,090
even four sets of quads.

32
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,010
From Ibn Shariff's
self-perspective, his approach

33
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,690
with 4,000 wives and concubines
and more than 1,000

34
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,030
children, it certainly looks
like a good idea.

35
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,230
But from the perspective of the
species, Mrs. Vasilyev is

36
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,730
actually more interesting.

37
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:47,380
Because if Ibn Shariff had 4,000
wives and concubines and

38
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:51,299
anything less than 2,000
children, then their fertility

39
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,739
on average was 130 times less
than Mrs.Vassilyev.

40
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:58,890
Ibn Shariff was using up the
scarce resource and actually

41
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,959
producing at a very low
fertility rate per woman.

42
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,649
A population of Mrs. Vassilyev's
would have quickly

43
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,250
overwhelmed the population using
Ibn Sharif's pattern.

44
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,639
The point is that from the point
of view of the species,

45
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:14,039
what might make sense for the
individual doesn't necessarily

46
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:16,769
make sense for the species
as a whole.

47
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,830
But the other thing to notice
is that this reproductive

48
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,360
success of both these
individuals wasn't just a

49
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,710
matter of their unbridled
desires.

50
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,900
Ibn Shariff didn't just
get these children

51
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,490
because of his lust.

52
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,890
He got it because of his
capacity for organisation, the

53
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:35,919
group's capacity for marshalling
resources, armies,

54
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,139
everything that they needed.

55
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:38,779
The same thing with
Mrs. Vassilyev.

56
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,250
She probably didn't raise
these 67 children solo,

57
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,199
single-handedly, in a
cabin in the woods.

58
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:46,709
Both of them grow their
fertility, not just to their

59
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,080
individual traits, but to
our social capacities.

60
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,500
Their reproductive success isn't
just a result of their

61
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,250
bodies, but of all the
logistical and cooperative

62
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,180
capacities of human beings.

63
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,920
Sometime in the past 5 million
years, we underwent a profound

64
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,579
sexual revolution.

65
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,250
It didn't just change the way we
reproduce, the way we have

66
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,030
babies, it created the
possibility of our

67
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,770
modern way of life.

68
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,010
Today if we think about human
population, many of us are

69
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:13,079
worried about the fact
that there are

70
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,570
so many human beings.

71
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,829
But we have to realise it wasn't
that long ago that

72
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,900
there were so few of us.

73
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,319
Our ancestors' fertility rates
were low, their infant

74
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:24,459
mortality rates were high,
and life was really hard.

75
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,000
There were times possibly when
our species was in danger of

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,189
being extinct.

77
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:30,770
In part, the social skills
that we learned from this

78
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,870
sexual revolution
made the entire

79
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,370
modern way of life possible.

80
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,969
It even made possible the
antisocial behaviour of

81
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:38,849
somebody like Ibn Sharif.

82
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:41,939
As we talked about in the last
topic, when humans started to

83
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:45,300
engage in cooperative parenting,
the point is it

84
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,760
didn't just keep their children
alive, they also

85
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,859
learned all kinds of social
skills, empathy.

86
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,020
They even became attracted
to social interaction.

87
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,260
According to Hrdy, this
cooperative parenting led us

88
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:01,129
to become emotionally modern,
long before we were

89
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:03,599
technologically modern.

90
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,519
That is, we cooperated even when
it requires sacrifice.

91
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,969
We weren't simply social
like other apes.

92
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:11,469
We were hypersocial.

93
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:14,409
We were empathetic, even when
we didn't need to be.

94
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:16,250
We sought each other's
approvals.

95
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,420
Basically, we're the huge
suck-ups of the ape world, the

96
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,189
please like me apes.

97
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:24,939
Hrdy thinks this prosocial
nature of humans is shaped by

98
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:28,569
the way we reproduce,
by the way we mate.

99
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:32,889
But even by the way that we as
infants seek attention and

100
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:34,129
resources from adults.

101
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:37,480
We beg them for their
attention.

102
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,310
Take for example, our
intelligence.

103
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,829
If you compare human infants
with apes, chimpanzees,

104
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:47,134
gorillas, orangutans, you find
that they're all pretty good

105
00:04:47,134 --> 00:04:49,219
at remembering where things
are and at figuring out

106
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,680
relations in the world,
cause/effect relationships

107
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,959
between objects.

108
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,779
Where our infants really stand
out, however, is with social

109
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:58,250
intelligence.

110
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,209
It seems that we're better able
to figure out what other

111
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:02,349
people are thinking, what
they're perceiving.

112
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,120
We're primed with what cognitive
scientists call

113
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,030
theory of mind.

114
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:10,139
Theory of mind is the ability to
understand what another is

115
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:11,620
feeling or perceiving.

116
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,850
And human infants are
especially good at

117
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,730
these sorts of skills.

118
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,080
But we're not just born with
better social intelligence.

119
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,379
We create social environments
where

120
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:23,029
these skills are nurtured.

121
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:26,179
We pass our infants around from
one adult to another, so

122
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,329
that infants get experience with
other faces, with other

123
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,329
expressions.

124
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:33,279
In contrast, most of the other
apes cling to their moms for

125
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,949
the first five or six years of
their life, barely interacting

126
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:38,110
with the other adults.

127
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,620
Getting passed around between
adults, however, also creates

128
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,319
other chains of inheritance.

129
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,500
You don't just get intelligence
and skills from

130
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,050
your mother.

131
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,939
You can also pick it up out of
all those other alloparents.

132
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:51,959
Given this environment,
the infant's

133
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,879
social skills got sharpened.

134
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:56,550
Being a cute baby, being
responsive to adults, actually

135
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,910
had a pay off in terms of the
kind of attention you got.

136
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,620
And this shaped us into more
and more social apes.

137
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,740
Even some of the things that
may annoy about infants are

138
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,189
possibly shaped by this
relationship.

139
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:10,740
For example, Bonobos or pygmy
chimpanzees don't

140
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,629
really cry that much.

141
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:14,689
They kind of whimper if
they want attention

142
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:15,949
and this makes sense.

143
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:17,209
After all, they're sort
of hanging on

144
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:18,519
their mother's bodies.

145
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,259
And besides which, there's
predators in the

146
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:21,349
forest around them.

147
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,305
Making a lot of noise would have
been counterproductive.

148
00:06:23,305 --> 00:06:26,090
It might even have increased
their chance of getting eaten.

149
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:28,729
In contrast, when our children
want our attention, they can

150
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,620
go off like a car alarm.

151
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,560
They'll cry and they scream,
which is a terrible strategy

152
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,709
if you're really concerned
about predators.

153
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:37,789
But it's a great strategy if
you're in a group of adults

154
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,550
fighting for their attention.

155
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,650
According to Sarah Hrdy,
there's kind of an

156
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:44,609
inter-infant competition
for attention.

157
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,350
In this context, infants got
better and better at

158
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,800
manipulating adults.

159
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,840
They got more socially skilled
because that was the way to

160
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,369
keep yourself alive.

161
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,069
In our next topic, we'll talk
about reproductive confusion

162
00:06:56,069 --> 00:06:58,449
or why it actually is a benefit
not to really know

163
00:06:58,449 --> 00:06:59,699
when you're fertile.

164
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,163
