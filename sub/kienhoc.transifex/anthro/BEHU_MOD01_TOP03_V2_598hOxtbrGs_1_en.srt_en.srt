1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,330


2
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,560
Once upon a time,
you had a tail.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,820
Look, I'm not singling
you out.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,109
It wasn't you only.

5
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:16,320
There's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,010
We all had them.

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,429
First off, you still
have a tail bone.

8
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:22,429
It's called you're coccyx.

9
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:25,929
And down near the base of your
spine, at the end of your

10
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:28,995
pelvis, you've basically got
what were once five vertebrae

11
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:31,400
that fused together
into one bone.

12
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:33,429
You felt if you've ever slipped
and fallen on your

13
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:36,479
bum, or you stepped on some
steps or ice and you've

14
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:37,829
falling down.

15
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,439
Your coccyx is the base
of your spine.

16
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:43,659
In x-rays, you can see where the
bones have fused together.

17
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:46,069
They started off as five
separate vertebrates when you

18
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,729
were in embryo.

19
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:49,399
But over time, they didn't
grow as much

20
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,579
as your other vertebrae.

21
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,719
And they fused into this one
single bone-- the coccyx.

22
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:55,759
You've got it there at the base
of your spine, and it's

23
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:56,759
kind of useless.

24
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,500
But if you had been a different
species, it might

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,060
have formed a fully
functioning tail.

26
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,959
It's there reminding you that
our ancestors did have tails.

27
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,609
We call organs like the coccyx
vestigial organs.

28
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:13,459
Vestigial refers to the fact
that they show vestigial

29
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:15,059
functions from what
they once were.

30
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,769
They're vestiges of earlier
structures.

31
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:20,069
Some people think that vestigial
organs are only when

32
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:23,139
the organ has no current use,
but that's not the case.

33
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:23,689
The coccyx--

34
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:25,480
well, it's not good for a lot.

35
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,719
But in fact you do use it
for certain things.

36
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:30,539
It's just that it clearly shows
this vestige of the

37
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,900
older use, when it in fact
formed the base of a tail.

38
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,190
The truth is, we've got lots of
these little design quirks

39
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:38,509
spread all over our bodies--

40
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,340
little bits of love the way our
body works that shows us

41
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,920
that in fact, we've
got new apps.

42
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,329
That there were older uses for
these organs in previous

43
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:47,689
animals-- previous species.

44
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:51,109
For example, our body hair.

45
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:52,969
For most of us, it's not
terribly useful.

46
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:57,620
But once upon a time, this was
fully functioning fur.

47
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,579
Goosebumps are that body hair
fluffing up, getting tired.

48
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,219
When our ancestors had a lot
more hair, there's a couple

49
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:06,280
different ways that this
could have been useful.

50
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,870
If your hair fluffed up, you
would have been bigger.

51
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,900
So it may look like you
were harder to eat.

52
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,780
On the other hand, when you get
cold, sometimes you get

53
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,500
goosebumps.

54
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,599
And if you had a lot more fur,
like our ancestors did, that

55
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,919
would have trapped a layer of
air between the fur and your

56
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:21,589
skin, kind of like an
insulated parka.

57
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,009
Now we've got these mostly
useless hair follicles all

58
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:26,019
over our bodies, that some of
us get really upset about.

59
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,230
We tweeze them or wax them
or manscape them off.

60
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:32,129
Hey, you're manscaping the
evidence of evolution.

61
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:35,579
Another example is
our appendix.

62
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,160
Now, our appendix does
have some uses.

63
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,939
In fact, some researchers think
that they're a bit of an

64
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:41,719
insurance policy if
you get really bad

65
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,539
gastrointestinal diseases.

66
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,909
But the truth is you can take
an appendix out, and the

67
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:47,039
person survives.

68
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,599
Mine's been out more
than 20 years, and

69
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,780
I'm doing just fine.

70
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,000
So an appendix is, again,
a vestigial organ.

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,770
It may have a new use, but it
clearly shows evidence that

72
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,930
our gastrointestinal tract was
once adapted to dealing with a

73
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,710
very different kind of diet.

74
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,570
Perhaps an even better
example is in the

75
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:03,729
structure of our ears.

76
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:06,899
If you look really closely on
some of us, you can see at the

77
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,819
very top of our ear, we have
just a tiny little bit of

78
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:11,019
muscle here.

79
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,380
Go ahead-- if you've got
somebody sitting nearby, take

80
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:13,560
a look at them.

81
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,120
Now, it's kind of weird.

82
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,140
It's a vestigial organ.

83
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:18,639
It's not really connected
to anything solid.

84
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,119
And so you can't really
pull on it.

85
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,069
You can't change the shape
of your ear or change the

86
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,199
direction of our ear.

87
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,039
But it's a vestigial organ in
the sense that it reminds us

88
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,150
that some of our ancestors
could change the shape of

89
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,469
their ears.

90
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:30,120
They could direct the
sound better.

91
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,140
They could do party tricks that
we can only dream of.

92
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:36,199
Even structures like
our toes--

93
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:38,789
they show us that the vestigial
use of our ancestors

94
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:42,889
was once to grasp on to trees,
to eat with their feet, even

95
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,129
to take care of their young.

96
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:46,829
And they're still useful for
certain things, like wearing

97
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,310
toe rings or stubbing.

98
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,819
But the truth is we could do a
lot more with our toes if we

99
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:55,539
didn't box them up in shoes,
make them a lazy, and useless.

100
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:57,609
Some people born
without arms--

101
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,450
congenital amputees--

102
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:01,679
actually develop incredible
skill with their legs and

103
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,520
their feet.

104
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,150
They're able to play guitar,
to write their names, to

105
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,930
paint, to drive cars--

106
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,580
all kinds of things that you can
do with your hands, they

107
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,180
can do with their feet.

108
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,650
In fact, Stephen J. Gould and
Elizabeth Vrba want to replace

109
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,259
the word "vestigial" organs.

110
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:19,079
They think it's a
deceptive work.

111
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,060
They prefer to use exaptation.

112
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,990
They think they vestigial organ
has too much of a sense

113
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,100
of useless, whereas an
exaptation is a reuse.

114
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,490
It's like a re-adaptation of one
trait for a new purpose,

115
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,259
repurposing all these structures
into new functions.

116
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:40,310
And this is an important
lesson about evolution.

117
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,410
In evolution, you never get
a complete redesign or an

118
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,290
innovation.

119
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,450
What you really is a kind
of renovation--

120
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:48,139
a re-purposing.

121
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:51,229
So how does evolution actually
do those kinds of renovations

122
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,390
on your body?

123
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:54,539
Well, one good way to understand
is to go back to

124
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,590
that discussion of your tail.

125
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:58,199
When I first brought it up, you
might have thought I was

126
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,209
talking about you having a tail
in a kind of metaphoric

127
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:03,719
way, like you, descendent
of monkeys.

128
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,610
But I was actually talking
about you, specifically.

129
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,960
Back when you were in utero,
about 30 days after you were

130
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:13,754
conceived, if we had a good full
body photo of you, you

131
00:05:13,754 --> 00:05:16,670
would see very clearly
you had a tail.

132
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,460
You looked like a fish.

133
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:20,439
But about 10% of your whole
body length would

134
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,740
have been this tail.

135
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,699
You're only about 11 millimetres
long at the time,

136
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,620
so you weren't really
that big.

137
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,920
It's not exactly the kind of
photo you want to put on

138
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,550
Facebook of yourself, but back
then, you didn't just have

139
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,939
these five shrunken vestigial
coccyx vertebrae.

140
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:38,240
You actually had 10 to 12
fully-formed tail vertebrae.

141
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,850
They were just as impressive as
the ones at the same time

142
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,120
that would have gone on to form
your spine, leading up to

143
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,259
your skull.

144
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:48,019
Those 10 to 12 vertebrae you had
when you were 30 days old,

145
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:52,919
in utero, in other species go on
to form fully functioning,

146
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,060
waggable, prehensile tails.

147
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,600
But in you, they didn't.

148
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,040
Now, why is that?

149
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,330
Well, the DNA that controls the
developmental programme

150
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:06,560
later told your body that it
didn't need those bones and

151
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,250
that nervous system
in your tail.

152
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,709
And so it was reabsorbed
by your immune system.

153
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:16,159
The point is that the DNA
programmes control the

154
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,870
development of what is basically
a kind of shared

155
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,430
body type that we have among
a lot of related species.

156
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,120
In some of us-- more
like monkeys--

157
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,129
that eventually leads
to having a tail.

158
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:30,790
But in humans, our DNA
re-diverts that energy--

159
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,730
re-diverts that development,
says, oh, do we need a tail?

160
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,259
Nah.

161
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:36,670
Let's reabsorb it.

162
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,560
Every once in awhile, the
renovations are not spotless.

163
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,290
The instructions that tell the
body to get rid of that tail--

164
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,990
well, they get a bit garbled.

165
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,060
And every once in awhile, a
child is born who has a bit

166
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,449
more of that tail that we all
once shared in utero.

167
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:52,370
When those genetic instructions
that tell the

168
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,129
body to get rid of those
vertebrae get garbled, you can

169
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:56,329
have the baby was born
with what we

170
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:59,209
call a caudal appendage.

171
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:03,549
A caudal appendage is a nice way
of saying the baby has a

172
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,460
bit of a tail.

173
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,979
They're really rare.

174
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,390
But we do have at least 100
recorded cases where children

175
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,789
are born with a caudal
appendage.

176
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,143
In this illustration,
I've tried to draw

177
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,199
what it looks like.

178
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,379
It's what we would call a

179
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:19,009
posterior aspect of a neonate--

180
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:21,039
that means a picture
of a baby's bum.

181
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,620
And in some cases, we've
actually have recorded

182
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,240
instances where a tail or a
caudal appendage as much as

183
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,699
2.5 centimetres long--
that's about an

184
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,029
inch in the old system--

185
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:33,789
is on the lower spine
of an infant.

186
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:40,810
Now, in medical terms, we call
this a sacrococcygeal mass,

187
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,139
which is a nice way of saying,
lady, your baby has a tail.

188
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:49,199
We call things like a caudal
appendage an atavism.

189
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,560
An atavism is an extremely
unusual phenomena.

190
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,500
It's what you might like
to think of as an

191
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,240
evolutionary throwback.

192
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,629
It's the reappearance of a trait
that was once existing

193
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:03,009
in the ancestors, but that's not
existing in the parents.

194
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:06,860
It's kind of like a hiccup in
the whole developmental

195
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,100
process that brings a
trait back that we

196
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,629
thought had gone away.

197
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:15,399
These cases are really rare,
but are they just freaks?

198
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,359
I think they're more important
than that.

199
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,100
The case of atavistic tails--

200
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,420
like the case of other sorts
of atavistic traits--

201
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,860
show us the genetic mechanisms
that are in all of our bodies.

202
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,970
That a lot of genetic
potential is

203
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,530
there in your DNA.

204
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:31,939
It's just been demobilised over
the course of evolution,

205
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:34,570
ready to come back if it's
necessary or useful for

206
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,609
adaptation.

207
00:08:35,609 --> 00:08:37,389
All of these structures--

208
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:40,980
atavisms, vestigial organs,
exaptations--

209
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,480
they really teaches how
evolution works.

210
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,139
That evolution doesn't work by
creating a new structure, but

211
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:47,600
by tinkering with the
developmental

212
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,220
trajectories of organisms.

213
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,660
It doesn't just get
rid of your tail.

214
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:54,110
It has a developmental programme
that over time,

215
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,250
reabsorbs it.

216
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,159
The other think the traits like
atavistic tails show us,

217
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,009
and exaptations--

218
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:04,230
in many cases, we have a lot
of unexpressed genetic

219
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,840
material in our DNA.

220
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,060
These are traits that the
vestiges are still

221
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:10,779
there in our DNA.

222
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:14,629
But they've been demobilised by
the evolutionary processes.

223
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:17,909
If our bodies had taken a
different developmental path,

224
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:20,289
we would have a structure like
some of our cousins have--

225
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:21,919
a fully functioning tail.

226
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,909
This is one of the key points
of studying human evolution.

227
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:28,899
It's not just the story of the
ancient past of our ancestors.

228
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:31,230
It's the only way to understand
some of these weird

229
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,779
quirks of our bodies--

230
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:35,350
some of these strange
traits we have.

231
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,950
The biologist Theodosius
Dobzhansky in 1973 famously

232
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,759
titled an essay, "Nothing in
Biology Makes Sense Except in

233
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:45,730
the Light of Evolution," and
I think he's spot on.

234
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,000
It's the only way to
understand the

235
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,450
way our bodies are.

236
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,259
It's the only way to
understand why

237
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:52,069
you once had a tail.

238
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,580
In our next topic, how you
get hands from paws.

239
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,288
