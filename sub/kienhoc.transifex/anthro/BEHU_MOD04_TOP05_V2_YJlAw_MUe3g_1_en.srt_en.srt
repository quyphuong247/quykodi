[PLAYING MUSIC]

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,280
This topic is all about how
expensive our big brains

4
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,929
really are.

5
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:16,850
So if having a big brain is such
a great thing, then why

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,030
doesn't every animal have one?

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,179
I mean if big brains are good
for all sorts of things, why

8
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:24,379
don't fish have them,
why not ants?

9
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:26,410
We humans are pretty impressed
by our brains,

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,410
I got to tell you.

11
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,980
Every time I teach human
evolution and we come up to

12
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,469
talk about what kind of
adaptations will help hominids

13
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:35,379
to survive in different
environments, they say pretty

14
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,990
much brains is the answer
to every question.

15
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:42,620
But if that's the case, then why
are big brains so unusual?

16
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:47,309
In fact, the human solution,
getting this very large brain,

17
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,219
seems to be kind of freakish,
a sort of weird outlier.

18
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:54,390
The general rule of brain growth
is that a species only

19
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,380
gets as much brain as
it absolutely needs.

20
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,969
The first reason all animals
don't have big brains is

21
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,150
because brains are actually
expensive tissue.

22
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,140
If you look at what it takes,
the amount of energy it takes

23
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,219
to run a brain, you'd
be surprised.

24
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:10,200
Your brain only makes about
2% of your body weight.

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,100
And yet when you're resting,
it's taking up 20% of your

26
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:16,125
body's energy, of the calories
you've taken in.

27
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,000
With infants, it's even worse.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,150
The infant brain is growing so
fast that the infant's brain

29
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,120
is using up 60% of the
calories that that

30
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,890
infant takes in.

31
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,530
So we might say this metabolic
price for the

32
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,000
brain is a kind of--

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,450
well, it's kind of constraint
on evolution.

34
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,900
Having more brains
might be great.

35
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,050
But unless you get more
calories, you can't

36
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:38,899
really pay for them.

37
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,640
For example, gorillas appear
to have gotten larger since

38
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,879
gorillas and humans shared an
ancestor, possibly due to

39
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,959
sexual competition as we
discussed in the module.

40
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:51,979
Now for gorillas to have grown
a brain that kept up with

41
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,439
their body size, they'd have
to get a lot more calories.

42
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:57,849
Right now, just to support the
brain size that they have,

43
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:00,899
they have to eat pretty much
80% of all daylight hours.

44
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,300
They just spend their time
sitting there, eating.

45
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,640
And they don't even move much.

46
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,109
They probably go a kilometre
day at most.

47
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:09,500
For gorillas to get a
human-sized brain, they'd have

48
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,189
to somehow get 700 more
calories per day.

49
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:15,479
There simply aren't enough hours
in a day for them to eat

50
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,969
that much food.

51
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:21,069
One problem for ancestors is
that as our brains have gotten

52
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:24,379
larger over evolutionary time,
the equipment that we for

53
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:26,250
getting that fuel, for
getting the calories,

54
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,090
has actually shrunk.

55
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,979
Our jaws and teeth have actually
gotten smaller.

56
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:32,259
Now, we can really tell
if we compare

57
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:34,719
ourselves to this specimen.

58
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,030
This is actually either
Australopithecus boisei or

59
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,120
Paranthropus bosei.

60
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,340
In this particular line of
hominids, what we find is

61
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,750
extremely pronounced,
exaggerated markers of a large

62
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,219
jaw and large teeth, not
just huge molars,

63
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:51,659
but also this structure.

64
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:53,159
It's called the sagittal
crest.

65
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:58,659


66
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:01,669
It's a kind of keel or a kind
of bony ridge on the top of

67
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:03,689
the skull, which the jaw
muscles would have been

68
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:04,909
anchored to.

69
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:08,359
In contrast, with the humans,
what we see is over time, as

70
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,860
we get closer and closer to
the present, all of these

71
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,720
markers, these hallmarks of a
large jaw, are shrinking.

72
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,770
The growing brain, our
shrinking jaws, and a

73
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,030
surprisingly small gut has
made food for us a big

74
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,430
problem, a very big problem.

75
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,430
Primatologist Richard Wrangham
has argued that you simply

76
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,050
cannot build a human-sized
brain, given the diet of our

77
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,560
nearest cousins.

78
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,199
For example, guerrillas
are raw food vegans.

79
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,929
It's simply not possible to get
enough calories that way

80
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,670
in order to build a
human-sized brain.

81
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:43,509
Gorillas eat entirely
leaves and fruit.

82
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:47,699
Now chimpanzees, they do get
some of their calories from

83
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:49,179
animal proteins.

84
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,530
2%, maybe as much as 5% of their
calories, are coming

85
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,659
from eating other animals.

86
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:57,419
Wrangham, who has studied the
evolution of diet, has argued

87
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,379
that if humans had preserved
the ancestral diet, that

88
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,799
chimpanzees have preserved, we'd
need about five kilos of

89
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,630
raw food a day.

90
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:07,549
That's 11 pounds.

91
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,820
To eat that much, would
take you at

92
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,280
minimum, six hours a day.

93
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,990
You'd be spending most of
your day just eating.

94
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:19,410
In contrast, humans
are omnivorous.

95
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,270
That is, we pretty much
eat anything we can

96
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:23,560
lay our hands on.

97
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,269
The foragers, the hunters and
gatherers that we know of from

98
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:30,000
our anthropological records, get
anywhere from 20% to 25%

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,829
of their calories from meat
protein, all the way up to, in

100
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:37,659
some cases, 99% of their
calories from animal protein.

101
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,170
Why does this matter?

102
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,420
Well, to get the same calories
that you get from a kilo of

103
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,800
lean meat, like a game meat,
say for example kangaroo,

104
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,389
you'd have to eat at least twice
as much fruit, two kilos

105
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,729
of something like grapes
for example.

106
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,360
But if you're going to eat leafy
greens, like gorillas

107
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,120
do, you're going to need seven
kilos to make up for the

108
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,149
calories that you get from
one kilo of meat.

109
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:01,609
We suspect that about 2 million
years ago, Homo

110
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,850
erectus, who was already getting
a bigger brain, also

111
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,080
began to forage and scavenge
more widely and more

112
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,419
versatilly, probably eating at
first mostly scavenged meat,

113
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,710
but eventually developing
into a hunter.

114
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:19,069
This would lead not only to new
sources of food, but also

115
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,849
to a kind of demographic
force.

116
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,680
They'd have to look
for food sources.

117
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,019
It turns out that by hunting,
you have to

118
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:27,810
live at a bigger range.

119
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,360
You just need more
space to find the

120
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,850
animals to feed yourself.

121
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,215
It probably didn't just involve

122
00:05:32,214 --> 00:05:34,009
though a change in diet.

123
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:36,949
Our ancestors at some point,
whether Homo erectus or

124
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:39,870
someone who came after,
learned to cook food.

125
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,209
Cooking concentrates
the calories.

126
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:45,719
It's like food processing,
outsourcing your mouth,

127
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,690
outsourcing your teeth, so that
you're doing the work of

128
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:52,129
your mouth and your teeth,
instead with fire or with

129
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:54,579
other types of preparation.

130
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:58,359
So it wasn't just cooking and
meat eating that changed our

131
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,860
way of paying for
this expensive

132
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,639
tissue, this big brain.

133
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,849
It was also that our ancestors
probably got more and more

134
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,160
clever with finding all sorts
of high-yield meals.

135
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,150
They learned to discover caches
of calories, jackpots,

136
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:14,739
little deposits of high calorie
food, rather than

137
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,180
doing kind of low intensity
grazing all the time.

138
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,269
So our ancestors had developed
a new strategy.

139
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:25,490
They were reading more widely
for pockets of high calorie

140
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,079
food, not just sitting there
like the gorillas, eating all

141
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,719
the leaves they could
lay their hands on.

142
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,460
Over time, our ancestors'
strategies got more and more

143
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,430
sophisticated.

144
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,819
As they got smarter, they
learned to exploit seasonal

145
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:39,579
food, food that would only be
there for a very brief time.

146
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:43,509
They've learned just to follow
the fish when they migrated,

147
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:47,437
to go to calving season when sea
lion pups were there, to

148
00:06:47,437 --> 00:06:50,970
find shellfish, to locate honey,
all sorts of food that

149
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,440
would have fed this
growing brain.

150
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,329
So at the same time that our
brains were costly, they were

151
00:06:56,329 --> 00:07:01,300
also giving us the cognitive
tools, the memory, the new

152
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,280
learning that we need to find
the food to feed those brains,

153
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,809
and the skills to pass on that
knowledge to our children.

154
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,180
By the time hominids show up
that looked like us, modern

155
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,750
humans, about 200,000
years ago, our

156
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,519
ancestors had moved on.

157
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,000
They were no longer
vegetarians.

158
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,269
They no longer just scavenged
for meat.

159
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:22,709
They had gone through possibly
a phase of being big game

160
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,979
hunters, to finally, what we
sometimes call the broad

161
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,129
spectrum revolution--

162
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:29,379
broad spectrum.

163
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:33,899


164
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:37,129
By this we just mean that our
ancestors were exploiting all

165
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:39,469
kinds of different resources
in the environment.

166
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,050
And their tools show it.

167
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:44,160
They got smaller and
more sophisticated.

168
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,970
They became more versatile.

169
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,290
The toolkit itself
became larger.

170
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,439
We see things like fishing
hooks, harpoons.

171
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:55,699
We see tools for working with
wood or for crafting skins

172
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:56,939
into clothing.

173
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:00,170
This broad spectrum revolution
was a revolution not just in

174
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,870
our diet, but in our capacity
to take advantage of the

175
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,050
environment.

176
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,110
I always warn my students
though, especially the ones

177
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,439
who talk about being interested
in the palaeolithic

178
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,969
diet, that if you're really
going to follow this model of

179
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,780
the broad spectrum diet, you
better to be ready to eat a

180
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:18,179
lot of things, basically
anything edible that you can

181
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,280
lay your hands on that's
high calorie.

182
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,859
Which means you're probably
going to be a lot of

183
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,189
invertebrates, a lot of insects,
a lot of small

184
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:28,259
vertebrates, lizards and
things like that.

185
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,279
Our ancestors weren't
very picky.

186
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,579
And in the process, they

187
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,639
revolutionised our way of life.

188
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:37,129
They became so versatile that
they could pull hundreds of

189
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:39,889
different food resources
out of the environment.

190
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:45,120
If you want to follow that
diet, well, bon appetit.

191
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,019
Our next topic is going to be,
even brains have their limits.

192
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:49,413
