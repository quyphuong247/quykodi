00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,080


2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,609
Welcome to module four.

3
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:14,339
We'll be talking about human
brains, what they're good for,

4
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:17,559
how we got them, and where
they might lead us.

5
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,649
What are brains good for?

6
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:21,129
Well, why don't we ask
the sea squirt?

7
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:24,460
The sea squirt is this really
simple marine animal.

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,890
It basically starts life
as a larvae that looks

9
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,289
a bit like a tadpole.

10
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,099
And it doesn't stay that way
very long, because it searches

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,660
for the perfect rock
on the ocean floor.

12
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,569
Once it finds that rock, it
fastens itself, and it never,

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,820
ever moves again.

14
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,929
The sea squirt eats by filtering
water, picking

15
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:42,729
little particles out
of the fluid.

16
00:00:42,729 --> 00:00:44,359
And it reproduces
hermaphroditically.

17
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:47,079
It has both male and female
sex organs, so it just

18
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:49,750
basically releases sperm into
the water, and they float to

19
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,500
the other lucky sea squirt.

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,780
What makes the sea sprite
especially interesting is that

21
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,789
it's a chordate.

22
00:00:57,789 --> 00:01:00,460
Now, a chordate has
a spinal cord.

23
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,189
It even has a little cluster
of nerves at the top.

24
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:04,849
It's a little bit like
a primitive brain.

25
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:07,620
While it's in that larval
stage-- while it's a tadpole--

26
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,630
it has a very simple
but a totally

27
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:10,729
functional nervous system.

28
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,630
They're a chordate, like other
animals with brains and

29
00:01:13,629 --> 00:01:16,829
nervous systems, and they use
that to get around, to find

30
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:17,739
their perfect rock.

31
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:21,780
But when they find it, and
they settle in, the first

32
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,320
thing they digest is actually
their brain.

33
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,529
So one of their first
acts as adults is to

34
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,549
digest their own brains.

35
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:31,429
The point is pretty simple, and
no, it's not that adults

36
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,430
have digested their
own brains.

37
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,410
The point is that you need
a brain to get around, to

38
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:39,280
perceive, to move, to interact
with the world.

39
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,489
If you don't-- if you're a
living thing that doesn't

40
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:44,390
interact with the world except
passively, then you don't

41
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,109
really need a brain or
a nervous system.

42
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:50,405
Trees get along perfectly
fine.

43
00:01:50,405 --> 00:01:53,170
All plants get along just fine
without a nervous system.

44
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,564
But if you move in the world, if
you have to interact, then

45
00:01:55,564 --> 00:01:57,289
you need a brain.

46
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,180
We may be impressed by our
imagination, our logic, our

47
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,090
advanced cognitive skills.

48
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,359
We may think our brains
are for language, or

49
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,020
communication, or any
other of the exotic

50
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,100
tricks that we can do.

51
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:11,799
But from an evolutionary
perspective, that's not what

52
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,980
we have brains.

53
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:15,780
Whereas lots of animals that
have brains, they can't do

54
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,800
things like speak, or use
symbols, or do any of those

55
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,200
sorts of skills.

56
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:22,329
We know from evolution that
there's only two basic reasons

57
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,390
you need a brain.

58
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:25,129
The first we've already
touched on

59
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:26,289
with the sea squirt.

60
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:28,179
The first is to interact
with the world--

61
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,830
to get around, to be able
to say to ourselves,

62
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,450
it's hot out here.

63
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:34,030
I need to move someplace cooler,
or that thing over

64
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,419
there is looking at
me like I'm food.

65
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:38,159
The second reason it's great
to have a brain is because

66
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,319
brains regulate bodies.

67
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,199
The more complicated
your needs, the

68
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,030
more you need a brain.

69
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:48,039
It helps us to maintain what
biologists call homeostasis.

70
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:51,009
Homeostasis is equilibrium,
or balance.

71
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:55,590
It's your brain regulating
bodily processes so that your

72
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,300
body adjusts to itself.

73
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,490
When we look at other species,
we see what seems like a huge

74
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:05,370
mental chasm between us and
them, but genetically, we're

75
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,509
actually quite similar.

76
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:09,139
In fact, if you look at it this
way, if you compare us to

77
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:13,459
chimpanzees, we are
98% similar.

78
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,290
Just 2% difference.

79
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:17,944
But that 2% is huge.

80
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:23,759
That 2% gives us things like
language, advanced cognition

81
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,289
and learning, all of our problem
solving skills, even

82
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:29,299
our technology.

83
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,880
How do we get all of this huge
gap in ability from this

84
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,419
little tiny biological
difference?

85
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:38,569
It's even more startling when
you look at it, because if we

86
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:41,930
look in the brain, we can't
find a special part of the

87
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,960
brain that makes humans
different.

88
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,120
Across all the areas of the
brain, all of the neural

89
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,730
architecture, what we find
over and over again is

90
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,006
homologs, homologies, like
we've talked about in the

91
00:03:52,006 --> 00:03:52,830
other modules.

92
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,830
Similarities in the structure
between our brains and the

93
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,719
brains of our nearest cousins.

94
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:00,370
Once upon a time, brain
researchers were looking for

95
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,849
the part of the human brain that
was different to other

96
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:05,909
species so they could figure
out what was that 2%.

97
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:07,590
And they thought, language.

98
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,409
Only humans can do it.

99
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:09,930
There must be some special
parts of the brain.

100
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,930
And in fact, there are two parts
of the brain that seem

101
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,560
specialised for language.

102
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,899
One is Broca's area, and the
other is Wernicke's area.

103
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:20,649
Damage to either one of these
areas can cause serious

104
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:22,180
problems with language.

105
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,579
The problem is, there's
homologies between both of

106
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:26,259
these areas and chimpanzee
brains.

107
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:28,469
The same parts of
the brain exist.

108
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,410
Chimpanzees just use them for
something else, which is a

109
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,040
story we have over and over
again with the human brain and

110
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,610
body is that things that were
used for one purpose get

111
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,370
re-purposed with a human
into new functions.

112
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,170
Animals are so similar that we
can actually transplant the

113
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,540
brain cells from one animal to
another, creating a new kind

114
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,780
of animal-- a chimaera, one that
has cells incorporated

115
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:52,719
from a different species.

116
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,690
Say, for example, chicken
brain cells

117
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:55,969
into a pig's brain.

118
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,730
And if we do it early enough,
the brain cells will be

119
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,129
accepted, so similar is the
function and structure of

120
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:04,069
those neurons.

121
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:06,500
The similarities between our
brains and the brains of other

122
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,910
species means that we can learn
an awful lot by studying

123
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,810
the brains of simpler
creatures.

124
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,230
And the first thing
we learned is the

125
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,080
lesson of the sea squirt--

126
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:18,000
that our brains are really for
interacting with the world,

127
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,750
for moving and taking care of
business, not for silently

128
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,300
contemplating or doing logic.

129
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,670
We tend to get misled by the
metaphors we use for thinking

130
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,199
about the brain-- that it's a
computer or a calculator.

131
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,079
But philosopher Andy Clark has
warned us that our brains are

132
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,370
actually bad at logic
and good at Frisbee.

133
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,009
His point is that your brain is
really good at doing some

134
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:39,170
tasks that your computer
and your

135
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,860
smartphone can't do well--

136
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,000
at face recognition, at
complicated ballistics

137
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,170
problems like running around
and catching a ball.

138
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,650
But it's not very good at
remembering phone numbers.

139
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:51,289
Those kinds of tasks are better
done by a computer.

140
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,700
The way that evolution has
shaped our brain has given it

141
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,099
a distinct set of skills, and
these are shaped by our

142
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,050
evolutionary needs.

143
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,340
Consciousness, logic,
complex thought--

144
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:04,619
these are all evolutionary
latecomers.

145
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,629
They are built upon and added
on top of a much older and

146
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:10,930
earlier set of brain
functions--

147
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,120
ones that we use every day.

148
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,639
We've learned about our
brain's talents and

149
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,969
limitations, in part from the
study of robotics and

150
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,690
artificial intelligence.

151
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:22,860
It was surprisingly easy to
build computers that were

152
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,129
better at certain tasks
than we are--

153
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:28,250
for example, at remembering
the phone book, or even at

154
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,040
beating the greatest chess
champion in the world.

155
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,129
However, it's been much more
difficult to get robots or

156
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:37,569
computers to do things like
to play soccer or

157
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:39,159
recognise your kids.

158
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,490
In fact, those tasks are
really difficult.

159
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,160
We're misled by how easily we do
them, because that's really

160
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,110
what our brains have
evolved to do.

161
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,629
In the next topic, we're going
to talk about how animals with

162
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:55,529
simple brains do really amazing
tricks, but also the

163
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:56,779
different parts of our brain.

164
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:57,981
