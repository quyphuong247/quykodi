3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,019
Darwin and the Origin
of the Origin.

4
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:09,679


5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,019
In order to understand how
Darwin begin to think about

6
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:14,910
theory of natural selection we
have to realize that in 1838,

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,839
two years after he came back
from the voyage, he began to

8
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:20,359
read Thomas Malthus' "An Essay
on the Principle of

9
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:24,800
Population." In the essay
Malthus argues that population

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,949
has a kind of grim reality.

11
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:29,140
That it can increase
geometrically.

12
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,990
Offspring can double
every generation.

13
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:35,250
In the process, what Malthus
realised, and what Darwin

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,740
realised too, was that many
more animals could be born

15
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,960
than could possibly survive.

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,469
Some of these would never
make it into adulthood.

17
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:46,570
This was the grim reality
of population increase.

18
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,850
Darwin realised that species
don't struggle one species

19
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,510
against the other, foxes
against rabbits.

20
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:55,289
But what this meant was that
rabbits were struggling

21
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,159
amongst themselves to survive.

22
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:00,799
A species has a kind of internal
process of struggle.

23
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,109
He compared it to the selective
processes that

24
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:04,260
farmers use.

25
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,120
How they picked seeds to plant
the next season, or how they

26
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,130
bred pigeons for the qualities
they liked.

27
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:12,079
And that's why he referred to it
as "natural selection." He

28
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:14,349
saw it as similar to what humans
were doing, but on a

29
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:16,119
much larger scale.

30
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,430
By the end of the 1830s, and
all throughout the 1840s,

31
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,610
Darwin was really thinking
about natural selection.

32
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:24,459
He was publishing other books,
his books about his voyage,

33
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,459
his books on geology, but he
was stewing on these ideas,

34
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:28,719
and collecting more information

35
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:30,319
about different species.

36
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,514
He wrote a secret manuscript.

37
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:35,140
A 230 page book that he stored
securely, that would be

38
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,579
published if he were to happen
to die before he was able to

39
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:39,090
finish the project.

40
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,600
But he kept his ideas
mostly to himself.

41
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,149
He was troubled.

42
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,170
He wasn't just troubled by the
fact that he didn't feel like

43
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,900
he had enough information, he
was collecting more data.

44
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,180
But he was also just troubled by
the implications of what he

45
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:50,850
was saying.

46
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:52,500
His wife was very religious.

47
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,959
And he, too, had come from a
very religious background.

48
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,119
He was trying to sort of decide
what this all meant.

49
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,609
Darwin also struggled with
poor health, what we now,

50
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:02,579
probably, would call
psychological conditions.

51
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,289
His daughter passed away
and he had ill

52
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,050
health in the family.

53
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:08,120
But for 20 years he worked
on these ideas.

54
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,719
He didn't call evolution
at first.

55
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:12,659
He called it, in his notebooks,
transmutation of

56
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:15,250
species, or change of species.

57
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,300
He shared his ideas with his
colleagues in the learned

58
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,650
societies, but he didn't
make them public.

59
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,490
Finally in 1858, he was
rocked by a paper.

60
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,050
It was sent to him by a young
field researcher, Alfred

61
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,430
Russel Wallace.

62
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,622
Wallace, in 1858, in his paper
he sent to Darwin, who he

63
00:02:30,622 --> 00:02:33,240
really admired, laid out what
was essentially Darwin's

64
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,680
theory, the theory he'd been
working on for 20 years.

65
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,560
Fortunately for Darwin, two of
his famous colleagues in the

66
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,310
Linnean Society talked Alfred
Russell Wallace into

67
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,210
presenting his ideas together
with Darwin at a meeting of

68
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,420
the Linnean Society of London.

69
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:49,879
Unfortunately for Darwin, he
was so distraught from the

70
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,349
death of another child that
in 1858, when the meeting

71
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:55,509
happened, Darwin didn't
even attend.

72
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:59,459
In the 1858 presentation,
Wallace read out part of his

73
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,120
paper, part of the letters that
Darwin had written to the

74
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,349
Linnean Society, but it
barely caused a stir.

75
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:07,979
The scientists who were gathered
there didn't really

76
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,649
see what was significant
about their

77
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,620
discussion of natural selection.

78
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,860
The 1858 presentation caused
scarcely a ripple.

79
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,380
That year in the annual report
the president of the Linnean

80
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:20,849
Society wrote, "The year which
has passed has not, indeed,

81
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:23,629
been marked by any of those
striking discoveries which at

82
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:26,210
once revolutionise, so to
speak, the department of

83
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,400
science on which they bear."
In other words, nothing

84
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,330
interesting happened
this year.

85
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,080
But then in 1859, Darwin
published On

86
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,610
the Origin of Species.

87
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,420
It was an instant best seller,
sold out completely.

88
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,639
It went through six
new additions,

89
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,369
just in Darwin's lifetime.

90
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,849
So what was the difference
between 1858 and 1859?

91
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:47,969
Why did it suddenly become
a best seller?

92
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:50,280
Well the first thing you have to
realise is that Darwin was

93
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,490
a brilliant writer.

94
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,250
All those years he had spent
stewing on the ideas, he had

95
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,500
built up example after example
of how you could see evolution

96
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,879
shaping the species
around you.

97
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,099
He had chosen examples from the
English countryside, from

98
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:05,449
hobbies like pigeon breeding,
that were popular in the day,

99
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:08,750
from cattle breeding, and all
the different examples that

100
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,669
readers would understand.

101
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:12,159
He had created a kind of
catalogue of life, in On the

102
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:12,919
Origin of Species.

103
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,989
And behind it, he showed how
evolution was working on

104
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,310
everything from orchids
to honeybees.

105
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,470
In Darwin's hands, biology
had become like

106
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,220
geology had under Lyell.

107
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,310
It was not just a catalogue of
diversity, but it was a system

108
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,220
that has certain underlying
principles that you could see

109
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,980
shaping each and
every species.

110
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,840
But it took a scholar with
Darwin's kind of encyclopaedic

111
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,369
knowledge of life, to
be able to do that.

112
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,149
The irony is that, we now look
back on Darwin as the father

113
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,204
of evolution.

114
00:04:43,204 --> 00:04:45,479
He didn't even like the word.

115
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,350
He preferred descent
with modification.

116
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,560
He thought that evolution gave
the idea, too much, that there

117
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,009
was progress.

118
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:54,849
And in fact, his supporters,
even though they fought for

119
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,530
his ideas, really didn't focus
on what was the most important

120
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:01,189
contribution of his theory,
which was the theory of

121
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:02,879
natural selection itself.

122
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,920
They were with him on the idea
of species changed, that

123
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,629
wasn't his original idea.

124
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:09,579
But they didn't believe his
process was what was causing

125
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:10,759
the change.

126
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,319
But ultimately, I think one of
the reasons that On the Origin

127
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:16,759
of Species was so successful
is that Darwin shared one

128
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:19,079
trait with the natural
theologians.

129
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,180
They were able to see the

130
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,129
fingerprints of God in creation.

131
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:25,829
He was still able to feel that
awe, that wonder, and share

132
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:28,219
that kind of excitement,
but he saw the

133
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,350
effects of natural selection.

134
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,570
At the end of On the Origin he
shares this kind of amazing

135
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:35,569
vision that he has of nature.

136
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:38,659
"It is interesting to
contemplate a tangled bank,

137
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,650
clothed with many plants of many
kinds, with birds singing

138
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:44,759
on the bushes, with various
insects flitting about, with

139
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,629
worms crawling through
the damp earth.

140
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:49,790
And to reflect that these
elaborately constructed forms,

141
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,760
so different from each other,
and dependent upon each other

142
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:56,009
in so complex a manner, have
all been produced by laws

143
00:05:56,009 --> 00:05:57,659
acting around us.

144
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,270
There is grandeur in this view
of life with its several

145
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:03,289
powers, having been originally
breathed by the creator into a

146
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:07,010
few forms or into one, and that,
whilst this planet has

147
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:10,039
gone circling on, according to
the fixed laws of gravity,

148
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,460
from so simple a beginning,
endless forms, most beautiful

149
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:20,299
and most wonderful, have been,
and are being evolved." In the

150
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,290
next topic, we're going to get
into Darwin's theory of

151
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,540
natural selection.

152
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,160
