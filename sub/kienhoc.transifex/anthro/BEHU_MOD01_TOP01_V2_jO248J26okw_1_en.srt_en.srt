[MUSIC PLAYING]

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,230
We are one in 450 million.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,089
At least.

5
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,399
There are at least 9 million
species of living things on

6
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:21,719
the planet Earth today.

7
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:22,939
Some scientists say
this number is

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,070
actually way too small.

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,940
The actual number may be closer
to 30 million species

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,970
alive today.

11
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:32,478
It sounds like a mind-blowingly
huge number,

12
00:00:32,478 --> 00:00:37,439
you got to realise that 98% of
all species that were once

13
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,299
alive are now extinct.

14
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:41,789
Not just the dinosaurs,
but countless

15
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:44,269
other innumerable species.

16
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,170
For example, 250 million
years ago, we had the

17
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,960
Permian-Triassic extinction.

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,960
In this extinction, at least
90% of all the animals that

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,825
lived in the ocean died off.

20
00:00:55,825 --> 00:00:58,370
The extinction was so bad, that
it actually killed off a

21
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:00,949
large percentage of the insect
species that were alive.

22
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,790
| took the planet 10 million
years to recover its

23
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:05,390
biodiversity.

24
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,620
So conservatively, and I mean
really conservatively, there

25
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:14,040
have probably been at least 450
million different species

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,180
of living things on the planet
at one time or another.

27
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,560
Incredible species.

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,000
Frill-necked lizards and giant
sequoias, and colonies of

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,349
fungi, and coral reefs, and
dinosaurs, and more species

30
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:28,199
than you could think about, and
more species than we would

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,439
need to write documentaries
for the rest of your life.

32
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,819
A mind-blowing variety of
animals and plants, adapted to

33
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:38,909
virtually every environment you
could think of, from deep

34
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,569
salt basins under the
Mediterranean to underground.

35
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,699
Even inside other animals.

36
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,170
And yet, we are kind
of one of a kind.

37
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,210
one in half a billion species.

38
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:52,439
You'd have better
odds winning the

39
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,280
lottery, playing Powerball.

40
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,730
Just one species, one that's
built cities, established

41
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,850
agriculture, and has advanced
technology, and writes

42
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:03,679
symphonies, and invented
language, and even came up

43
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,730
with Justin Bieber
and Lady Gaga.

44
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:10,069
A one in a half billion
species.

45
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:13,120
This is the central mystery
of human evolution.

46
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,750
How could the forces of natural
selection, the same

47
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,689
forces that produced all this
other variety, have produced

48
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:20,349
such an unusual ape?

49
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:23,900
Such a strange, balding creature
with weird social

50
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,159
habits and these really unusual
cognitive abilities?

51
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,370
That's the mystery of
human evolution.

52
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,219
In fact, if we look at our
closest cousins, the

53
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:35,500
chimpanzees, one of the
interesting discoveries about

54
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,379
genetic research is that we
share about 98% of our DNA a

55
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,409
with our closest cousins.

56
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:45,039
But as Jonathan Marks, the
anthropologist points out,

57
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,719
it's not just chimpanzees.

58
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,919
We actually share about 25% or
30% of our DNA even with

59
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:53,809
living things like daffodils
and bananas.

60
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,580
Over and over again, if we
look throughout life,

61
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,500
evolution has written the book
of this incredible diversity

62
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,650
with basically a limited
set of resources.

63
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:08,210
The same basic elements of DNA
show up again and again

64
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,050
throughout the entire realm
of living things.

65
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,330
And yet, that difference,
that little 2%,

66
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,000
matters a hell of a lot.

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,759
What makes that gap so great
and so important?

68
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,459
Yeah, it's a narcissistic
question, it's true.

69
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,610
Of all the 9 million or 30
million species alive today,

70
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,890
we're going to focus
on us, humans.

71
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:29,619
But we're pretty interesting.

72
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,530
I mean, it's not just that
evolution produced humans.

73
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,229
In us, evolution produced
an animal capable of

74
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:37,939
understanding how
it got there.

75
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:39,620
Evolution produced an
animal capable of

76
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,759
understanding evolution.

77
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,459
That's amazing.

78
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,830
That's what we'll be exploring
over the next four modules,

79
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,560
this subject.

80
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,569
We're going to be exploring
where we come from, when apes

81
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:51,729
started to look like humans, how
we got to be so unusual,

82
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:55,579
to walk on two legs, to have
such fragile helpless babies,

83
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,180
and perhaps most importantly,
when did we start getting

84
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,080
these really strange brains?

85
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,170
And why?

86
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:04,389
And what's the price that we
pay for such great brains?

87
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:08,169
This is really a course about
us, our origins, our place in

88
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:09,939
the tree of life.

89
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:12,449
Although we'll be linking to a
lot of documentaries and other

90
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:15,129
resources online where you can
go deeper into these subjects,

91
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,709
I'll be trying my best to
introduce the most important

92
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:20,620
concepts, to really start
discussions if we can about

93
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,850
some of the key issues.

94
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,930
I hope you have a chance
to discuss them online.

95
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,199
This is a really great
opportunity to share your

96
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,519
ideas, to ask questions, and
to really think about what

97
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,769
matters most to us.

98
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:33,419
How did we get to
be so unusual?

99
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,939
In the next topic, I'll talk
about my discipline,

100
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:37,189
anthropology, and what it
teaches us about humans.

101
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:39,497
