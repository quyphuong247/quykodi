00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,379
Friends, Viruses, and Other
Forms of Cooperation.

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,899
Well, one of the most
controversial parts of this

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,050
theory of endosymbiosis was
that some of the change in

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,190
organisms wasn't just the
result of mutations or

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,339
alterations in the genetic
material in the process of

7
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:23,269
reproduction.

8
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:26,509
The idea was that new genetic
material could actually be

9
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,710
inserted into the nucleus
either by a virus or a

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,570
bacteria by a different
process.

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,280
It didn't just arise
by mutation.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,000
Now in fact, new research has
been done that starts to bear

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,149
this controversial part
of the theory out.

14
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:41,979
We now realise that even
single-celled organisms can

15
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:46,519
sometimes pass DNA laterally
from one to another.

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,940
You don't just get-- well, the
bacteria don't just get their

17
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:51,460
genetic material from
their parent.

18
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,719
Bacteria can pass DNA from
one to the other.

19
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:55,549
They can steal DNA a
from each other.

20
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:58,179
This helps us to understand a
whole series of evolutionary

21
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:01,229
events, including the rise
of sexual reproduction.

22
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:03,890
But perhaps the most startling
discovery that's related to

23
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,849
this theory is that large
amounts of DNA are actually

24
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:08,469
left over from viruses.

25
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:10,420
They're called retroviruses.

26
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,049
They insert themselves into
the germ cells, into

27
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:14,340
the sperm and eggs.

28
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,210
And even in our human genome, a
lot of the material actually

29
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:18,890
turns out to be retroviruses.

30
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,700
Now to understand how this
works, I have to explain a

31
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,409
little bit about retroviruses.

32
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,560
A retrovirus is a little
bit of RNA.

33
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,010
That's the simpler, single-sided
version of DNA.

34
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,190
Now what it will do is it will
actually insert itself into a

35
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,219
gene, into a DNA molecule.

36
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:37,390
And then it kind of does
the reverse of

37
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,409
what DNA usually does.

38
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:42,450
It'll actually regenerate
the other side.

39
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,760
And in the process,
sits itself right

40
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,400
into the DNA molecule.

41
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,430
That's your retrovirus.

42
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,610
This is the retrovirus's way
of getting reproduced.

43
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:54,159
Some of them are incredibly
dangerous.

44
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,289
The HIV virus, for example,
is a retrovirus.

45
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,660
And they can even cause the
death of the animal.

46
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:03,280
Some cancers we think might
even be retroviruses.

47
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,469
But some less virulent forms of
retroviruses can actually

48
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:07,840
become endogenous.

49
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,039
That is, they sort of stitch
themselves into the DNA, not

50
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,129
just of the body cells, but of
those germ line cells, that is

51
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:18,810
the sperm and eggs, the parts
of the organisms that the

52
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,569
early 20th century geneticists
thought

53
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:22,049
that couldn't be changed.

54
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,570
They hack their way in.

55
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:26,129
And they become a permanent part
of the DNA, passed on to

56
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:27,669
the next generations.

57
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:30,619
In big, multicelled organisms
like human beings, it turns

58
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,770
out there's a tonne of these old
retroviruses lying around.

59
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,130
In fact, in our DNA it looks
like there's 100,000 sections

60
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:40,229
that are retroviral
insertions.

61
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:42,060
They have been put in
by retroviruses.

62
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,539
As much as 8% of all of our DNA
turns out to look like it

63
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:49,439
has this kind of viral origin.

64
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,109
Some of these retroviruses
can still flare up.

65
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,760
We think for example that some
of the autoimmune diseases may

66
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,479
have their origin in this kind
of genetic material.

67
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:00,780
But in some cases, the
retroviruses have become sort

68
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,500
of innocuous.

69
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,199
We even use them for
useful purposes.

70
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:07,839
In fact, endogenous retroviruses
are responsible

71
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,810
for the placenta that's
essential to all mammals.

72
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,620
The placenta protects the
infant, protects the embryo

73
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,300
against the mother's
immune system.

74
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,390
But it also latches on to the
mother's body and draws out

75
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:21,109
nutrients for the embryo.

76
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:26,060
If the ancestors of mammals
hadn't caught this retrovirus,

77
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,030
we wouldn't have placentas.

78
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,669
And that would mean that
we would have to

79
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:31,539
still be laying eggs.

80
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:33,539
The point is that none of
this really undermines

81
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:34,799
evolutionary theory.

82
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,660
Endosymbiosis, and endogenous
retroviruses, what they really

83
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:41,370
help us explain is that there
are other ways that variation

84
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,270
can arise, other than
just mutation.

85
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,750
And fitness isn't just fitness
for competition.

86
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,560
Fitness may be fitness
for cooperation.

87
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,009
A living thing may actually find
it's niche inside another

88
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:53,829
living thing.

89
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,940
And in the process, if it makes
its host more viable, it

90
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:59,770
actually creates more
of the niche

91
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,810
that it needs to survive.

92
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,830
Perhaps, the most striking
example of this kind of

93
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,440
cooperation is in animals that
we refer to as eusocial.

94
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:13,039
Eusocial animals, like bees and
termites and ants, a large

95
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:15,000
percentage of them
are sterile.

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,360
That is in an ant colony or a
bee colony, there's a large

97
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,750
number of workers who will
never reproduce.

98
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,620
A question is how could that
possibly be an adaptation of

99
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,569
evolution, if you can't even
pass on your DNA in any way?

100
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:31,050
We realise now the key to
understanding phenomena like

101
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,060
eusocietality, is actually
inclusive fitness.

102
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,689
Inclusive fitness is the idea
that we don't just pass on the

103
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:43,430
DNA that comes directly from
our own bodies, but in some

104
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,199
cases we pass on DNA
through the support

105
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,939
we give to our siblings.

106
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:51,819
That is if we share a lot of DNA
with our siblings, one of

107
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:54,159
the things that we can do to
help our DNA get passed on is

108
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,890
actually to support them.

109
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:58,849
Inclusive fitness is one way
to explain phenomena like

110
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,160
altruism, which at first
glance don't seem

111
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,200
to make much sense.

112
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,349
If you help individuals who
share a lot of DNA with

113
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,610
yourself, that can actually be
a way that you become more

114
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,090
likely to pass on your DNA
to future generations.

115
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:15,489
Another possibility, related but
a bit more controversial,

116
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,430
is the idea that what
may be happening is

117
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,240
actually group selection.

118
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,250
That is, instead of the
individuals competing one

119
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,459
against another, it's one group
of a species against

120
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,289
another group of the
same species.

121
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,290
It's one termite colony against

122
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,250
another termite colony.

123
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,079
If resources are tight and
groups can secure them better,

124
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:37,669
then it may be the case that
actually there's different

125
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,259
levels of selection.

126
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:40,539
Again, this is controversial.

127
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,830
But some theorists talk about
how selection actually

128
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:45,560
operates at the genetic level,
at the individual level, and

129
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,850
possibly even at the
group level.

130
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,740
Arguably, humans have benefited
from extraordinary

131
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,240
forms of cooperation.

132
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,189
From a very small population
100,000 years ago, precarious,

133
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,269
maybe even on the verge of
extinction in some moments, we

134
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:01,729
have grown to cover
the planet.

135
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,470
And we've done that through some
extraordinary forms of

136
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,380
cooperation and even
symbiosis.

137
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:11,219
Today, the total body mass of
all the humans on the planet

138
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,500
is eight times the mass
of all the other wild

139
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,480
vertebrates on land.

140
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,500
In fact, the total mass of
humans is equal to all of the

141
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,639
whales and fish in
the sea combined.

142
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,300
Our domestic animals, our cows
and our pigs and our dogs

143
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,360
together, weigh more than 20
times what wild animals weigh.

144
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,080
And together, us and our herds,
make up a quarter of

145
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:33,669
the weight of all living
things on the planet.

146
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,430
We're even shaping each
other's evolution.

147
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,509
We're co-evolving with our
domesticated animals.

148
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:43,079
It's pretty amazing that
in the space of 6,000

149
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:46,759
generations, we've gone from
being just one species to

150
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,759
being this kind of
dominant species.

151
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,159
We have changed the
environment.

152
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,760
We're changing the planet.

153
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,730
But it's not the first
time it's happened.

154
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,080
After all, you're breathing
the evidence of

155
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:58,129
these kinds of changes.

156
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:00,870
In this module, we started with
Darwin's basic theory of

157
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,759
natural selection.

158
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,569
And we've shown how we've
developed it, improved it, but

159
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:06,899
how it essentially remains
unchanged.

160
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:10,620
In the next module, we're going
to be talking about sex,

161
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,980
sex selection, reproduction,
how it helps to shape our

162
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,640
species and how our babies are
one of the most important

163
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,560
things for determining
how we become human.

164
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,959
