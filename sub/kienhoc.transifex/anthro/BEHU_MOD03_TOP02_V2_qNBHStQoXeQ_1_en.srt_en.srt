1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,759
 

2
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:11,650
In this topic, we'll be
talking about direct

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,699
competition, or fighting
for love.

4
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:18,769
In sexual selection, females, in
essence, are trying to get

5
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,059
the best possible genes
for their offspring.

6
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:23,579
In some species it's through
mate choice-- the females

7
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:25,869
auditioning candidates
for father.

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,700
But in some species, it's
actually through direct

9
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:28,769
competition.

10
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,945
In direct competition the males
fight directly in order

11
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:34,299
to reproduce.

12
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:37,709
Theoretically, the strongest,
healthiest male should emerge

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,509
and have the most offspring.

14
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:43,280
For example, in bighorn sheep,
in mating season the sheep

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,969
tend to come together, and the
males determine a dominance

16
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:49,079
structure by literally fighting
head to head--

17
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,640
they ram into each other with
their giant horns--

18
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,130
and the dominant ones are most
likely to have the most

19
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,740
offspring, because the females
will selectively mate with the

20
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,969
dominant males.

21
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:01,149
In many primates direct
competition is the rule.

22
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:03,799
Males compete directly for
access to females.

23
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:06,859
One of the most dramatic
examples is gorillas.

24
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,079
Gorillas are polygynous.

25
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:13,489
This means the males will tend
to mate with multiple females.

26
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:16,539
You might think of it as males
keeping a group of females to

27
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,510
reproduce with.

28
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,620
The only way the male will
reproduce is if he

29
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,045
successfully deposes
the dominant male--

30
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:24,909
the silverback gorilla--

31
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:27,750
from his control over
a group of females.

32
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,420
Among gorillas, only the
strongest really get to pass

33
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,659
on their genes.

34
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:34,629
The males that never get to take
control of a polygynous

35
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:37,099
group of females, they're
effectively sterile from the

36
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:38,819
point of view of evolution.

37
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:39,959
This competition--

38
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,929
this fierce competition
between males--

39
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,190
has produced some really
extraordinary traits.

40
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,120
Female gorillas are big, but
male gorillas are huge.

41
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,579
A male silverback can be two and
a half times the size of a

42
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:51,709
female gorilla.

43
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:53,259
And it's not just that.

44
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,719
Direct sexual competition
among gorilla males has

45
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:58,760
produced all these traits--
this impressive sagittal

46
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,370
crest, this collar here of
bone which supports the

47
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,040
gigantic jaw muscles.

48
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,620
Even the sharp canine teeth.

49
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,460
You've got to realise,
this is a vegetarian.

50
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,460
It's not using this stuff to eat
with, it's not a predator,

51
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,790
it's not attacking
prey with it.

52
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:15,329
This is all about direct
competition with other

53
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,960
gorillas, intra-specific
competition, in order to mate.

54
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,000
This is what sexual
selection can do.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,909
Sexual selection can drive
extreme traits to develop to

56
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:28,259
and extraordinary degree.

57
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:31,449
We call these secondary sexual
characteristics, because

58
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:33,909
they're not primarily involved
in reproduction.

59
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:36,889
They're not the uterus, they're
not sperm or testes,

60
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:39,219
but they're absolutely essential
to the social act of

61
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:40,069
reproduction.

62
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:43,180
Things like weaponry to fight
with other males, or large

63
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,129
size, or plumage to
meet mate choice.

64
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:50,359
We call these dimorphisms.

65
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,550
Dimorphism is a word that
describes two forms--

66
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,890
male and female.

67
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:56,339
And the degree of dimorphism--

68
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,750
the degree that which males and
females are different--

69
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,319
is one index of the intensity
of sexual selection.

70
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,479
The more dimorphic--

71
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,039
the more males and females
are different--

72
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:07,780
the more sexual selection is
going on, whether it's mate

73
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,580
choice or direct competition.

74
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,140
An example of the extreme
dimorphism that I'm talking

75
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:13,619
about is elephant seals.

76
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,980
Elephant seal males will
dominate an entire beach

77
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:18,829
during the breeding season, and
they're six times larger

78
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,430
than females.

79
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,890
But wait a minute, you're
saying, I thought sexual

80
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:24,629
competition was between
females.

81
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:26,979
Aren't beauty contests
between females?

82
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:29,789
Isn't there some kind of man
drought in Australia?

83
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:31,449
Well, that's not what
biology teaches us.

84
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:35,030
That's not what evolution says
is happening below our social

85
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,469
interactions.

86
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:39,060
To understand which sex is going
to have to be competing

87
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,640
whenever you have sexual
selection, we have to think

88
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,899
about the theories of Robert
Trivers, probably one of the

89
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,129
most important evolutionary
theorists since Darwin.

90
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:49,819
Darwin and Trivers both realised
that reproduction was

91
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:53,030
kind of a joint investment
between males and females.

92
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,379
Trivers pointed out that the
investments between the two

93
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:56,659
sexes were not equal.

94
00:03:56,659 --> 00:04:00,109
Whichever sex invested the
most-- took the most time,

95
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,710
most energy, the most metabolic
resources--

96
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,980
was going to be the limiting
factor for the reproduction of

97
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,030
the species.

98
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,319
On the sex that reproduced the
least, the least would be the

99
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,430
ones that competed.

100
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,920
So if you put less resources
into reproduction, you would

101
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,990
have to compete for access to
the scarce resource, which is

102
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,990
the other sex.

103
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,759
For example, even in
producing gametes--

104
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,689
the basic sperm and egg, the
basic fundamentals that go

105
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:25,040
together to form a species--

106
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,020
the investments of the two
sexes are not equal.

107
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:30,529
One part of the species
will usually

108
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:32,199
produce large gametes--

109
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,409
we tend to call these eggs.

110
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,380
The other will produce
little gametes--

111
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:40,050
we tend to call these sperm.

112
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,199
Now the difference is
that these gametes--

113
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,920
not only do they have the DNA
that you need for life, but

114
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,420
they also all the other cellular
machinery that you

115
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,480
need, all the other
parts of the cell.

116
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,129
In contrast, the sperm tends to
have only that DNA that you

117
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:55,069
need to reproduce.

118
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:57,790
It specialises in travelling
around and finding the other

119
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,069
half of the DNA.

120
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:03,500
So sperm and eggs really
define male and female.

121
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,399
This asymmetry between
eggs and sperm

122
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,759
we refer to as anisogamy.

123
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,740
Anisogamy is this different
investment at the basic level

124
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,769
of the stuff of life--

125
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:18,859
the machinery that goes to
produce the offspring.

126
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,560
In some species, the female
invests more in reproduction--

127
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,930
not just a bigger egg, but also
time sitting on the eggs,

128
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,250
feeding them, whatever it
takes, carrying them to

129
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,139
protect them.

130
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,909
In some, however, the males
invest more time and energy.

131
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,810
Whichever is investing more is
going to become the limiting

132
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,399
factor, and if there's sexual
competition, it's going to be

133
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,810
among the opposite sex.

134
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,069
In mammals, virtually every
species, the female is

135
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:43,459
limiting factor.

136
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:45,229
Unlike some other species--

137
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,710
non-mammals which just lay a
clutch of eggs and then swim

138
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:48,719
away or something--

139
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,820
in mammals, females tend to have
to feed their animals.

140
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,459
Well that's why we call them
mammals, because of the

141
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:55,750
mammary glands, because
of the feeding

142
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,389
of milk to the offspring.

143
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:00,300
This tends to mean that for
every mammal, females are the

144
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,949
limiting factor in
reproduction.

145
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:05,399
Males will have to compete
for access to females.

146
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,239
Trivers' hypothesis clear
predicts that in humans,

147
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,040
females are the limiting
factor.

148
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,230
Males should be the
ones that have to

149
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,870
compete for female attention.

150
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,860
Males should be the ones who
have perform elaborately, to

151
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,660
be pretty, to compete
with each other

152
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,640
for access to females.

153
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,479
The fact that in Western culture
we think it's the

154
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,550
other way around--

155
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,009
that females have to contend
for male attention--

156
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,089
has much more to do with our
culture, our ideology, our

157
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:31,419
politics, even patriarchy,
our gender relations.

158
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,550
It's not really what
evolutionary theory tells us.

159
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,550
But like so many other things
about being human, we have

160
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,430
made this way more complicated
than it really is.

161
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,780
In the next topic, we're going
to look really closely at male

162
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,579
and female bodies-- males
and females--

163
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:47,599
and see what their bodies tell
us about their relations.

164
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,576
