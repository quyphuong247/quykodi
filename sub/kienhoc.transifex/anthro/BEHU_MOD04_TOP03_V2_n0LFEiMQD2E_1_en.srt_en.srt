[PLAYING MUSIC]

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,769
Brain size, it's not just
bigger that's better.

4
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:16,219
With brains, size matters.

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:16,900
That's clear.

6
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:19,599
And humans have got
really big brains.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,070
In fact, on average, we've
got about a 1,200 cc

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,410
or a 1,300 cc brain.

9
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,839
That's about 1.5 kilos,
about three

10
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:29,789
pounds in the old system.

11
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:32,500
Compared to our nearest
relatives, like a chimpanzee,

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,090
we've got brains that are about
three times that size.

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,610
However, if brain size alone
determined intelligence, we

14
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:41,880
would expect dolphins and whales
and elephants to all be

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,060
smarter than we are.

16
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,289
Elephants, for example, have
brain three times the size of

17
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,859
ours and sperm whales, more than
six times the size of a

18
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:50,269
human brain,

19
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,260
Researchers, who study brains
comparatively across species,

20
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:56,289
talk about encephalisation.

21
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,869
Encephalisation is how
much brain you have

22
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:01,359
compared to your body.

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,349
How brainy you are in
relationship to weight.

24
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,299
Now, the closest relationship
or the best relationship we

25
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:09,539
could find, isn't a one
to one relationship.

26
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,380
As you get a kilo heavier, you
don't necessarily get the same

27
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:14,799
proportion of brain as you go.

28
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,819
As an animal gets bigger,
its brain gets

29
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:18,399
bigger, but more slowly.

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,280
And this makes sense, if
you think about it.

31
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,579
A lot of our brain
is controlling

32
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:22,849
our automatic functions.

33
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,209
It's running your lungs
and your heart.

34
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:27,109
And because you get bigger, it
doesn't mean you get an extra

35
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:29,420
heart or an extra
set of lungs.

36
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,909
Some of the smallest animals
on the planet actually have

37
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:32,810
very large brains.

38
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,280
A pocket mouse, for example, has
a brain that's 10% of its

39
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,260
total body weight.

40
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,400
In contrast, a sperm whale
has a giant brain.

41
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,950
It's brain is about 8 kilos,
which is about 17 pounds,

42
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,090
which seems impressive until
you realise that this sperm

43
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,490
whale can be about 40,000
kilos or 45 tonnes.

44
00:01:51,489 --> 00:01:53,829
That means as a total percentage
of its body weight,

45
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:55,429
it's a tiny fraction.

46
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,870
Less than 1% of its body
weight is brain.

47
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,844
If you plot the relationship
between the body weight and

48
00:02:01,844 --> 00:02:05,760
brain weight, the relationship
tends to be consistent across

49
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,990
different families
of living things.

50
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:13,909
Most vertebrates, like lizards
and fish, tend to have one set

51
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:16,799
of relationships between body
weight and brain weight.

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,960
Mammals, however, tend to
be more encephalised.

53
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,930
That is, they're slightly
brainier per kilo.

54
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,870
So if you have a lizard and
a mammal of the same body

55
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,539
weight, you would expect the
mammal to have a slightly

56
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:28,859
larger brain.

57
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,270
We know that predators
tend to have bigger

58
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,719
brains than their prey.

59
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,340
We know that prey that tends to
evade predators is actually

60
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,590
slightly more encephalised
than prey that just

61
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,090
sits there and hides.

62
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,159
We also know that certain types
of diets, like fruit

63
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,639
eating, and animals that are
more invested in parenting,

64
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:48,049
all tend to have
slightly higher

65
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,370
encephalisation quotients.

66
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,009
They're slightly brainier.

67
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:53,299
And some of the brainiest
animals of all are some of the

68
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,710
most social.

69
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,439
Primates tend to have some of
the highest encephalisation

70
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:00,609
ratios of all animals.

71
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,690
Even among the other mammals,
primates stand out.

72
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:06,829
But even in this select company,
humans among other

73
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,920
primates, humans are
disproportionately

74
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:09,989
encephalised.

75
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,409
How much depends on who
you compare us to.

76
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:16,030
But by most estimates, our
brains are two to three times

77
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,740
heaver than we would expect
given our body weights.

78
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,900
Go back 3 million years to
Australopithecus afarensis.

79
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,189
And what you find is a skull
that wouldn't look that out of

80
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:27,919
place alongside other apes.

81
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,539
Sure, a large brain, but nothing
out of line with

82
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:32,459
chimpanzees or gorillas.

83
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,409
Probably clever enough
to make and use

84
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:36,579
tools, but so can they.

85
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,719
If you look at Lucy, the most
complete-- or the nickname of

86
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,030
the most complete skeleton we
have of Australopithecus

87
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,599
afarensis, she looks
pretty much like us

88
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,599
from the neck down.

89
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,319
Not completely, but she would
have been bipedal.

90
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,400
She have been upright.

91
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,700
From the neck down, she
looks very human.

92
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,879
But from the neck up, she looks
like one of our primate

93
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,569
cousins, the chimpanzees
for example.

94
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:00,060
The brain hadn't really
changed yet.

95
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,879
If we follow our ancestors
though from around Lucy's

96
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,780
time, forward, closer to us,
what we find is that the brain

97
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,849
size begins to change.

98
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,909
Its slow by our standards.

99
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:13,900
But by evolutionary standards,
the brain size of human starts

100
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,389
to spike, especially about
2 million years ago.

101
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:20,528
The real increase in brain size
kind of gets started a

102
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:23,860
little before 2 million years
ago with a species that we now

103
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:33,110
call Homo habilis, 2 million
years ago, MYA.

104
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,370
Homo habilis had a brain about
600 cubic centimetres, which

105
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,769
is about 30% to 40% larger
than the other hominids.

106
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:42,930
And it's probably already the
sign that our ancestors were

107
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,480
departing from the brain size
and the encephalisation of our

108
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,120
ape cousins.

109
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,290
Over the next 300,000 years, and
for the time since then,

110
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,310
we really see the big change.

111
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,959
About 1.7 million years ago, we
started to get remains of a

112
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,560
species we now call either
Homo erectus or

113
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,670
sometimes Homo ergaster.

114
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:09,379
And this starts about 1.7
million years ago.

115
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:10,909
That's this specimen.

116
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:15,230
And here we begin to see brain
sizes as large as 900 cubic

117
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:15,860
centimetres.

118
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,500
Or some of the ones that have
emerged latest, have brains

119
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,329
almost close to modern humans.

120
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:24,229
There's a lot of variation
around the average of 900

121
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,410
cubic centimetres, a lot more
variation than we find today.

122
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,700
But the trend is
clearly upward.

123
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:33,639
Now, 2 million years may not
sound like fast to you.

124
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:36,729
But in evolutionary terms, this
is a real revolutionary

125
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,040
change in our brain size.

126
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,920
Before I go on, anthropologists
spend a lot of

127
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,819
time arguing about how to
classify different ancestors,

128
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:46,490
how many species, what species,
whether a species was

129
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,079
part of our genus homo or
whether it was part of earlier

130
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,789
genus, Australopithecus?

131
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,560
I don't want to get bogged
down in these debates.

132
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,379
I want to talk more
about the trends.

133
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:56,639
But I will put some links to
some sites that can tell you

134
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,050
more about the details, about
which specimens, what time,

135
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,250
and what we know about
these ancestors.

136
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,540
You'll find these links in
the resources section.

137
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,040
Some of the growth in brain size
can be chalked up to the

138
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,510
fact that Homo erectus was
simply larger than the species

139
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:12,579
that had come before.

140
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:14,454
The brain gets larger, as
the body gets larger.

141
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:15,779
But some of it can't be.

142
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:18,189
And we begin to see other traits
emerge too that make

143
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:21,649
them look like us, the smaller
teeth, the flatter faces, the

144
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:22,739
taller bodies.

145
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,930
Homo erectus, for example, was
probably almost the same

146
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,540
height as an average human
being is today.

147
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,230
Homo erectus was incredibly
successful.

148
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,110
From 1.7 million years ago, some
of them survived until

149
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,449
about 300,000 years ago, a
million and a half years.

150
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:38,860
They spread out of Africa.

151
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,170
They invaded Asia.

152
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,060
We have evidence that they
all went into all

153
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,009
different sorts of niches.

154
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:47,779
They became a kind of invasive
ape for the first time.

155
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:50,079
They had to adapt to
new food sources.

156
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,959
They probably had lifestyles
that we would recognise as

157
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,370
being human like.

158
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,870
And this maybe is our first
truly human ancestor.

159
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,230
They were innovative and had
to move into new places and

160
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,800
develop new technologies.

161
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,740
They might lived a lot like our
ancestors did, up until

162
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,360
very recently.

163
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,730
In the next topic we're going to
talk about the benefits of

164
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,230
immaturity when it comes
to our brains.

165
