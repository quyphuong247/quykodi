[PLAYING MUSIC]

3
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:14,099
This topic is all about how
the dynamics of evolution

4
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,390
drove up our intelligence.

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,210
So we still have to explain that
question we discussed in

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,210
the last topic, why, if our
ancestors had large brains

7
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,210
170,000, 200,000 years ago, why
did it take so long for

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,980
some of the modern behaviours
to start to appear?

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,020
One possibility is that as early
as 2 million years ago,

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,980
we have a change.

11
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:38,529
As our ancestors got more
sophisticated, as their diet

12
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,780
improved, as they got better
at defending themselves and

13
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,439
keeping their children alive,
we think that they may have

14
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,244
achieved what we call ecological
dominance.

15
00:00:47,244 --> 00:00:49,709
It wouldn't have been
an instant process.

16
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,770
It would have taken some time.

17
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,600
But ecological dominance means
that they would have been able

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,410
to get the resources they need
reliably from the environment

19
00:00:56,409 --> 00:00:58,849
and they would have been
shielding themselves from many

20
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,450
selective forces.

21
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,070
What this would have done is
it would have shifted the

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,450
pressure, more social forces,
more internal dynamics, more

23
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,670
sexual selection.

24
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,489
And this could have caused
our ancestors to

25
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:11,670
change much more quickly.

26
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,769
The problem is that with
ecological dominance, our

27
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:16,759
ancestors might have eventually
started to get

28
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,840
larger and larger numbers.

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,880
Their success in a sense would
have eventually come around

30
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,140
and bitten them.

31
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,459
As they got ecologically
dominant, as their numbers

32
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:29,239
swelled, and as they became more
and more hunters and wide

33
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:32,619
spectrum foresters, they would
have needed more territory.

34
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,910
And this would have eventually
driven them out of Africa.

35
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,310
After it drove of them out of
Africa, this population

36
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,969
pressure would have continued,
slowly at first.

37
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:44,900
But eventually, around 15,000
years ago, we think it led to

38
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,550
the development of
agriculture.

39
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,640
Now, we don't think that the
first humans who had

40
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,500
agriculture, had it because
they thought

41
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,329
it was a great idea.

42
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:55,840
They didn't sit around inventing
agriculture, sitting

43
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,400
under a tree thinking, oh, I'd
like to grow some food.

44
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,109
What probably happened is that
around the same period of

45
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:03,379
time, we know that
an ice age came.

46
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:06,189
And it probably dried out
certain environments.

47
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:09,460
And our ancestors, who had come
to rely on grains and

48
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,330
certain kinds of fruit, may
have started at first to

49
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,320
modify the environment
so that it produced

50
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,849
more of these foods.

51
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:20,299
At first it would have been a
kind of thing that they just

52
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,439
observed happening.

53
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:23,979
They wouldn't have known what
they were necessarily doing.

54
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:27,409
But eventually, it would lead to
fully fledged agriculture.

55
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:29,579
Ecological dominance would
become ecological

56
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,840
transformation.

57
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,909
Irrigation, the drainage of
wetlands, the burning of

58
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:36,969
forests so that it produced more
game, all kinds of ways

59
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:40,069
that our ancestors began to
modify their ecology to make

60
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:43,019
it more amenable for humans
to live there.

61
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,830
But social crowding would have
also produced a changed social

62
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,219
dynamic, that is the more people
we have around us, the

63
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:53,430
more humans are born in these
human-determined environments.

64
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,200
We don't know when language
started for example.

65
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,729
But at some point, every child
that was born was now born

66
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:01,579
immersed in language,
immersed in symbols.

67
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,150
Our forms of communication
became stronger.

68
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,640
And it became more difficult
for us to lose information

69
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:10,019
from one generation
to the next.

70
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,020
In a sense, you could say that
we're just transforming

71
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,710
ecology, we were transforming
the kind of cognitive

72
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:19,400
psychology as the environment
became full of symbols that we

73
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,670
grew up with.

74
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:23,389
Our social skills
were crucial.

75
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:26,319
As infants, our social skills
were absolutely important to

76
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,049
things like imitation, to
paying attention, close

77
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,380
attention, to what adults were
doing and imitating them.

78
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,879
But it also was important
for the adults.

79
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,169
Adults had to be sophisticated
enough to create a modified

80
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:42,079
form of language that they spoke
to babies, scaffolding

81
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,150
and supporting their
acquisition of

82
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,539
the language skills.

83
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:48,169
And so our sophisticated social
interactions weren't

84
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:50,239
just important to driving
our intelligence.

85
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,680
Our sophisticated social
interactions were important to

86
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,460
shaping the inheritance of
each child that was born.

87
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,560
All those social make us really
good at passing on

88
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,710
information.

89
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,080
Let me give you an example,
imitation.

90
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,040
If you've got a chimp and a
human, and you show them how

91
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:12,849
to use a tool, they can
both figure it out.

92
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:15,069
But if you show them a really
inefficient technique, a

93
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:19,500
really lousy technique to use
the tool, if you give it to

94
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,259
the chimp, the chimp will
probably just play with the

95
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:23,319
tool and figure out a different
way to use the tool,

96
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:26,089
probably one that was better
than the way you showed.

97
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:30,159
In contrast, the human child
will copy your method, with

98
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,240
all of its problems, with
all its failings.

99
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,560
It'll copy the lousy technique
because a human child is much

100
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,699
better at imitation.

101
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:41,430
Now, what this means is that we
pass on our ways of seeing

102
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,350
things, including
our biases and

103
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,930
mistakes, with great fidelity.

104
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,629
Over generations, we accumulate

105
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:51,029
more and more culture.

106
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:52,189
Chimpanzees don't.

107
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:55,060
You could basically reinvent
chimpanzee culture every

108
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,240
generation.

109
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,069
In contrast, human culture
starts to accumulate, one

110
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:02,009
generation adding on top
of what the previous

111
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:03,769
generation gave them.

112
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:05,959
The point is that the difference
between chimpanzees

113
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,919
and humans isn't just
all in our brains.

114
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,460
It's not just intelligence.

115
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:12,049
It's also the social skills
that you need to copy.

116
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,540
And it's the social skills of
the group that you need to

117
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,810
accumulate from one generation
to the next.

118
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,720
Without stable groups, without
cooperation between adults,

119
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,790
without an uncle passing
something to his nephew or an

120
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,590
aunt to her niece, you don't get
this kind of accumulation.

121
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:29,429
And that requires more
than raw brainpower.

122
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,300
That requires social skill.

123
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,000
The point is that to really have
human culture, you don't

124
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,939
just need human brains.

125
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:38,980
You have to have human brains
that are able to preserve

126
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,800
information and cooperate from
one generation to the next.

127
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,250
We have to be able to
cooperate with our

128
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,759
grandparents, and our great,
great, great grandparents,

129
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,289
back and back, to invent
things like languages.

130
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,850
It's not just a one generation
problem.

131
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,260
Michael Tomasulo, a
psychologist, an evolutionary

132
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:58,620
theorist, has called this
the ratchet effect--

133
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:04,899
the ratchet effect,
ratchet effect.

134
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:07,419
The point is that technology
and culture

135
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,910
becomes like a ratchet.

136
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,439
And a ratchet, if you don't
know, is kind of

137
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,800
like a type of tool--

138
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,329
imagine this turns--

139
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:17,339
and it's got a peg.

140
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:19,899
So this can only turn one way.

141
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:22,129
It can't go backwards.

142
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:25,089
At a certain point, because of
the density of the population

143
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:27,889
of humans and because of our
communication skills and our

144
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:31,709
social skills, our technology
becomes a kind of ratchet.

145
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:34,159
It only progresses one way.

146
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,040
It doesn't unwind.

147
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,870
We know that in that 100,000
years after modern humans

148
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,180
first appear, we get sporadic
innovation.

149
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,060
But often, it disappeared.

150
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,389
Either because nobody was
there to pass on the

151
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:49,319
information or because the
people who had invented

152
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,349
something, simply couldn't
communicate it to the next

153
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,650
generation.

154
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:55,019
This ratchet effect
takes a while to

155
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:56,560
develop in human evolution.

156
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,180
It's not just a factor
of brains and bodies.

157
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,790
But it's this complex emergence
of human society

158
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,040
we're really seeing.

159
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,310
Once it gets going, we see
innovations, click, click.

160
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,509
And they don't go back.

161
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:11,659
They stop disappearing from
the fossil record.

162
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,810
And we see them accumulating
faster and faster.

163
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,160
Sometimes when I show students
the most advanced tools, the

164
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,960
ones that we call microliths,
or tiny tools--

165
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,109
I'll put that up--

166
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,310
they're not too impressed.

167
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,490
They look at these little fish
hooks and these little tools

168
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,560
and they think well, what's
so impressive about that?

169
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,500
But what they're seeing is that
each little innovative

170
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,290
tool is being added to a kit.

171
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,890
That's this ratchet effect.

172
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:40,139
From one generation to the next,
the culture accumulates,

173
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,839
click, click.

174
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,859
And it doesn't get lost .

175
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,280
This culture would have included
special tools for

176
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:49,689
fishing, special tools for
making clothing, for building

177
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:52,759
houses and shelters, and things
like that, for carving

178
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,199
and creating decorations.

179
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:58,459
And each time, click, click,
it would accumulate.

180
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:01,250
Probably with the development of
Homo erectus, we have this

181
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,199
new kind of biocultural
evolution.

182
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,019
As they expanded out of Africa
into new ecological niches,

183
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:10,599
they would have had to
accumulate new techniques, new

184
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,820
technologies, new knowledge
of the environment.

185
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:15,519
And they would have
to pass it on.

186
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,000
So learning itself
would become a

187
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,420
requirement for survival.

188
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,129
As the technology and the
culture advanced, it would

189
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:25,959
become it's own kind of
selective pressure for greater

190
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:30,849
and greater learning,
racheting up.

191
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,070
We've got a fundamentally human
mind at this point.

192
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,690
And it's determined not just by
what is within the skull.

193
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,650
It is determined by this world
that's built around it.

194
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:43,788
And this immaturity to come into
that world and to take

195
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:47,189
all this information on board,
with all of the social skills

196
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,470
and the support you
need, to get this

197
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,960
human form of cognition.

198
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,500
The funny thing is the social
nature of our intelligence is

199
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,740
not just our great advantage.

200
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,850
It's also kind of our
Achilles heel.

201
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,129
We don't just take on people's
insights and their good

202
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:03,090
information.

203
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,920
We also take on their biases
and their blind spots.

204
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:08,370
Our social forms of transmission
mean that we're

205
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,200
susceptible not just to standing
on the shoulders of

206
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,860
giants and passing on the
information we need, but also

207
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,840
the fact that we see through our
ancestors' eyes, even when

208
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,670
the way that they understood
things no longer makes sense.

209
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:24,620
In the next topic, we're going
to talk about whether this is

210
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,720
all over and whether human
evolution is done.

211
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,215
