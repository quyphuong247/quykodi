00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,669
Một trong những bằng chứng tiến hoá thuyết phục nhất
mà bạn có được

3
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:14,585
đều nằm ngay trong chính hệ mô và xương của mình.

4
00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:16,672
Có thể đang phơi bày ngay trước mắt bạn

5
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:18,289
chính là đôi bàn tay.

6
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:21,160
Đôi tay không những rất đặc biệt

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,949
khi giúp ta viết chữ,
chơi đùa

8
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:25,669
Gíup ta chăm sóc,
bón cơm cho con trẻ ăn.

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,290
Thậm chí đánh nhau, hay giao tiếp tương tác với nhau

10
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,399
Mà khi ta nhìn ngược vào trong lớp da này

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,829
để nhìn vào cấu tạo bên trong đó,
ta sẽ thấy

12
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,170
cấu tạo đôi tay ra sao, hệ xương và cơ như thế nào

13
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,480
lại khá là giống với các loài động vật khác như vậy.

14
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:44,779
sự tương tự này không chỉ với loài khỉ hay tinh tinh,
mà còn tương tự với các động vật khác

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,700
mà ta không ngờ tới được.

16
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,560
Như là gấu, dơi, cá heo
thậm chí là ếch nhái.

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,850
Các nhà sinh vật học
gọi đây là

18
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,859
tính giải phẫu tương đồng

19
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:58,909
Sở dĩ có sự tương đồng này

20
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:00,199
là do các giống loài có chung một cội nguồn tổ tiên.

21
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,700
Rồi từ cội nguồn đó phân nhánh mà tiến hoá.

22
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,049
Một điều thú vị là, ta có thể thấy được
những điểm tương đồng này

23
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:08,009
khi nhìn qua lăng kính của cấu trúc giải phẫu,
cấu tạo cơ quan 

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,670
hay cấu tạo liên kết hoá học

25
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,439
dưới những chức năng khác nhau.

26
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,179
Ví dụ, một cấu tạo tương tự
bên dưới một bàn tay người

27
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,710
và bàn tay thú vật,
hay bàn chân và vây cá

28
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:21,409
British anatomist Richard Owen,
the man who gave us the

29
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:24,489
term "dinosaur," or "terrible
lizard," also the man who

30
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:26,869
founded the British Museum of
Natural History, gave us the

31
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,579
terminology homology in 1843,
even before Darwin had

32
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:32,140
published "The Origin of
Species." Owen wrote that a

33
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,250
homology was the same organ in
different species under every

34
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,560
variety of form and
in function.

35
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,629
Anatomists of his day, even this
early, realised as they

36
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:44,709
peeled off the skin and
dissected different species,

37
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:47,239
that startlingly different
species had quite similar

38
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,420
anatomical structures.

39
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,121
The skeletons of a mouse and an
elephant sometimes matched

40
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:54,000
up almost bone for bone, even
though they look so strikingly

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,329
different from the outside.

42
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:58,219
For example, if you took the
tusks of an elephant, they

43
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:01,349
look extraordinary, but they
match up with the teeth of

44
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:02,709
other species.

45
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:05,079
To get a sense for how
homologies work, let's take a

46
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:08,050
look at a photo of my dog
Louie's front paw.

47
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,469
Now, you might not think from
looking at the photo that his

48
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:12,819
paw and your hand had
a lot in common.

49
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:14,870
Louie can't pick up things
with his paw.

50
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,670
He can't write.

51
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,179
He can't open a can of dog food
for himself with his paw.

52
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,540
He mostly just sort of runs
around on it and occasionally

53
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:22,039
uses it to scratch with.

54
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:24,699
But if you were to look at an
x-ray of his arm and his paw,

55
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:26,250
you would notice that
the bones match up

56
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,599
surprisingly well.

57
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,780
He has a humerus in his upper
arm, or in his upper leg, that

58
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,789
matches the humerus in your arm,
connected to his scapula.

59
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:36,849
He has a radius and ulna in the
middle part of his leg,

60
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:38,609
matching the two bones
in your forearm.

61
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,440
What's a little bit confusing
about Louie's leg is it looks

62
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,840
like he has an extra joint.

63
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,360
But that extra joint sort of
matches up to the metacarpals

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,540
in your hand.

65
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:50,139
His paw is actually using less
of his leg than your hand is

66
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:51,469
using of your arm.

67
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:54,129
And that fifth dew claw
is a vestigial organ.

68
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:56,439
It matches up to your thumb.

69
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:59,729
If we look closely at the
diagram of the bones, Louie's

70
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:02,674
leg kind of looks like a human
arm, but twisted in a fun

71
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:06,580
house mirror, or in Photoshop,
the same bones reconfigured

72
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,250
into new functions.

73
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,810
Even in a mammal with a
radically different looking

74
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,340
limb, like a horse, or an
elephant, and a dolphin, we

75
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,950
often find these bones match up
one for one in homologies.

76
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:19,939
And that's when it's most
impressive, I think.

77
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:23,900
When you see a limb with a
radically different function,

78
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,010
underlying it is the same-- or
a very similar structure,

79
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:29,750
because we've all descended
from common ancestors.

80
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,240
This, for example, is Jeffrey.

81
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,430
He's a pony that lives
on our farm.

82
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,090
At first glance, his leg may
not look like your arm, or

83
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,409
even a dog's leg.

84
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:40,750
But his leg is homologous
to your arm.

85
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,509
You have to realise that
Jeffrey's basically standing

86
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:44,939
on a single finger.

87
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:48,030
And his finger, or his hoof,
has less joints than your

88
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,099
finger does.

89
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:52,109
But Jeffrey's got a humerus, a
radius, and an ulna, just like

90
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,650
you do, in the whole section
of his leg leading down to

91
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,039
what looks like a knee.

92
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:59,169
In veterinary anatomy that's
called a horse's carpus.

93
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:01,699
The carpus has a seven-bone
structure.

94
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,689
It's homologous to our wrist.

95
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:05,550
And the lowest part of the
horse's leg, down at the

96
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,530
bottom, is called the cannon.

97
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,319
That last joint of his leg
is homologous with your

98
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,250
metacarpal, your middle
metacarpal, the third one, the

99
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,500
middle bone on your hand.

100
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,980
But like your tailbone, his
bones have fused together into

101
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,720
a single unit.

102
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,310
At the lowest point, what's
called the fetlock, he has a

103
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,519
single knuckle, a single joint
above what's essentially a

104
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,699
giant fingernail.

105
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,560
Now, what you have realise with
the bone structure of

106
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,139
Jeffrey's leg is it's severely
distorted compared to yours,

107
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,699
but the bones do match up,
because Jeffrey, unlike your

108
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:38,199
dog, has had to adapt in a

109
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:39,849
completely different direction.

110
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,860
If we compare these structures
to a dolphin's fin, or a

111
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,660
whale's fin, we see that, again,
the same underlying

112
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,930
structure, but distorted in a

113
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,300
completely different direction.

114
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,350
In the whale and the dolphin,
the radius and ulna and the

115
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,100
humerus are all compressed
and reinforced.

116
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,260
And in contrast, the phalanges,
the joints of the

117
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:01,379
fingers in our hands, are
multiplied to form the basis

118
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:01,899
of the fin.

119
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:05,649
Now, in contrast, the bat has
these extraordinary stretched

120
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:09,469
and elongated bones, that all
of the bones of the arm and

121
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,870
the digits are stretched out
so that the membrane of the

122
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,430
wing has a large surface area.

123
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,449
In all these cases, we see how
evolution has driven the same

124
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:22,899
structure into radically
different functions.

125
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:24,750
In the next topic, we're going
to keep talking about

126
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,329
homologies, but we're going to
talk about the direction in

127
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:28,579
that selection.

128
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,560
