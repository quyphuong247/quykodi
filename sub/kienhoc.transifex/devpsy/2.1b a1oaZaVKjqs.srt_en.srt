00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:14,240
One of the early drivers in creating an alternative to Dependency Theory was work from Ethology.

1
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,980
This is Konrad Lorenz, the Father of Modern Ethology—ethology being the study of animal behavior in context,

2
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:27,130
not in the lab, not in the abstract, but in its evolutionary context.

3
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:32,840
Konrad was very famous for just going out and hanging out with the animals, and making observations

4
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:39,480
about not just what they did but why he thought they did it, and why he thought these specific

5
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,789
behavior patterns evolved.

6
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:45,219
He writes absolutely beautifully.

7
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:46,679
He wrote about aggression.

8
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,559
He wrote about communication.

9
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,399
He wrote about mating practices.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,159
And he wrote about parent-infant bonding, because he was fascinated by the complex behaviors

11
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:02,870
that are evident as soon as a flock of ducks, geese, or swans, any precocial birds, as soon

12
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,640
as they hatch out, they show this strong connection to their parent.

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,549
If you go down to the lakes here at the University of Queensland, you would see little ducklings

14
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,770
having this strong connection with their mama duck.

15
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,640
So Konrad wanted to understand the mechanism.

16
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,190
How does it work?

17
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:24,689
What does mama duck do to make those babies follow her around so diligently from the time

18
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:26,680
they’re hatched?

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,780
So, Konrad was doing one of his typical observational case studies.

20
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,350
While he was standing around the lake, he discovered “imprinting” after a bunch

21
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,000
of ducks hatched out of their eggs.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,120
He discovered it by accident.

23
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,880
Because he was there, hanging around, watching what was going on.

24
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:52,240
And when the ducks hatched out, the first large moving object they saw was Konrad Lorenz

25
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,780
instead of their mother.

26
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,760
These ducks imprinted on him, that’s what he came to call it.

27
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,939
What happened was, rather than following their mother, staying close to her, and wanting

28
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:09,500
to sleep on her, which would be their immediate natural behaviours, they addressed these behaviours

29
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:15,140
to Konrad, because he was the first large moving object in their visual environment.

30
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,140
He videotaped this because it was so amazing.

31
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,620
He called it Imprinting because it happened immediately.

32
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,480
Now why is it important in this context?

33
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,060
Because here is a parent-infant bond that has no basis in food.

34
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,080
There’s no long association between Konrad Lorenz and the baby ducks coming to link him

35
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,080
with food.

36
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,550
It happened immediately.

37
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,480
Now of course ducks aren’t people, but it did make people think... well, maybe there are

38
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,420
alternatives to Dependency Theory that we should consider in the case of humans.

39
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,830
That was one type of research that was causing people to think about alternatives to Dependency

40
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,520
Theory.
