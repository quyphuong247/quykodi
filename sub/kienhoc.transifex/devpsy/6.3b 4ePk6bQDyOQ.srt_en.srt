Other researchers have looked at domains within moral reasoning.

1
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:15,250
There are moral rules that pertain to our concepts of harm, and welfare, and fairness.

2
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,140
There are also social conventional rules.

3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,690
Social convention is concerned with social order and organisation, which is something

4
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,020
that&#39;s a little more subjective, more arbitrary.

5
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:30,390
These are rules that we expect people who live in our society to follow, but maybe don’t

6
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:36,329
directly reflect our principles – they aren’t vital to our ideas of morality.

7
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,120
Morality tends to be universal.

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,100
It doesn&#39;t matter who you ask, what country they come from, or what culture they come

9
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,210
from.

10
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,600
Killing another person is not considered okay.

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,649
That tends to be universal.

12
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:50,780
Hurting people and causing them pain is not okay.

13
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,579
Taking other people’s things is not okay.

14
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,989
That tends to be true regardless of where you grew up and regardless of who your parents

15
00:00:56,989 --> 00:00:58,270
were.

16
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,489
Whereas, social convention tends to be fairly arbitrary.

17
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,890
These are things like driving on the right-hand side of the road versus the left-hand side

18
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,399
of the road.

19
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:11,590
The convention that it&#39;s okay for men to walk around topless but not women.

20
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,270
These are the kinds of things that, while we have a hard time going against those rules,

21
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,819
they&#39;re not generally considered a reflection of morality.

22
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:22,439
They&#39;re not considered to be protecting people from harm.

23
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:28,159
Moral issues and social conventional issues are different things, but sometimes they intersect.

24
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,560
This is outside of a record store in the UK.

25
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,119
The point I want to make here is that social conventions like lining up in a queue are

26
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,119
sometimes in the service of preserving morality, things like fairness.

27
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:43,539
It’s fair that the people who are in the front of the line––the people who&#39;ve been

28
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:48,349
waiting the longest––get to go into the store first, and that the people who just

29
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:50,520
got there have to wait.

30
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,969
Sometimes, social conventions and our ideas of morality work together.

31
00:01:54,969 --> 00:01:57,529
Even though they&#39;re separate things, oftentimes, they can overlap.
