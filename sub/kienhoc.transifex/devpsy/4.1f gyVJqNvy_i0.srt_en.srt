Adolescents are exposed to a good deal of media that’s aimed at them in particular.

1
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,490
One of the risk factors associated with being unhappy with your body, is media consumption.

2
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,340
The amount of TV you watch with people who look like this, or the number of magazines

3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,520
you read, is correlated with how unhappy you are with your body. Only five minutes of watching

4
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,910
a TV show can change your perception of your own body, and can make you less happy with

5
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,201
your body (Yamamlya et al., 2005). This is Kate Moss, who is well-known for her

6
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:38,400
extremely thin body, she’s thin even in comparison to other models. Does anybody recognise

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,540
this picture? Ralph Lauren got in huge trouble when the ad first came out. The picture got

8
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,579
them in trouble for basically the worst photoshopping job ever, because this is not the shape of

9
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:53,110
a human. You can see the model, Filippa Hamilton, on the right on the catwalk, and it’s her

10
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,870
in the ad on the left. It’s very clear that her body has been photoshopped in an extreme

11
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,540
way. It’s not necessarily that they’re bad at photoshopping, it’s just that photoshopping

12
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,920
allows them to create idealised bodies, even idealised bodies that are not physically possible.

13
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,160
Nobody photoshops women to be bigger. They’re always photoshopped smaller and slimmer. Seeing

14
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,960
pictures like this tends to make girls think they’re too big. Seeing pictures of David

15
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,210
Beckham and Thor tends to make boys feel like they’re not big enough. So, media consumption

16
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,780
can be a huge risk factor for being unhappy with your body.

17
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,729
Also, personality features can be a risk factor––things like being perfectionistic, having a tendency

18
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,610
to internalise issues, or ruminate over things. There’s been some research in the last maybe

19
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:42,549
ten years or so that’s starting to suggest that some aspect of these body dissatisfaction

20
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:47,430
disorders, for example, anorexia and bulimia, might be more closely related to things like

21
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,299
obsessive compulsive disorders (Swinbourne et al., 2012 &amp; Tyagi et al., 2015). They might

22
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:55,380
be more along the lines of compulsions rather than a true interest in being skinny. So,

23
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,950
that’s where things like perfectionism comes in, internalise negative thoughts and that

24
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,200
sort of thing. Also, contributing to this kind of body dissatisfaction

25
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,520
are stressful home environments. Conflict at home, major changes or chaos in their personal

26
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,569
lives, loss like death or divorce, or high levels of criticism from parents, can lead

27
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:18,030
children to have issues with their body, and this also feeds into some of their compulsions.

28
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,480
A friend of mine, who had an eating disorder in high school, said that what she ate was

29
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,411
one of the only things she could control in the middle of her parent’s divorce. For

30
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:31,160
some children, one way to exert control is to start radically altering their own body

31
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,730
and clamping down on the kinds of things they eat. But this can also be accompanied by excessive

32
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,610
or compulsive exercising as well. So why do we care about what adolescents think

33
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:45,360
about their bodies? Well, it turns out that there are some long-term consequences to adolescents’

34
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,239
body images. Adolescents who have high body satisfaction tend to go on to have higher

35
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:57,060
self-esteem, and have more positive peer relationships. But, adolescents with low body satisfaction

36
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,520
tend to be at risk for depression. They’re also at risk for eating disorders, exercise

37
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,930
dependence, and steroid use in boys. Every year around fashion week the media seems

38
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,040
to start the debate about whether or not models are too skinny. Girls are portrayed as super

39
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,000
skinny. Boys, on some level, can’t win. They’re either portrayed as super skinny

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,790
or super muscly. People have debated back and forth whether or not these models should

41
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:26,099
be banned. Part of the reason we have this conversation as a society––about the kinds

42
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:30,790
of people or models who are presented as ideals to the media––is because it does seem

43
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,849
to influence adolescents in particular, and can harm their well-being and outcomes.
