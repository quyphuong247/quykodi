00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,100
The girl in the video said “blowed up”.

1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,160
It&#39;s pretty striking, isn&#39;t it?

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,860
Now, her parents don&#39;t say blowed up.

3
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,150
Obi-Wan Kenobi doesn&#39;t say blowed up.

4
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,720
Princess Leia doesn&#39;t say blowed up.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,499
Why did she say blowed up and repeat it a couple of times?

6
00:00:27,499 --> 00:00:32,759
These kinds of errors are known as overregularisation errors, and they&#39;re really quite characteristic

7
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,400
of children around this age.

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,390
The interesting thing is that if you go and carefully analyse the language output of children

9
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:46,341
younger than about three, and then follow it all the way to, say, age eight or so, and

10
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:51,230
you look at the overregularisation errors that they make during that time, what you

11
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:56,110
find is that it follows what&#39;s known as a u-shaped curve (Marcus, et al., 1992).

12
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,840
Now, we love these things in developmental psychology because most of our curves are

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,490
just straight lines.

14
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,120
This begs to be explained.

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,210
So, on the y axis, we have the percent of correct usage.

16
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:13,140
And on the x axis, we have the ages of children and their word learning.

17
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,810
What you find is that, young children, younger than the little girl in the previous video,

18
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,420
they will say “blew up”.

19
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,799
If there was an explosion that happened yesterday, they say “it blew up”.

20
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,960
Then, starting around age three, all of a sudden, they start overregularising.

21
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,909
They say “blowed up”.

22
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:36,549
They say “runned real fast”.

23
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:39,409
They say “eated all my dinner”.

24
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:41,090
And if you correct them, they&#39;ll say…

25
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,090
“Okay”.

26
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,460
But then the next day, they&#39;ll make the same mistake again.

27
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,399
They really insist on these mistakes.

28
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,659
These mistakes stick around for quite a long time, all the way up until about age eight

29
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:55,340
when they disappear again.

30
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,520
So, what&#39;s going on here?

31
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,249
Well, the hypothesis is that for young children, they&#39;re just mapping.

32
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:06,990
They&#39;re just mapping a word to its referent.

33
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,140
Explosion in the past, you say “blew up”.

34
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,069
Explosion right now, you say “blow up”.

35
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:19,890
What happens is that, internally, over time, something goes on in the child&#39;s mind between

36
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:25,540
the ages of three and eight where the rule, the grammatical rule is extracted and then

37
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,170
it becomes overapplied.

38
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,989
So, internally, they recognise that…

39
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:36,440
Okay, in order to get a past tense, I take the stem and I add ‘ed’.

40
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,930
And they start applying that rule.

41
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,390
No one&#39;s taught them to do this.

42
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,010
This is unrelated to schooling, as research has looked into that.

43
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,140
They just start doing it.

44
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,180
In that way, they make overregularisation errors, especially in a language like English,

45
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,650
where there are a lot of irregulars.

46
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:59,860
Then, they painstakingly have to learn all of the exceptions, which is why those errors

47
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,410
stick around until they&#39;re about eight years old.

48
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,720
So, that&#39;s the hypothesis.

49
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,140
That&#39;s the kind of stuff that developmental psycholinguists do when they&#39;re studying older

50
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,760
children&#39;s language acquisition.
