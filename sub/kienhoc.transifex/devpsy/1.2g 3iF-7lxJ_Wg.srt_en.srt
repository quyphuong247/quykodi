00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:12,639
So, what ideas did you come up with for investigating the question of whether infants imitate or

1
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:13,639
not?

2
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:16,600
Did you think about investigating other gestures?

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,099
Perhaps you considered some infants might be better at imitating than others?

4
00:00:21,099 --> 00:00:25,239
And did you think about testing infants repeatedly over time?

5
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:28,720
If you did, you’d definitely be on the right track.

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,290
Recently, our research group at The University of Queensland entered this imitation debate.

7
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:41,150
We decided to carry out a large scale, longitudinal study with 106 infants.

8
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:46,650
Unlike previous experiments that only tested new-borns once, we tested them repeatedly

9
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,390
at one, three, six and nine weeks old.

10
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,180
That’s the longitudinal part.

11
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,940
  We also included not just tongue protrusion

12
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:01,780
and mouth opening—the most commonly tested gestures of the last 30 years—but also hand

13
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:07,890
gestures, vocal sounds and facial expressions that previous researchers have claimed new-borns

14
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,560
can imitate.

15
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,950
Our aim was to see if some new-borns are better imitators than others, and to link these variations

16
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,049
to infants’ later-developing social skills and language.

17
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,939
Instead, we found no evidence that babies imitate at all, just as many people reported

18
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:27,430
back in the late 70s and early 80s.

19
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:32,890
So, we had to conclude that new-borns do not in fact imitate.

20
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:37,590
But this is only clear when the experiment is done properly with multiple gestures and

21
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,139
repeated testing.

22
00:01:39,139 --> 00:01:41,259
   Is this bad news?

23
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:42,749
We don’t think so.

24
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:47,630
Confirming that imitation is not an inborn skill in humans means that it’s something

25
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,380
we learn to do in the first months of life.

26
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:55,110
Now the research can concentrate on investigating how we learn to imitate.
