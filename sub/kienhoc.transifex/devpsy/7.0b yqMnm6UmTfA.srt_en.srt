00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:12,130
The essence of Piaget&#39;s theory is that we all develop schema or schemata in the plural.

1
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,330
What&#39;s a schema?

2
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:18,600
It&#39;s the basic skill, knowledge, or concept that we all have that guides our learning.

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,610
Piaget believed that infants have schema from the very beginning as well.

4
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,920
But even though we have this basic knowledge, sometimes as we explore the world, we face

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,550
new experiences that might come in conflict to the things that we know.

6
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,910
This causes a state of disequilibrium.

7
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:40,380
Disequilibrium occurs when our basic knowledge or schema differs from the new experiences.

8
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,710
When this happens, we can deal with it in two different ways.

9
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,310
One way we can deal with it is to assimilate the new experience.

10
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,800
We can basically fit the new experience into our knowledge.

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,920
Another way to deal with a new experience is to accommodate it.

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,969
We can create a new concept to accommodate that new experience.

13
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:01,810
For example, you can think about the schema as a folder.

14
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:05,239
Then, let&#39;s say that a child has an existing schema called bird.

15
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:10,079
They have encountered many birds in their life so far, and have developed a schema for

16
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,920
what birds look like.

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,329
Let&#39;s say this child visits a new place and sees a new type of bird that they haven’t

18
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:17,329
seen before.

19
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:21,030
This is probably going to cause a state of disequilibrium because it&#39;s like, wait...

20
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,869
this object looks like a bird.

21
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:25,450
It looks similar to the other birds the child has seen before.

22
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,539
It has feathers and a beak, but it looks different from the other birds they’ve seen before.

23
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:33,920
When the child sees this new bird-like object, they’re thinking, &quot;Hey, wait a second, that&#39;s

24
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,719
not really like a bird I’ve seen before.

25
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,780
What do I do with this new experience?&quot;

26
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,719
In this case, a child can take one of two steps.

27
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:45,569
One option is to assimilate that knowledge, so the child can say, &quot;You know what?

28
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:49,009
Okay, bird-like object, I&#39;ll fit you into my existing bird schema.

29
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,420
You are a bird”.

30
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,159
This is how a child builds their knowledge about birds.

31
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,320
Another option is to accommodate.

32
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,169
The child might think, &quot;You know what?

33
00:01:57,169 --> 00:01:59,240
This new object doesn&#39;t look like a bird at all.

34
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,530
I&#39;m going to create a new schema called “alien” and I&#39;m just going to put this new object

35
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,179
into this new schema I’ve just developed.&quot;

36
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:08,500
This is how children build knowledge about the world.

37
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,010
Piaget believed that children progress through the different stages by experiencing new things

38
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,880
and in going through a balance of assimilation and accommodation—fitting things into what

39
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,230
you already know, and also creating new concepts to accommodate the new experiences.
