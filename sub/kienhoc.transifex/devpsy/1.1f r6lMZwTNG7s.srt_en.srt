00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:11,700
From the time babies are born, through their facial expressions, we can get a sense of

1
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,360
their emotional state.

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,940
Now, people talk a lot about emotional expressions in infants.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,390
Some of these infants are a bit older, but some of them are just in the new-born period.

4
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:27,109
You can readily identify what they may be feeling from their facial expressions, which

5
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:32,750
suggest that emotions are inborn, that we’re pre-wired to experience reactions to certain

6
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,050
sorts of things.

7
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:39,850
So, like the bottom right-hand baby, Mr. Surprised Baby, he’s obviously seen something that

8
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,969
violated his expectation.

9
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,760
Whereas baby “A”, in the upper-left hand baby, he’s probably just seen his primary

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,010
caregiver, and he’s excited and happy to be in face to face contact again.

11
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:56,050
It’s pretty easy to identify what kind of experiences these babies are having.

12
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:01,940
But the thing is, because they’re quite simple individuals, and because our emotional

13
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:07,780
lives as adults is much richer and more varied, there’s a bit of debate about what elements

14
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,530
of emotion might be inborn.

15
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,540
When we experience an emotion, it’s all overlaid with a whole lot of thoughts, memories,

16
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,980
and plans.

17
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:23,180
But for babies, it’s gotta be lot more straightforward since they don’t have all those things.

18
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:29,970
Is there a clear mapping between what’s inborn—these kind of basic facial expressions—and

19
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,229
the emotions that we feel later in life?
