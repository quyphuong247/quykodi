Between 6 and 18 months of age, mothers play a really important role in scaffolding infants&#39;

1
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,680
understanding of mental states.

2
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,400
Scaffolding is this concept where we build an infant&#39;s knowledge through teaching them

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,660
about something that&#39;s just a little bit more difficult than what they know.

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,259
Mental states are things like desire, thoughts, beliefs, knowledge.

5
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:30,919
These are the internal mental states that go on in our mind.

6
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:34,310
What&#39;s really tricky about mental states is that we can&#39;t see them.

7
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,399
How do we objectify a thought?

8
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,800
In comparison to things like a bag, box, or desk, where it&#39;s really visually clear what

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,800
it is.

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,920
A mental state is something that goes on in our head and we can&#39;t really see it.

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,120
It&#39;s an abstract concept.

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,460
For infants to grasp this concept, it takes them a lot of time and also a lot of scaffolding

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,910
from their mother.

14
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,850
Mothers can help infants by talking to them about their mental states of, for example,

15
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,700
their desire...such as...

16
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,560
Do you want that apple?

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,850
Infants have in their heads…

18
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:04,879
I want that apple.

19
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,790
They have this thought, this desire.

20
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,900
When mothers put the word to it, then they realise…

21
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,920
This thing I&#39;m feeling in my head is this desire called want.

22
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,590
That&#39;s how they start to be more aware of mental states.

23
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,900
What&#39;s really important is that, around 6 to 18 months of age, mothers talk to their

24
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,290
infant more about their desire than their thoughts or beliefs.

25
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,010
This relates to the concept of scaffolding, in that desire is probably one of the most

26
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,420
salient mental states that infants experience.

27
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,540
On a daily basis, a lot of their time is spent on trying to fulfill their desires...

28
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,540
I want that thing.

29
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,560
I want that toy.

30
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,729
I want my diaper changed.

31
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,240
I want to go to sleep.

32
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,280
Those things are really prominent in the infant&#39;s mind.

33
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,040
By labeling the infant’s desire with words, it really helps them grasp this concept that&#39;s

34
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,690
already in their head, and get a better understanding of it.

35
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:01,229
It&#39;s important that mothers talk about infant&#39;s own mental states, so for example…

36
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:03,360
&quot;Do YOU want that apple?&quot;

37
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,390
If the infant doesn’t understand what&#39;s going on in their own head, how are they to

38
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,799
understand what other people are thinking?

39
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:11,059
So, self first, then others.
