0
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,860
Then finally, we can surprise babies through the technique of violation of

1
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,640
expectation, which is basically just creating a magic show for babies.

2
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:21,420
What we do here is we create a surprising outcome from the adult point of view and we

3
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:28,420
see if babies also show that they think it’s surprising. We can do this by measuring their looking times,

4
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,119
or by a physiological measure like heart rate.

5
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,640
Mostly though we do it in terms of looking times.

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,300
Here’s an example.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,360
Renée Baillargeon, who became very famous

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,620
for doing these kinds of studies,

9
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,280
did this experiment back in 1994.

10
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:50,850
She brought infants aged three to 10 months into a lab. She wanted to know

11
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,310
at that age, prior to the point of locomoting, prior to having much experience

12
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,290
of gravity themselves because they weren&#39;t yet locomoting -  would babies

13
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:07,440
already understand something about gravity, namely that if an object is unsupported it’s

14
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,890
going to topple to the ground?

15
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:16,280
She operationalises this by presenting babies with a possible and then an impossible event.

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,420
Of course these were counterbalanced and she gave the babies time in between.

17
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,260
In the possible event, the babies watch as the box gets pushed

18
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,670
across the table, the whole time fully supported.

19
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,980
That’s possible, nothing surprising there.

20
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Babies look because it’s kind of cute and it’s all in the patterns that they love but it&#39;s really no big deal to them.

21
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,090
So they watch it and that’s fine.

22
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,049
Then she shows the impossible event.

23
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:49,030
Here you’ve got the exact same materials and the same amount of movement but because

24
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,700
of the way the box was initially placed you end up with an outcome that should be

25
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,700
impossible.

26
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,170
That box ought to fall down but it doesn’t.

27
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,320
So, what do babies do?

28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,520
Well three-month-olds looked significantly longer at the impossible compared to the possible

29
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,079
event.

30
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,290
So Renée Baillargeon interpreted that as they understand that there’s a violation there.

31
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,700
They look longer because they’re surprised and they’re trying to figure out...How

32
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,880
does that work? Why does that happen?

33
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,400
That’s the interpretation.

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,260
Now these violation of expectation studies can get very elaborate.

35
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,959
And there’s quite a divide in the infancy researchers’ community about whether we are over-interpreting

36
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,580
these kinds of experiments.

37
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,560
Because, always, we’re looking at it from an adult perspective and if babies

38
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,030
look longer we think, well the babies are thinking like adults.

39
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,430
But maybe there’s something else about the impossible event that makes the

40
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,200
baby look longer.

41
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,740
Maybe they really like arms and there’s more arm in that one.

42
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,420
There’s always all kinds of low level perceptual differences between a possible

43
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:02,069
and an impossible event, by its nature, that could be the explanation rather than the high

44
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:06,830
level conceptual explanation that oftentimes the researchers go for.

45
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,420
So that’s a really interesting sort of division in the field at the moment.

46
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:15,590
Certain universities are really into rich interpretation in using this paradigm

47
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,300
and other ones are much more conservative.

48
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,300
I’ve actually used this paradigm on a couple of occasions.

49
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,700
But in general I’m fairly conservative because I love babies but they really don’t know that much.
