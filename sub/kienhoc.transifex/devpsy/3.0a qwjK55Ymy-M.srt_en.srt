00:00:06,819 --> 00:00:10,860
No other animal uses language like we do.

1
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:17,800
Even Gorillas who share about 98% of our DNA don’t have the same language abilities.

2
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,810
How do we come to develop language so naturally from the moment we’re born?

3
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:27,050
We’ve talked about babies attachment to their primary caregiver.

4
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:32,780
The critical period is a time in development when something has to happen, otherwise, development

5
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,010
won&#39;t proceed as normal.

6
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,969
We concluded that there was not a critical period for attachment in human development,

7
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:44,860
because children could overcome early deprivation, and come to have attachment relationships

8
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:50,170
with people even after they didn&#39;t have an opportunity to have a single attachment figure

9
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,950
in the first few years of life.

10
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,980
As you&#39;ll see with language development, it seems to be a bit of a different story.

11
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,520
There does appear to be a critical period for language development (Lenneberg, 1967).

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,950
But exactly how we characterise that isn&#39;t completely clear yet.

13
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,140
Language development in babies is a really lively area of research.

14
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,130
Known as developmental psycholinguistics.

15
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,000
I just want to set the stage by pointing out that... language is specific to human beings.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,470
Now, let&#39;s not confuse communication with language.

17
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:30,060
Human beings communicate in lots of different ways, but our primary mode of communication

18
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,549
is spoken language.

19
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:36,689
But in some cases, it&#39;ll be sign language if you&#39;ve got people who have hearing impairment

20
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:40,180
or can&#39;t produce noises from their larynx.

21
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:46,560
Languages differ all across the world, but, every human group known has a language.

22
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,240
Not only that, if you look at every human group and their children, you&#39;ll find that

23
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,130
the children show an extraordinarily regular developmental progression for language.

24
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:01,219
Children tend to say their first word around their first birthdays.

25
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:07,260
After a period of producing single word utterances, they start stringing words together.

26
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:12,350
When they start to do that, they follow grammatical rules without ever having been explicitly

27
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,720
taught.

28
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,889
And by the time they&#39;re between four and five years old, children are producing utterances

29
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:23,920
that are basically as long as the utterances of fully fluent speakers of the language.
