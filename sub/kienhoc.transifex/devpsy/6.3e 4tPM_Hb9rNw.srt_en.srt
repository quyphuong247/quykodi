00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,690
One of the ways that developmentalists have looked at this is to categorise parenting

1
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:16,200
styles and look to see how that influences the way children reason about moral situations.

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,029
Diana Baumrind began looking at this in 1967.

3
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:22,580
This is Baumrind&#39;s axes of parenting style.

4
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:29,390
There are four parenting styles in these axes, those who are: Indulgent parents, authoritative

5
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:34,210
parents, neglectful parents, and authoritarian parents.

6
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:39,500
The vertical axis here, is for sensitivity and interest in the child.

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,190
Parents have a high level of sensitivity to their child or a low level of sensitivity

8
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,000
to their child.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,180
A high level of sensitivity and interest would include taking into account the child&#39;s feelings

10
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,530
and perspective, and talking things through with the child.

11
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:58,809
Whereas, low levels of sensitivity and interest would be not talking the child, not paying

12
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:02,160
attention to what they&#39;re thinking, or how they&#39;re feeling.

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,110
The horizontal axis here is the amount of control parents like to have over children’s

14
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:10,570
behaviour, and their expectations about what children should do.

15
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,830
Low levels of parental control and expectations would include allowing children to behave

16
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,870
poorly, and parents don&#39;t try to change or modify the child’s behaviour, they just

17
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,870
kind of let them run wild.

18
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,490
They would have low expectations for children academically and would allow them to be rude

19
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,450
to other people.

20
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,240
High levels of parental control on the other hand are parents who tend to really be on

21
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,600
top of their child’s behaviour, so modifying their behavior any time they get out of line,

22
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,490
having high expectations academically, and also high expectations of behaviour in terms

23
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,189
of being polite, and fitting in with adults.

24
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:50,310
We end up with four distinct kinds of parenting styles here based on Baumrind’s model.

25
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,689
Parents who are low in control and who aren’t very sensitive or interested in the child

26
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,090
would be classified as having a neglectful parenting style.

27
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,730
They tend not to correct children’s behaviour when they&#39;re acting out and have low expectations

28
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,680
for their child’s learning.

29
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,770
Parents who have a low level of control, but a lot of interest in the child would be classified

30
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,610
as having an indulgent parenting style.

31
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,560
These parents tend to have low expectations for their child’s learning and behavior,

32
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,540
but also give them everything they want .

33
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,230
Parents who have a high level of control but are not particularly sensitive to the needs

34
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,819
of the child would be classified as having an authoritarian style of parenting.

35
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:31,760
These parents have high expectations for their child’s learning, and but aren’t particularly

36
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,020
concerned with how the child is feeling or what they are thinking.

37
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,819
This also tends to be the kind of parenting that involves more of the physical kinds of

38
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:44,060
correction, for example, spanking, and also sometimes, harsh words.

39
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,760
It depends on the parent.

40
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,980
Parents who have a high level of control but also a high level of sensitivity and interest

41
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,450
in the child would be classified as having an authoritative parenting style.

42
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,530
These parents closely keep track of their child’s behaviour, they have high expectations

43
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,959
for their child’s learning, and tend to take into consideration how the child is feeling,

44
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,520
talking things through with their child.
