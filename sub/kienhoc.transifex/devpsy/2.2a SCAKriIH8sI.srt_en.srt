00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,410
According to Bowlby, babies have inherited this Attachment Behavioral System that enables

1
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,110
them to stay safe by constantly seeking proximity to their primary caregiver.

2
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:22,730
If that’s true, then, do babies do anything other than cling to their mother?

3
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,599
What if the mother dies?

4
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:27,630
Does this mean it’s the end for her clingy baby too?

5
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,759
Well, from an evolutionary perspective, that just wouldn’t make sense.

6
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:36,060
There’s more to the baby’s development than just the Attachment Behavioral System

7
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,680
like Bowlby had described.

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,280
Mary Ainsworth, who was the first student of Bowlby&#39;s, made a really important addition

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,719
to basic Attachment Theory which was this…

10
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,730
You have to have a balance.

11
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:53,949
She said there’s actually dual motivations in children: exploration, which serves the

12
00:00:53,949 --> 00:00:59,309
purpose of learning and equipping them for independent survival; and security.

13
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,329
They’re motivated by these two things, and they’re in balance.

14
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:09,300
Whenever there’s danger, the security motivation is higher and the baby approaches the caregiver

15
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,510
or produces behaviors to get the caregiver to approach him.

16
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:18,680
When danger isn’t present, then the exploration motivation is higher, and the baby goes out

17
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,130
and plays and does things for himself, you can see this any day of the week.

18
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,610
If you go to a park, mother turns up with the child.

19
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:32,340
She sits down with her book and her cafe latte, and he hangs around for a little while, and

20
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,340
then he’s off.

21
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:39,040
He’s on the slide, and then he’s on the swing, and he’s having a great time, learning

22
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,840
and then if she hasn’t looked up for a while, or a dog comes along, or another kid tells

23
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,340
him he stinks, then what does he do?

24
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,680
He runs right back to mom.

25
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,200
He hangs out with her for a little while, he gets a cuddle, he gets a kiss and it’s

26
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,850
all just too interesting, and he’s back out again.

27
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,920
All morning, out and back, out and back.

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,290
Mother is the secure base from which he can explore.

29
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,740
So, that was the first thing that Mary Ainsworth added to attachment theory.
