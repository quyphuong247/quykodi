How do babies learn language, if it’s so special to humans? Well, it starts out very

1
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:18,600
early on in life. You might think that babies don&amp;#39;t talk for the first year of life, so

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,950
they start learning language around that time. Well in fact, a tremendous amount of language

3
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:28,990
learning occurs in the first year of life before babies are speaking at all. They&amp;#39;re

4
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:33,740
babbling, but they&amp;#39;re not speaking in recognisable words.

5
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:40,160
Let me start with the input. Babies come into the world tuned into language already. As

6
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:45,100
we know, they&amp;#39;ve already got, at birth, a preference for the language that they&amp;#39;re going

7
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:50,020
to be speaking. If you&amp;#39;re a Spanish baby, you prefer to listen to Spanish (Moon,

8
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,060
Cooper, &amp;amp; Fifer, 1993). If you&amp;#39;re a Russian baby, you prefer to listen to Russian.

9
00:00:54,060 --> 00:01:00,320
That means that already in the womb, they&amp;#39;ve picked up elements of the language around them.

10
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,159
They&amp;#39;ve picked up the kinds of sounds, the intonations, the rhythms that are

11
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,480
characteristic of the language they&amp;#39;re going to speak.

12
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,760
They&amp;#39;re already sensitive to these things.

13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,340
They didn&amp;#39;t just go by unaware. Babies are tuned into these things, and that may

14
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:22,290
help them learn language because they pay attention when they hear speech after birth.

15
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,710
We also know that when babies are born, they are actually more sensitive to the sounds

16
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:33,390
of languages than older children and adults. Across the world, languages use all sorts

17
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:39,399
of different sounds to convey meaning. Our language of English pretty much uses the sounds

18
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:46,800
of the alphabet and a couple of diphthongs, th, sh, ch. We put those together to make meaningful

19
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:52,060
words, which are then strung together to make meaningful utterances. That&amp;#39;s a subset of

20
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,340
the kinds of sounds you could use in language. Some languages require the speaker to make

21
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,960
a “click” sound.   Other languages use intonation rising up or

22
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,330
dropping down to convey meanings. If you say it rising up, it means something completely

23
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:12,500
different from if you say it dropping down. Here is an example in Chinese:

24
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:20,260
mā (mother) má (hemp) mǎ (horse) mà (scold).

25
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,220
Some languages mark sound differences that other languages don&amp;#39;t.

26
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,720
For example, it’s difficult for English speakers to hear the difference between the

27
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,610
sounds that are represented by the written letters “e” and “i” pronounced in

28
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,830
German. The German word for “love” and &amp;quot;live&amp;quot; (life) sound very similar to English

29
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,050
speakers:

30
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,490
“Leben; Lieben”.

31
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:46,410
A good example for us, English speakers, is Spanish.

32
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:56,541
In Spanish, what we hear as two distinct phonemes, b and v, /b/ and /v/, are the same. So, here

33
00:02:56,541 --> 00:03:02,400
in Australia, if we say bat and vat, we&amp;#39;re saying two different words. One&amp;#39;s a flying

34
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,150
mammal, one’s a tub. If you say those two words in Spain, a Spanish speaker will not

35
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,310
hear the difference between the two. It sounds like you’ve said the exact same word.

36
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,900
It&amp;#39;s hard for us to comprehend that because we pay attention to this phonetic distinction,

37
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,260
but they don&amp;#39;t in Spain. There are plenty of phonetic distinctions that we don&amp;#39;t hear

38
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,590
because it&amp;#39;s not part of the English language.
