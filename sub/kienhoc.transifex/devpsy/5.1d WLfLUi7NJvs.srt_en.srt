There is a classic experiment by Edward Tronick from the Child Development Unit at Harvard

1
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,450
University called the still face experiment, showing babies interacting with their mother

2
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,430
through emotional responses (Tronick et al.,1978).

3
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,960
In the still face experiment, there are three different phases.

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,600
In the first phase, the mother and infant is engaged in a play session just like they

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,539
would normally, so happy times.

6
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,650
In the second phase, the mother switches her happy positive expressions to a neutral one––what

7
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,530
the experimenter called “still face”.

8
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,150
This then really causes havoc for the infant.

9
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,130
It&#39;s like...What&#39;s going on?

10
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,690
This is not normal.

11
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:47,510
The infant realises that in a social interaction, it&#39;s really about communicating both ways.

12
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,970
The infant really tries to regain their mother&#39;s attention, her positive behaviours, and her

13
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:53,970
reactions.

14
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,840
The infant is not just a passive agent in a social interaction.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,269
In the final phase, the mother changes her expressions back to happy expressions again.

16
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:07,400
The infants are then happy to interact with their mother again as if nothing happened.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,920
We see this especially from infants that are securely attached.

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,790
Therefore, it seems that infants are actively involved in social interactions.
