00:00:06,819 --> 00:00:10,930
Just like the rest of us, babies prefer sweet tastes.

1
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,589
If it’s sweet, then it’s likely to be non-poisonous and high in energy.

2
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:19,660
Those are the kinds of things that we want to put into our body.

3
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,500
And you get a reaction like this even in the new-born period to something bitter.

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,170
Very, very similar to the kind of response that we make when something is bitter: yucky

5
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:33,190
face, and also an expulsion response.

6
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,920
They stick their tongues out.

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,240
Babies are extremely sensitive to touch and what we’ve learned in the last 30 years

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,739
or so is that skin to skin contact is actually essential for healthy development.

9
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:47,520
It seems a bit obvious, doesn’t it?

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,680
But we had to re-learn that about ourselves.

11
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,860
This happened largely because with the advent of care for premature babies and the capacity

12
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,970
to medically assist them, some babies who were born prematurely were spending longer

13
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,129
and longer times in incubators.

14
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:08,710
Now, incubators are warm, high-oxygen, and sterile, so that’s very good.

15
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:13,820
But they’re also unnatural; there is no skin to skin contact.

16
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:19,420
In efforts to help premature babies spending time in incubators to grow and get discharged

17
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:24,329
sooner, hospitals started implementing lots of different practices.

18
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:30,409
One practice is this kangaroo care, which is now advocated for full-term babies as well.

19
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:35,430
Basically, it is just getting down skin to skin with the baby.

20
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,030
With the premature baby here, he’s out of his incubator, he’s naked, mother’s bare-chested,

21
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:46,250
and the more time he spends in skin to skin contact with her, the more likely it is that

22
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,640
he is going to be able to breathe on his own, be able to feed on his own, and get out of

23
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,640
the hospital sooner.

24
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,399
There’s a very, very strong correlation there.

25
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:01,190
Skin to skin contact calms crying, assists sleep cycles, and promotes growth in premature

26
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,439
infants.

27
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:06,020
The same is true for typically developing babies.

28
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,700
If you only remember one thing from the developmental psychology lectures in this course, remember

29
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,590
this when you’re a parent.

30
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,329
If you have a little baby and he’s crying and you can’t calm him down, the one thing

31
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:22,791
that is guaranteed to work is strip-off his shirt, strip-off your shirt, get the baby

32
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:26,720
in skin to skin contact, and then wrap a blanket around the two of you.

33
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,260
I guarantee that will make him stop crying within a few minutes.

34
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,850
Now obviously, if you’re on the highway or in a plane, you can’t do it.

35
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,010
But if you can do it, it will work.
