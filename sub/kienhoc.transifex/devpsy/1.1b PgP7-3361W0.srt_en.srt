Now, hearing is an interesting case because research over the last 25 or 30 years has

1
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:16,270
shown that babies, not only can they hear quite well, but they are born with specific

2
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,239
preferences for what they prefer to listen to.

3
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:23,599
I’ll show you in a little while how we do these experiments.

4
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:28,990
But we know that from the time they’re born, babies have a preference for human sounds.

5
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:34,420
They like heartbeats, they like human voices as opposed to other kind of natural sounds,

6
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:40,460
and specifically, they prefer their mother’s voice to any other’s woman’s voice.

7
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,080
This is a really interesting fact because it changes the way we think about nature and

8
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,080
nurture.

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:50,100
The historic view is that nature is sort of like everything that happens before you’re

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,690
born, your genetic predispositions.

11
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:56,640
And nurture happens from the time of birth when the environment starts to write on the

12
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,890
blank slate; the learning that begins to occur once you’re born.

13
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:06,380
But, if babies are born with a preference for a specific woman’s voice, it’s unlikely

14
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,079
that genetics has something to do with it.

15
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,359
Where has that come about?

16
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:13,990
It’s come about through learning in utero.

17
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:20,789
So now we know that nurture actually begins before birth.Which means that nice clean line

18
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:26,079
that the philosophers had between nature and nurture now becomes blurred.

19
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:32,369
Now we have to start thinking about what source of sensory input does a fetus have and how

20
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:34,540
does that impact upon their development?
