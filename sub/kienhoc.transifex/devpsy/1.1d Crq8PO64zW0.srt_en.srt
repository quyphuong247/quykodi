00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:12,860
Now, we don’t really think of ourselves as a species that relies on smell very much.

1
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,320
We like things that smell good.

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,130
And, of course, our taste sensations are almost completely dependent upon smell.

3
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:24,820
But we don’t think about questions like, do babies recognise their mother by smell?

4
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,949
But if you ask that question of babies, you find out that in fact they do.

5
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:34,629
By the first month, babies are sensitive to the difference between different women’s

6
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:38,739
smells and they prefer their mother’s smell.

7
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:44,469
Now I want to talk about this experiment by Aidan MacFarlane in 1975.

8
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:49,360
It was one of the first, and it shows how, if you’re clever, and you think about how

9
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,050
can I get information out of a baby?

10
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,950
You can come up with answers.

11
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,770
You can’t ask him questions.

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,780
Can’t give a baby a questionnaire.

13
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,469
Can’t give him instructions.

14
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:05,940
So, how do we set up an environment for babies to tell us what they know?

15
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:12,080
So, MacFarlane wanted to know if new-born babies can recognise their mother’s smell.

16
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,680
He had mothers bring their babies into the lab.

17
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,730
He put the baby down on the table and then asked the mother for a breast pad out of her

18
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,770
bra which nursing mothers use to catch the extra milk.

19
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,410
It smells just like her.

20
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,080
They put that on one side of the baby’s head.

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,760
And then, another breast pad from another lady, pre-prepared, was put on the other side

22
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,690
of the baby’s head and then that’s your experiment.

23
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,020
Stand back see what the babies do.

24
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:43,170
And what they did was consistently turn their head in the direction of their mother’s

25
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,170
breast pad.

26
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,740
Now, of course, you want to make sure that you’re not just accidentally measuring what

27
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,150
direction do babies like to turn their head.

28
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:56,890
So, you&#39;ve got to switch over the breast pads, which the researchers did, and then poor little

29
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,060
baby had to turn his head back the other way.

30
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,230
But again, that’s what they did, making it a very strong conclusion that the babies

31
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:09,470
can differentiate the two smells, and had a preference for the more familiar smell of

32
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,849
their mother.

33
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:15,791
So, within the first month of life, you’ve got babies with sensory equipment that is

34
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,790
ideally suited to the job at hand.

35
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:23,099
They come out already being familiar with their mother’s voice and preferring that

36
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:24,269
voice.

37
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:30,409
They come out with a visual system perfectly tuned to face to face contact, which enables

38
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:35,689
them to recognise their caregiver, the most important person in their life.

39
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:40,180
And within the first month, they recognise her smell and they thrive when they’re close

40
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,909
to her, in skin to skin contact.

41
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:47,920
If you take it as a whole, nature certainly prepares babies for the environment that they’re

42
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,530
going to be born into, and gives them the tools they need to thrive even with their

43
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,010
limited capacities.

44
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,810
So, that’s the input side.

45
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,680
What about the output?
