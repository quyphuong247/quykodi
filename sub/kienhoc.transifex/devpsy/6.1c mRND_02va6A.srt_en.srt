There are a couple of problems with Social Learning Theory.

1
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,510
One is that sometimes, children can be more moral than their parents, which means that

2
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,040
they are learning morals from an additional source, not just their parents.

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,830
If you&#39;ve ever been driving down the road and a child in the backseat leans over and

4
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,680
says, &quot;Why are you going over the speed limit?&quot;

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,220
Occasions like that show that kids are picking up additional morality from places outside

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,470
of the adults in their life.

7
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,980
We also have some evidence that children’s moral reasoning goes through some changes

8
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,890
over the course of development.

9
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,289
Their reasoning isn&#39;t like adults&#39; reasoning, but it&#39;s still fairly systematic.

10
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:44,800
This suggests that what&#39;s happening is that children’s moral reasoning is morphing,

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,340
and probably increasing in complexity along with their cognitive ability.
