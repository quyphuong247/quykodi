Let&#39;s look in depth at the Nature versus Nurture arguments.

1
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,940
People who argued that language is innate point to the developmental regularity of language

2
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,530
acquisition.

3
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:23,610
Meaning that all over the world, whether it&#39;s Mandarin, Hungarian, or  English, universally

4
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,170
the first word occurs at around 12 months.

5
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:32,369
Then the two-word stage starts at around 18 months, and so on.

6
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,210
This suggests that it&#39;s really an unfolding in the brain, because of course, environments

7
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,710
are very different around the world.

8
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,899
That&#39;s one argument that the innatists use.

9
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,809
Another argument from innatists is what they call poverty of the input.

10
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:52,979
Meaning that the input that children hear is not varied enough to explain all of the

11
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:58,219
things they say through simple processes of association, imitation, and shaping through

12
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:01,309
social reward and correction.

13
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:05,680
For one thing, why did the little girl in the video say blowed up?

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,979
Most of the people around her are saying blew up.

15
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:11,850
What is she doing to say blowed up?

16
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,610
Where on earth did that come from?

17
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,610
You could say…

18
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,399
Well, she heard it from other kids, but then where did they get it from?

19
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:22,039
That becomes a chicken and egg problem.

20
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:27,189
Another issue about poverty of the input is that you can put children in a context where

21
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:30,770
they’ll say something that they could never have heard before.

22
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,520
Here&#39;s a very simple example by Jean Berko Gleason (1958).

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,570
Gleason brought babies—well, four- to seven-year-olds, into the lab.

24
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,659
She shows them this and says...

25
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:42,250
This is a wug.

26
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,549
Then, she gives them a little test, and says…

27
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:47,130
These are two…?

28
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,229
And the little four- to seven-year-olds go…

29
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,229
 Wugs.

30
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:52,119
Now, why is that important?

31
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:54,829
Well, on a learning view, how could this have occurred?

32
00:01:54,829 --> 00:02:00,799
They have never before heard someone refer to two of those things as wugs.

33
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,610
They haven’t built up an association between that particular form of the word and that

34
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,030
referent.

35
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,080
And they’ve never heard it before so they can&#39;t be imitating.

36
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,660
They can&#39;t have been shaped into doing that, right?

37
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,280
So, where the heck did it come from?

38
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,860
The innatists would say that it came from the magical language acquisition part of the

39
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,280
brain.
