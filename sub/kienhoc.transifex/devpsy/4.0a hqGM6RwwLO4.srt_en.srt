00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,980
“I see no hope for the future of our people, if they’re dependent upon the frivolous

1
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,130
youth of today.”

2
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,349
Sound familiar?

3
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,949
This was said back in the 8th century BC (Hesiod), if you can believe it.

4
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:17,949
There’s more…

5
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:20,679
“For certainly all youth are reckless beyond words.”

6
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:26,150
“When I was young we were taught to be discreet and be respectful of elders, but the present

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:31,539
youth are exceedingly wise––otherwise known as disrespectful, and impatient of restraint.”

8
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:37,120
Shakespeare followed it up, saying...“I would that there were no age between 16 and

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,181
23” So, he’s just hoping everyone could just skip that time period... “for there

10
00:00:41,181 --> 00:00:47,300
is nothing in between but getting wenches with child, wrongdoing the ancientry, stealing,

11
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,730
fighting, etc etc.”

12
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:56,100
Even Aristotle got in on the act, so he said that adolescents were “in character, prone

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,530
to desire and ready to carry any desire they may have formed into action.

14
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,270
Of bodily desires, it is the sexual to which they are most disposed to give way.

15
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,939
And in regard to sexual desire, they exercise no self-restraint.”

16
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:15,240
Apparently, people have been complaining about adolescents for centuries.

17
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,479
For example, adolescents are a problem for the future of our culture if they continue

18
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,149
the way they are.

19
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:25,420
People worrying about teen pregnancy, being disrespectful to their elders, and things

20
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,340
like being unable to control their impulses.

21
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,439
All of these things have been a conversation about adolescents apparently since the beginning

22
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,709
of time.

23
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:37,880
But don’t worry, each generation turns out just fine and then in turn complains about

24
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,069
the generation following them.
