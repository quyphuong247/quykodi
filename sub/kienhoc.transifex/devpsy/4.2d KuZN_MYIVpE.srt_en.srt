00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,930
James Marcia does have evidence that there is a developmental trend for these 4 kinds

1
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,900
of identity statuses.

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,840
For “diffusion” and “foreclosure”, both of these are really not thinking things

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,000
through when your experiencing a crisis.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,710
“Moratorium” and “achievement” are where we’re experiencing a crisis and thinking

5
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:30,189
things through.Across the bottom here on the x-axis we have age.

6
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:34,400
On the y-axis, we have percent in each identity status.

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,570
As you can see, younger adolescents are more likely to give rationales that place them

8
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,030
in categories of “identity diffusion” and “foreclosure”.

9
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,670
They aren’t really thinking through their crises.

10
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,670
As people get older, though they are increasingly likely to give rationales that place them

11
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,260
in categories of moratorium or identity achievement.

12
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:58,480
And, during the teen years and early twenties, the greatest increase in identity type is

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,569
for identity achievement, which is the blue line.

14
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:08,000
So, as people get to 16, 17, 18 years of age, they are just starting to think through their

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,150
issues carefully, and just starting to commit to some of these changes, but it’s a small

16
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,720
percentage.

17
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,320
Most teens have a diffused identity, even at 18.

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,710
But, by the time people get to 24 years of age, most will have reached identity achievement.

19
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,150
(Marcia, 1966; 1980).

20
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:30,810
It’s worth noting that the age of 18, people are allowed to generally vote or join the

21
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,680
military, where they’re legally considered to be an adult in a lot of places.

22
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,280
You can see here that, at that age, most adolescents still don’t really have their own identity.

23
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,740
They’re still working things through.

24
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:48,410
But they are able to commit to important things even before they really know who they are.

25
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:53,410
The long and short of this is that forging one’s own identity is a long process - in

26
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,770
contemporary societies anyway.

27
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,100
Not until around 21 years of age, do a majority of adolescents get to the “achievement”

28
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,470
or “moratorium” status.

29
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:06,050
We might have different identity statuses in different areas of our lives.

30
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:10,280
So our love life versus our work, versus how we deal with religion or what not, we might

31
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,810
have different identities in all of those different areas of our life.

32
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,879
“Identity achievement” has been associated with some good things.

33
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,730
Things like being open-minded.

34
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,859
When we have made a decision about who we want to be, sometimes it helps to consider a different

35
00:02:23,859 --> 00:02:24,909
point of view.

36
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:29,129
“Identity achievement” is also associated with high self-esteem and psychological well-being.
