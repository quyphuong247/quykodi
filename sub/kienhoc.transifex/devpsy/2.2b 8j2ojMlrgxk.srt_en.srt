00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:11,230
The whole reason Mary Ainsworth went to work with Bowlby, was because she wanted to understand

1
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,449
individual differences in parent-infant and parent-child relationships.

2
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:18,180
That’s what she really cared about.

3
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,410
She was interested in the question of...

4
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,369
How come some children just cling to their mothers?

5
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,080
They just stick their face into her skirt and they won’t even look out.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,710
They won’t greet any strangers.

7
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,279
Whereas other children you know, the parents take them to a public place, and they have

8
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,500
to put a leash on them.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,890
Otherwise, they’re just going to bolt completely.

10
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:41,540
Huge individual differences in the way children react to their parents and the wider environment.

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,280
Where do those differences come from?

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,239
There wasn’t anything satisfactory really in Dependency Theory as far as she was concerned

13
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,649
for understanding those individual differences.

14
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:58,520
Because, the more you feed the baby, not necessarily the more he’s going to be attached to you.

15
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,850
So she thought, maybe it’s Attachment Theory.

16
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:07,900
This idea of a psychological motivation, feeling of security, can give me a handle on why there

17
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,579
are these individual differences.

18
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:14,909
Mary moved from London––where she was working with Bowlby––to Baltimore in the

19
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,060
United States of America.

20
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,039
She started her work at Johns Hopkins University where she carried out and published her major

21
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:25,490
piece of research on patterns of attachment.

22
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,209
This is her book (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters &amp; Wall, 1978).

23
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:30,709
She took Attachment Theory in a new direction.

24
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:35,530
She recruited pregnant women and asked them to enrol in her study, and kind of just threw

25
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,890
everything at them.

26
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,720
She interviewed them about their feelings about being a parent, what their plans were

27
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,000
for how they’re going to treat their babies when they’re born.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,140
Then once the babies were born, she visited them in the hospital.

29
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,770
She visited them at home.

30
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,840
She had regular home observations all the way through the first year of life where she

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,359
did all kinds of things.

32
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:56,419
Now, this was before videotape.

33
00:01:56,419 --> 00:02:01,939
So, she had a little army of research assistants who went to their homes, followed them around,

34
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:05,779
measured things like the average distance between the mother and the baby.

35
00:02:05,779 --> 00:02:08,790
How quickly did the mother respond when the baby cried?

36
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,980
Is the mother feeding on a rigid four-hour schedule, which was all the rage back then,

37
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,400
or does she do it in a different way, just all kinds of things?

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,540
What’s her attitude towards parenting?

39
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,400
What’s her attitude towards her husband?

40
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,620
What’s her attitude towards the baby?

41
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,810
Ainsworth just gathered all the data she possibly could.

42
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,810
Then, she realised…

43
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,739
Wooh I’ve got so much data.

44
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:31,209
How am I going to organise this?

45
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:33,269
I need something standard.

46
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:37,680
If I want to compare from one family to the next, I need one standard that will allow

47
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,469
me to make the comparisons.

48
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:43,709
So, she developed an experimental technique to be part of this.

49
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:46,870
It’s called the Strange Situation test.

50
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,680
Basically, what she wanted to do, was to make the baby’s Attachment Behavioral System

51
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,439
turn off and turn on in the lab.

52
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,909
So, Baby and mother come to the lab and go into a room.

53
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:01,230
There are some toys around.

54
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,489
A stranger comes in, hangs out for a while.

55
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:06,249
Then the stranger leaves.

56
00:03:06,249 --> 00:03:07,499
Then the mother leaves.

57
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:08,980
Baby’s alone.

58
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,870
Then the stranger comes back.

59
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:15,040
Then the mother comes back as the stranger leaves again, and it’s over.

60
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,489
So, basically what you’re looking at is...

61
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:22,940
Does the baby use the mother as a secure base to explore, or is he more clingy?

62
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,450
How does a baby respond to the stranger?

63
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,859
How does he respond when the mother leaves?

64
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:30,269
And how does he respond when the mother comes back?
