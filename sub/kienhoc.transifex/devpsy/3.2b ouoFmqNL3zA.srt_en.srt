00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:10,809
Now, the first words are normally uttered around the infant&#39;s first birthday, but there&#39;s

1
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:13,429
a lot of variability around this.

2
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:18,160
Technically, you wouldn’t worry about a child who wasn&#39;t speaking until she was at

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,890
least three years old.

4
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,589
If you don&#39;t get the first word by about three years, that&#39;s when you start testing for hearing

5
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:27,419
impairment, or you start considering other diagnoses.

6
00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:30,050
There’s a very long tail to the distribution.

7
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,500
The first birthday is the modal time when infants start saying their first word, and

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,360
it’s almost always a noun (Tardiff et al., 2008).

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,180
It&#39;s usually a middle-sized thing in their environment.

10
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:47,460
A door, ball, book, in fact those were the first words of my three children.

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,579
Then, their early vocabulary is pre-dominantly nouns.

12
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:55,760
Again, small, medium-sized things in their environment.

13
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,790
They pick up words for a few simple actions and we specifically teach them these pragmatic

14
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,129
functors like “bye-bye” and “ta.”

15
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,050
They don&#39;t refer to anything, but they&#39;re part of the social context of language.
