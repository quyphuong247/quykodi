00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,920
Most people would say Marie was the naughtier girl because she was doing the wrong thing.

1
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,940
She purposely disobeyed.

2
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,970
The intent behind the action is what&#39;s important for adult morality.

3
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,410
What&#39;s interesting is that children tend to focus on the outcome.

4
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:25,820
The outcome here is, for children, 1 broken cup versus 15 broken cups.

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,169
For young children, the girl who broke the most cups was the naughtiest.

6
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:34,980
That’s a type of reasoning by children in Piaget&#39;s youngest stage… the Heteronomous

7
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,079
morality stage, which is about four to eight years of age (Piaget, 1932).

8
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,010
Essentially this stage says that children focus on rules or laws.

9
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,289
And Children believe rules have their own innate authority.

10
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,550
Children follow rules because those rules exist.

11
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:54,280
They don’t consider that the rules might be negotiable or changeable, or that that

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,320
rules serve a purpose.

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,949
In this stage children are primarily motivated by a fear of punishment.

14
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:04,530
So, children follow the rules because they exist.

15
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,070
And that’s what you do to avoid getting into trouble.

16
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,540
The child leaning over your shoulder, asking why you&#39;re speeding, is probably in this stage

17
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,050
of moral reasoning.

18
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,540
There&#39;s a law, and you&#39;re not following it.

19
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,900
That is not okay.

20
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,610
That&#39;s immoral.

21
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,150
Children learn to take on other people&#39;s laws.

22
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:26,530
In this stage, the outcome is most important, so 15 cups versus 1 cup.

23
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,270
The intent is not of relevance to them.

24
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,990
Piaget&#39;s second stage of moral development… the Autonomous morality stage, goes from age

25
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,720
eight to adulthood.

26
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,360
This is where kids start to figure out that laws can be relative, that they&#39;re social

27
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,000
constructions, that they have some sort of underlying purpose, and then that purpose

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,950
can be argued against or modified.

29
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,470
Children begin to understand that rules are made by people for people.

30
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:56,970
So, children at this age, the intention behind the act is most important.

31
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,810
This marks the stage where children have an internalised sense of morality, where they&#39;re

32
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:07,030
subject to their own law, and they aren’t following the rules to avoid getting in trouble.

33
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,500
The stages here, for Piaget, are pretty broad.

34
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,060
I think most people would say that an eight-year-old’s moral reasoning is very different from adult’s

35
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,609
moral reasoning.

36
00:02:16,609 --> 00:02:19,260
That&#39;s part of the reason why we don&#39;t elect eight-year-olds to office.
