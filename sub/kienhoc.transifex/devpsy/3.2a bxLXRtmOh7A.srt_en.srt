00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:11,969
Say, you&#39;re a baby, and you&#39;re 12 months old, and you&#39;re toddling around, and you hear your

1
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:13,830
parents talking about things.

2
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,480
How do you connect up what they&#39;re saying, the words that are coming into your auditory

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,589
system with what they mean, what they refer to?

4
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:28,510
One hypothesis is that you do it through association.

5
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:33,540
Babies are looking at something like a bottle, and they hear somebody say, &quot;Do you like your

6
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,540
bottle?

7
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,270
Look at your yellow bottle.&quot;

8
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,371
With that nice infant-directed speech, it’s very clear that bottle is the word, the thing

9
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:43,160
that&#39;s being highlighted.

10
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,649
They&#39;re looking at the bottle, so they link up what they hear, “bottle”, with what

11
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:50,719
they see and thereby learn the word.

12
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,760
That&#39;s one solution and in fact, that was the solution that was proposed some centuries

13
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,260
ago, but the problem is that life isn’t that simple.

14
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:06,550
For instance, babies would often be in a situation like this where they&#39;re looking at one thing

15
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,610
and the speaker is looking at something else.

16
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:14,500
When the speaker makes his utterance, if the baby is looking at the wrong thing, this could

17
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,440
be very confusing.

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,800
The baby spends a very long time thinking that geckos are called roosters.

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:28,210
Dare Baldwin, a Canadian developmental psychologist, wanted to find out what happens in this situation,

20
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,600
where simple association won&#39;t work.

21
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,390
She did this test in 1991, where she brought babies and their parents into the lab, and

22
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,840
she basically set up this situation.

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,670
She ensured there were three objects available.

24
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,030
When the baby was looking at one, the parent uttered a word (Baldwin, 1991).

25
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,220
The question was…

26
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:53,990
Would the baby link the word they hear with what they were looking at, at the time?

27
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:58,310
What she found was that babies don&#39;t simply associate what they hear to what they can

28
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,040
currently see.

29
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,560
What they do is when they hear a new word, they turn around and look at the speaker to

30
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,610
figure out what the speaker is looking at.

31
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,790
They follow the speaker&#39;s line of regard and that&#39;s the referent they assigned to the new

32
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,319
word that they&#39;ve heard.

33
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,489
It&#39;s really quite a sophisticated mechanism for babies as young as 16 months old.

34
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:24,190
This is known as joint attention.

35
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:29,170
Babies don’t simply associate utterances with any objects they’re looking at as was

36
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:34,200
long thought, they’re actually using their sophisticated social skills to make sense

37
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,769
of people&#39;s utterances and learning words that way.

38
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:44,099
Just to highlight that, hearing children of deaf parents who learn sign language as their

39
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:49,890
primary language, they have access to television, but they don&#39;t learn spoken language from

40
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,999
their access to television.

41
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:56,860
It&#39;s not until they get to school and they start being spoken to that they start learning

42
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,020
spoken language (Sachs &amp; Johnson, 1981 - reference list).

43
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,170
It&#39;s not good enough just to hear it.

44
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:06,170
You have to be in a social context where people are communicating, and you can have a rich

45
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,099
sense of what they&#39;re talking about.

46
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:12,032
It takes that in order for babies to learn language (Baldwin, 1994; Ramirez-Esparza,

47
00:03:12,032 --> 00:03:12,042
Garcia-Sierra &amp; Kuhl, 2014).
