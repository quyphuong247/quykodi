00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,510
What seems to be happening in the adolescent brain, in addition to differential rates of

1
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:15,080
maturation, is that their brain is undergoing synaptic pruning.

2
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,020
This happens up until the early 20’s.

3
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,810
But what that means is that their brain is pruning away connections that they’re not

4
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,810
using.

5
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,270
So, it’s strengthening ones that they are using, and it’s getting rid of ones that

6
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,270
they don’t use.

7
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:32,419
Here is an illustration of the neurons in a child’s brain at birth, at seven years,

8
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:34,579
and at 15 years of age.

9
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:39,010
You can see that the numbers of neurons they have when they’re 15 is less than those

10
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,460
they had when they’re seven years of age.

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,570
The other phase in life where there’s a whole bunch of synaptic pruning is right around

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,570
two years old.

13
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,210
There’s a major reorganisation then.

14
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,510
The second burst of synaptic pruning happens in adolescence.

15
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,680
Their brain can prune away up to 50 percent of their connections during this phase in

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,830
life.

17
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,870
What that does is it makes their brain more efficient.

18
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,410
We can think faster.

19
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,759
It gets rid of pathways that might be less efficient, and strengthens the ones that might

20
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:08,520
be more direct between areas of the brain that need to talk to each other.

21
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,709
It’s something of a use it or lose it kind of thing, where the ones they’re using stay,

22
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:15,530
and the ones they’re not using, go.

23
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:20,570
Late development of adolescents’ prefrontal cortex may allow them to be particularly creative

24
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,170
during this time.

25
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,439
They still have all sorts of connections that haven’t been pruned away yet.

26
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:30,810
Some people have argued that this late development of the prefrontal cortex, which has the side

27
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,700
effect of impulsivity, creativity in adolescence, is key to humans’ creativity, flexibility

28
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,539
of thinking, and adaptability (Thompson-Schill, Ramscar &amp; Chrysikou, 2009).

29
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:43,659
Without risk taking, our brains might settle into highly predictable, conservative patterns.

30
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:49,270
So, late prefrontal cortex development may have negative consequences for some individuals

31
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:55,380
who go too far but for the species as a whole, it may be highly adaptive, allowing adult

32
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,029
brains to retain novel patterns
