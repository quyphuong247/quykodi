I’m sure you’ve worked out from the beginning that it’s a little bit silly, and archaic,

1
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:14,699
to say it’s either nature or nurture.

2
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:16,859
And we’ve come to that understanding now.

3
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,160
For one thing, if you think about nature as the inbuilt, say, brain patterns, of a newborn

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,220
baby, well, the fact is that the brain changes drastically in the first two years of life.

5
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,599
The cortex doubles in size.

6
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,210
Now the underlying stuff pretty much just grows or stays the same, but the cortex itself

7
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,370
doubles in size, synapses grow all over the place and then they die back.

8
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:46,250
So basically, any cognitive wiring, that you have at birth is going to be completely different

9
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,719
two years down the track.

10
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:53,370
So, that sort of precludes the idea that you could have these fully inbuilt brain systems,

11
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,019
cognitive systems at least.

12
00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:59,489
Also, we’re learning more and more about gene environment interactions.

13
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:05,130
So, your nature may provide you with genetic disposition for one type of behaviour or another, but

14
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:11,070
your nurture, your environment, may affect the way that gene is expressed.
