00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:12,710
Harlow and his lab went through many permutations of different types of isolation, lengths of

1
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,090
isolation, and what they saw was really clear.

2
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:22,980
Isolates who had nothing, the extreme isolates, they showed really... really bizarre unhealthy

3
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,510
behaviour.

4
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,560
All their biological needs were met, but something major was missing because they tended to just

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,509
sit in the corner, rock back and forth.

6
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:34,030
A lot of them were into self-harm.

7
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,170
They’d bite themselves or they’d bang their heads against the wall.

8
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,730
The isolates who had mannequins did a bit better, but it was interesting because the

9
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:50,070
ones who had a bottled mannequin mum, a bottled surrogate, they would feed on her but they

10
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,070
wouldn’t otherwise spend time with her, which goes completely against Dependency Theory,

11
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,150
doesn’t it?

12
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,800
They should have an association of pleasure with that thing.

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,039
But they didn’t spend any time on it at all.

14
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,600
Rather, they spent time on the squishy, soft mum.

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,910
So, if they had a soft mum, they would cling to it, kind of like they would do in their

16
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:15,210
natural environment if they had a living monkey mother.

17
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,680
And if they had both a soft and feeding mum, they’d cling to the soft mum.

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:27,179
Now, after a period of isolation, Harlow and his colleagues put the isolates back into

19
00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:28,950
the troop.

20
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,380
What happens now?

21
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,920
Now they get some social input.

22
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,220
But It didn’t help.

23
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,530
The isolates were a mess when they went back in with the rest of the monkeys.

24
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,920
The main problem was that they didn’t know how to respond to social interaction from

25
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,300
other monkeys.

26
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,950
The other monkeys would come up and try to make friends, and the isolates would freak

27
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,530
out, be aggressive, and then those guys didn’t want to be friends with them anymore.

28
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:59,070
So, they became isolated even within the social group as a result of their early isolation.

29
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,300
And this was a really consistent finding.

30
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:07,810
They didn’t get over it, and it was really, really deep down that these detrimental effects

31
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,860
were seen.

32
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:14,090
So much so, that if you took a male isolate and you put him with a receptive female, he

33
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,200
couldn’t work out what he was supposed to do.

34
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,630
He couldn’t get close to her.

35
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,110
He couldn’t mate with her.

36
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,720
Now, that’s pretty extreme.

37
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,160
That’s what happens when you take a social creature and you isolate him from his natural

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,970
social environment.

39
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:33,310
It disrupts his psychological health all the way down to basic biological functions like

40
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,310
mating.

41
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,370
Now, the females could be mated, but they tended to be incompetent mothers, so any maternal

42
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,230
instinct also seemed to be gone.

43
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:47,090
They tended to be abusive towards their babies, neglectful of their babies, and then these

44
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,670
babies of course had to be taken away and either isolated or raised by someone else.

45
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,020
So, you can see that cycle of abuse starting.

46
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,050
It’s not a happy story.

47
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,750
As I say, we couldn’t do this kind of research anymore, thank goodness, but we did learn

48
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,420
a tremendous amount from it.

49
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,400
In the end, there was a little bit of a happy ending because Harlow and his group, they

50
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,720
weren’t trying to torture monkeys, so they did try many, many different schemes for making

51
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,350
the isolates capable of functioning again within the group.

52
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,410
Ultimately, they did finally crack it.

53
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:25,740
They discovered that, putting isolates with juvenile monkeys really helped them to regain

54
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,510
their ability to socialise with other monkeys.
