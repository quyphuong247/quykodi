To investigate whether babies can discriminate male and female faces, we bore them -

1
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,260
believe it or not.

2
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:17,040
In habituation, we force babies to have a preference by boring them with one

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,810
of these two categories.

4
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,980
Here’s some sample habituation data.

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,619
On the left we have the mean looking time.

6
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:30,099
The baby’s looking time ranges from 0 milliseconds to 14 thousand milliseconds.

7
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:32,460
This is how you would do this experiment.

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,900
If they don’t show a preference for male versus female faces, then let’s force the issue.

9
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,600
Put them in a looking chamber and you show them a male face and

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,480
you let them look at it until they get bored… a mean of 8000 milliseconds.

11
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,760
Then you show another male face, and they’ll look

12
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,190
at that a little bit less long because they’ve already been stimulated with male faces.

13
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,980
Like the second bite of the snickers bar.

14
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,980
And then the third male face and then you keep going until their

15
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,110
average looking at these three faces is half of what the average looking

16
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,940
at the first three faces was.

17
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:12,020
That’s how we define boredom in these kinds of experiments.

18
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,550
And now once they’re bored, you can do your test.

19
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:21,140
If they have coded each of these as just face, face, face, face, face, they’ll have

20
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,800
a category of faces, generally.

21
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,680
Then if you throw in a female face, they’re not going to notice the difference, they’re

22
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,350
just all faces to babies.

23
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:34,080
But if they do know the difference between male and female faces and you’ve bored them

24
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,160
with male faces, now when you put in a female face, they’re going

25
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,390
to get interested again.

26
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,410
And that’s what these data depict.

27
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,970
This is a really powerful technique because you can ask babies all sorts of questions about

28
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,520
what they can and can&#39;t tell the difference between when you don’t necessarily think they’re

29
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,440
going to have a preference.

30
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,680
Can they tell the difference between a BMW and an Audi?

31
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:02,070
Can they tell the difference between an Australian soccer jersey and a Brazilian soccer jersey?

32
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,420
Can they tell the difference between an apple and an orange?

33
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,220
You can ask them anything you want with this kind of paradigm.

34
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,579
It’s very powerful.
