00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:08,690
Infants love to learn.

1
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,840
From around six months to around 18 months of age, infants become more and more active

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,209
in learning about the world.

3
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:19,640
They start to seek information through joint attention.

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,840
Joint attention is where you try to get the attention of the other person so that you&#39;re

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,900
looking at the same thing, and you can talk about it together.

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,900
Infants can do this through gaze.

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,980
They can also do this through pointing, which is really important because they can learn

8
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,760
the names of the different objects that they’re pointing at.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,800
 Another way in which infants learn about the world is through social referencing.

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,510
This is where infants suss out what&#39;s going on by looking at mum.

11
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,510
When infants are exploring somewhere unfamiliar, they tend to look towards mum to see how she

12
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,800
is reacting.

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,800
If mum looks happy…

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,230
Okay, I&#39;m fine to go and explore.

15
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,949
If mum looks a little fearful, then the infant retracts as well.

16
00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:02,680
Just like joint attention, infants develop social referencing at around 10 to 12 months

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08,289
of age.We also see social referencing in the visual cliff paradigm.

18
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:12,400
In the visual cliff paradigm, infants are tested to see if they have developed depth

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,830
perception.

20
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,060
The infant is put on one side of the table that looks solid, and then on the other side

21
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,200
of the table, there&#39;s a little visual cliff.

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,490
It looks like there&#39;s a drop off.

23
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:27,030
The researcher then waits and sees if the infant is willing to crawl across over the

24
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,330
edge.

25
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,110
The infants are typically quite fearful in this situation to crawl over the edge––particularly

26
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,270
if they have developed depth perception.

27
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:41,259
However, the infants become especially fearful when the mum is looking fearful like this––when

28
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:45,899
they&#39;re giving the look like...It&#39;s a really bad idea to go across over there.

29
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,320
The infants then almost never crawl over the edge.

30
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,110
We can see this in the laboratory with the visual cliff.

31
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,020
We can also see it when we go out to parks, or when infants are crawling on stairs or

32
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,070
on something else that’s potentially dangerous, and they look at mum with a cheeky smile.

33
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:08,149
When mum shows her stern look, the infant goes… alright, not going to do that then.

34
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:13,290
So, social referencing helps infants to learn about all the strange things that they encounter

35
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:13,950
in the world.
