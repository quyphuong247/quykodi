00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:11,450
If you look at babies across the world, they’re sensitive to all the phonetic distinctions

1
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,100
across all the different languages.

2
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:20,189
A Spanish baby will hear the difference between bat and vat even though his older siblings

3
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:22,200
and his parents won&#39;t.

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:28,150
Similarly, an Australian baby will hear the phonetic distinctions between “E” and

5
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:33,360
“I” pronounced in German that English speakers simply aren&#39;t sensitive to.

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,539
If you track this development, you’ll find that as babies approach their first birthday,

7
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:44,670
they become less and less sensitive to phonetic distinctions outside of their language.

8
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,159
They&#39;re born with a universal ear that fairly quickly tunes into the sounds that are going

9
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,129
to be carrying meaning within the language that they will be speaking.

10
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:57,640
Now, infants are sensitive to features of linguistic input.

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:03,629
But, we also structure the input in such a way to help them learn language.

12
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:08,320
The way we talk to babies, as you&#39;re probably aware, is very different from the way we talk

13
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,620
to adults.

14
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:15,189
We talk to babies in a register known as motherese or infant-directed speech.

15
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:19,390
We use the same thing with our small fluffy pets because they have been bred to look like

16
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:34,530
babies with big eyes, big foreheads, small snouts.

17
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,090
It&#39;s a particular way of talking to something that&#39;s cute.

18
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:44,350
We talk slowly, we&#39;re very repetitive, and we use high and low intonations.

19
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:49,049
If someone is talking to a baby, this is what we might expect to hear: &quot;Hello, baby.

20
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:50,840
Hello you cute baby.

21
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,429
Look at you, with your sweet little cheeks.

22
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:56,670
Those cheeks are so chubby.

23
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,780
They’re very sweet.”

24
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,710
That&#39;s how we speak to babies.

25
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,280
You may not like the sound of it, but the following would be absurd.

26
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,710
&quot;Hello baby.

27
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,070
Aren’t you cute.

28
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,520
You’ve got sweet little chubby cheeks.

29
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,180
Yeah, those are really sweet chubby little cheeks.&quot;

30
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,290
That makes no sense at all.

31
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,629
We naturally speak to babies in the motherese register, and we all do it.

32
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:25,760
When you analyze motherese, what you find is that first of all, babies prefer it, so

33
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,090
given a chance, they’ll turn their head or suck in order to hear motherese as opposed

34
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,360
to adult-directed speech.

35
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,790
Also, if you look at motherese, what it does is it segments the speech stream in a way

36
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,340
that may help babies to break in and figure out where the word boundaries are (Cooper

37
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,490
&amp; Aslin, 1990; Fernald, 1985 - reference list).

38
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,569
Here, you’ve got...

39
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:48,569
&quot;Hello, baby.

40
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:49,569
Hello.

41
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,769
How are you today?

42
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:53,360
Look at you, you&#39;re so cute.

43
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,409
Look at those chubby cheeks.”

44
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:55,459
(Those are some chubby cheeks you’ve got.

45
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:56,459
I love your chubby cheeks.)

46
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:03,630
Words like “Hello”, “you”, “Chubby cheeks” are repeated over and over.

47
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:07,629
That&#39;s one of the hardest things when you get to a place where you don&#39;t speak the language,

48
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:10,629
and effectively that&#39;s what has to happen for babies.

49
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:13,241
They&#39;re born into a place where they don&#39;t speak the language yet.

50
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:20,500
The trick is if you&#39;re only hearing adult-directed speech, it&#39;s quite monotonous, and fast, and

51
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,030
it&#39;s hard to tell where the word boundaries are.

52
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:28,970
Until you can break in to individual words, you can&#39;t begin to map meanings from words

53
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,440
to the world.

54
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,130
Infant-directed speech seems to help babies to do that because it&#39;s slow, it&#39;s got the

55
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:42,080
high and low intonations, and it&#39;s repetitive, and there tends to be emphasis on the important

56
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,130
words which we repeat over and over.

57
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,130
Remember earlier…?

58
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,010
&quot;Cute little cheeks.

59
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,390
Look at those cheeks.&quot;

60
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:54,510
Oftentimes, we&#39;ll be touching the baby or pointing at something when we&#39;re emphasising

61
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,140
those words.

62
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,049
So, babies come out ready for language.

63
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,500
They&#39;re already attending to language.

64
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,519
They already like the language they&#39;re going to be speaking.

65
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,579
They&#39;re ready for anything, and we structure the input so they can readily start to pick

66
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:10,489
up language.
