Bowlby believed that if a child failed to form an attachment with a single caregiver

1
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,630
in their early years, it would lead to lifelong problems.

2
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,289
He proposed that there’s a critical period during development.

3
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:24,880
If a particular stimulus has a profound effect, if it comes too early or too late outside

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,159
of the critical period, then it’s not going to work.

5
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:33,450
So, the idea was that the chance to form an attachment is pretty much in the first two

6
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,480
to three years of life, and if it doesn’t happen during that time, it’s never going

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,590
to happen.

8
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,320
And he thought that’s what led to the lifelong problems that were seen in the children from

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,680
the orphanage.

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,820
Now that’s a very strong claim.

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,280
As it turns out, it’s not right.

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,990
One thing we know is that the effects of the extreme deprivation, in the case of monkeys

13
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,430
for instance, can be overcome.

14
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:02,680
Harlow and his lab, as I’ve mentioned, tried all sorts of ways to intervene on behalf of

15
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,429
the isolates, and they basically tried all sorts of monkey therapy (Harlow &amp; Suomi, 1971).

16
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:10,850
It didn’t work to put them with a mate, a receptive mate.

17
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,220
It didn’t work to put them with an older monkey.

18
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,560
Finally, they found out, if you put them with a juvenile that would work.

19
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,380
They came upon this because the female isolates were better at mothering their second time

20
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,380
around.

21
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,619
So, something about their next baby seemed to have awakened some attachment behaviors

22
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:30,619
in them.

23
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:35,259
Harlow and his lab started putting isolates in with juvenile monkeys.

24
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:39,869
So, what happened was the juveniles basically just wouldn’t take no for an answer.

25
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,539
They just kept repeatedly approaching, and finally they broke through.

26
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:49,340
In this case, he’s actually able to physically touch one of the isolates.

27
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,020
Whereas in other cases, they were always so aggressive that no other monkey wanted to

28
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,450
get near them.

29
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,770
Parents in North America and Europe, have adopted many orphans from around the world

30
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,820
as a result of political unrest.

31
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,929
A lot of follow-up studies have been done with these children, and what they find is

32
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:10,200
that it’s not necessarily an easy road (Cohen et al., 2008; Miller &amp; Hendrie, 2000 &amp; Pomerleau

33
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,200
et al., 2005).

34
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,420
Early deprivation does have a profound effect in most cases, but those effects can be overcome,

35
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,720
which means that human beings never lose their capacity to develop love relationships.
