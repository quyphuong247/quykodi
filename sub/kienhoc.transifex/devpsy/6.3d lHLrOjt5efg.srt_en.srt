I started out this topic by pointing out that some of the theories about morality are interested

1
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,760
in what children observe, and the idea that adults, and specifically parents, are the

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,660
most important models for their child’s morality.

3
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,500
Some people tend to discipline children harshly, using physical discipline.

4
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,739
This isn&#39;t an occasional light spank.

5
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:30,099
In the study I&#39;m about to talk about, they qualified harsh physical discipline as three

6
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:33,970
or more times a week and for a variety of transgressions.

7
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,620
So consistent harsh physical discipline.

8
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,410
Some people do that with the idea that it will make kids upstanding moral citizens.

9
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,710
It turns out that disciplining children this way is linked to hostility and aggression

10
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,020
in children.

11
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,930
So kind of like the modeling work we saw for the Bandura Bobo Doll Study.

12
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,330
Kids went on to be hostile and aggressive in other areas of their life.

13
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:02,240
What it did not change was children’s moral development, their moral reasoning.

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,680
This harsh physical discipline mostly teaches children to be hostile and aggressive.

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,710
It doesn&#39;t seem to change the way they reason about morals.

16
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:14,520
The idea that, &quot;If you spare the rod, you spoil the child,&quot; tends not to bear out here,

17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,570
but that doesn&#39;t mean that parents have no influence on the way their children think

18
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,599
about morals, interact with others, or behave in certain moral situations.
