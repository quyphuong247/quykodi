00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:12,361
One of the things that made people reconsider Ainsworth’s very mother-centric theory was

1
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:14,740
when they started doing cross-cultural work.

2
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:20,350
What they found was that if you go to Northern Europe, especially North Germany, Scandinavia,

3
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:26,550
Denmark, places like that, there’s quite a high proportion of anxious avoidant “A”

4
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,550
babies.

5
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:32,759
Here’s a paper published by Grossmann and colleagues in 1980 about the number of children

6
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,220
considered as “secure” in Germany.

7
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,230
It was far fewer than those from the US (Grossman et., 1980).

8
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,410
And this seemed to have been driven by the high proportion of children who were categorised

9
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,430
as anxious avoidant.

10
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:50,320
Now does this mean that all of these mothers in Northern Europe don’t enjoy contact with

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,420
their babies?

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,740
No, that doesn’t seem right.

13
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:59,190
When the researchers, who themselves were from this area, started talking to parents

14
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,309
and delving in, what they found was that the cultural norm there was that if your baby

15
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:10,009
is able to sit up, then they can pretty much be independent, handle things on their own.

16
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:15,210
So, their practice was... once the babies were sitting up, well... just sit them up,

17
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,470
put some toys in front of them, and then leave them alone.

18
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:23,220
The idea was that when they cry, they’re tired and they need to go to bed.

19
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,020
In this context, babies learn…

20
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,570
I’m not going to cry.

21
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,760
If I cry, she’s going to come and put me to bed, so I’m just going to stay cool.

22
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,860
You put them in a strange situation, of course they act anxious avoidant from Mary Ainsworth’s

23
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,860
perspective.

24
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,160
But, it’s just because they are very used to being left alone.

25
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,501
They always know their mother’s going to come back, and they know that if they cry,

26
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:47,550
they might get put to bed, and they don’t want that because they got a whole bunch of

27
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,240
cool new toys to play with.

28
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,740
In a different culture, the Strange Situation test can mean something completely different

29
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,040
again.

30
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,690
This is reinforced when you look at what people discovered in Japan.

31
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:07,130
This is a paper published by Takahashi in 1986, they started administering strange situation

32
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:12,900
tests and found a large proportion––like 32 percent of the babies there––were categorised

33
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,910
as anxious ambivalent “C” babies, while none were categorised as anxious avoidant

34
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,130
(“A”) babies.

35
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,599
What does this mean?

36
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,620
Japanese mothers are all inconsistent?

37
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,620
No.

38
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,640
That can&#39;t be right.

39
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,510
Again, when they delved deeper, it turned out, especially at that time—it may have

40
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,730
changed a bit now, the most common sleeping pattern for the first two years of life was

41
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,370
for a Japanese infant to sleep with his mother.

42
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,010
If you take a baby who spends all of his time with his mother––including sleep time,

43
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,870
and you put him in a strange situation, it’s not just a strange situation for him, it’s

44
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,440
a monumental tragedy like he’s never dealt with before… mum... has... left... the...

45
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,440
room!

46
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,090
Of course, he freaks out.

47
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,360
Of course, he vomits.

48
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:06,240
So, the contexts, the expectations, determine how the strange situation should be interpreted.

49
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,739
Mary Ainsworth put everything as if all mothers were the same and cultural expectations were

50
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:15,210
the same, and that’s simply not the case.

51
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:19,660
Here is a paper published by Rothbaum and colleagues in 2000 stating that countries

52
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:25,300
such as Japan view a mother’s sensitivity towards her child, her competence, and the

53
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:30,800
secure base that she provides for her baby very differently to those viewed by Mary Ainsworth

54
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,489
(Rothbaum et al., 2000).

55
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:36,750
She also neglected the fact that all relationships are a two-way street.

56
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,500
The baby’s characteristics are just as important as the mother’s.

57
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,750
If you have a baby who’s very difficult, who gets easily overstimulated, doesn’t

58
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,870
like face-to-face contact.

59
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,400
What would be the most sensitive thing to do?

60
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
Leave him alone!

61
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,860
Don’t force him into a whole lot of face-to-face contact.

62
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,129
But if Mary Ainsworth’s watching, she might say…

63
00:03:57,129 --> 00:03:59,129
Look, not very much face-to-face contact.

64
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:01,050
That’s not a very sensitive mother.

65
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,160
But, in fact, you might be doing what’s best for the baby.

66
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,060
Now, you might think that these patterns of attachment are only used for classifying baby’s

67
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,420
attachment style and their interactions with their mother.

68
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,900
Patterns of attachment observed during early childhood can stay with us all the way through

69
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,180
our adolescence to adulthood.

70
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,880
So, what’s your attachment style?
