00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,370
Another aspect to theory of mind is this understanding that other people have knowledge that might

1
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,090
differ from your own.

2
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,640
You can test this using the appearance reality task.

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,460
For children under three years of age, they have this understanding that for example a

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,230
Band-Aid box should have Band-Aids inside.

5
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,919
But if they open the Band-Aid box and see that there are markers inside, they completely

6
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:32,230
forget that other people in the world, who haven&#39;t opened this Band-Aid box would not

7
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:33,969
know that there are markers inside.

8
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:39,260
It’s like, if you received a Nike shoebox as a gift, you would expect Nike shoes inside.

9
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,800
But if you opened up the box and there was a chocolate cake inside the box you’d be

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,260
totally surprised, no one would reasonably expect there to be a chocolate cake inside

11
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,940
a Nike shoebox unless they were told about it.

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,789
That’s because as adults we understand that what we know might be different from what

13
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:57,280
other people know.

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,019
Children around four to five years of age have typically developed this kind of knowledge

15
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,280
about what other people know.
