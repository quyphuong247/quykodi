00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:11,631
Kohlberg developed three levels of morality: the Preconventional Morality, Conventional

1
00:00:11,631 --> 00:00:14,620
Morality, and Postconventional Morality.

2
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,590
Within each level, there are two stages.

3
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:21,570
Before the age of nine, there are two stages that children progress through.

4
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,520
Bearing in mind, Kohlberg wasn’t asking infants about morality – these kinds of

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,310
questions are really for children at the upper end of this age range.

6
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,220
In the first stage, children would tend to argue that Joe should give the money to his

7
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,600
dad because if he doesn&#39;t, he&#39;ll get punished.

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,970
This is where children are operating using someone else&#39;s law.

9
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:45,100
They&#39;re being guided by rewards and punishment rather than the morality of the issue.

10
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,410
Their reasoning tends to be egocentric in the sense that they&#39;re mostly worried about

11
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:53,039
what will happen to them, not about the fairness of the situation.

12
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,930
When children hear a story like this one about Joe, children under the age of nine are likely

13
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,010
to be categorized as having a preconventional morality level.

14
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,450
In the first stage, they have an individual perspective on preconventional morality.

15
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,930
They&#39;re focused on concrete tangibles.

16
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,710
Their focus tends to be fairly egocentric.

17
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,920
For stage two, children start to argue, Yes, “Joe shouldn&#39;t give the money because Joe

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,640
can do whatever he wants with his money, and he wants to go to camp.&quot;

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,770
Still egocentric, still worried just about a single person here, Joe, but now, they are

20
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,399
thinking a little bit about fairness and what bigger systems this fits into, that he should

21
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:32,450
be able to do what he wants with his money.

22
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,450
Okay.

23
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,969
Children reach the next level – Kohlberg’s conventional morality level - somewhere between

24
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:39,479
adolescence and adulthood.

25
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,979
And, keep in mind that in Kohlberg levels, the ages he gives are approximate.

26
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,869
There&#39;s no exact age where kids should or should not pass, but they should go through

27
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:50,520
each of these levels in order.

28
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,820
At some point in time, around adolescence, children enter Stage 3, which is the first

29
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,509
stage of this level.

30
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,399
They start to say that “Joe shouldn&#39;t give his father the money because Joe sacrificed

31
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:06,490
and worked hard in good faith to do something his father promised he could do.”

32
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:10,340
At this point, children are beginning to take a social, interpersonal perspective on these

33
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,340
dilemmas.

34
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,750
They are considering Joe&#39;s relationship with his father and how they&#39;re interacting, and

35
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,970
also the idea that hard work should get you something.

36
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,750
Children are starting to consider the perspective of someone who is a contributing member of

37
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,180
society.

38
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,910
By the time children get to stage four, their answers get longer.

39
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:32,020
They say things like, &quot;Joe has the right to refuse to give his father the money because

40
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:37,440
in a general sense, respect for property is important for order in society, and by refusing

41
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,140
to give the money, Joe will be upholding that principle.&quot;

42
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,780
Here, children are reasoning about interpersonal orientations as well as Joe&#39;s interaction

43
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,380
with society as a whole.

44
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,400
They are considering things like what kinds of common rights people have, societal expectations

45
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,590
of possession, and having principles dictate behaviors.
