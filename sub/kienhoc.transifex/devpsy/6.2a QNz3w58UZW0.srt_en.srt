When you’re faced with a moral dilemma, how do you deal with it?

1
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,300
How do you justify your decision?

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,950
Jean Piaget and later Lawrence Kohlberg, were both interested in how children reasoned about

3
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,430
moral dilemmas (Kavathatzopoulos, 1991).

4
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,350
They were particularly interested in the way that children reasoned about dilemmas.

5
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,119
Not the answers to the dilemmas that children gave, but how they reasoned through whether

6
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,359
or not something was moral.

7
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,850
The work of both Piaget and Kohlberg links nicely to what we know about children’s

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,520
cognitive development.

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,570
That&#39;s part of the reason that these are considered to be cognitive theories of moral development.

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,140
Piaget was a stage theorist and he propose stages of moral development.

11
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,780
To decide what stage of moral development children were in, he gave children different

12
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,500
kinds of moral stories.

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,620
Here&#39;s an example of one of them...

14
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:56,610
A little girl, named Marie, broke a cup when she was trying to reach the jam jar whistage

15
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,579
le her mother was out.

16
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:03,149
Marie is not allowed to have jam unless her mother gives it to her.

17
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,890
Another little girl, called Sue, broke 15 cups when she was coming into dinner.

18
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:13,650
Her mother called her and she bumped into the cup tray on her way to the table.

19
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,610
The question here for kids is: Which little girl was naughtier?

20
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,470
Which one would you say?
