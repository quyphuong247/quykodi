My oldest daughter is an adult now.

1
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,420
When she walks in the house, do you know what the first thing she says is?

2
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,420
She says…

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,250
Where’s Mum? and she wants to come and see me, happily.

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,670
It’s a lifelong bond.

5
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,140
How do children develop their first relationship?

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:31,509
This word “attachment” refers to a lifelong affectionate bond that develops between two

7
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:32,940
individuals.

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,570
Little babies develop their first attachment very early, within the first several months

9
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,219
of life.

10
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:43,230
Artists through the centuries have considered babies’ attachment to their mothers to be

11
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,379
a beautiful, sweet thing, and it’s been the topic of many paintings.

12
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:53,100
If you spend time with an eight- or nine-month-old baby, you’ll find that he’s very friendly

13
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,550
up until the point that something happens.

14
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,469
As soon as he gets hungry, or as soon as he gets tired, or as soon as he falls over, who

15
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:01,829
does he want?

16
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:08,020
He wants Mummy—he’s got a very, very clear preference for his mother, as well as a lot

17
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,670
of affection, and a desire for closeness.

18
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:17,229
Now, it’s a very natural thing, but as psychologists, we might ask…

19
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:21,000
Well, why? or, How?

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,670
Why and how do babies come to love their mother so ferociously in the first few months of

21
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,090
life?

22
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:34,130
You might think it would be safer from an evolutionary perspective to sort of love everybody,

23
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:39,130
being indiscriminately friendly in the first few months of life, because you’ve got to

24
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,130
hedge your bets.

25
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,539
You’ve got to get food and all the things that you need to survive, and so maybe you

26
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:50,020
should just be friends with everybody and hope that somebody comes through.

27
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,299
But that’s not the way it works.

28
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:56,859
Babies have a strong, strong affection for their primary caregiver, who’s usually the

29
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:58,750
mother but not always.

30
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,820
They have secondary affections for other people, and these last a lifetime.

31
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:09,229
Now, let me ask you, what do you think the three important things are for an infant to

32
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,510
develop their first relationship with their primary caregiver?
