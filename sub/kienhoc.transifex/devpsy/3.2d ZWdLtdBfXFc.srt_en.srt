00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:12,910
Why do children make overextension errors?––where they call anything that’s round a moon,

1
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:18,180
and underextension errors––where they fail to extend the family pet known as a dog

2
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,789
to other dogs they see?

3
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,489
One view is that children understand that words point to things.

4
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:26,890
They understand how reference works.

5
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:31,279
But they make overextensions because they have such a limited vocabulary, and they just

6
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,060
want to get in the game.

7
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,360
Even though they know that moon only refers to that thing in the sky at night, they want

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,620
to be able to talk about the cricket ball, the light bulb, and the circle, so they overextend

9
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,989
the word moon, as a placeholder until they actually learn the words for those things.

10
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:53,680
Now, that&#39;s a nice explanation, but it doesn&#39;t explain underextensions.

11
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,210
The other view is that, up until about 18 months, when children have learned around

12
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:03,809
50 to 75 words, they don&#39;t actually understand how language works.

13
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:09,310
They don&#39;t yet understand that words refer to individual things.

14
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,070
So, they haven&#39;t really worked out the problem of reference.

15
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,799
They make these overextension and underextension errors because they&#39;re still working out exactly

16
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:21,210
how the whole thing is supposed to be managed.

17
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:27,420
From around 18 to around 24 months, when they&#39;ve got a critical mass of beyond 50 to 75 words

18
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,090
in their vocabularies, then it makes sense to them.

19
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:36,790
Now, that view is supported by the fact that, at around the same time that they stop making

20
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,149
overextension and underextension errors, they go through this thing known as the naming

21
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:43,180
explosion (Goldfield &amp; Reznick, 1996; Bloom &amp; Markson, 1998).

22
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,590
This is where basically, they just go crazy and start picking up around nine words a day,

23
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,119
which is an awful lot of language learning.

24
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,549
Babies at this age, like to play this game.

25
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:54,549
Infant speaking: “What’s that?”

26
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:55,549
Adult speaking: “That’s a tool.”

27
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:56,549
Infant speaking: “What’s that?”

28
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,549
Adult speaking: “That’s a tape measure”.

29
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:00,119
Infant speaking: “What’s that?”

30
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,850
Adult speaking: “That’s a big expanding ball.”

31
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,600
They’ll play, and play, and play the &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; game as though they&#39;ve worked it out.

32
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,720
Look, everything has a name here.

33
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,300
I&#39;m just going to get my mum to tell me all of them.

34
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,930
That&#39;s a possibility.

35
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,430
That’s a nurture view, as you might imagine.

36
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,370
The child has learned how language works, solves the problem of reference to a certain

37
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,819
extent, terms of…

38
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:24,819
Okay.

39
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:30,591
I just have to work out what the word refers to in all these cases, then they just go on

40
00:02:30,591 --> 00:02:34,819
about their business once they get to that point of learning.

41
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:39,849
The alternative view though, is that this explosion of learning nine words a day from

42
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:45,459
the time you&#39;re 18-months old to six-years old has just got to be biologically based.

43
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:50,739
It&#39;s just such a phenomenal growth rate that at 18 months, maybe there&#39;s just something

44
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:55,900
happening in the brain that turns their mind into sponges, and they start learning language

45
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,879
as a result of that.

46
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:02,910
There&#39;s still a fair bit of debate about which is the correct answer, what&#39;s the best model

47
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,830
for understanding the naming explosion.

48
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:11,961
Now, by the time children are around six-years old, most have somewhere between 12,000 and

49
00:03:11,961 --> 00:03:14,909
14,000 words in their vocabulary.

50
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:18,010
As adults, we have about 25,000 words in ours.

51
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,160
So, at 18 months, we&#39;ve got a naming explosion.

52
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,280
Children go from a slow build-up of 50 to 75 words to nine words a day, playing the

53
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,760
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; game.

54
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,659
And also, they start combining words.

55
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:35,260
Now, this changes things completely.

56
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,579
You go from just pointing and naming to putting words together.

57
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:42,480
This gives you a tremendous amount of power.

58
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,810
It&#39;s striking that children make very few word order errors.

59
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,480
Word order is grammar, basically.

60
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,900
They make very, very few errors.

61
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,330
From the beginning, they know the difference between, &quot;Teddy eat,&quot; and, &quot;Eat teddy.&quot;

62
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:03,469
&quot;Teddy, eat,&quot; means we sit Teddy in a high chair, and we feed them with a spoon.

63
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:08,000
&quot;Eat Teddy,&quot; means we put him on a carving board and we cut him up.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,079
Children don’t mix those two things up.

65
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:12,909
They know from very early on.

66
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:18,500
This is sometimes known as telegraphic speech, this two and three-word stage.

67
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,940
Then shortly after that, basically, kind of all hell breaks loose and children just start

68
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,039
talking constantly.
