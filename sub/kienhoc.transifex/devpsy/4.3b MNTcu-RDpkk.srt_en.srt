00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,650
When you give adolescents cars, you sometimes end up with something like this.

1
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,790
Adolescents account for something like 36 percent of vehicle accidents even though they

2
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,369
make up less than 20 percent of all drivers on the road.

3
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:23,840
This is part of the reason why insurance companies charge adolescents a lot of money to insure

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,680
their cars, because adolescents have a tendency to wreck their cars.

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,380
There are other examples of adolescent judgment problems.

6
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,430
We have seen headlines like this many times…

7
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:38,470
“Teenage hosts of Facebook-organised party turned riot…”

8
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:43,500
Basically, teenagers throwing a party while their parents are away, and hundreds of people

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,610
show up unexpectedly.

10
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,350
The party gets out of hand.

11
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,500
People throw bricks through walls, and knock over mailboxes, causing hundreds and thousands

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,329
of dollars in damage to the parents’ house.

13
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,670
Again, more examples where adolescents are maybe having some trouble with decision making.More

14
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,399
trouble with decision making.

15
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,690
This is called tombstoning.

16
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,580
That is a hundred-foot drop into water nobody knows the depth of.

17
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,100
But it’s really impressive.

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,450
This is off the fort at the Portsmouth Harbour, in England.

19
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,329
What’s interesting is that, there are some traditional societies where cliff diving like

20
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:23,360
this is actually a rite of passage for adolescent boys that’s built into the culture.

21
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,649
It turns out that boys in England have found this traditional rite of passage all on their

22
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:29,310
own.

23
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,890
And I have to say that cliff diving was common where I grew up too, but every year someone

24
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,859
– almost always an adolescent - was airlifted out of the river as a result.

25
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:43,079
This is incredibly dangerous, but adolescents still tend to do it.

26
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,380
This is part of that sensation-seeking, and the reward of having all your friends think

27
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,399
you’re amazing.

28
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:51,509
Other issues of adolescent risk-taking.

29
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,359
How many of you knew that you can ingest vodka through your eyeball?

30
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,079
It’s possible, but don’t do that.

31
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:03,270
The alcohol can cross the blood brain barrier through the eye really fast.

32
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,830
It’s also really bad for you, you can lose your eye, you can ingest the alcohol so fast

33
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,830
that you can die.

34
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,629
Adolescents do these sorts of things that are possible but not really advisable, and

35
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:19,180
it’s not something you see adults doing generally.

36
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,980
Other things you don’t see adults doing… beer bongs.

37
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,049
I haven’t seen a beer bong in a party for a good number of years.

38
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:31,439
Things like beer pong, flip cup and other drinking games all encourage lots of drinking,

39
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,290
but risky kinds of drinking, particularly rapid binge drinking.

40
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,239
Those sorts of things where you can ingest so much that it will hurt your body, or kill

41
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,989
you before you know it’s happened.

42
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:46,720
Those are the kinds of risk taking behaviors that seem to appear only in adolescents.

43
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,569
This is not something that you see adults doing.

44
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:53,430
So why do we really see only adolescents doing these crazy things?
