00:00:06,819 --> 00:00:10,690
For most children, their ability to grasp theory of mind happens between three and six

1
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,900
years of age.

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,929
However, one population of children that really seem to struggle with developing theory of

3
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,210
mind is those who have the Autism spectrum disorder.

4
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,789
Autism is characterised by deficits in social abilities.

5
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:27,430
Children who have autism might be reluctant to make eye contact with people who are trying

6
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:32,050
to engage with them, or they might not want to engage in social contact at all.

7
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:36,420
These children might play by themselves while other children engage with one another.

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,329
Researchers have theorised that, perhaps, their deficits in social abilities stem from

9
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:44,050
their struggles with having a theory of mind.

10
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,649
This was first tested in 1985 by Simon Baron-Cohen and his colleagues.

11
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:53,860
They tested three groups of children, indicated here on the x axis: children with autism,

12
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,620
children with Down Syndrome––those experiencing different cognitive difficulties than those

13
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,699
with autism, and then typically developing four year old children.

14
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:05,930
On the y axis, we have the percentage of correct judgements in the false belief test.

15
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:11,130
What they found was that, around 85% of the typically developing four-year-olds and children

16
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,370
with Down Syndrome developed the ability to pass the false belief test––based on the

17
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,080
Sally-Anne test.

18
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,080
These children had no problem passing the false belief test.

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,229
They were able to develop a theory of mind.

20
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:29,689
In contrast, children with autism, only around 20% of them were able to pass this test.

21
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:33,420
Something that seems to come really naturally for us with time.

22
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,880
By the time we’re six, most of us typically have theory of mind, children with autism

23
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,310
really seem to struggle with this.

24
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,680
Researchers have suggested, this might be the origin of their deficits in social abilities.
