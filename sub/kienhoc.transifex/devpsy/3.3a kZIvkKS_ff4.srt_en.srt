00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:11,849
So, there are really two views about language learning that will be familiar to you.

1
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:14,719
One is that language is innate.

2
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,380
Our capacity to learn and use language is coded into our genes, which manifest in our

3
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,250
brain that is perfectly designed to acquire and use language.

4
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,480
Things like the overregularisation process support that argument.

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,020
Things go on endogenously in language acquisition that suggest that there&#39;s a proclivity in

6
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,520
human development to acquire language and to develop this complex system for communication.

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,640
So, that&#39;s the nature view.

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,739
It&#39;s attributed to Noam Chomsky in the 1960s, a psycholinguist at MIT.

9
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:57,460
Prior to that, people really strongly believed that language, like everything else, was learned.

10
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,850
The preferred view was that language word-learning was a process of association, as we&#39;ve already

11
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,980
talked about (Tomasello, Strosberg &amp; Akhtar, 1996).

12
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:10,040
Producing grammatical utterances was a process of social learning, that is imitating what

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:16,160
other people say and then being rewarded or punished, and thereby shaped as you produce

14
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,730
these imitative utterances.

15
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,040
It&#39;s not explicit reward and punishment.

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,140
If you say the utterance grammatically correctly, everybody understands, and that&#39;s a reward.

17
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:31,280
If you don&#39;t say it grammatically correctly, people don&#39;t understand, or they misunderstand,

18
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,310
or maybe they correct you, and that&#39;s a subtle punishment (Skinner, 1953).

19
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:42,090
The nurture view is that these learning mechanisms, these general learning mechanisms of association,

20
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,190
imitation, and shaping are powerful enough to get us to learn language.

21
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:54,060
Whereas, Chomsky, and people who have followed him since the 1960s argued that, no, language

22
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,460
acquisition is too complicated to occur through those simple mechanisms.
