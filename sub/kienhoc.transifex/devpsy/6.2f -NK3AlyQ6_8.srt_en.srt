00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,790
Kohlberg has two more stages, they are the Postconventional Morality level, but not everyone

1
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,719
reaches these stages.

2
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:18,100
These are a minority of adults who reason about morality in this way.

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,320
For Kohlberg, these stages represent universal kinds of morals.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,090
The kinds of morals that would apply to everyone regardless of their culture.

5
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,720
He calls it a prior-to-society perspective.

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,960
In Stage 5 reasoning, &quot;Joe has the right to refuse to give up the money because each person

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,789
as a free individual is entitled to enjoy the use of property as long as it does not

8
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,920
infringe upon the like rights of others.&quot;

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,010
Here, we&#39;re talking about what people would argue to be a basic fundamental human right,

10
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,280
and that this fundamental right would be true no matter where you go on the planet.

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,149
Then, stage six is the kind of morality that you might associate with Gandhi, or the Dalai

12
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:59,640
Lama, or Mother Theresa.

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,059
This would be morality based on your own personal conscience.

14
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,770
Not your social contract, not societal expectations, but because you think that it&#39;s the right

15
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,890
thing to do.

16
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,960
These stages for Kohlberg are linear.

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,510
You start in one and you go through to the others.

18
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:18,790
But, just because you’ve passed out of a stage doesn’t mean you no longer have access

19
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,720
to that type of reasoning.

20
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,600
You can reason about morality using phrases and ideas from multiple stages.

21
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,850
When you categorise people into Kohlberg&#39;s stages, you see changes across ages.

22
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:37,720
In this graph, on the x axis, we have age ranging from 10 years to 36.

23
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,920
On the y axis, we have the percentage of people falling into each stage of moral reasoning––based

24
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,210
on the kinds of moral reasoning they give in response to the dilemmas.

25
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:54,280
And the different colours refer to Kohlberg&#39;s stages one, two, three, four, and five.

26
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,800
You can see, when people are young, they start out in these blue stages - stage one and stage

27
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,800
two.

28
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,300
They have egocentric kinds of reasoning about morality.

29
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:09,500
As they enter adolescence, those kinds of rationale start to decrease.

30
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:14,671
Through Adolescence, people start to rely more on stage three kinds of reasoning, so

31
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:19,849
interpersonal reasoning, and what is due to you as a contributor to society.

32
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:24,670
Right around 18 or so, is when you start to see this marked increase in stage four, which

33
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:30,329
is the kind of perspective adults reason from, which involves considering common human rights

34
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:33,609
and understanding their own place in society.

35
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:38,549
Although the stage three reasoning continues to be commonly used in adulthood.

36
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:42,770
You can see that the percentage of people categorized into stage five does increase

37
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,599
a little bit in adulthood, but it&#39;s not a huge portion of the population.

38
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:51,840
What we can take away from this graph is that, there is a developmental trend in how children

39
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,540
and adolescents reason about morality.

40
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,290
They start out thinking egocentrically, and as they get older, they start to think about

41
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,249
principles and society as a whole.
