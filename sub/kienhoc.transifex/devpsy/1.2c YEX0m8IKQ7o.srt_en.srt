00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,210
Another experimental technique that makes use of baby’s ability to follow visual stimuli

1
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,469
is called preferential looking.

2
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,630
So, this is a super simple technique and I’m going to tell you about some studies that

3
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,029
were published back in the early 1960s.

4
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,109
This work was published by Robert Fantz some of it in Science.

5
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,839
This was the first time that anyone had done a study like this (Fantz, 1963).

6
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:34,750
Fantz reasoned well, let’s measure how long babies attend to different visual stimuli.

7
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:40,660
So, he got babies ranging in age from only 10 hours old to six months old.

8
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,240
And he laid them down on his table.

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,400
Then he put this thing over their heads called a looking box and he just slid pictures into

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,400
it.

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,710
So, the pictures were just the right distance for the babies to see clearly, and then Fantz

12
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,640
measured how long did they stare before they start to squirm and get bored.

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
He thought…

14
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,980
Okay, if they look away for more than two seconds, then they probably don’t want to

15
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,750
see this picture anymore.

16
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,189
And then he simply measured how long they looked at different pictures.

17
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:13,909
Now, on the left here (graph), we have the stimuli that were presented to the babies.

18
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:19,460
And on the bottom line, we have the mean percentage of fixation time, the higher the value the

19
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,060
longer the baby was looking at that picture.

20
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,120
The blue bars were data collected from babies under 48 hours old.

21
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,549
The green bars were data collected from babies between two and five days old.

22
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,930
And the yellow bars were the data collected from babies between two to six months old.

23
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:42,659
And we can see that babies prefer black and white faces, they don’t mind looking at

24
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,030
the bull’s eye, and they like yellow and red.

25
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,970
Now, this was revolutionary data for people.

26
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,499
These days, we kind of take it for granted because this information has seeped into popular

27
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:55,499
culture.

28
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:59,999
The fact that babies like faces… and that they like high-contrast patterns… and that

29
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:02,280
if they have a choice, they prefer red.

30
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,369
But people didn’t know this before and it had a profound impact.

31
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:08,119
For one thing it made people realise..

32
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,509
Wow!

33
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:11,030
Babies actually care.

34
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,819
They care what their environment looks like.

35
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:15,540
They’d rather see one thing as opposed to another.

36
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,660
Who would have thought?

37
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,459
And then it also made them re-think…

38
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:21,770
How should we stimulate babies?

39
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,440
Prior to this kind of research, babies’ rooms were all pink and blue with cute little

40
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,860
bunnies and duckies and stuff like that.

41
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,140
Everything was pastel colours.

42
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,740
But then these experiments demonstrated…

43
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:40,340
Actually, if you want to make the baby interested, give him a black and white face, or a bulls-eye.

44
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,200
And if you want to put colour in there, make it red.

45
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,340
Forget the pastels.

46
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,720
And so that spawned this whole industry in baby stimulation products which is still going

47
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,290
very strong today.

48
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:56,290
If you go to the toy section of a major department store, there’s this whole section of baby

49
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:03,620
stimulation: mobiles, wall paintings, things like that, and most of it is on these principles,

50
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,819
high contrast faces with splashes of red.

51
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:12,590
Let’s say you use the even more modern preference technique, where you lay the baby down and

52
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,569
you show two things at one time.

53
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:19,719
Now, you’re basically making them make a head-to-head choice, so that way you don’t

54
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:22,910
have fatigue effects or anything like that to deal with.

55
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:28,659
Let’s say you want to know, do babies like male faces or female faces better?

56
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:33,180
So, you put a male face and a female face together head-to-head.

57
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,709
Now, what happens if the baby looks equally at both of them?

58
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:41,319
Well, we don’t know how to interpret that.

59
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:45,840
It could be that they like them both equally and they can also tell the difference between

60
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,109
the two.

61
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:52,150
Or it could be that they just can’t tell the difference between male and female faces.

62
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,030
They both just look like faces and they like faces.

63
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,489
So, we cannot answer the question…

64
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:03,000
Can they discriminate male and female faces with these sort of preference data?

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,110
That’s where we move to habituation.
