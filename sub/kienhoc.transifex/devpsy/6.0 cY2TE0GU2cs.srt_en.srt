00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:11,000
Now, how many of you would say that you operate on some sort of moral basis?

1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,760
Most of us have a strong sense of what is right and wrong and what our moral codes are.

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,269
These are the kinds of things that we think carefully about, we have very strong opinions

3
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:23,899
about, and we’re reluctant to change our opinions on our own moral codes.

4
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:27,460
We&#39;re going to start talking about how children go from being babies with not much sense of

5
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,789
morality to adults who have a very strong sense of morality.

6
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:35,610
A little while ago, a couple of teenagers decided that they were going to do the world

7
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,610
a service by filming themselves going into Apple Stores and proving that you can in fact

8
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,100
bend the new iPhone.

9
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:47,560
They ended up breaking about 4,000 dollars&#39; worth of the Apple Stores&#39; iPhones.

10
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,920
Then, they posted it on YouTube, which might be where they really went wrong.

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,310
Rather than providing the world some sort of service showing that these things bend,

12
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,510
they just ended up getting arrested.

13
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:03,370
And afterwards, they were unrepentant blaming the whole situation on Apple, saying “We

14
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,920
were in the Apple store bending and breaking their IPhone which is like criminal damage

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,249
I guess, I don’t really care to be honest because it’s Apple’s fault”.

16
00:01:12,249 --> 00:01:15,920
That is what an immature moral code might look like.

17
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,060
Moral development is a really long path.

18
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,159
Everybody has to, at some point in time in their life, figure out right from wrong.

19
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,479
There are all sorts of moral issues and these issues often involve a logical as well as

20
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:28,520
an emotional component.

21
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,170
There are often no right answers to lot of these things.

22
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,780
They&#39;re difficult questions.

23
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,780
Things like…

24
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,950
&quot;Is it okay to kill people who want to die?&quot;

25
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,009
I know that’s a debate in most places around the world.

26
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:43,000
 This is a debate that&#39;s going on in the States right now.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,310
Is it okay to kill people who are a menace to society?

28
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,569
So, this shapes people&#39;s views on the death penalty.

29
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:52,509
Is it okay to take from the rich and give to the poor?

30
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:55,319
This question will sometimes manifest in terms of theft.

31
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:01,509
Sometimes, it manifests in terms of discussions of legislations or taxes or even religion.

32
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:05,749
These kinds of issues appear everywhere, and It takes a while for children to figure out

33
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:07,499
how to reason about these issues.

34
00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:10,240
There are many theories of moral development.

35
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,140
But I’ll just talk about two of them today.

36
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,110
One is the social learning theory, the other one is a more cognitive theory.

37
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,890
We&#39;ll go through both of these, but let’s start with the social learning theory first.
