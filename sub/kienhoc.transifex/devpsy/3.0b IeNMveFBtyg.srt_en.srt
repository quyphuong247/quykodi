Language is something that is intrinsic to human beings, to our mind, to our culture.

1
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,460
It&#39;s our mode of communication.

2
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,610
As I say, it doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t other ways to communicate—there are—but language

3
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,580
is the way we do it and language is special.

4
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,430
Let me introduce this very special gorilla here, named Koko.

5
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:33,230
She’s been trained for the last 40 years by a developmental psychologist, named Penny

6
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,760
Patterson, to use American sign language.

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:43,380
Now, Koko has impressive proficiency for a non-human, but even after 40 years of intensive

8
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:49,560
training, she can&#39;t do anything close to what a normal three-year-old human being can do.

9
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,540
Koko has really only learned to sign for single words, and then she joins the single words

10
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,220
together to express her feelings and needs.

11
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:05,080
Word segments like “Koko love”, ‘Food Koko”, “Broke bad”, “Hungry bad”,

12
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,590
“Good this”.

13
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:12,600
Koko hasn’t been able to use her sign to form any more complex sentences than this

14
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,380
even after forty years of training.Now, oftentimes, people will be very sentimental about Koko

15
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,530
and other non-human primates and say...

16
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,790
Well they would have language if they had the right larynx for it, or if they were raised

17
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,290
in human culture.

18
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,450
If they had the right this or the right that.

19
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,820
But, there is, unfortunately, no evidence that that&#39;s the case.

20
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:38,730
You can teach animals to communicate with humans, but no non-human animal has anything

21
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:42,250
like the complex language system that we have.

22
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,859
It&#39;s special to humans.
