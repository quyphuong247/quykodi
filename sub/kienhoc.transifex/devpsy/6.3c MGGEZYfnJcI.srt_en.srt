00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,040
Now, do children understand morality versus social conventions?

1
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,510
Well, here&#39;s an interview with a four-year-old girl about a moral issue.

2
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,359
She has seen someone hit another boy.

3
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:20,170
The experimenter asks her, &quot;Did you see what happened?&quot;

4
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,640
She says, &quot;Yes, they were playing and John hit him too hard.&quot;

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,399
The experimenter says, &quot;Is that something you&#39;re supposed to do or not supposed to do?&quot;

6
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,390
She says, &quot;Not so hard to hurt.&quot;

7
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,020
The experimenter says, &quot;Is there a rule about that?&quot;

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,480
She says, &quot;Yes.&quot;

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,500
The experimenter says, &quot;What is the rule?&quot;

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,360
She says, &quot;You&#39;re not to hit hard.&quot;

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,250
The experimenter says, &quot;What if there was no rule about hitting hard?

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,160
Would it be all right to do it then?&quot;

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,560
She says, &quot;No.&quot;

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,880
The experimenter says, &quot;Why not?&quot;

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,510
She says, &quot;Because he could get hurt and start to cry.&quot;

16
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:57,230
Here, the four-year-old girl is understanding that even in the absence of a rule like &quot;You

17
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,610
can&#39;t hit people,&quot; it&#39;s still not okay to hit people.

18
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,530
She has a sense of morality.

19
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:08,689
She can operate in a way that we would consider moral even in the absence of a specific rule.

20
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:13,009
In terms of a conventional issue, the four-year-old girl watched another child who got in trouble

21
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:14,009
for being noisy.

22
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:17,590
The experimenter says, &quot;Did you see what happened?&quot;

23
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,799
She says, &quot;Yes, they were noisy.&quot;

24
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,289
The experimenter says, &quot;Is that something you&#39;re supposed to do or not supposed to do?&quot;

25
00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:25,679
She says, &quot;Not do.&quot;

26
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:27,819
The experimenter says, &quot;Is there a rule about that?&quot;

27
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:30,749
She says, &quot;Yes, we have to be quiet.&quot;

28
00:01:30,749 --> 00:01:35,479
The experimenter says, &quot;What if there were no rule, will it be all right to do then?&quot;

29
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,549
She says, &quot;Yes.&quot;

30
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:38,729
The experimenter says, &quot;Why?&quot;

31
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,179
She says, &quot;Because there is no rule.&quot;

32
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:45,229
Here she is separating out moral issues from social conventional issues.

33
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:49,340
If you take away the rule for a social convention, it&#39;s okay to do.

34
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,009
If you take away the rule for a moral issue, it is still not okay to do.

35
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:58,209
So, even at the age of four, children are starting to separate this kind of stuff out.

36
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:01,909
They&#39;re understanding that some things should never be done and some things are okay to

37
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:04,249
be done if there&#39;s no rule against it.

38
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:09,420
And, of course, that four-year-olds are able to do this contradicts the work of both Piaget

39
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,360
and Kohlberg.
