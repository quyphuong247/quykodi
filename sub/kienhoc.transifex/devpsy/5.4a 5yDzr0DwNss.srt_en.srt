00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,890
Think about a friend you have.

1
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,250
I bet you would understand - on the whole - when your friend will be happy about something

2
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,480
or when they will be upset.

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,020
How do we see this?

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,480
When children are around 4 years of age, they develop this thing that is fundamental to

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,100
us as human beings.

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,029
It&#39;s called theory of mind.

7
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:27,970
Theory of mind is the ability to understand other people&#39;s mental states and to use that

8
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,939
ability to predict subsequent behaviour.

9
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:34,870
This is also known as mindreading or mentalising.

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,210
As we’ve talked about some of them earlier, mental states are things like desire… like

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,340
&quot;I want,&quot; Perception, like...

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,910
 &quot;I see.&quot; or things about thoughts like...

13
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:44,910
&quot;I think.

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,910
I know.&quot;

15
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,030
Also, beliefs like...

16
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,030
&quot;I believe…&quot;

17
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,010
These are all mental states.

18
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,280
Once again, they&#39;re very abstract.

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,329
That&#39;s why it takes children a few years, until they&#39;re around four or five years of

20
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:58,789
age, to really grasp the concept of mental state.

21
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:04,040
How do we know that children around 3 to 4 years of age are starting to develop the concept

22
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,320
of theory of mind, or the understanding that other people&#39;s mental states might be different

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,320
from their own?

24
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,570
One way we know is through their language.

25
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,409
Around three years of age and onwards, that&#39;s when they really start to use contrastives.

26
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:22,340
Contrastives refers to making statements that contrast each other.

27
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,500
This little girl might say something like, &quot;I love princesses, but my brother doesn&#39;t

28
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,630
love them.&quot;

29
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,860
This kind of language really suggests that children might be having quite a robust sense

30
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,500
of self that is different from other people.
