Around 18 months is also around the time when infants show some sharing behaviour.

1
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,930
Experiments investigating children’s sharing behaviour typically set up a situation where

2
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:22,360
the experimenter only has one toy block, and the child has many, so we can see if the child

3
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,430
is willing to share with the experimenter.

4
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:29,460
Children start to develop sharing behaviour at around 18 months, and this development

5
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,000
continues throughout their life.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,640
When children are in a situation where they have more toys than the experimenter, it seems

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,620
that, at the very beginning, sharing behaviour is not spontaneous for them.

8
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,579
The experimenter needs to say things like…

9
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:45,260
&quot;I only have one block.

10
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,110
Can you share with me?&quot;

11
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,190
Children at around 18 months of age really need explicit cues at the beginning to prompt

12
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,450
them to share.

13
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:57,590
At around three and a half to four years of age, children start to spontaneously share

14
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,460
without being prompted.

15
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,050
If children at around this age can hear the experimenter say something like...

16
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:08,090
“Oh!”, and see that they only have one block, they might spontaneously share their

17
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,680
blocks with the experimenter.
