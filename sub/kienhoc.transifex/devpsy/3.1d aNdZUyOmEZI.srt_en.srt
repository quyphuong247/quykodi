00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:11,820
Now, one of the most important things that all babies do, whatever language they&#39;re learning,

1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,099
is point like this.

2
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,500
And only humans do this spontaneously.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,710
You can teach dogs to point.

4
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,190
You can teach non-human primates to point.

5
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:28,099
And there&#39;s a few reports that non-human primates will point spontaneously in certain circumstances,

6
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:30,160
but these are only captive ones (Fouts, Hirsch, &amp; Fouts, 1982; Savage- Rumbaugh, McDonald,

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,160
Sevcik, Hopkins, &amp; Rubert, 1986, Miles, 1990 shown).

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,010
Pointing like this has not been observed in non-human primates in their natural habitats

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,010
(Goodall, 1986; Leavens &amp; Hopkins, 1999).

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,430
It&#39;s never been seen in the wild.

11
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:42,149
So, you can point to get somebody to bring you something, or you can do it like this

12
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:48,590
child and point to show somebody something, to share an experience, to point out something

13
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,399
in the world.

14
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,699
That&#39;s the one that&#39;s important.

15
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:57,039
That&#39;s the one that you certainly don&#39;t see spontaneously in any other species.

16
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,359
It just precedes the infant&#39;s first word because effectively, it&#39;s the same thing.

17
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,330
When I say bottle, and I point to the bottle, I&#39;m doing the same thing, in one case with

18
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,250
my index finger, and in another case with my vocalisation.

19
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,350
I&#39;m drawing your attention to something in the world.

20
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:22,830
So, bottle is the referent of my point or the word that I used.

21
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:28,082
It seems that once babies start realising that they can point at things, then they do

22
00:01:28,082 --> 00:01:31,290
it both with their finger and with language.
