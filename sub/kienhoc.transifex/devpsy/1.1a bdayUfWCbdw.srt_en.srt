What can babies see?

1
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,850
What sounds do they like to listen to?

2
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,290
Can they taste the food we feed them?

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,900
Is touch important to them?

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,980
What can they smell?

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,210
Do babies experience these senses the way we experience them?

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,779
I’m going to review what we know about babies

7
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:30,100
sense capacities at birth and in the first few months of life.

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:36,851
Then I’ll talk about their reflexes, a little bit about their emotional expressions, and

9
00:00:36,851 --> 00:00:38,100
temperament.

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:46,340
Let’s talk about baby&#39;s sense capacities at birth…five senses: vision, hearing, taste,

11
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,460
touch, and smell.

12
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,270
We’re a strongly visual species.

13
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,390
Our eyes are actually—outgrowth from our brain.

14
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,980
Specialised nervous tissue to capture light.

15
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:05,140
And we have a tremendous amount of brain space devoted to processing visual information.

16
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,810
Now, what do we know about babies vision?

17
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:13,869
Well, if you look at a one-week old baby, it doesn’t look like he’s focusing on

18
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:16,030
much of anything, right?

19
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:21,079
His eyes are sort of moving all over the place and as a matter of fact, babies have really

20
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:26,210
very poor vision; it’s about 20/500 at birth.

21
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,689
If we take a look at the chart that the world health organisation uses for classifying visual

22
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:35,830
impairment, 20/30 to 20/60 is considered near normal vision.

23
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:41,830
20/500 is considered profound visual impairment, which is what the baby’s vision is when

24
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,590
he’s born.

25
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,100
If we take a look at an eye chart, this is what someone with perfect 20/20 vision is

26
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,900
able to see.

27
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,819
And this is what someone with 20/200 is able to see.

28
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:58,359
And baby’s vision is about 20/500 at birth.

29
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:03,689
Through these lenses, this is what the world looks like to a new-born baby.

30
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,539
Not very clear.

31
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:09,190
Their vision improves rapidly over the first eight months of age.

32
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:14,950
But at birth, they really can’t see very well except at a specific focal distance.

33
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,819
So, their eyes differ from ours in that they can’t adjust their focus.

34
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:21,300
Whereas, we can.

35
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,110
We have a flexible lens made of cartilage, which is just behind the cornea of our eye.

36
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:31,459
It’s surrounded by muscles and, involuntarily, we move those muscles to focus, either close-up

37
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:32,459
or far-away.

38
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,250
That’s changing the shape of the lens.

39
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,310
But babies’ lenses don’t change shape.

40
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,180
They’re fixed like a magnifying glass.

41
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,750
So, you have to be at exactly the right distance in order for them to see clearly.

42
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,330
But if you are at that distance, they can see you perfectly clearly.

43
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:56,230
As it happens, nature has equipped them with a very handy focal distance of about 20cm.

44
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:01,379
So, that when they’re in the arms of their caregiver —which is where they spend an

45
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:06,760
awful lot of their time in the first six months before they can locomote—they can see perfectly

46
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,670
their caregiver’s face.

47
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,360
So, they aren’t inborn with total visual capacity.

48
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,000
But they are inborn with a visual capacity that ideally suits them for the immediate

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,209
task at hand, which is to form a bond with a caregiver who’s going to protect them,

50
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:25,370
feed them, and keep them alive.

51
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:30,240
By eight months of age, they’ve got adult vision and that includes depth perception,

52
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,579
being able to integrate the input from the two eyes.

53
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:37,300
Now that’s important when you’re crawling because when you’re locomoting, you have

54
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,879
to be able to judge depth.

55
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:44,670
Adult vision comes online just around the time babies need it the most—when they can

56
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,750
move on their own.
