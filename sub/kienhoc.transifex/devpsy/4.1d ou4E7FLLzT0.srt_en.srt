00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,190
Boys and girls deal with many pubertal changes, and both groups have to deal with all of these

1
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,670
things at the same time.

2
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:16,560
But, if you ask them what they would like to change about themselves, you get some interesting

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,190
responses.

4
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,170
If you ask adolescent boys, what they would like to change about themselves, about 47

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,400
percent (47%) say they’d like to change their scholastic ability or their achievements.

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,539
And 23 percent (23%) say they would like to change their personality or something related

7
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:33,180
to that.

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,460
And 14 percent (14%) say they’d like to change their physical appearance.

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,560
And then the rest of the survey rounds out with hobbies, sports abilities, and those

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,930
who said nothing.

11
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,660
On the other hand, if you ask girls, you get a slightly different pattern.

12
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,411
If you ask girls what they would most like to change about themselves, 39 percent (39%)

13
00:00:50,411 --> 00:00:56,390
say their personality, 27 percent (27%) say their scholastic ability, and about 24 percent

14
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,580
(24%) say that they would like to change their physical appearance.

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,400
And the rest of the survey rounds out with hobbies, sports abilities, and those who said

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,220
nothing.

17
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,820
A desire to change one’s scholastic ability, personality, and physical appearance are the

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,759
same three major things that boys would like to change but slightly re-ordered.

19
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:17,119
If you look at this data you might think that adolescents are surprisingly happy with their

20
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,509
bodies.

21
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,719
Seventy-six percent (76%) of girls did not say that their physical appearance is the

22
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:27,560
thing they’d most like to change, and boys certainly seem to be happy with their bodies.

23
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,650
But to better measure body satisfaction, you can show adolescents a scale like this (image

24
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,100
displaying different illustrated body shapes of both boys and girls)—this is the way

25
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,810
that people measure body dissatisfaction and things like body dysmorphic disorder.

26
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,270
What happens is you give boys this scale (same image with different boys’ body shapes),

27
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,530
and give girls this scale (same image with different girls’ body shapes).

28
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,490
Then, you ask them...

29
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,500
Which is you?

30
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,409
After that, you ask…

31
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,509
Which would you like to be?
