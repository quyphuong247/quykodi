00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,960
For girls who go through puberty early, the immediate consequences are that they tend

1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,500
to have greater independence, and they tend to be very popular with the boys.

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,470
We all know that puberty is not just the onset of height, for girls, they grow breasts, hips,

3
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,590
and all sort of things like that.

4
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,119
These girls also tend to start getting poorer marks in school, with some increased delinquency

5
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:27,359
too.

6
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,540
These girls tend to have earlier sexual experiences, and kind of like the boys, more substance

7
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,040
use, more depression, and more body image issues (Simmons, Blythe &amp; McKinney, 1983).

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,750
On the other side of things, girls who go through puberty late, maintain their good

9
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,270
marks in school, so they donâ€™t seem to have that issue.

10
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,780
They start dating later, possibly because theyâ€™re not as popular with the boys.

11
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,930
So, those are the immediate consequences that children experience in the moment.

12
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:58,449
As adults, girls who go through puberty early tend to have difficult social relationships,

13
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:00,989
and lower levels of education completed.

14
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:03,710
These girls tend to drop out of school earlier.

15
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,090
And they tend to have more mental health issues and substance use issues.

16
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,829
Again, some of this may have to do with where they were in the social hierarchy in high

17
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:16,119
school, and if they carry those skills to the adult world, the adult world will kick

18
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:18,130
them out.

19
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:22,460
For girls who go through puberty late, one of the major consequences is that they complete

20
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,460
higher levels of education.

21
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,270
They maintain good marks in high school, and then continue to do well academically later

22
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:28,710
in life.
