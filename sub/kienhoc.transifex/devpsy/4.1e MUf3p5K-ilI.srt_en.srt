In the Australian adolescents’ body dissatisfaction study, researchers were most interested in

1
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:15,420
the differences between where the adolescents say they are, and where they would like to

2
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,130
be with regard to their own body image (Maude et al., 1993).

3
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,369
Over 900 Australian adolescents participated in this study, so it’s a pretty good-sized

4
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:23,500
study.

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,029
606 participants were girls and 315 were boys.

6
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:29,029
They were all high-schoolers.

7
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,340
Let’s take a look at what the researchers found.

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,070
On the y axis, we have the percentage of responses.

9
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:40,510
On the x axis, we have those who indicated that their “ideal body is thinner than own

10
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:46,469
body”, their “ideal equals their own body”, and their “ideal is fatter than own body”.

11
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:47,469
Girls are in orange.

12
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:49,359
And boys here are in blue.

13
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,980
What you find is that, for boys, about 34 percent said that their ideal was thinner

14
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:59,449
than their own body, about 33 percent said their ideal matched their own body, and about

15
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:02,370
34 percent said that their ideal was fatter than their own body.

16
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,840
So, boys are across the board here.

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,520
But, if you look at the girls’ data, you see that 70 percent said that their ideal

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,020
was thinner than their own body.

19
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,121
Only 20 percent said that their ideal was the same as their body, and then about 7 percent

20
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:19,410
said that their ideal was fatter than their own body.

21
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:23,330
Even though girls are not saying that the thing they’d most like to change about themselves

22
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:28,350
is their body, when you look at data like this, girls are overwhelmingly unhappy with

23
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,040
the body that they have.

24
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,010
Adolescence tends to be a time when things like body dissatisfaction emerges.

25
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:39,810
This can include anorexia, bulimia, body dysmorphic disorder.

26
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,510
The prevalence tends to spike in adolescence, partly because their bodies are changing,

27
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:47,790
and partly because they are starting to be interesting to others and are becoming interested

28
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,680
in romantic relationships themselves.
