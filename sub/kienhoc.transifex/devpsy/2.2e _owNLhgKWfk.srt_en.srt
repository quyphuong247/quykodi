00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:10,330
Now, Mary Ainsworth looked at these attachment patterns and thought...

1
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,400
How do these relate to the mountain of data I’ve been collecting in the home?

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,279
She discovered something interesting.

3
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:22,179
The mothers of Secure “B” babies, she found, were much more likely to be what Ainsworth

4
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:24,649
called sensitive.

5
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:28,640
These mothers were more likely to be feeding on an infant-centred schedule rather than

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,929
a rigid four-hour schedule.

7
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,610
They were much more likely to approach their baby immediately when the baby started to

8
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,410
cry rather saying something like … Oh, let them cry it out.

9
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,750
It’s good for their lungs.

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,010
Which, by the way my father told me that was the thing to do when my first child was born.

11
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:50,260
And the mothers of secure “B” babies spent more time in face-to-face contact, playing

12
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,650
happily with their babies face to face.

13
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:59,530
By contrast, Mothers of anxious avoidant (“A”) babies were more likely to report disliking

14
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:04,629
contact with their infants, more likely to just sort of plunk their infants down in front

15
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:09,189
of—well, these days it would be probably a video—toys and things, and to just leave

16
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:12,320
them on their own.

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,979
Then the anxious ambivalent (“C”) babies had mothers who tended to be rather inconsistent.

18
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:22,649
One week, Ainsworth would go and they’d be feeding on a rigid schedule because they

19
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:26,150
read a book about how to feed babies that week, and that was the thing to do.

20
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,530
And then the next week or the next month, the mother was feeding on a baby-centred schedule

21
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,609
because that’s what their friends were doing and it seemed to stop the baby crying.

22
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:39,409
These mothers were just really all over the place and inconsistent.

23
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:44,619
Ainsworth then developed this theory that the Attachment Behavioral System is intact

24
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:49,579
in all of these children, but it manifests itself in different forms depending upon the

25
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:55,100
environment, and specifically the environment that the primary caregiver creates.

26
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,060
What the baby wants is security.

27
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,229
So, in the case of a securely attached “B” baby, he knows that as soon as he bids for

28
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:07,889
proximity, as soon as he turns on that Attachment Behavioral System, he’s going to get what

29
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:08,900
he needs.

30
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,320
Mum’s going to come back.

31
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,700
Mum’s going to pick him up.

32
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,160
Mum’s going to spend time in face-to-face contact.

33
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,450
When he’s hungry, he cries and immediately he gets something in his mouth.

34
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:23,540
He doesn’t have to wait if it’s still two hours away from a regimented schedule.

35
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,580
So, that baby grows up in an environment where the Attachment Behavioral System just kind

36
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,230
of flourishes naturally.

37
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:37,600
Anxious avoidant (“A”) babies on the other hand, Ainsworth proposed, grow up in an environment

38
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,910
where what they learn is that if they’re not too demanding, their attachment needs

39
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,380
will be met.

40
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,360
They too need to feel secure.

41
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,990
But what they’ve learned is that their mothers don’t like them to be all clingy and crybabies.

42
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,480
Their mother is always going to come back, and always going to have their back if they

43
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,000
just keep it cool and keep it calm.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,340
In a strange situation, if they get all crying and upset, then they might get rebuffed, so

45
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,090
instead they just keep it calm and cool, and they know that they’re going to have their

46
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,150
attachment needs met.

47
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,620
Anxious ambivalent (“C”) babies, on the other hand, because their mothers are inconsistent,

48
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,180
they don’t know what the heck is going on.

49
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,130
They’re just holding on for dear life.

50
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,400
So, they just get into a strange situation and they don’t know what to expect, so they

51
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,360
get completely hysterical.

52
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,720
So, this was Ainsworth’s spiel, and it became a very popular powerful view.

53
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,470
If you look at the web, there are all these things about attachment parenting, which is

54
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:38,440
basically how to be sensitive in Ainsworth’s way of thinking about it in order to have

55
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,310
a securely attached baby.

56
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,760
There’s nothing wrong with that, but it is important to consider a little bit more

57
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,260
broadly.
