What happens when children go to school?

1
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:14,510
How does mindreading or theory of mind play a role in their life at school?

2
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,220
Children who pass the false belief test earlier tend to be more popular among their peers

3
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,460
in school.

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,230
They seem to be the ones who have more friends, or they&#39;re more liked by their peers.

5
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,490
They seem to engage in prosocial behaviour more often, which makes sense, because in

6
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:33,870
order for children to engage in prosocial behavior, like helping, sharing, comforting,

7
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,480
they need to understand that other people have needs, thoughts, feelings that differ

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,020
from their own.

9
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,800
Having a theory of mind and understanding other people&#39;s mental states doesn&#39;t necessarily

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,579
give children the motivation to engage in prosocial behavior in some cases.

11
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,940
Sometimes, theory of mind manifests in bullying.

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,889
The ability to have a good understanding of the thoughts of others may make it easier

13
00:00:57,889 --> 00:01:01,159
for you to manipulate other people&#39;s thoughts.

14
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:04,710
That&#39;s why theory of mind can sometimes manifest in bullying.

15
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,620
Also, children with more developed theory of mind seem to also be more sensitive to

16
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,360
teacher&#39;s criticisms.

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,890
This might be damaging for them as well.

18
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,980
Therefore, there is a positive and a negative side to developing theory of mind early
