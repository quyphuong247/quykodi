Do you think babies imitate what we do?

1
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,490
If you’re holding a baby and you stick out your tongue, will he stick out his tongue

2
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,290
as well?

3
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,410
Imitation is key to learning and social relationships.

4
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,510
We watch what others do and copy them to gain new skills.

5
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,630
We adopt the stances, expressions and habits of those we like and admire.

6
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,470
The question is: do we learn to do this or is it inborn?

7
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,579
For the last 30 years, many people have argued that imitation is inborn.

8
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:44,690
This belief was based on a now-classic study by psychologists Andrew Meltzoff and Keith

9
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,220
Moore published in 1977.

10
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:53,359
They presented new-born infants – many who are just a few hours old – with an adult

11
00:00:53,359 --> 00:01:01,019
who protruded his tongue, opened his mouth, pursed his lips and wiggled his fingers.

12
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:06,170
These displays were repeated to the babies several times and while this was taking place

13
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:11,390
the researchers counted how often the babies produced each movement.

14
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:16,120
It appeared that new-borns more frequently produced a particular gesture when it matched

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,570
the one being performed by the model – as if the new-borns were imitating what they

16
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:21,930
saw.

17
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,280
And since they were so young, the conclusion was that they were born with this ability,

18
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,720
as there hadn’t been time for them to learn it.

19
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,130
  Now, after that initial paper, numerous researchers

20
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:39,470
tried to replicate it but the results weren’t consistent—some people saw the same thing,

21
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:44,820
others found no imitation and others only saw copying of tongue protrusion—creating

22
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,480
a controversy that has lasted for decades.

23
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:55,760
Then in the 1990s, only positive results were published, perhaps indicating a bias in publishing.

24
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,910
Because not many people want to read about what new-borns can’t do, but we’re always

25
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,500
interested to learn more about their positive capabilities.

26
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,590
So, if you were a researcher, how would you get to the bottom of this issue?
