00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,830
If you put a dummy in a baby’s mouth, then guess what, he’s going to suck.

1
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,600
He can’t help it because of the sucking reflex.

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,670
Now we can make use of this innate reflex to investigate what babies prefer.

3
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,800
One technique is the high amplitude sucking technique.

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,939
I don’t use this, but this is how we found out that babies like heartbeats, mother’s

5
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:31,999
voices, and human voices in general.

6
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:36,470
Here, you’ve set-up the dummy so that it connects to a tape recorder that controls

7
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,280
what the baby hears.

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,890
Now babies can modulate their sucking speed.

9
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,149
When they like something, they’re going to suck fast.

10
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,570
And when they don’t like something, they’re going to slow down their sucking.

11
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:54,210
And so, you can set it up so that if they suck fast on this special dummy, then they

12
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,539
hear a particular sound, such as their mother’s voice reciting a nursery rhyme.

13
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:03,780
You allow them to suck for a minute or so, and each time they suck fast, they get to

14
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,600
hear their mother’s voice.

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,800
Then, you change the recording so that if they suck fast, they hear another woman’s

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,660
voice reciting the nursery rhyme instead.

17
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,620
You let this one go for a minute as well.

18
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,440
You repeat this minute-by-minute for 10 minutes or so in total.

19
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,540
Over the course of that time, the babies’ sucking patterns reveal whether they are willing

20
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:30,050
to work hard to hear one sound as opposed to the other.

21
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,220
Now if they do suck fast for longer when that makes their mother’s voice play in their

22
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,550
ears, what does that tell you?

23
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:41,360
It tells you, first of all, they can tell the difference between these two female voices,

24
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,750
which in itself is pretty impressive if they’re only a week old or even if just new-born.

25
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,620
It also tells you that they have a preference for one over the other.

26
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,700
There are not only studies showing that babies prefer human sounds, heartbeats, human voices,

27
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:04,080
their mother’s voice, research has also shown that two-day-old babies prefer, in anybody’s

28
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,190
voice, the language that they’re going to speak as opposed to another language.

29
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:15,270
This study was conducted by Moon, Cooper, and Fifer in 1993.

30
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:20,719
If we take Australian new-born babies and we put them in a deal like this, we can set

31
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,600
it up so that they can hear “The Cat in the Hat” read to them in English...

32
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,420
&quot;But our fish said, “No! No!

33
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,060
Make that cat go away.&quot;

34
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,700
Or “The Cat in the Hat” read by the same woman, bilingual woman

35
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,120
in Spanish: No debe estar aquí. Ni muy cerca siquiera.

36
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,180
No debe estar aquí si su mamá está afuera.

37
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,340
You’ll find that the Australian babies will suck to hear English as opposed to Spanish.

38
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,640
You take the same setup to Spain, and those babies are going to suck to hear Spanish instead

39
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,820
of English.

40
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,360
So, they’re already learning in utero about the language that they’re going to

41
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,040
be speaking.
