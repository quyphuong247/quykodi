When Mary Ainsworth applied the Strange Situation test to all the hundred families in her study,

1
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,040
interesting patterns came out. There were basically three ways that babies responded.

2
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:23,860
Now there are subcategories within these, but these are the three major classifications.

3
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,450
She called them “A”, “B”, and “C” just to make it confusing.

4
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:34,840
Most common is the “B” pattern which she called secure. The other two she called anxious,

5
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,410
not in terms of anxiety but just in terms of not being secure, to differentiate them

6
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:48,060
from the “B” pattern. These took two different forms. One was anxious avoidant. The other,

7
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:54,650
anxious ambivalent. As you’ll see, that refers to their overall responses and particularly

8
00:00:54,650 --> 00:01:01,150
to their behavior on reunion. The secure “B” pattern is the most common.

9
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,680
It’s actually the modal one in just about every culture. In Western cultures, you’re

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,071
going to see around 60 percent of infants responding with this pattern in a strange

11
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:14,130
situation. So, these babies use their mother as a secure

12
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,859
base, so as  soon as they get into the lab they go… Great! new toys. I’m going for

13
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:24,230
it, and they hit the ground running. When the stranger comes in, they’re wary. They

14
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:30,619
might re-approach the mother. When the  mother leaves, they are upset. The Attachment system

15
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:35,990
turns on... full bore, they cry, they approach the door, they scream, they’re not interested

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:41,490
in the stranger. Then when mother comes back, there’s an immediate bid for proximity.

17
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,670
They get right up close to her. They get up into her arms and then quickly calm down,

18
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:53,289
and then they go back to playing. That’s the pattern that Mary Ainsworth called secure.

19
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:57,780
She also saw around 20 percent of infants had, what she called the anxious avoidant

20
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,619
“A” pattern. Now what these babies do is just be cool throughout the entire strange

21
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:09,069
situation. As soon as they get in, they go straight for the toys. Stranger comes in…

22
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:13,990
Hey stranger. They don’t re-approach the mother. They’re not threatened by the stranger.

23
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:20,099
Mother leaves… Oh, she’s gone. They don’t show any overt distress when she leaves, and

24
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:26,950
when she comes back… Oh, she’s back. They don’t show any proximity-seeking on return.

25
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,400
So Ainsworth called that “avoidant” for obvious reasons.

26
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,200
And then the anxious ambivalent “C” pattern is almost the opposite minority of children.

27
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,340
“C” babies are really, really clingy, hyper-hysterical. Around 20 percent of infants

28
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:49,310
were considered as “C”. A good proportion of “C” babies are classified as that but

29
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,189
they don’t even make it through the whole strange situation because when the mother

30
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:59,709
leaves, they freak out, absolutely and become hysterical. They’ve even been known to vomit.

31
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:03,870
Of course, you’ve got to stop the strange situation in that case.  But they show very

32
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:10,909
little exploration, total hysteria on separation. Not just a healthy attachment behavioral system

33
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:15,019
turning on, but real hysteria.  And then when the mother comes back—this is where

34
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:19,659
the name comes from—they’re often ambivalent in that they’ll approach her, but then they’ll

35
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:23,940
turn away or might even hit her, be aggressive towards her when she tries to re-establish

36
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:30,420
proximity. So, these were the three classifications that Mary Ainsworth discovered from her Strange

37
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,080
Situation test. Now let’s see if you can classify them.
