00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,559
Noam Chomsky viewed language as innate, he argued that we learn language by virtue of

1
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:18,600
a genetically coded Language Acquisition Device, which is present in all human infants, and

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,539
simply needs language input in order to generate language.

3
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:26,930
It creates this rapid word-learning process.

4
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,410
And it produces grammatical utterances within the first 18 months of life.

5
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,480
So, that&#39;s why you see so few errors.

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,940
That&#39;s why you see this very regular acquisition of language.

7
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,120
He called it a Language Acquisition Device (Chomsky, 1972).

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,281
Proponents of this view often times also argue that there’s a critical period for language

9
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:48,040
acquisition.

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:54,750
If you look at the way children acquire language, they do it so effortlessly, and so rapidly.

11
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,610
It&#39;s very different from the way that adults acquire language.

12
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,600
Some of us are really proficient at learning languages, but even the very proficient ones,

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,989
have to study.

14
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,650
But babies don&#39;t study.

15
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,689
They get the input and boom, they make the output.

16
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,250
So, this is where the the idea of a critical period comes in.

17
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:20,080
Now, if you could test the critical period hypothesis, that would lend support to the

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,700
nature view.

19
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,860
The problem is you can&#39;t test the critical period hypothesis because only humans have

20
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,860
language.

21
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,330
And you can&#39;t ethically take a human and deprive him or her of language to see whether or not

22
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,880
there&#39;s a critical period.

23
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:41,240
Then, in 1970, there was this case of a little girl called Genie.

24
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,979
Genie was raised in Los Angeles California and she was very, very maltreated.

25
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:50,740
Her mother was functionally blind and her father was psychotic.

26
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:57,470
At a certain stage in Genie&#39;s very early development—and nobody knows exactly when—he locked her

27
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:03,530
into a walk-in closet, tied her to a potty seat, and she stayed there until she was 13

28
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,079
years old.

29
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:10,000
The best estimate is that this happened when she was about one-year old, so before she

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,060
started using language herself.

31
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:18,049
While she was in there, her father fed her and cleaned her, but he didn&#39;t allow the mother

32
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:19,049
to go in.

33
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:24,019
If Genie did or said something her father didn’t like, he would growl at her like

34
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:26,480
a dog, and sometimes scratch her.

35
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,189
He would beat her if she continued to do things he didn’t like.

36
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:33,989
Genie’s father never spoke to Genie.

37
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:38,469
She may have heard some snippets of conversation from outside, because there was a small window

38
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:41,709
in one of the walls at the top of the closet.

39
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:45,799
One day, Genie&#39;s mother finally got herself together to get Genie out of there.

40
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:48,400
By that time Genie was 13.

41
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,019
When father left the house, mother took Genie, and they walked up the street to the local police

42
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:54,239
station.

43
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,681
The morning before Genie&#39;s father was due to go to court on child abuse charges, he

44
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:00,400
took his own life.

45
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,489
That&#39;s why we don&#39;t know details of Genie&#39;s early life, because the mother didn&#39;t know

46
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:05,489
either.

47
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:07,129
She didn&#39;t know all the details.

48
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:10,749
She was blind and she too was abused by this man.

49
00:03:10,749 --> 00:03:13,370
This case became massive news.

50
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,120
It was news because it was such an horrific case.

51
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,450
But it was also news because at that point, debates were raging, not only in academia,

52
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:27,199
but in the popular press, about whether language is coded into our brains, whether there&#39;s

53
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,769
a critical period, or whether it&#39;s something that we learn, and therefore, we could learn

54
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:34,849
it all the way through our lives.

55
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:37,450
Here&#39;s a chance to test the critical period hypothesis.

56
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:43,499
Yes, it&#39;s a case study, it&#39;s not an experiment, but what happened was, as soon as Genie was

57
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:49,159
discovered, she was immediately fostered to a developmental psycholinguist from UCLA.

58
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:54,529
They spent tremendous amounts of time and money, and actually got grants from the government

59
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:57,099
to try to teach Genie to use language.
