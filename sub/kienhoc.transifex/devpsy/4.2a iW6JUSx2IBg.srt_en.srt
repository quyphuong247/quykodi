Warning: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander learners

00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:11,160
are warned that this video may contain images and voices of deceased persons.

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,120
Most children can’t wait to become adults.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,250
And we often ask children what they want to be when they grow up.

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,669
Discovering who we are as an adult isn’t always smooth sailing, as there are many unexpected

5
00:00:20,669 --> 00:00:23,369
challenges that we need to overcome.

6
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,279
In addition to figuring out how to deal with changing bodies, adolescents have to find

7
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,239
an adult identity.

8
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:32,990
One of your important tasks as an adolescent is to separate yourself from your parents,

9
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:37,410
to separate yourself from who you were as a child, to figure out who you are, what you

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,140
want to be, and how you fit into society.

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,940
There are some key areas where the challenge to find an adult identity appear.

12
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,210
One area is in building relationships––this can be friendships but also can be romantic

13
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,620
relationships.

14
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,260
On top of negotiating complex social hierarchies, adolescents also have to figure out what their

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,540
sexual orientation is, and who they want to date.

16
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,170
Adolescents also need to figure out their own personal identity in terms of work.

17
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,479
This tends to be the age in which teenagers get their first job.

18
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,920
And whether they’re flipping burgers or filing in an office, they have to figure out

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,491
who they’re going to be in that scenario and how to negotiate responsibility, when

20
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:18,390
others suddenly view you more as an adult than a child.

21
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,380
Adolescents also have to decide how closely they’re going to follow ideologies that

22
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,259
they might have grown up with.

23
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:26,979
So, will they follow their parents’ religion, and how fervently?

24
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:29,979
 Will they support the same political parties or different ones?

25
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:34,130
There are many ways for adolescents to try out their new identities.

26
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,969
One of the people who did the earliest work on adolescence and identity was Erik Erikson.

27
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:42,119
He’s the one who coined the term “identity crisis” which is kind of adolescence in

28
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:43,429
a nutshell.

29
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:47,920
For Erikson, what was most important was teenage rites of passage in terms of forging this

30
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,000
identity.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,729
He worked with the Lakota tribe, who are Native Americans living in South Dakota.

32
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:58,490
 He observed their traditional society rituals that involved adolescent’s identity.

33
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,999
In traditional societies, because the changes in adolescents are not necessarily visible,

34
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:07,380
sometimes there are artificial markers that mark the change from child to adult.

35
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,000
When children hit puberty, that confers to them adult status in a lot of traditional

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
societies.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That includes being allowed to get married.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,720
They take on roles as workers, for example whether or not they are allowed to do adult

39
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,310
work like hunting, or be a medicine man or woman.

40
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,410
They get to have greater independence, and their parents don’t get to tell them what

41
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,430
to do anymore.

42
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,080
They’re also allowed to own property.

43
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,020
And because they’ve hit puberty, they can also become parents.

44
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,080
These are all the sorts of things that we associate with adulthood.

45
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,690
In traditional societies, they developed an interesting way of helping to mark this.

46
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,860
For girls, there’s a pretty obvious start for puberty, and that’s the start of menstruation.

47
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,180
There is a clear before and after; Once it happens, girls are considered to be adults.

48
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,850
For boys, there are fewer obvious markers for transitioning into adulthood.

49
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:58,070
So, people have developed different kinds of ceremonial initiation rites, and they tend

50
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,360
to happen when boys are about 13 to 15 years old.

51
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,860
Here are some examples of traditional rites of passage.

52
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,220
This one is a tossing ceremony.

53
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,550
It’s done by the Aranda Tribe in central Australia.

54
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,240
When the boy turns 12, his male relatives take him and they throw him up in the air

55
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,560
and they catch him.

56
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,310
They do that a few times and that’s the beginning of his rite of passage.

57
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,100
Once this tradition has happened, he’s allowed to then go on and do other kinds of rites

58
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,430
of passage to become a full–fledged adult in his society.

59
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,230
This is an example from Africa – this is a Malawian circumcision ceremony.

60
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:34,990
But it’s not just traditional societies that have these kinds of rites of passage.

61
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,820
Some of these other ones will look familiar to you.

62
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:43,570
Things like bar mitzvahs and bat mitzvahs, Baptisms in the Catholic Church or confirmation—many

63
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:49,100
religions have markers that denote a separation from childhood, and the entrance into adulthood.

64
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,410
In traditional societies, puberty is one of those things that allows you to get married

65
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,550
and you get to have kids.

66
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:01,600
In Schlegel and Barry’s study of 186 traditional societies, in 63%, girls tended to be married

67
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,600
within two years of the start of puberty.

68
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,260
When this research was done, girls had their first menstruation right around 14 or 15 years

69
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,260
of age.

70
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,460
Boys had the ability to take a wife once they had reached some sort of specific level of

71
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,570
achievement.

72
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,720
That would be something like making their first kill on a hunt.

73
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,299
Something that shows that they are able to provide for a wife and kids.

74
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:26,160
In 64% of those societies, males were married within about four years of puberty.

75
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,470
The age range of adolescence here is really narrow.

76
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,440
We’re talking two to four years where children go from being a child to being married, and

77
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,040
possibly having children of their own.
