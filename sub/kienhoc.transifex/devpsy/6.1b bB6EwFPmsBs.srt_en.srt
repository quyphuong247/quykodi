The children who observed the aggressive modelling in Bandura’s Bobo doll experiment adopted

1
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,160
the aggressive behaviour after watching the film.

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,930
Some children even invented new ways of attacking the Bobo doll that were not modelled by the

3
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,700
adult in the film, like shooting the doll with a gun.

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,680
Children who were not exposed to the aggressive modelling however, did not show the same aggressive

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,720
behaviours towards the doll.

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,340
It&#39;s a pretty robust finding actually.

7
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,599
You can see lots of children were pretty closely modelling what they had seen.

8
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:37,140
Bandura said that, &quot;Once upon a time, people thought that watching someone be violent would

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,880
drain the viewer of their violent tendencies.&quot;

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,300
That turns out not to be the case.

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,300
Children are great imitators.

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,649
What ends up being the case is that children will model adults, not necessarily parents,

13
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:52,900
they&#39;ll model adults, and are able to pick up moral or immoral behaviours that way.

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,059
Now, this experiment was highly influential at the time (Bandura et al., 1963).

15
00:00:56,059 --> 00:00:58,480
It was a really big deal.

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,370
People were worried about children because of something that was happening in the &#39;60s,

17
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,110
a new kind of technology was emerging…

18
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,960
The television.

19
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,140
TV was coming into the homes of all the children.

20
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,770
Adults were worried that kids were going to learn these violent behaviors watching &quot;The

21
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,690
Lone Ranger&quot;, and carry them out in real life.

22
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,670
These kinds of arguments still happen today on the topic of things like violent video

23
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,490
games or movies.

24
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,930
It&#39;s still a concern.

25
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,409
What Bandura’s experiment did very nicely, though, is show that children can imitate,

26
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,400
and that they can embellish and expand upon what they see.

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,060
It doesn&#39;t necessarily show that violent video games and TV is bad for children, but that

28
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,320
children learn what they see.
