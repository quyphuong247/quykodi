00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:09,059
We’ve all heard babies babble.

1
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:13,089
We tend to think of babbling as something that babies do when they&#39;re crawling around

2
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:16,320
and sitting up, the goo goo ga ga stage.

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,460
But in fact, babies babble, they make noises from the time that they&#39;re born.

4
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:26,039
(Sound of baby making noises).

5
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,470
They don&#39;t just cry.

6
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,179
They make all kinds of different sounds.

7
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,629
In the same way that their ear is born ready for anything, and then over the first year

8
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:38,629
of life...hones down to the sounds that are going to be important in the language that

9
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:43,190
they&#39;re going to speak, their tongues are the same way.

10
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,329
Babies are born babbling and making every single sound possible.

11
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:53,489
Then, the closer they get to their first birthday, the more their babbling sounds like the language

12
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,390
they&#39;re going to speak.

13
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,590
For example, here&#39;s a two-month-old baby babbling.

14
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,260
(Sound of baby babbling).

15
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,260
That’s their babbling.

16
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,420
They could be French.

17
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,420
They could be English.

18
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,420
They could be Russian.

19
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,880
We don&#39;t know.

20
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,580
We can&#39;t really tell at this stage.

21
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,911
Now, listen to this one.

22
00:01:10,911 --> 00:01:13,440
(Sound of an 10-month baby babbling).

23
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,160
This baby has just turned 10 months.

24
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:24,110
He&#39;s coming up to his first birthday and you can hear that the babbling is English language

25
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,110
babbling.

26
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:30,700
(Sound of same 10-month baby babbling).

27
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,740
That goo goo ga ga is actually English babbling.

28
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,531
And you hear it very close to the first birthday because that’s when the baby’s tongue

29
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:46,170
has already been tuned to the consonant vowel pairings that are going to be common in English

30
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:53,210
when the baby starts saying his first word, and that’s usually around 12 months or so.

31
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,150
Babies who are learning sign language, they also babble (Petitto &amp; Marentette, 1991).

32
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:01,290
But they babble with their hands...They make cute little approximations of signs.

33
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,580
As they get to their first birthday, their signs will start to look more and more like

34
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,450
real signs.
