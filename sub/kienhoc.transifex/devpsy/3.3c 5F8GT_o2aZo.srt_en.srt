The nurture view in language development says…

1
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:14,910
Look, yes, it is pretty darn complex but look at all the other complex stuff we as humans

2
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,299
can do.

3
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:18,020
We went to the moon.

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,369
We all drive around in cars.

5
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:24,260
We keep our environments light all the way through the night.

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:30,300
There&#39;s a lot of complex stuff that we can do and learning language is just one of them.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,870
We have the ability to learn things that are beyond our innate capabilities.

8
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,940
We learn language the same way as we learn anything else according to this view.

9
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,739
If you think about the context we&#39;re in, we are constantly bombarded with linguistic input

10
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:46,989
and social support for learning.

11
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:52,020
If language is just coded into our brain, then there&#39;s a genetic code for having a brain

12
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,610
that uses language, why is there so much variation in languages all over the world?

13
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,420
Why don&#39;t we all just speak Esperanto?

14
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:05,910
In fact, if you look at the languages across the world, it&#39;s very hard to find underlying

15
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:11,840
principles that apply to all the grammars of all different languages.

16
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,250
People who follow Chomsky have been trying this now for five decades.

17
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,610
They&#39;ve been trying to find the so-called universal grammar, the thing that’s probably

18
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,110
coded in the brain and they just can&#39;t find it (See Dabrowska, 2015).

19
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:28,869
A lot of languages convey meaning in a lot of similar ways, but there are exceptions

20
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:30,549
all over the place.

21
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,439
You can&#39;t find the common core.

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:41,200
You would think that there would be if language was just a product of some kind of structure in the brain that was determined by our genes.

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,159
People on the nurture side also point out that the rate of language development depends

24
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,190
on the input.

25
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:52,460
Now, in the early stages, for one-word and two-word learning, you do get this incredible

26
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,670
regularity.

27
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,009
But after that, the environment makes a tremendous difference.

28
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:05,119
For instance, Hoff in 2003 found that at two-years of age, children from high socio-economic

29
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,640
status homes, by the way, who are read to regularly, will have just about twice as many

30
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,480
words in their vocabularies compared to children from low SES homes.

31
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,000
This seems to link to the amount of language they hear, and there’s a strong link with

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,170
whether or not they&#39;re read to, although that may just be a proxy for how much they&#39;re spoken

33
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,680
to (Hart &amp; Risley, 1995; Hoff, 2003b; Hoff-Ginsberg, 1991).

34
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,730
Early stages of language development are pretty regular.

35
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,610
But once you start looking a little bit later, the amount of language input has a tremendous

36
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,880
impact on the rate of language acquisition.

37
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,570
This is support for the importance of learning as well as the environment in which language

38
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,359
is learned.

39
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:45,680
There&#39;s no answer here.

40
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,579
This is a debate that continues to go on.
