To do experiments with babies, you’ve got to be clever, you’ve got to work with what

1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,889
they’ve got.

2
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:14,259
They can’t answer questionnaires.

3
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:15,360
They can’t follow instructions.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,950
So, what are you going to do?

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,250
Well, you rely on their innate capacities.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,580
We know they’ve got reflexes.

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:28,040
So, maybe we can make use of the fact that they can suck, and they can grasp.

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,880
And we can also make use of their senses.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,550
Remember, they can look, they can follow visual stimuli provided it’s in the right focal

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,980
distance.

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:42,190
We can also make use of habituation, which is just a characteristic of all living things.

12
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:47,900
Repeated stimulation of the same form becomes less potent over time; it’s just boredom.

13
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,600
So, the first bite of the chocolate bar is amazing, fabulous, best thing you’ve ever

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,680
tasted.

15
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,300
By the end, you’re on your phone and just chewing and not even paying any attention

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,300
at all.

17
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,500
You’ve habituated to the taste and we habituate to everything all the time.

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:09,390
Babies habituate as well and we can make use of that in our experimental designs.

19
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,820
Then finally, there’s surprise.

20
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,860
When we’re surprised it means that our expectation has been violated.

21
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:20,430
One of the things we do when our expectation is violated is, well, we make the surprised

22
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,409
face, and we also stare and look longer.

23
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:26,060
So, imagine when you go to a magic show.

24
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,360
When the magician does something crazy like pulls a rabbit out of the hat, a tiny, tiny

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,540
little hat, where’d that rabbit come from? you look and look and try to figure it out.

26
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:41,400
So, we can measure babies looking to find out what they expected and what they didn’t

27
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,400
expect.

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,500
And expectations tell us something about the way they see the world.
