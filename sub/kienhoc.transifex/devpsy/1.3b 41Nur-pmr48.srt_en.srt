00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,610
To think about nature and nurture as an interaction, we can look at the interaction between our

1
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,049
genes and our environment.

2
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:19,250
The best example of gene environment interactions is work that has come out of the Dunedin longitudinal

3
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:24,220
study, published by Caspi and colleagues in 2002.

4
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:30,289
They had over a thousand children, and they looked at the MAOA gene, which they know—when

5
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:35,230
its levels are low––it’s associated with aggression and antisocial behaviour in

6
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,230
adults.

7
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:41,160
When they looked developmentally, what they found was that, there are quite a few children

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,550
with low MAOA gene (Caspi et al., 2002).

9
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,090
But, they all don’t become anti-social and aggressive adults.

10
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:54,070
The ones who do also have a particular environment, namely maltreatment.

11
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,470
Here are their data (Caspi et al., 2002).

12
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,940
On the left is their measure of antisocial behaviour, where the value one indicates high

13
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,829
antisocial behaviour.

14
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:09,880
On the bottom here, is the level of childhood maltreatment: None, probable, and severe.

15
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,840
What the researchers found was that, if you are low in the MAOA and have experienced severe

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,729
levels of maltreatment, then you’re very, very likely to end up in jail for aggression,

17
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:23,009
or anti-social behaviour of some form.

18
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,530
But, if you only have one of those two, your risk is much, much lower.

19
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,689
So, this is an example of a gene-environment interaction.

20
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:36,759
The way the gene expresses itself is contingent upon the environment in which the child is

21
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,259
growing up.

22
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:43,429
Finally, we understand this interaction of nature via nurture.

23
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:49,570
Our genetic predisposition, say our temperament, drives us to select particular environments.

24
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:55,369
So, if you’re a very, very difficult baby, you don’t like novelty, you get over stimulated

25
00:01:55,369 --> 00:02:00,329
very easily, as you get older you are going to seek out sheltered environments.

26
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,570
You’re not going to be out there getting a whole lot of new experiences.

27
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,569
You’re likely to avoid scary movies, violent video games, things like that.

28
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:14,750
So, you’re likely to continue to be perhaps shy, withdrawn, introverted, a little bit

29
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:20,410
anxious, and that could be equally because of your early temperament, and because of

30
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,520
the selection you’ve made for your different environmental inputs as you develop.

31
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,250
So, that’s what modern developmental psychology is all about; trying to understand these complex

32
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,230
interactions.
