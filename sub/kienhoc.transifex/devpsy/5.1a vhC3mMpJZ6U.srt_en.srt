We all know an adult who often says the wrong thing at the wrong time, making everyone uncomfortable.

1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,830
They are often completely oblivious to how their actions affect others.

2
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,980
Young children can also lack apparent empathy or tact at times.

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,630
Maybe they tell you how much hair you are losing, or how old you are looking.

4
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,109
But we’re always, well maybe sometimes, forgiving of this as we know they still need

5
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:30,630
to learn social skills.

6
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,720
So how do we learn social skills?

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,320
Let’s talk about how children go from thinking about just their own world to being able to

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,879
take into consideration other people&#39;s views, to understanding our world, living together

9
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,400
harmoniously with everyone else.

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,129
Newborns are born with specific preferences that seem to really drive their learning.

11
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,170
They learn things that are important to them.

12
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,650
In terms of their social learning, it&#39;s really important that they pay more attention to

13
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,980
things like faces.

14
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,440
Goren and colleagues in 1975 found that infants who were an average of nine minutes from birth

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,290
had a preference for things that look like this.

16
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,000
This is a face-like stimulus on a paddle.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,869
Goren and colleagues showed that infants preferred to look at the two-dimensional schematic face-like

18
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,070
stimulus as opposed to the scrambled face.

19
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,380
And that they preferred to look at the scrambled face than the blank face (Goren, Sarty &amp; Wu,

20
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,380
1975).

21
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,509
Newborns really enjoy looking at faces.

22
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:31,159
This is important because, in social interactions, it&#39;s all about looking at each other&#39;s faces.

23
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:38,700
Being able to have a preference for faces is an advantage (Interaction between adult

24
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,340
and baby).

25
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,329
Also, they seem to have a preference for human speech over artificial sounds.

26
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:52,439
This, once again, is really important because it&#39;s through human language that we connect

27
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,390
with other humans.

28
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:01,700
Finally, infants have a preference for maternal language sounds (Adult speaking Spanish).

29
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,749
This not only includes the maternal language itself, but also the accent of their maternal

30
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:06,979
language.

31
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:11,870
This is important because it enables infants to speak with the right accent and language

32
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,960
so that they will fit into the community in which they will grow up in.
