Infants have the ability to recognise different emotional cues.

1
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,280
They can also use their recognition ability to respond in appropriate ways.

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,330
This photo here is of an infant showing a social smile.

3
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,240
In the first month or so of life, you might see infants having a big, big grin, but that’s

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,170
usually only because they are full, or they’ve just had a good sleep.

5
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,850
It&#39;s not really until around three months of age that infants seem to show a smile in

6
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,910
response to social cues.

7
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,390
Social smile is when infants smile and respond to facial cues.

8
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,790
By the time they&#39;re around six months of age, they&#39;re particularly tuned into people that

9
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:43,870
are familiar to them.

10
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,850
They would show smiling, laughing, those kinds of things much more to people they know––like

11
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,059
their mother, compared to strangers.

12
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,420
So, infants are tuned in to their mothers&#39; expressions and seem to be able to suss out

13
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,550
what other infants are feeling.

14
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,190
An example of this is called contagious crying.

15
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,280
Young infants––particularly for those between three to six months of age––when

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,570
they see another infant cry, they start crying, too.

17
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,000
It&#39;s as if crying is contagious.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,550
Well, some people argued that contagious crying happens from a basic sense of empathy––being

19
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,420
able to feel what other people are feeling (Hoffman, 2000; Simner, 1971).

20
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,210
Others have argued that infants are just being hyper-reactive (Davidov, Zahn-Waxler, Roth-Hanania

21
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,210
&amp; Knafo, 2013).

22
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,470
They&#39;re just getting all freaked out because someone else is freaked out.

23
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,670
Those are the two sides of the argument.

24
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,140
It might be basic empathy or it might just be something about feeling emotionally aroused.

25
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,420
Infants seem to be able to produce these emotional responses, which really allows them to be

26
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,670
active participants in social interactions.
