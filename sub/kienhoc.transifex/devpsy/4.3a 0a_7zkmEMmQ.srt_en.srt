00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,420
Adolescents are known to take mind-blowing risks, and to participate in things that are

1
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,070
best defined as sensation-seeking.

2
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:18,930
During the adolescent years, we see increasing rates of accidents, suicide, alcohol and substance

3
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:25,560
use, violence, reckless behaviors, eating disorders, and risky sexual activity.

4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,869
Increases in all things risk-taking essentially.

5
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:33,080
So, the very last of these three tasks I’m going to talk about in terms of what adolescents

6
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,800
need to do is to just survive!

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,840
Which is surprisingly difficult.

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,859
Even though adolescence is the time where your body is at its peak––adolescents

9
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:46,320
have the best strength, they’re the fastest, they have the fastest reaction time, they

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,090
have superior immune function compared to any other point in time in life.

11
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:55,989
They have increased resistance to cold, heat, hunger, dehydration, and most types of injury.

12
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,410
And, they heal quickly.

13
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,629
They are even less likely to get hangovers.

14
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,040
All of this tells us that adolescents’ bodies are in top shape at this period of time in

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,960
their life.

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,390
But their chances of dying increase 200 to 300 percent just by going from a child to

17
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,610
an adolescent!

18
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,829
There’s something about adolescence that causes a spike in mortality rates.

19
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:22,580
Sadly, a lot of the things that seem to kill adolescents are related to issues with the

20
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,930
control of their own behaviors, and control of their own emotions.

21
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:30,030
It’s basically some of these things that Aristotle talked about, and Shakespeare talked

22
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,479
about, acting like they know everything and being impulsive.
