Do you think you share the same morals as your parents?

1
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,680
Social learning theory basically says, what we all kind of intuitively know.

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,080
That is, children learn to be moral by imitating adults.

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,940
Not only do they imitate what adults do, whether it&#39;s moral or immoral, but adults also shape

4
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,830
children&#39;s behaviour and their social learning by giving them punishments or rewards.

5
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,980
We, as adults, create boundaries for what children do.

6
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,410
We start them thinking about what&#39;s moral and immoral.

7
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,870
Social learning theory would argue that the parents are the major influence in kids&#39; moral

8
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,670
development, which is a lot of pressure for any parent.

9
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,550
One of the main proponents of this theory was Albert Bandura.

10
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,899
He did a seminal study in 1963, and used a toy that was very common back in the day,

11
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:51,289
called the Bobo Doll (Bandura, Ross &amp; Ross; 1963).

12
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:54,770
I had one when I was little but it was considered ancient even when I had it.

13
00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:00,170
Basically, it is a blow-up plastic clown with the weight on the bottom, and you push it

14
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,170
over.

15
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,450
Because it&#39;s weighted at the bottom, it bounces back up.

16
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:08,290
This was a toy that was created back when people thought clowns were cute and not terrifying.

17
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,870
So, Bandura showed children a film of an adult modelling aggressive behaviour on the Bobo

18
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,000
doll.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,490
In the film, the adult punched the Bobo doll, threw the doll in the air, and kicked the

20
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,490
doll.

21
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,360
After watching the film, the children were then left in a room with a variety of different

22
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,790
toys––including the Bobo doll.

23
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,380
The experimenter then watched to see what children would do.
