Most people in this situation would think that Joe should not give his father the money.

1
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:13,420
The father went back on a promise, which is not fair.

2
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,789
Joe held up his end of the bargain, his father didn&#39;t, and now Joe’s father is trying to

3
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:19,410
take his money.

4
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,759
It&#39;s the thought process behind why it&#39;s okay or not okay.

5
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:26,130
That&#39;s what Kohlberg and Piaget here are interested in.

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,189
An argument FOR Joe giving the money could be that it’s a way for Joe to kind of, pull

7
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:31,650
his weight at home.

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,390
His parents are giving him a house, food, and an education.

9
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,500
And maybe it would be perfectly acceptable for Joe to give his father the money.

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,870
It would be kind of fair for Joe to give his dad the 100 dollars in exchange for some of

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,000
the stuff that Joe gets in return.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,150
The issue here is not whether the responses are right or wrong, or whether they argue

13
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,690
for or against Joe giving his father the money.

14
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:57,290
What is of interest to Kohlberg is whether or not you can reason convincingly for your

15
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,430
decision in these scenarios.

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,120
Would your answer change if Joe is 18?

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,439
If Joe is living at home, he might be making more money.

18
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:10,600
A hundred dollars might not be worth that much to him or might be less of an effort

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,930
to save in the first place for him.

20
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,830
There are complex rationales behind many of our moral conclusions.

21
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,150
Our moral reasonings are incredibly complicated, even though for the most part, we operate

22
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,010
on a gut sense level.

23
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,830
Should he give the dad the money, yes or no?

24
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,740
Even as adults, we often don&#39;t think all the way through all of the potential moral outcomes.

25
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,689
And, this is a kind of logic that it takes children a little while to figure out.
