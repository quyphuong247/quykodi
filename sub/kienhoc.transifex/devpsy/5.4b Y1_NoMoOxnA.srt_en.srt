What are other ways in which we know how theory of mind develops?

1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,000
We use behavioral tasks that can be tested in laboratories.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,960
How do we know if children understand that what you see is different from what someone

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,500
else sees?

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,559
We can test this using the Visual perspective taking test.

5
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:29,040
In this experiment, the child sits on one side of the desk, and a puppet or an experimenter

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,919
on the other side of the desk.

7
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:35,231
There&#39;s three big mountains in the middle that basically obstruct the view of the child

8
00:00:35,231 --> 00:00:37,770
from that of the puppet.

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,050
What you can do is, place something like a pink house on one end, and you can ask the

10
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,050
child...

11
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,610
&quot;Does the puppet know what color the house is?&quot;

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,350
If the child understands that the puppet can&#39;t see what they can see, then the child would

13
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,460
say, &quot;No, the puppet does not know what color the house is.&quot;

14
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,530
If the child thinks everything they see is what the puppet sees, then they would say…

15
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,140
&quot;Of course the puppet knows.

16
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,140
It&#39;s pink.

17
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,690
It&#39;s a pink house.&quot;

18
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,879
Three-year-olds are the ones that really struggle with this kind of task.

19
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,490
They would say something like...

20
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,320
&quot;Yeah, of course the puppet sees everything I see.&quot;

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,679
Whereas, by four years of age, is when children have the understanding that other people&#39;s

22
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:17,200
vision might be different from their own.

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,060
Children&#39;s lack of visual perspective taking is really shown on how they play hide-and-seek,

24
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,030
which is just adorable if you&#39;ve never seen children play hide-and-seek.

25
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,069
Children around three years of age don&#39;t have the ability to take the visual perspective

26
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:30,780
of the other person.

27
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,499
They assume that, if they are not able to see anyone else, then others won’t be able

28
00:01:34,499 --> 00:01:35,499
to see them either.

29
00:01:35,499 --> 00:01:39,780
So, they cover their own faces on the floor, or behind a blanket, thinking no one else

30
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,069
would see them.

31
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:46,310
This is why they hide––hide in quotation marks, in places where it&#39;s clear that they&#39;re

32
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,090
there, but they think that they&#39;re really doing a good job of hiding just because they

33
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,469
can&#39;t see what other people see, or they don’t know what other people are seeing.
