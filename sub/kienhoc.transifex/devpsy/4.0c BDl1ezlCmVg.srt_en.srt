Adolescents have a lot of jobs.

1
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:11,870
There are a lot of changes that happen during that time period, and they have many things

2
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,349
to master before they can go on to be adults.

3
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:19,310
I’m going to talk about three of those changes today— although there are more.

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,770
One thing that adolescents have is to come to grips with is all the physical changes

5
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,469
that are happening to them—it’s easy for adults to forget how weird it is when you’re

6
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:29,270
in the middle of it.

7
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,940
They also have to find their own adult identities—some sort of identity that they’ll take on as

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:39,390
an adult that’s separate from who they were as a child, separate from their parents.

9
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,780
Then the last one is simply to survive.

10
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,800
It turns out to be a little bit more difficult than you would think.
