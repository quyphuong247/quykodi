00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:10,330
So, are adolescents doing these crazy things because they don’t yet know that these behaviours

1
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,810
are dangerous?

2
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:16,010
To answer this question someone set out to test just that (Wechsler et al., 2002).

3
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:20,310
In the mid 90’s, there was an effort to educate university students about the dangers

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,599
of binge drinking.

5
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:28,229
These results are from a survey completed by students at 119 American universities.

6
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:31,800
On the y axis, we have the percentage of binge drinkers.

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,820
On the x axis, we have the year that the survey was collected.

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,890
The green is for males, and the yellow is for females.

9
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,800
This is the percentage of binge drinkers for male and females before the education program,

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,210
here’s where the education program happened.

11
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,440
You can see exactly how much affect it had on binge-drinking which is to say absolutely

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,440
none.

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,240
It’s not the fact that adolescents don’t know this stuff is risky.

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,150
It’s not an issue of education.

15
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,020
What does seem to be at issue is the adolescent brain.

16
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,990
What people think is happening here is that the different parts of our brain develop at

17
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,670
different times.

18
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,360
One important part of our brain is called the nucleus accumbens, it’s this little

19
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,490
red section here.

20
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,039
The nucleus accumbens is very deep in our brain.

21
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:20,270
It’s part of our brain that we share with snakes and reptiles.

22
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,570
This is a very ancient part of your brain.

23
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,259
Most organisms have one.

24
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:29,179
What this part of the brain does is motivate us to get things that are desirable.

25
00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:33,770
In humans that can be things like food, sex, accolades from other people for jumping off

26
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,770
cliffs.

27
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,959
All of those things are desirable.

28
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,829
And this is the part of our brain that motivates us to go get them.

29
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:46,670
In contrast, this part highlighted by the red circle here is our prefrontal cortex.

30
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,060
Our prefrontal cortex is the part of your brain that develops last.

31
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,479
It is the part of our brain that helps us with things like long-term planning, complex

32
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,150
reasoning, logical skills, and the part where we say to ourselves…

33
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,899
This could kill me.

34
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,279
That is developed in your prefrontal cortex.

35
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:06,399
It could be considered our mental stop signal.

36
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,580
The nucleus accumbens develops first, so we get is a whole bunch of motivation, and the

37
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,940
prefrontal cortex isn’t fully developed until later, so we don’t have a lot of stop

38
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,950
signal.

39
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,500
So essentially what we have is an accelerator pedal and no brake.

40
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,750
This is part of the reason why adolescents tend to engage in very risky behaviors.

41
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,470
The kinds of behaviors that spike right after children become adolescents, and seem to taper

42
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:35,390
off as they become adults and acquire more and more of those adult things like homes

43
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,750
and mortgages and kids.
