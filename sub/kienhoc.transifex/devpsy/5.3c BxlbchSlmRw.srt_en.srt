00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,410
The next type of prosocial behavior to emerge is comforting (image of category displaying

1
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,920
comforting being shown), which emerges at around 24 months of age.

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,530
Comforting is actually one of the hardest prosocial behaviors for children to demonstrate.

3
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,160
When children see an experimenter knocking their knee on the edge of a table, they might

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,230
say something like… “you weren&#39;t looking where you were going&quot;, which is not very empathetic.

5
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,480
Comforting behaviour emerges later than anything else.

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,080
(Image being shown of 3 categories) Children start to develop helping behaviours at around

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,540
14 months.

8
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,090
They develop sharing behaviours at around 18 months, then comforting behaviours at around

9
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,480
24 months.

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,540
Why are comforting behaviours so difficult for children to develop?

11
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:49,070
It&#39;s because in helping and sharing, it’s easy for children to actually see the needs

12
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,920
of the experimenter, or the other person.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,670
They can see that the clothes peg has dropped on the floor, or the experimenter has only

14
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,430
one toy block.

15
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:02,660
When children elicit helping and sharing behaviours, it&#39;s very clear, visually, what the other

16
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,000
person&#39;s needs are.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,420
In the case of comforting, children can&#39;t see pain or sorrow very clearly, as it&#39;s really

18
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,659
an internal state.

19
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:16,350
They really need to be able to put themselves in the other person&#39;s shoes in order to elicit

20
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,380
comforting behavior.

21
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:24,009
That&#39;s why children may not start to develop comforting until around 24 months, but only

22
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:25,490
with prompting.

23
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,950
It&#39;s only when the experimenter says things like…

24
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,340
&quot;Is there anything you can do for me?&quot;

25
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:36,049
Then, the child might go, &quot;Here, I&#39;ll rub it for you&quot; or something like that.

26
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:38,310
Comforting continues to develop into the early school years.

27
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,519
It&#39;s a really difficult concept to grasp because the mental state underlying it is so abstract.
