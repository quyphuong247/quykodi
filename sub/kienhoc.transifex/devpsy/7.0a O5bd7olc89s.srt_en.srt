00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,340
How have we developed our knowledge about the world?

1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,080
How do we know that, even if we can’t physically see an object, for example our phone, that

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,430
it’s still there even if it’s not in our sight?

3
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,740
When speaking to someone, how do we know what the other person is able to see, even though

4
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,250
we’re facing them?

5
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,850
How do we know what’s fair?

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,380
Infants and young children have a hard time grasping concepts about fairness and other

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,519
people’s perspectives.

8
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,800
It also takes time for them to understand that an object exists even though it’s been

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
hidden.

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,530
How do children and infants develop the logical ability to think through and reason about

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,530
things?

12
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,410
Well, that&#39;s what cognitive development is all about.

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,010
Jean Piaget was a Swiss genetic epistemologist.

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,400
Genetic epistemology is the study of how we develop knowledge.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,790
Piaget was a very bright child.

16
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,420
In the beginning, he was studying animals.

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,960
He wrote his first scientific paper when he was 11 years of age on the albino sparrow.

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,120
Then, he went on to study mollusks.

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,890
He was trying to figure out how mollusks adapt to different environments.

20
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,140
He was really interested in studying non-human animals until he started to have his own children.

21
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,550
He was really fascinated by their development and wanted to know, “How do young children

22
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,900
develop the knowledge that we have as adults?”

23
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,619
He started out by observing his three children and taking lots of notes.

24
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:24,700
From the first few hours of life, he wrote down everything.

25
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,149
That&#39;s how he came up with his theory on cognitive development, or the development of knowledge

26
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:31,649
and our intellectual abilities.

27
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:36,270
What made Piaget really special was he focused on HOW children develop knowledge.

28
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,479
At that time, developmental psychologists typically looked at when children develop

29
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,119
certain abilities, but they didn&#39;t really focus on HOW they develop knowledge.

30
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:51,110
Piaget was really the first person to lay down theories on HOW children come to develop

31
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,110
knowledge.

32
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,770
So, what&#39;s Piaget&#39;s theory of cognitive development all about?

33
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,970
It&#39;s a constructivist theory.

34
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,310
Constructivist theory is based on the idea that children actively construct knowledge

35
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,190
as they manipulate and explore their world.

36
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,420
Piaget believed that, instead of teaching children by giving them instructions, it’s

37
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:12,950
really the children&#39;s ability to explore the world that allows them to construct their

38
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,950
knowledge.

39
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,210
For example, instead of teaching a child about sand by explaining that, &quot;Sand is little particles

40
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:23,730
of rocks,&quot; Piaget believed that a child constructed their knowledge of sand by just going to the

41
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,090
beach, touching the sand, playing with it, and feeling it with all their senses.

42
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,760
So, Piaget was all about active exploration.

43
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,620
He came up with four main stages to explain how children develop knowledge.

44
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:41,560
Stage one is the sensorimotor stage, which goes from birth to two years of age.

45
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,630
Stage two is the pre-operational stage that goes from two to seven.

46
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,740
Stage three is the concrete operational stage, which is from 7 to 11 years.

47
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:55,960
Then finally, stage four is the formal operational stage, which occurs at around 11 years of

48
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,960
age.

49
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,300
Piaget&#39;s theory is known to be a stage theory because he believed that children construct

50
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,950
knowledge one stage at a time.

51
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,740
Each stage builds on the one before.

52
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,830
Also, he believed that children can&#39;t skip through the different stages.

53
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,360
They might reach each stage at different ages but they all nevertheless progress through

54
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,940
these four stages sequentially.

55
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,740
We will go through these stages in great detail in the coming videos.
