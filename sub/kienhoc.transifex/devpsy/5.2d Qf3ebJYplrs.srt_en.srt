00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:11,430
By around 18 months of age, infants seem to have a basic understanding that other people

1
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,150
might be different from themselves.

2
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:19,650
Repacholi and Gopnik in 1997 showed that infants actually have a basic understanding of other

3
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,980
people&#39;s desires.

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,740
In their experiment, Betty Repacholi and Alison Gopnik had two plates placed in front of the

5
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,740
infant.

6
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,860
One plate had crackers on it, and the other plate had broccoli.

7
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,772
The experimenter then sat next to the infant, and expressed to the infant that they don’t

8
00:00:33,772 --> 00:00:36,430
actually like crackers, but prefered broccoli instead.

9
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,989
The experimenter would put a piece of cracker in their mouth and say to the infant “YUCK,

10
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:47,219
crackers,&quot; showing their distaste for crackers, and then say, &quot;YUM, broccoli, YUM”, showing

11
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,910
the infant that they didn’t like the crackers, but liked the broccoli (Repacholi &amp; Gopnik,

12
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:51,910
1997).

13
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,149
Then afterwards, the experimenter placed their hands in the middle of the two plates and

14
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:57,410
asked the infant..., &quot;Can I have some please?&quot;

15
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,950
They didn’t refer to any specific object, they just asked…

16
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,729
&quot;Can I have some?&quot;

17
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,480
Eighteen month-old infants reached out and gave the experimenter their preference.

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,420
Even if the infant themselves may have preferred the crackers themselves, they gave the broccoli

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,399
to the experimenter.

20
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:19,630
This suggests that 18 month-old infants have a fundamental understanding that their desires

21
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,930
may contradict from other people&#39;s desires.

22
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,740
The infant’s understanding that their own desires can be different from others is also

23
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,909
scaffolded by their mother or primary caregiver.

24
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,619
I mentioned earlier that mothers talk to their infants about their own desire first.

25
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:40,299
Then, between 18 to 36 months of age, the mother talks to the infant about their thoughts

26
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:45,390
and beliefs, because they have a good basic grasp of desire by then.

27
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,469
After that, the mother talks about other people&#39;s mental states.

28
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:50,430
Instead of saying things like…

29
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,359
&quot;You should do this&quot;, the mother says things like…

30
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,700
&quot;Daniel thinks that the dog is cute.&quot;

31
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,920
Talking to infants about the thoughts and beliefs of others foster the infant’s understanding

32
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,289
that the self might be different from others.
