00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:09,960
So, what is adolescence exactly - how do we define it?

1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,349
We can look at it chronologically, basically just an age which people tend to define as

2
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:17,810
the teenage years between 13 and 19.

3
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:22,919
You can also look at it biologically, using physical markers or physical changes to mark

4
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:25,119
the onset and offset of adolescence.

5
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,239
For biological definitions, it starts at the pre-pubertal height spurt, which precedes

6
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:37,070
puberty and ends when people reach full reproductive maturity, which would be around 15-18 years.

7
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,790
Or, you can define adolescence in terms of society.

8
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,301
The sociological definition would be the period of time between the onset of puberty, the

9
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:49,520
biological markers of puberty, and ends when adolescents assume adult responsibilities.

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,060
That would be things like leaving home, being able to support yourself, maybe owning a house

11
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:01,940
or a car, or having children, maybe having a job, all of those kinds of things.

12
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,160
Some of these definitions can be fairly narrow in time.

13
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,420
The chronological one is just six years, but if you take the sociological definition, adolescence

14
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,509
could be considered to be 10 or 15 years.

15
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:17,069
For example, if a child doesnâ€™t leave home and take on adult responsibilities until they

16
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:18,590
are around 27 years old.
