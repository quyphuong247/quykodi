00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,840
To describe the characteristics of an individual, there’s something like 10,000 different

1
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,510
terms we can use to describe different personality traits.

2
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:23,450
Outgoing, lazy, party animal, ambitious, we could brainstorm thousands of them, literally.

3
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,320
Now, you can’t apply these to babies.

4
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,080
Think about that one-week-old in the first video.

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,070
How do we know if he’s lazy?

6
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,870
How do we know if he’s outgoing or a party animal?

7
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:41,510
All he does is pretty much lay there, sleep, eat and cry a little bit.

8
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:46,640
So, can we characterise individual differences amongst babies?

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,000
Well, ask any parent of more than one child and they’ll say “Oh yeah, they were completely

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,629
different from the time they were born”.

11
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:58,550
We can evaluate babies temperament as a way to characterise their individual differences.

12
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:05,059
So, temperament is personality really, but when we talk about personality in adults,

13
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:08,479
we have all these many complex terms to describe it.

14
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,080
But with babies, what you find is that you can really only capture their individual differences

15
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,280
on three dimensions.

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:23,860
Their biological regularity, their general Hedonic tone, and their Responses to novelty.

17
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:31,130
In terms of biological regularity, we know that some babies sleep regularly, eat regularly,

18
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,830
and poo regularly.

19
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,360
You can pretty much set your watch by them.

20
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,220
Lucky parents who have this baby, they know exactly what to expect.

21
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,450
On the other hand, some babies are highly irregular.

22
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,650
You can also characterise babies’ individual differences in terms of their general hedonic

23
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,880
tone.

24
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,060
Hedonic tone refers to, kind of, their state of being.

25
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,380
Some babies are happy, they rarely cry, they wake up and they’re just laying in their

26
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,610
cot smiling.

27
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:05,130
Other babies wake up and the first thing they do is scream and they’re generally pretty

28
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,070
grumbly babies.

29
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:12,950
So, hedonic tone is another dimension in which individual babies differ.And then finally

30
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,400
they differ in terms of their response to novelty.

31
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,790
If you present an infant with, say, a new toy, you’ll find that there’s a range

32
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:28,069
of responses from very interested, very positive, all the way to very negative––avoidant,

33
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:30,980
upset, over-stimulated.

34
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,450
And in the middle, is a slower response.

35
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:40,819
When we think about temperament, we can reduce it down to three different types of babies

36
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:43,939
and these have been validated repeatedly.

37
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:49,709
Across studies in different countries, different samples over time, it’s really quite a reliable

38
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:51,879
categorisation scheme.

39
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:57,500
The research looking into temperament in babies shows that a lot of babies, about 40

40
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,019
percent are what we call easy.

41
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:05,219
They’re biologically regular, they’re generally very happy, and they have a positive

42
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:07,359
response to novelty.

43
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:09,120
These babies are good fun.

44
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,760
And their parents are well-rested and enjoying themselves.

45
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,519
A small proportion of babies are difficult.

46
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:22,920
These are categorised by being biologically irregular, they tend to be pretty unhappy,

47
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,250
and they have a negative response to novelty.

48
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,810
Sometimes, we call these colicky.

49
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,060
And another small portion of babies are considered slow-to-warm-up.

50
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:37,290
Now, they’re in-between the other two in terms of biological regularity and their hedonic

51
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,290
tone.

52
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:43,069
What really characterises them, is their response to novelty which is slow to warm-up.

53
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:48,480
At first, they don’t like anything new, but then eventually they come around.

54
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,689
It’s incredible how easy it is to classify babies according to these temperament categories.

55
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:59,389
But of course, the important question is, if these categories are applied in infancy,

56
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:01,819
what does it mean for later life?

57
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:05,799
If you’re an easy baby, are you going to grow up to be a happy-go-lucky, freewheeling,

58
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:09,139
extroverted, fun person, or not?

59
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:10,819
Is there any kind of continuity?

60
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:15,870
There’s a whole bunch of studies around the world looking at just this.

61
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,460
One of the largest is down in Victoria, out of the Australian Institute for Family Studies.

62
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,960
It’s known as the Australian Temperament Project.

63
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,480
All of their research output is on the web, if you’re interested.

64
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:33,039
They started testing children in the 1980s and now those children are in their 30s and

65
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:36,379
they’ve been following them all the way from birth.

66
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:40,750
What they find is that on some dimensions, there’s good continuity between temperament

67
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,800
and later personality.

68
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,129
The main finding of all of these studies is that in general, the correlation between temperament

69
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:52,060
as a baby and personality as an adulthood however, isn’t really that great.

70
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:57,970
It’s round about .3 if you look across all of the babies classified according to temperament

71
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,130
and then some sort of adult personality inventory.

72
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,440
It’s really not a very strong correlation except at the extremes.

73
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:13,430
So, when you have a super duper easy baby, he’s very likely to grow up to be that happy-go-lucky,

74
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,670
extroverted individual.

75
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:20,099
If you have a super duper difficult baby, he’s very likely to grow up to be someone

76
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:22,900
who is anxious and prone to negativity.

77
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,610
But in the middle, there’s a whole lot of swapping around.

78
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,009
And that probably has to do with an interaction of nature and nurture.

79
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:34,939
Temperament is certainly our nature, but so many things can affect it over time.
