Kohlberg came along, and he took Piaget&#39;s work a little bit further.

1
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,000
He was interested in the same kind of idea.

2
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,110
He tested 84 boys and men.

3
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,790
They ranged from five years of age, all the way to adulthood.

4
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,340
This study covers a huge range of ages.

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,480
He asked them about a series of moral dilemmas.

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,730
What Kohlberg ended up finding was six stages of moral development.

7
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:33,680
Here is one of Kohlberg&#39;s dilemmas, &quot;Joe is a 14-year-old boy who wanted to go to camp.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,370
His father promised him he could go if he saved up the money for himself.

9
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,829
So Joe worked hard at his paper route and saved up the $100 it cost to go to camp, and

10
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:45,670
a little more in addition.

11
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,829
Just before camp was going to start, his father changed his mind.

12
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,320
Then, some of his father&#39;s friends decided to go on a special fishing trip, and Joe&#39;s

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,970
father was short of the money it would cost.

14
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,140
He told Joe to give him the money he had saved from the paper route.

15
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,860
Joe didn&#39;t want to give up going to camp, so he thinks of refusing to give his father

16
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,590
the money.&quot;

17
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,229
The question here is, &quot;Should Joe refuse to give his father the money?

18
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:11,510
Why or why not?&quot;

19
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,540
What do you think?
