00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,870
Before there was any scientific study of what babies are thinking, this was a matter for

1
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,410
philosophers.

2
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:19,939
And philosophers going all the way back to Plato came up with pretty much two polar opposite

3
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:26,009
views which will be familiar to you: the nature and the nurture perspective.

4
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:31,460
The Nature perspective—and this can be attributed directly to Plato—is that a newborn baby

5
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:38,940
like this has, in his mind, nascent forms of everything that will ultimately unfold

6
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,059
into his adult life.

7
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:46,899
He has capabilities, skills, personality that’s already coded in there.

8
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:50,629
So, we would these days call that, a genetic perspective.

9
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:56,489
It’s all there, and what has to happen over the course of development is simply maturation.

10
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:01,019
What’s already pre-coded just has to come to fruition.

11
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:06,520
That’s not denying that there’s some environmental input required, but everything that is ultimately

12
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:13,110
going to be definitive in a psychological way for an individual is already pre-formed

13
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,110
in infancy.

14
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:19,710
Now that’s a very strong innatist or nature view.

15
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,590
The alternative, Nurture perspective is pretty much the polar opposite.

16
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,190
This view is that human babies are born with an absolutely blank slate of a mind.

17
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,320
There’s nothing in there yet.

18
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,970
Experience from the time of birth begins to write on that blank slate.

19
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:42,240
This view goes back to John Locke who made a metaphor of the blank slate.

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,200
William James, an American psychologist, proposed that a human baby is born into what he called

21
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,220
a blooming, buzzing confusion.

22
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,880
It’s all just craziness for that one-week old baby.

23
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,561
He hears things, he sees things, he feels things inside and outside of his body, he

24
00:01:59,561 --> 00:02:03,660
has no idea what’s what—it’s just all, confusion.

25
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:09,020
And then development, according to James, is a process of making sense of all that information

26
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,950
by associating things together.

27
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:17,579
And this refines the way babies respond to things, and ultimately what develops are the

28
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:24,609
cognitive capacities, the skills, and personality that are evident later in life.

29
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:28,840
So, the Nature view is that nothing is pre-formed.

30
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,510
Everything comes about as a result of experience.

31
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,269
Now, that doesn’t mean that there’s nothing innate.

32
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:41,019
But in this case the only thing that’s innate is the capacity to learn.So, these two completely

33
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:45,790
separate views were proposed by philosophers.

34
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,970
Nobody actually did experiments with babies until the 1960s.

35
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,530
Partly, that was because we couldn’t figure out good ways to do it.

36
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,420
Later on, we’ll talk about how we do experiments with babies these days; the clever techniques

37
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:06,480
that have evolved in the last 40 years or so, which really give us a genuine handle

38
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,190
on what babies are capable of.
