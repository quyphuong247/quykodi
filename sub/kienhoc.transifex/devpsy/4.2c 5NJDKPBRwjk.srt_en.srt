00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:11,270
For modern societies, adolescence has become its own life phase in and of itself.

1
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:16,379
James Marcia was interested in the ideas surrounding identity formation so he picked up where Erikson

2
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:17,800
left off.

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,260
He thought about this idea of an identity crisis.

4
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,600
For Marcia, experiencing some sort of crisis isn’t just having a bad thing happen to

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,600
you.

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,480
It’s having a bad thing happen to you, but then thinking about the issues, evaluating

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,570
your patterns from childhood, and deciding whether or not you want to continue those

8
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,960
patterns, or relationships, or whatever it is that is causing the issue for you.

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,860
For him, experiencing a crisis of identity means thinking through all of these issues,

10
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,100
and then making some sort of commitment to any changes you want to see in yourself.

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,390
And deciding to behave in a way that suits you as opposed to the way that you’ve always

12
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,489
known.

13
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:58,739
For Marcia, there were four different kinds of identity statuses, and you aren’t stuck

14
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,040
in just one.

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,190
You can move from one to the other.

16
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,750
But for him, the real issue is whether or not you had experienced a crisis, and whether

17
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,790
or not you thought through the bad events.

18
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,659
If you didn’t really think through the bad event, and you made some sort of a commitment

19
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:19,409
but without really thinking things through, then he’d consider that to be “foreclosure.”

20
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,209
If you didn’t think through the bad event and also didn’t commit to anything, that

21
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:26,350
would be “identity diffusion.”

22
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:31,250
If you had a crisis, you thought through it, you decided what you wanted to be but then

23
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,969
you didn’t commit to it, then he called that a “moratorium.”

24
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:40,200
And if you had a crisis, and you thought things through, and you make a commitment to the

25
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,979
changes that you wanted to see in yourself, then you have achieved your own identity,

26
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,709
what he called “identity achievement”.

27
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:51,560
Let me give you an example of what those categories might look like, because it’s a little bit

28
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,320
abstract.

29
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,880
For James Marcia, a person who&#39;s in “identity diffusion” is someone who’s not really

30
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,829
thinking things through, and not really making any kind of commitment.

31
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:03,829
They might say...

32
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:06,299
“I haven’t really thought about what I want to do with my life.

33
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,380
I guess I’ll keep my job delivering pizzas until something better comes along.”

34
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:16,520
“Foreclosure” would be what happens when you’re not thinking things through but you’re

35
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,530
going to make a commitment to not thinking things through.

36
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,530
You might say…

37
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,140
“I’m pretty much like my dad in being fit for the building trade.

38
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,180
If it works for him, it will work for me”.

39
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,790
So, you haven’t really thought through things, but you’re really going to commit to it.

40
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,860
“Moratorium”, is when someone is having a crisis, they’re thinking things through

41
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,930
but not making a commitment.

42
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,070
They would say something like, “I don’t know how capable I am as a person or what

43
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,530
jobs I’ll be right for.

44
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,250
I can’t decide on a course of study until I figure it all out”.

45
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:53,600
“Identity achievement”, is when someone is having a crisis, they’re thinking things

46
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,450
through and making a commitment.

47
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,700
They would say something like...

48
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,360
“I’ve thought long and hard about law as a career.

49
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,760
I’m pretty certain that’s for me”.

50
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,480
And, keep in mind that, you can have a different identity status for each crisis that you experience.
