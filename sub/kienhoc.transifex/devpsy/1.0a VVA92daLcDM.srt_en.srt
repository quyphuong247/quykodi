00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:10,000
How do we become the people we are?

1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,030
With our full-blown personalities, and our high IQs, our motivations, our dreams, our

2
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:21,400
skills — we all started out like this.

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,439
In the first two years of life, we go from being an extremely helpless individual to

4
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:33,079
being… someone who is capable of walking, talking, telling the difference between boys

5
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:38,220
and girls, starting to toilet themselves, feed themselves—it’s a phenomenal rate

6
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,740
of growth in the first two years of life.

7
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,570
I’ll be focusing on the early part of human development.

8
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,680
Developmental psychologists, in general, study change over time; in psychological phenomena

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,850
and across the entire lifespan.

10
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,650
A lot of developmentalists focus on infancy and early childhood because so much amazing

11
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:03,470
stuff happens in such a really short time.

12
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,940
Infancy has always fascinated people.

13
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:11,000
Infant means “without speech” and it’s traditionally considered the first two years,

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,420
even though babies do start using language after about the first twelve months of life.

15
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,759
But they don’t form sentences, really, or use language as their primary means of communication

16
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,899
until they’re about two years old.

17
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:27,490
Hence, “infant” referring to the first two years of life.

18
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,399
Now here’s a one week old person.

19
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:31,590
He’s pretty helpless.

20
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,130
Pretty uncoordinated.

21
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,540
Cute.

22
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,859
But apparently, not a whole lot going on.

23
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:38,859
Half-asleep.

24
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:39,970
Oh, there’s something.

25
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,250
Well that’s what they do.

26
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:48,670
That’s a baby who appears to be in a transitional state between being awake and being alert,

27
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,539
because he was sort of drifting in and out of sleep there.

28
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:56,909
When he was alert, you could see a bit of a spark in his eyes.

29
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,450
But, invariably, when people spend some time with a baby this age, they end up asking themselves

30
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,959
this question, what is going on inside there?

31
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,789
What is in that tiny mind?

32
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:10,160
He’s like me.

33
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,450
In fact, I was one of those just, in my case, 52 years ago.

34
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:22,420
Is there cognitive processing inside the baby’s mind that’s similar to that of adults?

35
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,720
Do they think the way we think?

36
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,020
Do they feel the way we feel?

37
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:32,530
Do they respond in anything like the way older people would?

38
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,200
In some ways you might think, well yes, of course!

39
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,070
There’s got to be continuity across human life.

40
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:44,170
He’s got a human brain, so probably he processes sensory information in similar ways to the

41
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,570
way we do.

42
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:50,690
But then of course, there’s no language there, and much of our thought is language-based.

43
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,310
And, he does looks pretty uncoordinated.

44
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,900
It was only in the last 40 years that people started trying to systematically address the

45
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,230
question of...

46
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,150
What is inside a baby’s mind?
