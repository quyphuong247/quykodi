00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:12,480
When we were babies, did we love our mothers because they satisfied our needs?

1
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,289
Is having our needs taken care of the most important thing that enables babies to develop

2
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:21,000
attachment to their primary caregivers?

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,369
Well, historically, and this is going back to the late 1800s, the view was that babies

4
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:32,640
love their mothers because she satisfies their needs.

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,190
This came out of Freudian Theory.

6
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:41,050
Sigmund Freud was an Austrian, first a medical doctor, and then became the Father of Modern

7
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,100
Psychoanalysis.

8
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,030
He was a prolific scientist, as well as clinician.

9
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:52,070
“Scientist” is probably a generous word, he aspired to be a scientist.

10
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,600
He didn’t really use the scientific method.

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,550
He was a prolific writer and theoretician.

12
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,789
He had theories about all sort of things from psychopathology, to human development, to

13
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,890
how the brain works.

14
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,409
A prevalent theory of his was what was known as Dependency Theory.

15
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,670
This theory was part of the dominant ideals and beliefs of the time.

16
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:22,070
Everybody turned to Freud in the late 1800s, and early 1900s, for his view of human nature.

17
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:29,509
Freud’s view was that babies are born as basically helpless balls of biological needs.

18
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:31,119
And that’s not wrong.

19
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,500
He said that when babies start to get hungry, their tummy rumbles, they’re in a state

20
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:41,190
of discomfort, they need something to satisfy their hunger, and then mummy turns up.

21
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,369
She holds the baby.

22
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:43,970
He can see her face.

23
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,850
She puts a nipple in his mouth.

24
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,390
He starts to suck.

25
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,670
He drinks the milk.

26
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:55,520
And he moves from a state of unpleasant biological need to satiated biological satisfaction,

27
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,659
and her face is the last thing he sees before he drops off to sleep in a state of perfect

28
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,719
bliss.

29
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,759
Then later on, he wakes up, and he’s pooped in his nappy, and it’s all sticky and yucky,

30
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,340
and he’s crying, and here she comes again, the angel lady, and there’s her face again!

31
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,239
His bottom gets wiped, and the clean nappy is there.

32
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:19,320
When he gets cold, he cries.

33
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,169
She calms him, and she wraps him up in a blanket.

34
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:30,570
She is repeatedly associated with this move from biological need to biological satisfaction.

35
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,950
Freud felt the babies were really quite primitive, and that they were really just sort of moving

36
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,220
from one physiological state to the next.

37
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,290
What happened over time was that infants came to love their mothers, show affection and

38
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:49,000
preference for her, because she was associated with all this good stuff that she kept giving

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,340
him.

40
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,160
The infant is motivated by the food, by the clean nappy, by the warm bed.

41
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:00,060
That’s what he really wants, and she’s kind of incidental because she’s always

42
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,510
associated with those things.

43
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:08,350
This was Dependency Theory, and it is just a theory except that it was used by many people,

44
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,360
including governments, to address social issues.

45
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:19,470
For instance, the orphanage system: that was a practical application of Dependency Theory.

46
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,900
Now these days, orphanage is just about a dirty word, right?

47
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,200
Although there are still orphanages in some places around the world.

48
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,609
Clinical research looking at orphans is still going on in some of those places.

49
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:36,410
We don’t have orphanages anymore in Australia.

50
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:40,870
This system was built on the notions from Dependency Theory that what’s important

51
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,280
for psychological development is that the child have their biological needs met.

52
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,220
It doesn’t matter who meets those needs, just that they can count on their needs being

53
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,350
met.

54
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:56,560
This is where you get this stereotypical image of the armies of nuns coming through or nurses

55
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,250
coming through rigidly on a schedule, feeding, changing, putting children to bed, and bathing

56
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,560
the children.

57
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,170
By the way, there was criticism of Dependency Theory at the same time that it was instantiated

58
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,590
in policy.

59
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,190
The criticism was that if babies only care about the stuff, then, for instance, when

60
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,930
they become toddlers, and they can walk around on their own, then they can get to the pantry

61
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,790
on their own, they should just fall in love with the pantry, right?

62
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:28,030
Why don’t they switch their allegiance from the mother to the pantry?

63
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:33,760
They spend much more time in their life feeding themselves than being fed by mother.

64
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:40,410
So why is there lifelong dependency on the mother, when physical dependency on her only

65
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,230
lasts a small portion of their early life?

66
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:51,090
Because of this, people criticised Dependency Theory, calling it the Cupboard Love Theory.

67
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,790
Now Dependency Theory drove the building and implementation of orphanages and the systems

68
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:02,490
with which orphanages were run, but what became pretty clear was that the outcomes for children

69
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,590
in orphanages were not very good.

70
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:10,910
It took some decades before people could sort of separate out the effect of the orphanage;

71
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:16,640
from perhaps the congenital problems that children who were orphaned, already came with.

72
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,130
They might have had early trauma if they were orphaned.

73
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,430
They might have had some sort of physical or early psychological problem that led the

74
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,620
parents to send them to an orphanage.

75
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,140
It’s hard to disentangle those things.

76
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,950
But what people did know from quite early on was that children who grew up in orphanages

77
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:40,640
weren’t as physically healthy, weren’t as psychologically healthy, and did relatively

78
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,470
poorly academically compared to children who grew up with families.

79
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,440
And that was unfortunate because there was a lot of money and a lot of thought going

80
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,260
into creating the most scientifically sound, best way to raise orphaned children, and the

81
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,200
outcomes just weren’t very good.

82
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,670
In fact, when people started doing really careful research, and were able to statistically

83
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:08,180
control for some of the mitigating factors, for example were able to directly compare

84
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,680
children from similar backgrounds, raised in an orphanage versus raised in a family––if

85
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,820
they got fostered instead of sent to an orphanage, people started to realise actually there was

86
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:24,040
something specific about the orphanage system that wasn’t working.

87
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,810
It caused a rethink, but it takes time.

88
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,930
When you’ve built places like this, and they’re all over the place, this is the

89
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,920
system that you’ve implemented, then it takes time to rethink and reconsider, what’s

90
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,340
a better way to do it?

91
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,840
And, you need a theoretical framework.

92
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,180
Something was needed to replace Dependency Theory.

93
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:45,680
What could that be?
