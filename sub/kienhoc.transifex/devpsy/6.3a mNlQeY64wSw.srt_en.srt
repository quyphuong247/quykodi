00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:09,660
Do you see any limitations with what Kohlberg did in his experiment?

1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,440
For some reason, Kohlberg only tested boys and men in his task.

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,660
So, people have challenged Kohlberg’s theory on this basis, and have subsequently looked

3
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,630
at gender differences.

4
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,400
In more modern approaches to how we think about moral reasoning, people have also examined

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,449
specific domains of reasoning within moral reasoning and how kids understand those.

6
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:32,870
And, finally, some have also considered role of parents.

7
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,970
Carol Gilligan, who was actually a student of Kohlberg, was one of the first people to

8
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,870
challenge his theory.

9
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,010
She repeated Kohlberg’s study, but this time, she tested men and women as participants.

10
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,300
What she ended up finding was that, women were most often in stage three, and men were

11
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,390
most often in stage four.

12
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,980
Gilligan is not arguing here that women are less morally advanced than men.

13
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,500
What she found was that, More often, women gave reasons like…

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,600
&quot;Joe shouldn&#39;t give his father the money because Joe sacrificed and worked hard in good faith...

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,820
&quot; whereas men more often gave reasons like...&quot;Joe has the right to refuse to give his father

16
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:13,040
the money because in a general sense, respect for property is important for order in society....et

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,040
cetera...et cetera.&quot;

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,970
What Gilligan argues is that this is actually a reflection of a cooperative kind of orientation

19
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,720
versus a justice kind of orientation.

20
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,890
Going back to Kohlberg’s stages, stage three is more about how Joe and his father are interacting,

21
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:31,140
and whether or not they&#39;re holding up their ends of the bargain, whereas, stage four tends

22
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,200
to be argued from the point of general rights, and whether or not it was a just thing to

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,920
do.

24
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,740
Gilligan argues that by failing to test half of the population, Kohlberg may have overestimated

25
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,830
the importance of progressing through the stages, and that maybe there are just different

26
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,729
kinds of moral reasoning that vary across people.
