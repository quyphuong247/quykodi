00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:11,350
From about the child’s first birthday to about the age of one and a half, there&#39;s this

1
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:18,510
period where they&#39;re basically pointing and uttering single word nouns: chair, doggie,

2
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,599
car.

3
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:25,420
In this period, known as the one-word stage, they&#39;re acquiring words, and uncharacteristically,

4
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,609
they do make some errors.

5
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:34,460
Most of the time, through our language development, there&#39;s very few errors happening, but children

6
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:40,820
make these referential errors in the first 50 words or so and they’re quite interesting.

7
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,620
The first kind of error is called an overextension error.

8
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,610
Chamberlain &amp; Chamberlain looked at this in 1904.

9
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:54,280
This is where you have a word that refers to one thing and babies overextend the reference

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,280
(Chamberlain &amp; Chamberlain, 1904).

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,481
For example, you&#39;ve got a little 14-month old, her daddy takes her out regularly, they

12
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:04,010
look up at the sky, they point, and they say, &quot;moon.&quot;

13
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,400
Baby points and says, &quot;moon,&quot; everybody enjoys that.

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,040
It seems like she knows what moon refers to, but then you bring her inside and when she

15
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,190
sees a cricket ball, she goes, &quot;moon.&quot;

16
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,490
When she sees the light bulb turns on, she goes, &quot;moon.&quot;

17
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,400
When she sees a circle drawn on a piece of paper, she says, &quot;moon&quot;.

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,690
Now, this is interesting because the baby hasn&#39;t had an opportunity in social context

19
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,500
to see other people refer to these things as moon.

20
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,640
She goes and does it on her own.

21
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,890
It&#39;s called an overextension error.

22
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,500
Just about all babies do overextensions.

23
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,480
Far fewer babies make underextension errors (Reich 1976).

24
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,300
Here, you&#39;ve got a common noun that they treat as a proper name.

25
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,620
So, the baby knows the name of the family pet as dog, but doesn’t extend that word

26
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,120
to any other dogs that she sees.

27
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,920
Two different kinds of errors, and there are some interesting debates about what these

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,090
errors signify.
