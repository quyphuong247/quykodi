00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,260
In contemporary societies, we have something of a different pattern because the average

1
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,180
age of menstruation for girls has declined.

2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:18,320
Right now, the average is about 12 years of age, and this age has been going down over

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,039
the past 150 years or so.

4
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,369
This is sometimes called the “secular trend”.

5
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:28,119
A secular trend is when something shows a long term, linear trend in a single direction

6
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:33,420
over time – in this case it refers to the secular trend in the age of menarche.

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,460
You can see here that this is the girl’s first year of menstruation––age is in

8
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,540
years.

9
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,950
This is the year that the data were collected.

10
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,769
You can see a very clear downward trend, where in 1860 the average age of menstruation was

11
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:49,140
between 15 and 16 years.

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,850
From then on, the average age of menarche decreases.

13
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:58,030
Some people suggest that this is due to improved nutrition and improved healthcare, which results in

14
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:03,840
better growth, and girls mature earlier, reaching their first menstruation at earlier ages.

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,780
While the average age of menstruation has

16
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,450
gone down, the average age of first marriage is going up.

17
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:15,049
In Australia, in 1974, the average age of first marriage for women was around 21,  and

18
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:16,560
for men it was 23.

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,829
But, in 2014, the average age for women was about 28 years, and for men it was about

20
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:22,829
30.

21
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:27,710
So, for both men and women, the age of first marriage has increased about 7 years since

22
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,020
the mid 1970’s.

23
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:34,719
So, what we get in contemporary societies is this much broader spread from the onset

24
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:40,100
of puberty to the part of your life where you actually take on all those adult responsibilities.

25
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,159
In terms of identity formation in contemporary societies, all of these adult roles, all these

26
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,590
things that you’re supposed to be heading towards: marriage, careers, having homes,

27
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,790
having children, now happen about a decade after the onset of puberty.

28
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,569
For contemporary societies, these events look very different from those of traditional societies.

29
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:02,499
They’re almost happening in a different phase of the life.

30
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:06,880
Adolescence has gone from a two or four-year phase in life to about eight to 15 years.

31
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,330
There are pros and cons to these changes.

32
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,470
One of the pros of this expanded adolescence is that it gives adolescents a whole bunch

33
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,080
of time to think about really deep questions like…

34
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,190
Who am I?

35
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,480
What do I want to be?

36
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,980
Who do I want to love?

37
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,260
And What do I believe in?

38
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,660
Adolescents have a lot more time and freedom before taking on adult responsibilities than

39
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,190
they used to.

40
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,040
Some people have suggested that this has been pretty fundamental in changing our cultures

41
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,790
over time.

42
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,940
One of the cons, people have suggested at least, involves that delay in social responsibility

43
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,780
– people are afraid that young people will never move out of their parent’s house.

44
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,030
But when it’s all said and done, at least from a cultural perspective, probably the

45
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,420
pros outweigh the cons.
