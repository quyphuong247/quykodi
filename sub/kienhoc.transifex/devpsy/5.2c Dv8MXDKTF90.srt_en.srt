Around 18 months is when infants start to show a sense of self, and this continues to

1
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,269
develop throughout ages 3 or 4 years.

2
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:18,990
But, in some ways, we&#39;re all still kind of developing our sense of self too.

3
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,730
For infants, the mirror of self-recognition test is used to assess the infant’s concept

4
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,350
of ‘self’.

5
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,430
What you do in this test is you take an infant and place them in front of a mirror.

6
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,290
What you want to know is if the infant understands that what they see in the mirror is them.

7
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,120
However, it&#39;s kind of hard to tell what they&#39;re thinking when you just place them in front

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,670
of the mirror.

9
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,420
What you do is you get a sticker or a marker, and then you put it on the infant&#39;s head or

10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,530
nose while they&#39;re not looking.

11
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,260
In this case, the infant has a little sticker on his nose.

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,710
He has been put in front of the mirror.

13
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,480
What you want to see is whether the infant reaches over to his own self and moves the

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,170
sticker off, or if they reach towards the mirror and try to get rid of the sticker.

15
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,159
If the infant realises that the reflection in the mirror is actually himself, then he

16
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,659
should reach towards himself, as there&#39;s no point in reaching towards the mirror.

17
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,660
This was how Beulah Amsterdam examined the emerging concept of self in 18-month olds

18
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,210
back in 1972.

19
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:21,550
By around 24 months of age, almost all infants in western societies pass this test.

20
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,830
They move the sticker off of their own face.

21
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,680
Other research that has modified this test has found that children start to recognise

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,130
themselves in photographs at around two years of age (Lewis &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 1979).

23
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,390
Children start recognising themselves in videos at around three years of age (Suddendorf,

24
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,390
Simcock &amp; Nielsen, 2007).

25
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,750
They then continue to develop recognition until they’re around 4 years of age when

26
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,600
they can consistently recognise themselves.

27
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,860
Along with my colleagues, Thomas Suddendorf and Virginia Slaughter, from the School of

28
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:50,110
Psychology here at The University of Queensland, we published a paper in 2006 that showed…

29
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,250
when children started to reach for the sticker on their nose in the mirror, they also reached

30
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,480
for a sticker placed on another part of their body, their legs in this case, that they could

31
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,910
only see in the mirror (Nielsen, Suddendorf &amp; Slaughter, 2006).

32
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:04,380
In another experiment, without the children knowing, we slipped their legs into a pair

33
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,390
of loose-fitting sweatpants that looked different from how their legs initially looked.

34
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:12,010
We found that, they didn’t reach for the sticker if the legs they saw in the mirror

35
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,830
didn’t correspond with what they thought their legs actually looked like.

36
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,459
However, when they were given the opportunity to view themselves wearing the sweatpants,

37
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:21,719
they reached for the sticker.

38
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:25,840
These results tell us that children have an idea of what they look like to others, and

39
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,560
any changes to their self-image can be updated very quickly.

40
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,349
Another way we can tell that infants seem to have a sense of self by 18 months of age

41
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:37,599
is that they start to talk about their own mental states.

42
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,540
In particular, they talk about the mental state of desire.

43
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,470
They might say things like…

44
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,650
&quot;Want cake,&quot; or their mental state of perception like...

45
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,650
&quot;See doggie”.

46
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,879
They&#39;re using two-word utterances or telegraphic speech––just keeping the main words together.

47
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:56,100
Eighteen months is around the time when they talk like this, when they talk about their

48
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,620
desire and perception.

49
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,810
It&#39;s not until infants reach around 30 months or around 2 and a half years of age that they

50
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,739
start to talk about thoughts.

51
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:07,720
They might say things like…

52
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,980
&quot;I think cake is yummy,&quot; or &quot;I think the doggie is cute.&quot;

53
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:18,599
So at first, infants talk about desire, perception, and then on to thoughts and beliefs.

54
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:23,469
This relates back to how mothers, at first, talk about what&#39;s the easiest thing for the

55
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,260
infant to grasp, which is desire.
