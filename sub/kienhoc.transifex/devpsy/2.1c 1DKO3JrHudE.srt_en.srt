A set of studies that are simultaneously famous and infamous came out of Harry Harlow’s

1
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,289
lab at the University of Wisconsin.

2
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:19,610
This work in the 1960s is not something that could ever be done today.

3
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:26,380
In fact, this work may have caused a reformulation of ethical principles in animal research.

4
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,560
So, this is what they did.

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,910
Harlow and his colleagues were fascinated by a social psychology question, an eternal

6
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,350
question.

7
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:40,160
We say, no man is an island, that we can’t function alone.

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,949
But they wanted to know if that was really the case.

9
00:00:42,949 --> 00:00:48,469
So, they wanted to take a social creature—in this case they used the animal model of a

10
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:54,769
rhesus macaque, and they wanted to isolate them from their social group and see what

11
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:56,859
influence that would have.

12
00:00:56,859 --> 00:01:01,280
Now, you can see, in a way, the link with the orphanage system.

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,280
Although obviously, orphanages are crowded, so it’s different, the orphans are out of

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,600
their natural context of a family.

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,470
They had this paradigm that went on for many many years whereby they had a rhesus macaque

16
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,630
troop in Wisconsin.

17
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:22,950
When a baby was born, they took it away immediately from the group, and they raised it in isolation.

18
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,450
Now, the isolation varied in the amount of time it lasted, and it also varied in the

19
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,140
form it took.

20
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:36,270
Extreme isolates had no social contact whatsoever, they were just raised pretty much in a white

21
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,670
box, but they were kept warm and dry and well-fed.

22
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:44,720
So, their basic biological needs were being met.

23
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,390
Dependency Theory should say, not so bad.

24
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:55,100
Others were raised with what they called surrogates, which were basically monkey mannequins.

25
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,640
They had a monkey face, and they had a wire body that the babies could crawl up on, to

26
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,020
sort of be naturally close.

27
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,960
The wire surrogate had a bottle on it, so that’s where the baby would feed.

28
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,200
Another wire surrogate had soft cloth covering it, so it was a little bit squishy, and smelled

29
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,480
kind of monkey-like after the baby monkey had spent some time on it.

30
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,490
Now, for these isolates who were raised with surrogates: one that they would feed on, and

31
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,610
the other they could cling to but couldn’t feed on, which surrogate do you think the

32
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,370
isolates spent more time on?
