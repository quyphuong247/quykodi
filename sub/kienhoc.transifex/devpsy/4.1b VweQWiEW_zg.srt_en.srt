00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:10,950
Boys who go through puberty early tend to have greater self-assurance.

1
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,320
They tend to be rated as more attractive and more masculine, and they tend to be more popular

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,110
with their peers.

3
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,510
These are all bonuses for boys who go through puberty early.

4
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:24,150
But it also turns out that the boys who go through puberty early tend to have increased

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,940
substance use, more delinquency, and more psychological issues.

6
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,340
So, there are some pros and cons to going through puberty early (Jones, 1943).

7
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,390
For boys who go through puberty late, they tend to be socially awkward.

8
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:41,570
They tend to misbehave in class a bit more than boys who go through early, possibly because

9
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,640
they’re trying to get some attention, or trying to set themselves apart.

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,450
And they do display some anxious behaviors.

11
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:52,420
But, it’s not just the immediate consequences of early and late puberty that are important.

12
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,440
There are some later consequences in adulthood that seem to be related to going through puberty

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,789
early or late.

14
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:04,110
For boys who go through puberty early, later on they tend to be more domineering but also

15
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,640
more responsible.

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,190
They tend to have a lot of self-control, but that can also make them rigid and a little

17
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,970
bit conforming.

18
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,960
They tend to be more advanced in their career but have some difficulty coping with stress,

19
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,150
and they can tend to have more intimacy difficulties.

20
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,470
Some of these may be related to things like having greater testosterone levels.

21
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,490
Early pubertal onset can be triggered by higher testosterone which could be responsible for

22
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,670
some of these later consequences.

23
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,860
It could also be that the anxious things they learn in the social hierarchy in high school—which

24
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,630
I think for most people resembles Lord of the Flies—if they take those skills into

25
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:43,190
the adult world, they find that the skills don’t tend to serve them very well.

26
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:47,910
These boys have to come up with new ways of dealing with other people and social interactions

27
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,250
if they’re going to participate in the adult world.

28
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,240
For boys who go through puberty late, later on in life they tend to have a good sense

29
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:02,250
of humor, clearer insight into issues, a sophisticated understanding of themselves, and good intimate

30
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,850
relationships.

31
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,670
It could be that not being the top of the social totem pole actually helps them out

32
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,119
later in life.

33
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,090
But there are a couple of different interpretations of this.
