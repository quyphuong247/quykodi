00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,910
A really important aspect of having a theory of mind is having this understanding that

1
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,240
other people have beliefs that might differ from your own beliefs or reality.

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,950
This is tapped in by the false belief test (Wimmer &amp; Perner, 1983).

3
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,779
Created by Wimmer &amp; Perner back in 1983, the false belief test is still thought to be the

4
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:25,320
litmus test for theory of mind.

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,900
It&#39;s really the hallmark of having that understanding that other people&#39;s behaviors or other people&#39;s

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,890
knowledge might differ from your own.

7
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,270
In this test, children are presented with two characters: Sally in a grey dress, and

8
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:44,040
has a basket, Anne in a yellow top, a dark skirt, and has a box.

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,269
Sally puts a marble in the basket, and then she goes away.

10
00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:53,420
While Sally is gone and not looking, Anne moves the marble into the box.

11
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,870
When Sally comes back, the question is...

12
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,380
Where will Sally look?

13
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,520
Where should she look?

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,920
Children around 42 months old would say that Sally would look in the box, while children

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,180
around 52 months old would say that Sally would look in the basket.

16
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,430
They have developed the understanding that just because you saw the object being moved,

17
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,470
it doesn&#39;t mean that the other person who didn&#39;t see it being moved would share that

18
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,229
same belief.

19
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:22,500
This is why it&#39;s called the false belief test.

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,210
Even though there seems to be slight cultural differences in the timing at which children

21
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:32,260
start to pass this false belief test, a major shift in theory of mind capacity happens around

22
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:38,440
four to five years of age, and this is seen across various countries and languages, including

23
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,740
North America, Europe, Australia, and Africa (Wellman, Cross &amp; Watson, 2001).

24
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,810
 For example, these guys over here, they are children from a hunter-gatherers society

25
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,229
in Cameroon called the Baka tribe.

26
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:54,539
When you&#39;re trying to do the theory of mind test––so let&#39;s say the false belief test,

27
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:59,810
which is the litmus test––with other cultures, you might want to make it more culture specific.

28
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,780
Instead of talking about the marble––suppose the Baka children have never played with a

29
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,380
marble––you might use nuts instead.

30
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,250
You might say, &quot;Sally put the nuts in the pot and moved it to the kettle or the basket,&quot;

31
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,090
something like that, just to make sure that it&#39;s culturally specific.

32
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:19,030
If it is culturally specific, these children also pass the false belief test around four

33
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,030
years of age.

34
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,250
This shift happens between three and six years across cultures.
