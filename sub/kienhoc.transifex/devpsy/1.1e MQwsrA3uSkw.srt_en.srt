00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,500
What can babies do?

1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,020
If you look at a little baby, it seems that they really can’t do much at all.

2
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:18,020
Baby’s voluntary activity is pretty much nearly non-existent.

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,060
It grows starting around the first two to three months.

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,949
There, you start to get some guided reaches.

5
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:28,330
You start to get some purposeful responses for instance, kicking the foot.

6
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:33,780
But at birth, what babies have that a lot of people don’t recognise is a suite of

7
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,260
new-born reflexes.

8
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:41,820
Now, we’ve all got reflexes and some of them we keep all our life like the blinking

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,510
reflex, or the swallowing reflex.

10
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:50,620
A reflex is a fixed action pattern which is involuntary; we can’t control it.

11
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,460
It runs off the same way every time when the appropriate stimulus is presented.

12
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,370
If you get poked in the eye, you’re always going to blink.

13
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:03,750
You can’t not blink because it’s involuntary and it’s going to be the same thing every

14
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,009
time—the eyelid closes.

15
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:08,259
Similarly, with swallowing.

16
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:10,969
Something goes past your epiglottis; you’re going to swallow.

17
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:14,340
You can’t not swallow under those conditions.

18
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,080
We’ve got a few reflexes that stay with us through our lives.

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,070
But in the first couple of months of life, we’ve got a set of around 20 reflexes.

20
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,770
Reflexes like the Moro, also known as the startle, the Grasping reflex, the Rooting

21
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,070
and Sucking reflexes, and the Stepping reflex are all there in babies.

22
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:39,829
They’re not there in older children, so a lot of these new-born reflexes disappear

23
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:44,850
between birth and two and six months after birth, meaning that you can no longer elicit

24
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,850
them.

25
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:51,180
But in the first six months, you can readily get babies to do these things.

26
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,889
The Moro reflex is actually used as an indicator of neurological health.

27
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:59,459
Babies don’t leave most hospitals unless they show a good strong Moro reflex.

28
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:02,159
Here’s what it looks like.

29
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,490
You elicit it by holding the baby at about a 45 degree angle, and then making him feel

30
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,550
like he’s going to drop.

31
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,550
And he runs off this behaviour pattern, which is very obvious.

32
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,200
He throws his arms out, and then crosses over his arms and his legs.

33
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,530
Arms out, cross over, arms out, cross over.

34
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,700
It’s the same every time, you could do it all day.

35
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,239
They’ll keep on doing it.

36
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,099
Now, that’s not something that you see in older children.

37
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:32,599
The Grasping reflex you also don’t see as a reflex in older children.

38
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:35,120
It becomes a voluntary action.

39
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,840
But in new-born babies, if anything touches their palm they grasp, and they’ve got a

40
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,150
strong grip.

41
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,480
These reflexes, it’s kind of clear what they’re all about.

42
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,870
The Moro reflex is associated with survival.

43
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,230
If you think back to the environment in which we were evolving, we didn’t have prams,

44
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,380
we didn’t have baby carriers.

45
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,510
The Moro reflex is one that’s protective.

46
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:02,970
If the baby, say, gets jostled or drops, he breaks his fall by throwing out his arms,

47
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,890
and then he grasps back on.

48
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,850
Similarly, the grasping reflex keeps him hanging on to whoever it is that’s carrying him

49
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,019
around.

50
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:15,840
Now, these are hypotheses, but they make good sense.

51
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,239
The Rooting and sucking reflexes are associated with feeding.

52
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:23,970
So, rooting is where you tickle the baby on the cheek and he turns his head towards the

53
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,970
stimulus.

54
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,170
The Sucking reflex, well, touch anything to the baby’s upper palate and he’s going

55
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,290
to suck.

56
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,580
Princess Diana knew about this and she used it when she had to take the little princes

57
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,110
to coronations, state ceremonies and places like that.

58
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,810
If you look, she’s always got her pinky in the baby’s mouth during the time when

59
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,189
he absolutely cannot cry.

60
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:48,970
Because she knew that if he’s sucking, he can’t cry.

61
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,329
And if something’s touching the roof of his mouth, he has no choice but to suck.

62
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:57,879
She didn’t want to leave her babies at home; so she took them and she made use of the sucking

63
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,519
reflex to keep them quiet.

64
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,370
So, we can see that a lot of these reflexes have to do with survival.

65
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,660
But then there’s some really interesting ones like the stepping reflex, which most

66
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,940
people don’t know about.

67
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,690
This is about a one month old baby.

68
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:18,700
You can tell because his head is big and the rest of him is pretty skinny and he’s also

69
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,200
pretty floppy in his body.

70
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,710
He is nowhere near ready to walk.

71
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,550
But he has a stepping reflex that all babies have which is elicited by holding him up in

72
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,920
this position and then touching his feet to the ground so the bottoms of his feet touch

73
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,110
the ground.

74
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,580
Look, did you know babies could do that?

75
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,580
They can all do it.

76
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,430
So, if you know a one-month-old, go home and try it.

77
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,880
You just have to sort of tilt them forward a little bit while their feet are touching

78
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,740
the ground and suddenly they start marching along.

79
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,960
That’s the stepping reflex.

80
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,740
Now the stepping reflex is really interesting, because the other ones you can see clearly

81
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:00,050
have immediate survival value, but what is the stepping reflex all about?

82
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,000
Babies aren’t going to walk for quite a long time.

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,120
And before they walk they’re going to go through a phase—97 percent of babies do—of

84
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,470
crawling on hands and knees.

85
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,380
The other three percent skip the crawling and progress straight to scooting around on

86
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,380
their butts.

87
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:23,180
So, if this reflex represents, say an inborn skill, an inborn capacity for bipedal locomotion,

88
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:29,090
why does it follow this bizarre developmental trajectory of being there early on, disappearing

89
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:34,140
for a while, and then coming back only after a period in which locomotion is in a completely

90
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,930
different form, namely crawling?

91
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,410
This is something that people debate, and again it sort of separates into nature and

92
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,410
nurture.

93
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:48,139
So, the nature people say, look, our brains have the motor program for walking and we

94
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:52,750
just have to wait for circumstances to be right—to have the strength in our back,

95
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:58,569
the postural control—in order for that innate program to manifest itself.

96
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:04,250
And the nurture people say, Well, if it’s an innate skill, how come it disappears and how

97
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,980
come when it comes back, it comes back through this circuitous route of crawling first?
