Puberty is an awkward time for humans.

1
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,310
The only saving grace during this weird time - is the fact that we must all suffer through

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,310
it.

3
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:17,800
Somehow, we have to work out a way to come to grips with all the physical changes - and

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,430
that’s job number one for adolescents.

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,040
Puberty alters body size, shape and functioning.

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,410
One of the first markers of puberty is a growth spurt.

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:32,840
This chart has age across the x axis starting at six years of age, and then the y axis has

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,860
the height gain per year, so this is a change measure.

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,750
Boys and girls both, tend to grow about six centimeters per year right until they hit

10
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,690
their growth spurt.

11
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,690
Then their growth increases.

12
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,080
For girls, they start to grow about eight and a half centimeters a year for a couple

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,739
of years, and boys grow about nine centimeters a year for a couple of years.

14
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,730
That results in a pretty rapid change in height for children (Tanner, Whitehouse, &amp; Takaishi,

15
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:56,730
1966).

16
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,720
In fact, my dad remembers when he was an adolescent, and was growing so fast that he found it difficult

17
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,350
to go to sleep at night because his legs hurt so much.

18
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,470
He was around six foot four in high school, so pretty darn tall for a 17-year old.

19
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,490
Some of these changes, particularly growth spurts, can happen so rapidly that it’s

20
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,310
uncomfortable for children.

21
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,969
And on top of that, they have to figure out how to control and move around in a body that

22
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:22,560
is getting very tall and has change proportions.

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,359
This height spurt marks the onset of puberty.

24
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:30,259
You can see that for girls it happens a little bit earlier than boys.

25
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:34,869
Girl’s puberty starts earlier than boy’s and ends earlier than boy’s.

26
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:38,359
Girls are starting their growth spurt here about 11 years, whereas boys don’t really

27
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:41,990
start to see their growth spurt until 13 or 14 years.

28
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,350
This is why when girls hit their growth spurt, girls are often a full head taller than their

29
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,409
male peers - because the boys don’t hit their growth spurt until a few years after

30
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:51,229
the girls do.
