Within the first six months, infants really develop a sensitivity to emotional cues, which

1
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,120
is very important in social situations.

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,560
Infants seem to show recognition of different emotions.

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,580
For example, Field and colleagues found in 1982 that infants as young as 36 hours from

4
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:28,680
birth could differentiate positive emotions like happy from negative emotions like sad.

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,390
They could also differentiate positive and negative expressions from surprised expressions

6
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,600
like this.

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,070
In addition, around five months of age, infants prefer to hear the sound that matches the

8
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,640
emotion of the face (Walker-Andrews, 1997).

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,260
For example, they prefer to hear a laughing sound that&#39;s matched with a happy face.

10
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:53,260
They prefer to hear [ha-ha-ha-ha-ha] matched with this happy face more than when the happy

11
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:58,620
sound is matched with a sad face, or when this happy face is matched with a sad sound

12
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,360
Â [boo-hoo].

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:06,040
So, infants really seem to be tuned in to the visual aspects of emotion, and also have

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,390
the ability to match the acoustic elements with the visual cues - which is pretty amazing.

15
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:15,360
They seem to be able to do this really well, especially for people who they&#39;re familiar

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,360
with.

17
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,650
If they are presented with photos of their mother, they are much better at making the

18
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,000
visual-acoustic association than if the photos are of strangers.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,210
Their ability to generalise increases across the first year of life.
