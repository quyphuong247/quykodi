00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,220
Here is an example of a child around three years old.

1
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:14,590
At the very most, she would have been talking for around two and a half years or so.

2
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:19,650
It&#39;s extraordinary what she’s accomplished in such a short time.

3
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,960
Especially considering she’s not just learning language.

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,710
There are other things to do as well.

5
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,449
Children are learning to walk, how to dress themselves.

6
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:33,600
They’ve been learning to toilet themselves, feed themselves.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,530
Work out right from wrong, boys from girls.

8
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,870
All of these things are happening at the same time that they’re acquiring language.

9
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,470
One thing to notice is how fluent she is at this young age.

10
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:51,650
Another thing to notice is that she clearly has a regional dialect even at this young

11
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:52,900
age.

12
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,720
However, she does make a grammatical error.

13
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,360
As a developmental psycholinguist, if you&#39;re studying language acquisition up until the

14
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,670
three-word stage, normally what you study is the children’s utterances.

15
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,440
You&#39;re interested in exactly what children are saying, and in what context.

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,550
Once you get to this stage and beyond, there&#39;s just so much language that many people

17
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,690
switch over to studying errors.

18
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:24,610
Now, errors are very rare, but when children make errors in language, they can be quite

19
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,430
telling about the processes underlying.
