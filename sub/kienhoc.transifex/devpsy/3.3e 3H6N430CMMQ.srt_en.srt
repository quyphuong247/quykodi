It was Susan Curtiss who wrote the book in 1977 called : &quot;Genie: Psycholinguistic Study

1
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,480
of a Modern-Day &#39;Wild Child&#39;”.

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,369
She stated that Genie was very sweet, and very communicative.

3
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:23,540
Genie acquired a vocabulary, but it was quite limited.

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,140
The real important thing was that she never really learned grammar.

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,510
She made word order errors from the time they started teaching her to combine words.

6
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,899
Now, it&#39;s hard to make much of this, isn&#39;t it, because she&#39;s not a normal child.

7
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:43,930
Not only had she passed the critical period for language acquisition, but she&#39;s had an

8
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,629
horrific early life.

9
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,580
So, it&#39;s hard to know what might have caused her abnormal language learning.

10
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:56,039
She never ever acquired much beyond limited telegraphic speech with word order errors,

11
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,280
which is pretty striking.

12
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,679
The other sad and striking thing was that after she had been sort of experimented with,

13
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:04,250
she didn&#39;t have a home.

14
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,170
Her mother was institutionalised.

15
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,960
Her father was dead.

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,640
And she ended up institutionalised herself, which is a really sad outcome for someone

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,250
who was so important at one time to this debate about language.

18
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,180
If you would like to read about Genie’s history, this book: &quot;Genie: A Scientific Tragedy&quot;

19
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,420
by Russ Rymer (1994).

20
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:28,770
It chronicles what happened to Genie both before and after she was discovered.

21
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,860
We might, at a stretch, say that Genie provides evidence for critical period of language acquisition.

22
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,080
But as I said, it&#39;s been hard to do because of all the confounding variables.

23
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,230
But, when you put it together with some other things, it does start to look like there probably

24
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,970
is a critical period.

25
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:50,901
For instance, we know that deaf children of non-signing parents, if they don’t learn

26
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:56,461
to sign before they&#39;re about seven, eight, nine years old, they will pick it up, but

27
00:01:56,461 --> 00:02:01,300
they&#39;ll never be fluent as deaf children who are brought up signing (Mayberry &amp; Eichen,

28
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,300
1991).

29
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,570
Similarly, we all know that if you move to a new linguistic environment as an immigrant,

30
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,540
from the age of seven, eight, or so, you&#39;re always going to speak with a bit of an accent.

31
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:17,280
Whereas, if you move earlier than that, for the most part, you won&#39;t speak with an accent.

32
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,110
We don&#39;t know for sure, but it does appear that there’s a critical period for language

33
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,000
acquisition.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,120
It&#39;s much harder to learn a new language after the critical period, and the learning process

35
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,630
seems different.

36
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,620
At least in the Genie case, there is some support for the nature view.
