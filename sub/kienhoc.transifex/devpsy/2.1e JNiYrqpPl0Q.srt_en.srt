0
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,540
Now, we’ve got terrible outcomes for children in institutions.

1
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,990
We’ve got ethology studies showing that there are other ways that parent-infant bonds

2
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,100
can form.

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,390
We’ve got Harry Harlow who has done specific tests and shown that, at least in the case

4
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,689
of monkeys, babies prefer to cling as opposed to feed.

5
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:29,619
That’s really kind of the death knell for Dependency Theory.

6
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:32,840
So, who’s going to step into the void?

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,320
Believe it or not, it’s a psychoanalyst, someone trained in Freudian Psychology, named

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,990
John Bowlby.

9
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,700
He read Ethology.

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,300
He read the animal studies.

11
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,550
Most importantly, he had spent a lot of time in his early clinical career in the orphanages

12
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,579
and he saw that Dependency Theory didn’t work.

13
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:58,820
So, he came up with a new theory that we now call Attachment Theory. it’s a slight

14
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,150
shift.

15
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,960
It may seem subtle, but it’s actually very profound.

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,990
He said that a baby loves his mother not because of the stuff she provides but because of something

17
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,460
intangible that she provides... security.

18
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:21,360
The infant is motivated not by anything physical, but by a feeling of safety.

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,579
Babies love their mothers because that’s where they feel safe and secure, and when

20
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:29,360
they’re close to their mothers, that’s where they are safe and secure.

21
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,579
Bowlby’s was an evolutionary theory.

22
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,289
He said that evolution has equipped us with a system called the Attachment Behavioral

23
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:41,130
System, and he likened it to a control system.

24
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,709
He said, okay, well, a control system is a thermostat.

25
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:48,219
That’s the classic example.

26
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:52,369
What you’ve got is a system that’s designed to maintain a steady state.

27
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:58,470
The set goal of a thermostat is the temperature you set it at, say 24 degrees, and as soon

28
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,869
as your environment deviates from that set goal, the system turns on.

29
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:06,529
If it gets warmer than 24, the aircon kicks in.

30
00:02:06,529 --> 00:02:10,440
If it gets colder than 24, the heat turns on.

31
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,421
Bowlby said that’s the kind of system that we’ve all inherited in the form of the Attachment

32
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:21,780
Behavioral System, where the set goal is proximity to the caregiver.

33
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,040
Why has that evolved?

34
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,030
Because that’s where as babies we’re safe, that’s where we’re likely to survive.

35
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,280
Babies want to be close to their caregivers because that’s where they have the best

36
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,700
chance of growing up.

37
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,920
The behavior is turned on until the set goal is reached.

38
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,810
As soon as you take a baby away from its primary caregiver, you get this.

39
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:49,080
System turns on: and you see crying, whining, clinging, approaching.

40
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,470
The behaviours take lots and lots of different forms.

41
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:59,250
That baby has learned that... crying... and... whining will get his caregiver’s attention

42
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,610
and get him closer to the caregiver.

43
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,120
So, he’s going to do those things.

44
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,930
For most of them, it’s crying because we don’t like the crying, so we approach and

45
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,950
we do something to try to stop it.

46
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,060
That’s what the system looks like turned on.

47
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,710
There’s the set goal.

48
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,720
It’s been reached.

49
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,510
All these babies are in the arms of their mothers.

50
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:25,570
I don’t know if you recognise, on the left-hand side, that’s me many years ago.

51
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,960
That little girl is now an adult.

52
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,680
But then, as a baby, she’s in her mother’s arms and she’s happy.

53
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,880
She’s got a little residual cling, but otherwise her set goal is fully reached and her system

54
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,060
is turned off.

55
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,470
Let me now show you a dynamic image of the Attachment Behavioral System at work through

56
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,970
separation and reunion.

57
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,920
This is a one-year old baby boy.

58
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,819
He’s in a room with his mother and a stranger.

59
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:53,819
Mother leaves.

60
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:57,120
Now, watch the system turn on.

61
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,310
Mother comes back.

62
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,940
Watch the set goal get reached.

63
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,750
You would have seen many of these through your life.

64
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,780
All good now.

65
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,780
There’s mummy.

66
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,850
As soon as he’s in proximity, everything is turned off.

67
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:15,540
Bowlby said we’re all born with this system, that it’s one of the most important behavioral

68
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,230
systems that we have because it ensures our survival.

69
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:24,340
It’s every bit as important as feeding and mating, all of which are also essential for

70
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,810
survival.

71
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:31,070
He said that the onset of the attachment behavioural system is timed with locomotion.

72
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,280
It begins to develop in the first few months of life, but then really kicks in once babies

73
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,690
start being able to crawl around on their own.

74
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:44,270
Now, remember, babies are born with already a preference for attending to peoples’ voices,

75
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,990
a preference for their own mother’s voice, a visual system that enables them to memorise

76
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,870
the faces of their primary caregivers.

77
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,180
And prefer their smell as well.

78
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:00,290
Over the first few months, babies are developing a strong representation of their primary caregiver,

79
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,610
and they start showing attachment behaviors.

80
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,890
But, once they can locomote, then the system really kicks in.

81
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,450
Why?

82
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,030
Because that’s the point when they’re most vulnerable.

83
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:15,220
If they don’t have an Attachment Behavioral System that maintains proximity to their caregiver

84
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,070
and they’re crawling, they can just crawl right off into the night.

85
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:25,550
So, the Attachment Behavioral System becomes very strong just when babies start to locomote.

86
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:29,270
And indeed, at around nine months is where you see the strongest stranger anxiety.

87
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:34,050
That’s where children who used to be pretty happy to go sit on auntie’s lap now don’t

88
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,470
want anything to do with auntie, they just want to stick close to mother.

89
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,600
That’s the Attachment Behavioral System really kicking in.

90
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,850
Here’s a perfect example: babies crawling into a potentially dangerous situation and

91
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:50,050
constantly looking back in order to ensure that the primary caregiver is maintaining

92
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,590
proximity.

93
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,490
It doesn’t have to be skin to skin proximity, but you’ll find that children always want

94
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,240
their parents watching them, and within a certain distance.

95
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,320
Just go in the park and you’ll see it.

96
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,380
As soon as they start doing something that’s halfway dangerous it’s…

97
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,800
Mum, look at me.

98
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,960
Mum, look at me.

99
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,250
Mum, watch.

100
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,600
They want to have that contact when they’re moving into danger.

101
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,240
If mum starts to walk away, that’s not good enough.

102
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,830
They’re going to follow her to maintain certain proximity.

103
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:24,500
Bowlby presented this new theory to the British Psychoanalytic Association in the early 1960s.

104
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,930
He published it soon after.

105
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,730
When he presented it to the Freudians, they didn’t like it.

106
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,670
In fact, he was nearly booed off the stage during his Keynote address, because they were

107
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,310
all Dependency theorists.

108
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:40,260
It completely mucked up their Freudian view of what babies were capable of and where the

109
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,290
basic attachment comes from.

110
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,480
So, he kind of left that licking his wounds a bit.

111
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:52,389
After he published Attachment Theory, then slowly, non-psychoanalytic people started

112
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:57,930
to get interested.Now, what are your thoughts on Attachment Theory?

113
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,830
Do you think it’s a good alternative to Dependency Theory?

114
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:06,169
Bowlby spent a lot of his time in orphanages––where many many children ended up during World War

115
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:07,650
II.

116
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,710
What should we do in such a situation?

117
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,290
They’re many children without parents.

118
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:16,680
It was clear that the orphanage system wasn’t very good for children.

119
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,169
What would be the practical implication from Bowlby’s Attachment Theory in this situation?
