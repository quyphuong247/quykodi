0
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,000
We can all help others.

1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,380
And we do.

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:14,049
We help our family, friends, neighbours, and even strangers in countless ways.

3
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:17,030
Imagine a world in which nobody helped anybody do anything.

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,029
Our society would break down.

5
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:23,740
When and how does our prosocial behaviour develop?

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,530
Between 6 to 18 months, in particular, the beginning of the 2nd year of life, is when

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,000
infants start to engage in prosocial behavior.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,090
The first prosocial behavior that they show is helping.

9
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,489
Helping behaviour emerges around 14 months of age.

10
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:44,390
In experiments evaluating infant helping behaviour, the experimenter typically tries to do something,

11
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,890
like putting pegs on the clothes line.

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,670
The experimenter then drops a peg in the middle of completing their task.

13
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,980
The infant then quickly walks over, picks up the peg, and gives it back to the experimenter.

14
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,250
In another experiment, the experimenter carries a pile of books from one end of the room to

15
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,989
a cupboard that’s located on the other side of the room.

16
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,530
When they get to the cupboard, they make it obvious to the infant that they can’t put

17
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,759
the books inside the cupboard because the doors to the cupboard are closed.

18
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,100
The infant then walks over and opens the door for the experimenter.

19
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,159
Infants love to help.

20
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,240
Some people have argued that this helping behavior seems to suggest that infants might

21
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,920
understand the other person&#39;s needs, or the other person&#39;s mental state that they need

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,469
the help.

23
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:29,469
Others have argued…

24
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:34,280
&quot;Do you really need to go into the other person&#39;s head to know that you should be picking that

25
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,280
up?

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,700
Because you can see that the peg just fell on the floor, you don&#39;t have to think about

27
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,700
the other person.

28
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,369
You can see that it fell and just go and pick it up.&quot;

29
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:47,439
So, some people argue that this might be a fundamental form of understanding other people&#39;s

30
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,020
mental states.

31
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,950
Others argue that this might just be an association between a behavior and an action.

32
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,909
So, these are the two sides to the argument.
