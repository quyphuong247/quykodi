00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,110
JOHN SING: The next component of planning is scheduling.

2
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,350
Scheduling is all about how you plan to manage your time when

3
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,070
undertaking a project.

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,130
Time is often the least flexible aspect

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,380
of what we call the triple constraints of project

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,650
management.

7
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,950
The triple constraints that are common to all projects

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,870
are quality, cost and time.

9
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,750
Compromising any one of these elements

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,480
usually impact negatively on the others.

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,170
In project management, a schedule

12
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,160
represents the planned duration of the individual tasks

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,320
of the project overall.

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,950
There are five key elements associated with time management

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,111
of a project.

16
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:43,485
These steps are fairly intuitive,

17
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:45,980
so let's identify the key processes

18
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,620
before exploring each in a bit more detail.

19
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,930
They are defining the activities,

20
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,030
then sequencing these activities,

21
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,010
estimating the activity resources required,

22
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,010
estimating the activity duration to complete

23
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,250
and developing the schedule.

24
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,750
It is important to note that the development of the schedule

25
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,730
can only occur once all of these processes have been completed.

26
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,400
Why do we need to take these steps

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,257
before developing a schedule?

28
00:01:10,257 --> 00:01:12,590
The main reason for this is that a project manager needs

29
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,080
to gather and analyse all relevant information and be

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,730
very accurate in assessing how long each activity will take.

31
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,780
Once both resources and duration have

32
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,450
been assessed and estimated, a working schedule

33
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,930
can be handed over to the project

34
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,410
stakeholders for review.

35
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,050
Now that we are more aware of the process,

36
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,150
let's slow this down a bit and unpack

37
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,460
each of the steps in a bit more detail.

38
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,430
First, you need to define the tasks that

39
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,980
need to be performed to produce the project deliverables

40
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,960
or outcomes.

41
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,240
These actions must relate to the deliverables as determined

42
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,290
in your work breakdown structure.

43
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,560
If a task does not fit with the work breakdown structure,

44
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,774
then either the activity is unnecessary

45
00:01:52,774 --> 00:01:54,940
or something has been left out of the work breakdown

46
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,840
structure.

47
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,790
Once you have defined the activities,

48
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,330
the activities need to be sequenced.

49
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,740
Sequencing activities involves making decisions

50
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,900
about the process flow of the tasks that

51
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,840
need to be completed.

52
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,949
In addition, certain tasks might be related.

53
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:13,170
So you'll also need to identify any dependent relationships

54
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,820
between them.

55
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,070
You can then move on to the next step, which

56
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,050
is estimating the resources required

57
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,920
for undertaking each activity.

58
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,840
These resources might include materials, people and equipment

59
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,460
to perform a particular activity.

60
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,400
Estimating activity resources is closely linked

61
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,950
to assessing and estimating the duration of each activity.

62
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,952
Estimating task duration requires

63
00:02:36,952 --> 00:02:38,660
you to consider the amount of work needed

64
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,310
to complete individual activities using the estimated

65
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,920
resources.

66
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,550
As you might have noticed, resources and time

67
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,710
co-exist with one another.

68
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,320
The final step of time management

69
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,830
is developing the schedule.

70
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,550
The development of a schedule represents

71
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,660
the output of the preceding five input

72
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,240
processes that we have identified.

73
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,100
By applying this process you have now defined, sequenced,

74
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,210
and estimated the necessary resources and duration

75
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,690
of all the activities, which contribute to the production

76
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,426
of the deliverables.

77
00:03:09,426 --> 00:03:10,800
The initial draft of the schedule

78
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,133
is prepared to combine all of the requirements that have

79
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:14,870
been collected at this point.

80
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,430
Scheduling is core to the planning process.

81
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,380
And it is important to note that the schedule can and should

82
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,410
be refined multiple times before the implementation

83
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,110
phase of the project commences.

84
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,770
Constant monitoring and review in a changing environment

85
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,470
is a key contributor to success throughout the project life

86
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,360
cycle.

87
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,210
Let's use Janet's DIY home improvement tiling project

88
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,750
to illustrate the scheduling process.

89
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,660
How might she approach this?

90
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,660
You may recall that she has allowed herself

91
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,850
four weekends for this project.

92
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,460
In doing so she has identified the amount of time

93
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,980
it will take her to complete the project.

94
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,840
Before compiling the actual schedule

95
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,270
it would be advisable to follow the scheduling process.

96
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,270
A template, much like this one, can

97
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,060
be used to complete a scheduling process.

98
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,640
This is an easy and intuitive way

99
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,290
to think about your project, what needs to be done,

100
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,590
the resources required and duration

101
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,742
to complete each activity.

102
00:04:08,742 --> 00:04:09,242
