00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,510


1
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,950
Janet recently bought a house outside of the city

2
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,320
with her boyfriend Ben.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,660
It's a bit of a fixer upper.

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,630
But it has a big garden and she got it at a good price.

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,300
But as we all know, with every good deal,

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,800
some additional work will need to be

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,020
done to make it a dream home.

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,530
Part and parcel of selecting a fixer upper

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,920
is understanding that DIY activities

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,552
will need to be completed.

11
00:00:29,552 --> 00:00:31,010
They were things that Janet and Ben

12
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,377
could both live with like the old fireplace that

13
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:36,780
was no longer working, some shabby carpets on the floors,

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,760
and a garden that was in serious need of landscaping.

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,660
However, the one thing that needed the most attention

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,790
was retiling the kitchen floor.

17
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,560
Janet knew that the kitchen would be the heart of her home.

18
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,510
And It needed to be just the way she wanted it.

19
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,930
Although Ben wasn't really one to tell her what to do

20
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,370
or how to do it, she had to frequently consult with him

21
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,890
to ensure they would both be happy with the final outcome.

22
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,140
Janet called this project her DIY project.

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,270
It really was a series of firsts, her first house,

24
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,430
the first time she owned something independently,

25
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,350
and the first time she would be undertaking any kind of DIY

26
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,810
tiling activity.

27
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,840
Since it was the first time, Janet

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,280
didn't really know where to start

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,360
or what she needed to consider.

30
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,130
She knew that she wanted to have this completed within a month

31
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,740
since she could only dedicate time

32
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,370
to do work on the weekends.

33
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,192
She knew the type of tiles that she wanted to use

34
00:01:29,192 --> 00:01:30,650
and the approximate amount of money

35
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,150
she was prepared to spend.

36
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,930
But beyond that, she didn't know much else.

37
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,260
Janet considered this to be a one woman

38
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,540
job with occasional input and ideas from Ben.

39
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,970
It was therefore left to Janet to determine

40
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,170
what she needed to do and what she wanted

41
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,380
the final outcome to look like.

42
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,874
