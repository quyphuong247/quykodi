00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,410
ANTON JORDAAN: Closure forms the final phase of the project life

2
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,480
cycle and formally brings together

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,600
the end of the project and the handover of the completed

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,740
project to the buyer or sponsor.

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,240
Closure of the project also requires consolidation

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,010
of communications with your team and other stakeholders

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,964
and obtaining feedback about the success of the project.

8
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:33,130
Key questions that need to be answered in this phase

9
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,070
are, were the original objectives of the project

10
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,280
delivered?

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,330
What do I need to measure?

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,500
How will I give and receive feedback?

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,150
And do I understand the project management journey?

14
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,050
It is at the end of this phase that you'll

15
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,340
be able to assess whether the time, effort,

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,970
and all the energy you put into the initiation and planning

17
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,846
phases of your project have paid off

18
00:00:55,846 --> 00:00:58,220
and whether you have achieved the initial objectives that

19
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,370
were set out in the initiation phase of the life cycle.

20
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:02,880
