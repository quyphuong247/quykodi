JOHN SING: To complete the initiation phase of the project

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,780
management life cycle, you need to create

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,271
an overview of the project, no matter how large or small.

4
00:00:16,271 --> 00:00:17,895
This will provide you with a bird's eye

5
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:19,450
view of what you need to consider

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,260
before you start planning.

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,250
As you can see, the initiation template

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,870
considers the key issues you need

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,600
to be clear about before undertaking a project.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,460
Let's work through the template together using Anne's wedding

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,520
planning project as an example.

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,860
Let's review this by following the process step by step.

13
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,330
We can begin by looking at the first item, which

14
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,960
requires clarification of what the project is all about.

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,860
This is usually relatively simple and straightforward,

16
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,280
but certainly an important consideration.

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,190
The next element that needs to be considered

18
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,120
is the purpose of the project.

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,300
In other words, why is the project being undertaken?

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,140
In reference to the wedding planning,

21
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,100
it is to ensure that the bride and groom are

22
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,020
happy with the end result, which is the wedding event.

23
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,710
Now we need to provide some detail

24
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,900
on the background of the project that is to be undertaken.

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,350
Another important element that needs to be considered

26
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,490
is to specify the project objectives that

27
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,310
need to be achieved.

28
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,310
Remember, it is often easier to break down

29
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,330
one objective into shorter more achievable tasks

30
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,090
that can be achieved and measured.

31
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,730
Next up, you would need to consider

32
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,880
any and all requirements to ensure the specific objectives

33
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,990
can be met.

34
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,670
In this initiation template, you'll

35
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,020
also need to think about potential risks

36
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,210
to your project.

37
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,610
At this stage you are only giving

38
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,040
some high-level consideration to what these risks might be.

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,310
This is merely an overview at this point.

40
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,900
Now identify who is involved in the project, which

41
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,170
in these case is Anne and possibly her assistant.

42
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,860
Also think about identifying other stakeholders

43
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,130
you will be engaging with over the project life cycle.

44
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,040
So when you now view the template

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,190
you will have adequate information on the project

46
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,310
you're about to proceed with before you

47
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,732
undertake any of the detailed planning to make it happen.

48
00:02:00,732 --> 00:02:01,232
