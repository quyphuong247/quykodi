ANTON JORDAAN: This week's lessons

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,020
are framed around planning a project.

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,180
Planning is integral to the success of a project.

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,360
As you may have heard the old adage, failing to plan

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,890
means planning to fail.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,180
And this is completely true for project management.

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,390
The planning of a project requires diligence, investment

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,380
of time, and gathering sufficient information

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,490
to enable you to build a detailed plan that helps avoid

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,770
as many mishaps as possible.

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,830
So, what is involved in the planning phase of the project

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,430
life cycle?

13
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,130
We will focus on three key areas.

14
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,280
First, there is the scoping of the project.

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,040
In other words, determining and agreeing

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,310
the activities to meet and complete

17
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,940
the requirements of the project.

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,570
The second planning element is scheduling the project.

19
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,190
Scheduling involves placing the necessary activities

20
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,930
into a time frame for completion.

21
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,730
And finally, planning requires an estimation

22
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,310
of the cost of undertaking the project.

23
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,080
Cost considers the time and resources

24
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,910
required to complete the project within the planned schedule.

25
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,400
The project manager must then work

26
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,770
within the cost and budgetary requirements of the project.

27
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,990
Now that we have introduced some of the key issues

28
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,800
of the planning phase, let's turn our attentions

29
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,300
to the key questions for this week.

30
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,010
How do you define the scope of a project?

31
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,800
What planning needs to be done?

32
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,630
What resources do I need?

33
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,010
When does it need to be done by?

34
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,400
And how much will it cost?

35
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,720
Now that the issues have been framed,

36
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,260
we are now in a position to take a closer look at the elements

37
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,180
of scope, schedule, and cost.
