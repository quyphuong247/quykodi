00:00:07,276 --> 00:00:08,650
STELLA BACHTIS: Now that you have

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,360
had a go at preparing your project schedule,

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,320
let's take a look at the optimum way

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,500
to put the schedule together.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,820
As you can observe, the initial 63 day schedule

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,830
has now reduced to a duration of 39 days.

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,370
It is worth noting that the individual 11

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,480
activities are still the same duration as before.

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,870
The reduction in days is the result of sequencing activities

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,770
in the schedule.

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,810
We knew that the first three activities

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,860
would remain unchanged because they

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,180
were dependent on a previous activity

14
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,660
before they could be undertaken.

15
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,110
However, if we take a closer look

16
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,420
at the next four activities, activity number four,

17
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,940
installing roof frames, number five, plumbing,

18
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,770
number six, wiring, and number seven,

19
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,500
assembling the external walls, they

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,870
are activities that can likely be done simultaneously

21
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,319
since none of those activities are dependent

22
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,030
on the completion of another activity immediately before it.

23
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,430
Covering the roof can be done soon after the roof frames

24
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,690
are erected.

25
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,880
But again, it does not need the plumbing or wiring

26
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,430
to be in place before it can be completed.

27
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,230
The interior walls and external finishes

28
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,260
have their individual time frames

29
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,290
that are dependent on other activities being completed.

30
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,990
Looking at the schedule, you can see that the total days are now

31
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,650
reduced to the required 39 by completing

32
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,910
some activities simultaneously.

33
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,540
By reducing the amount of time to complete

34
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,850
the project in 39 days, we have been able to fast track

35
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,250
the schedule.

36
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,100
This means that we have been able to complete the project

37
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,150
within a shorter amount of time without adding

38
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,970
any additional resources.

39
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,280
So let's recap what we have learned

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,450
about scheduling so far.

41
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,250
We have taken a set of activities

42
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,920
that are required to complete the building of a house.

43
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,800
The next step was to place them in an order

44
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,540
that they need to be completed.

45
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,700
Once the ordering of activities was in place,

46
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,580
we then looked at how we could reduce

47
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,180
the amount of time taken to complete

48
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,250
the building of the house.

49
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,540
In other words, we fast tracked the schedule.

50
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,650
Now let's take it a step further.

51
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,570
Let's take the situation where one of the stakeholders

52
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:35,560
wants you to complete building the house within 35 days.

53
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,890
Reducing the number of days in the schedule for a second time

54
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,630
is also known as crashing the schedule.

55
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,790
This kind of request, regardless of the project,

56
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,150
should raise alarm bells for you.

57
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,510
Ideally, the first choice should be for you to say no.

58
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,380
Crashing the schedule brings about its own new set

59
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,550
of risks that possibly have not been anticipated.

60
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,140
However, if saying no to decreasing the schedule

61
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,010
is not an option, what are your alternatives?

62
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,860
There are two ways to meet the new deadline.

63
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,490
The first is to increase the amount of resources used,

64
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,960
which will inevitably increase the cost of the project,

65
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,880
and we will work over our budget.

66
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,670
Alternatively, we compromise on the quality

67
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,320
of the final project by cutting corners

68
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,930
to ensure we meet the new 35 day deadline.

69
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,710
We could possibly employ an extra plumber and electrician

70
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,250
to reduce the amount of time they

71
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,560
spend on their respective activities.

72
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,700
And perhaps, add another resource

73
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,200
to help complete the interior and exterior

74
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,030
finishes of the house.

75
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,220
But this will be over budget.

76
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,650
Your decision lies in the initial project outcomes,

77
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,520
which was to build a house.

78
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,990
You need to carefully consider whether you can compromise

79
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,700
on quality in this situation, or whether you run

80
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,660
the risk of being overbudget.

81
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,020
Regardless of your decision, remember

82
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,050
that the project manager is always

83
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,490
accountable for any decisions made during the project

84
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,040
lifecycle.

85
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,750
