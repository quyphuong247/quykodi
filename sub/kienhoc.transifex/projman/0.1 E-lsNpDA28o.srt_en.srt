00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,320
FRANK SCHULTMANN: Hi, my name is Professor Frank Schultmann.

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,900
I'm from the University of Adelaide in Australia,

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,490
and on behalf of the Introduction

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,540
to Project Management team, I'd like

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,280
to welcome you to our course.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,930
Our team consists of me, Dr. Anton Jordaan, Dr. John Sing,

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,820
and Stella Bachtis, all from the University of Adelaide.

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,430
We've assembled a range of resources, and tools,

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,000
and templates, which we are looking forward

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,030
to sharing with you.

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,460
This course assumes no prior knowledge of project management

12
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,770
theory, and will focus on the key areas of project management

13
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,780
and application of project management skills

14
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,770
that are applicable to all projects, large and small.

15
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,290
We will embark on a six week journey

16
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,250
through the four stages of the project life cycle.

17
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,870
You will use a project management canvas

18
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,380
as your frame of reference.

19
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,550
Project management covers a diverse set of industries

20
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,240
and sectors, and can be as simple

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,030
as a small, do-it-yourself makeover project at home,

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,380
or something more complex like the construction of a building.

23
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,290
Our view is that project management transcends

24
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,900
the stereotypical view of the individual with a hard hat

25
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,360
on, managing a large construction project.

26
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,680
Chances are that you too are a project manager,

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,960
applying basic project management skills into your day

28
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,220
to day experience at home or at work.

29
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,590
To this end, we have assembled a great range

30
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,780
of resources and activities, including videos, discussions,

31
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,050
interviews, templates, and interactive activities.

32
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,920
At the end of each week, we've included a short summary video

33
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,690
by applying the project management canvas.

34
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,630
In addition, here, too, I will host

35
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,920
a frequently asked questions section

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,930
to reaffirm the learning of the week.

37
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,480
You will also have the opportunity

38
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,980
to undertake a short quiz so you can test what you've

39
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,940
learned throughout the week.

40
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,120
We will be sending reminders each week,

41
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,130
so look for us in your email inbox.

42
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,800
In the meantime, here's a brief overview

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,550
on how we've organised the course.

44
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,560
In week one we'll be providing you

45
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,890
with an overview of the key of characteristics of project

46
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:28,780
management and the phases of the project management life cycle.

47
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,460
You will be introduced to three scenarios

48
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,630
that we will be referring to over the six week time frame.

49
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,930
You will spend some time considering five dimensions

50
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,980
of successful project managers, and consider your own strengths

51
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,780
and areas of possible development.

52
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,050
In week two, we introduce the project management canvas

53
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,990
and course overview, and immediately thereafter

54
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,570
focus on the first phase of the project management life cycle,

55
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,430
known as initiation.

56
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,410
Using one of our scenarios, we will

57
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,620
focus on how to identify the problem or issue that

58
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,880
needs to be solved in the project,

59
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,690
and the options that need to be considered.

60
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,160
You will be shown how to complete

61
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,280
a template for the initiation phase

62
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,230
to ensure you have sufficient detail

63
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,920
of the project in this foundational stage

64
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,620
of the project life cycle.

65
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,970
In week three, we will focus on planning the project.

66
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,810
This is usually the largest part of the life cycle,

67
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,010
and needs sufficient attention and detail to get it right.

68
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,840
We will consider three main elements

69
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,460
of planning, which are scoping, scheduling, and costing.

70
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,380
Without planning these elements in sufficient detail

71
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,300
you're likely setting up your project to fail.

72
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,310
You will have the opportunity to complete

73
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,030
some interactive activities to embed

74
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,100
your understanding of how you might

75
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,960
go about planning a project.

76
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,330
In week four we will discuss risk.

77
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,100
Risk is inevitable to every project.

78
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,470
This week focuses on the identification and assessment

79
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,840
of risks, and how you might go about reducing or mitigating

80
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,230
risks for your project.

81
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,560
You will engage with an interactive activity using

82
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,050
a risk identification tool that can

83
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:17,220
be applied to one of our chosen scenarios or your own project.

84
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,200
In week five, we will examine the role

85
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,990
of leadership, communication, and stakeholder engagement

86
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,390
which form part of the execution phase of the project management

87
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,120
life cycle.

88
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,750
These integrated activities require a range of skills

89
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,820
and careful consideration for successful implementation.

90
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,110
You will be able to assess your own leadership

91
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,010
skills through an interactive activity

92
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,860
and determine your areas of strength and future

93
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,680
development.

94
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,320
Lastly, in week six we will enter the final phase

95
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,410
of the project life cycle, which is known

96
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,680
as closure of the project.

97
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,780
We discuss the key areas around project completion,

98
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,890
lessons learned, and handing over the final deliverable

99
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,660
to stakeholder beneficiaries.

100
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,600
We really want you to remain engaged and motivated

101
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,640
by the project matter, and look forward

102
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,670
to showing step by step processes

103
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,360
to help you managing your own project.

104
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,010
Please make sure that you spend some time getting

105
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,570
to know how the platform works.

106
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,620
Use the menu on the left to navigate between weeks

107
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,850
of the course, and the ribbon across the top of the screen

108
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,640
to navigate through the resources

109
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,740
in each section of the week.

110
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,930
That's it for now, but I'll look forward

111
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,650
to seeing you in week one.

112
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,159
