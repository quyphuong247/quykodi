JOHN SING: The project management canvas

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,510
provides a great visual of the project management journey.

3
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,490
The distinct phases help project managers to carefully think

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,180
about their projects and how they

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,310
might approach each in turn.

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,030
At this point, let's pause for a moment

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,320
and consider Janet's DIY project at home, where she wants

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,360
to redo her kitchen floor.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,050
The first thing she should do is develop an overall perspective

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,290
of the project.

11
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,450
In other words, she needs to set some objectives

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,300
and determine her actions.

13
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,520
From the outset, she needs to determine

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,510
what the project involves, how long it

15
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,020
will take her to complete it, and what alternatives

16
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,750
exist to complete this project.

17
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,180
Janet needs to understand that this project is not

18
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,110
only about retiling her kitchen floor,

19
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,160
but also involves other activities

20
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,900
before she can do this, like removing the current flooring.

21
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,980
In order to plan for all task in the project,

22
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,660
she needs to consider all aspects that

23
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,560
will impact the work.

24
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,890
If we work to the project management canvas,

25
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,140
Janet's next step would be planning for this project.

26
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,570
She needs to identify the resources needed,

27
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,790
where she might obtain these, and, since it

28
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,006
is the first time she's doing something like this,

29
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,630
she would need to speak to those in the

30
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,600
know about how to use them.

31
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,850
Janet also needs to determine how much money she

32
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,260
has to spend on this project before beginning

33
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,460
to rip out her current floor.

34
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,540
Once the planning has been done in detail,

35
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,630
she can then begin her project.

36
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,760
In this project, Janet's stakeholders

37
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,680
are her partner, Ben, since they are living together,

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,670
and also the suppliers of the resources she needs.

39
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,690
She will need to ensure that Ben is also

40
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,040
happy with her progress, since he will also

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,000
be utilising the kitchen.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,740
Over the four-week time frame she

43
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,070
has given herself to complete the project,

44
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,090
Janet may encounter some challenges

45
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,870
that she might not have thought of,

46
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,570
like water damage under the existing flooring.

47
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,900
This would need to be dealt with taking the budget and resources

48
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,320
into consideration.

49
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,660
Once Janet has completed tiling the floor,

50
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,170
the project is ready to close, and the benefits

51
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,860
enjoyed by her and her partner.

52
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,650
So this is a relatively simple process to follow.

53
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,194
The more challenging aspects include

54
00:02:10,194 --> 00:02:11,610
considering all of the things that

55
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,010
need to be completed within each task

56
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,404
to ensure the successful outcome of the project.

57
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:17,904
