00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,410


1
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,420
This is Peter.

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,750
He is a junior manager in the ACME organisation.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,180
There has been much excitement among senior managers

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,260
since ACME secured a government contract three weeks ago.

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,550
The contract requires ACME to develop and implement

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,820
a new system to help school leavers

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,330
and young adults find employment in their community.

8
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,560
The current landscape consists of a number

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,920
of different community service providers

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,350
who have each implemented their own initiatives and systems

11
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,540
that seek to help young people transition from school

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,610
and into the workplace.

13
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,910
As these initiatives have not been coordinated, none of them

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,670
have been particularly successful.

15
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,520
It is the intention of the government to create improved

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,960
alignment by developing a centralised system that can be

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,550
used by community organisations.

18
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,250
It is expected that by the close of the projects in 12 months

19
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:06,470
time, employment of young people between the ages of 18 and 22

20
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,610
will increase by 40%.

21
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,570
If the system implementation is successful,

22
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,800
it will be used as a model in other similar projects

23
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,450
to help young people in other communities.

24
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,670
Peter is surprised when his boss taps him on the shoulder,

25
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:26,330
advising him that he has been nominated to lead this project.

26
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,030
Peter never thought of himself as a project manager,

27
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,650
and he was not included in the initial discussions

28
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,640
around the project.

29
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,530
Moreover, he was concerned that he still

30
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,390
had a full-time workload in his current position to deal with.

31
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,030
Peter has very little experience in working with young people

32
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,150
and community organisations.

33
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,510
Given the nature of the particular project,

34
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,000
he will be required to work closely with these two

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,960
groups together with secondary school teachers, parents,

36
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,890
and school principals.

37
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,810
The government grant is substantial,

38
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,670
and Peter has to ensure that the funds are adequately

39
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,900
deployed and managed.

40
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,940
He needs to ensure that the system enables community

41
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,729
organisations to create viable employment opportunities

42
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,760
for young people.

43
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,240
The development and implementation of the system

44
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,190
will require rigorous stakeholder engagement

45
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,170
and management at all levels throughout the process.

46
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,320
Peter has been advised by his more experienced colleagues

47
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,200
that he will need to carefully track system implementation

48
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,220
progress.

49
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,150
Sufficient time will need to be invested into the planning

50
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,310
activity, as Peter still needs to determine what

51
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,180
needs to be done by who, when, and how

52
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,490
to ensure the successful implementation

53
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:47,210
of the system and a positive outcome for young people.

54
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:51,781
