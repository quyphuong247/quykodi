1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,750
Trong quá trình lên kế hoạch dự án,

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,119
các công tác ban đầu cần cân nhắc cẩn thận,

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:13,410
Đây là giai đoạn bạn thực sự áp dụng

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,580
không chỉ khả năng tư duy

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,010
mà còn cần kĩ năng cá nhân, kĩ năng làm việc,

6
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,230
để hiểu sâu hơn 

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:32,280
nhận thức chi tiết hơn 

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,620
về cách bạn định triển khai dự án.

9
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,930
Việc lên kế hoạch thực hiện theo nhiều cách.

10
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,630
Theo thời gian biểu.

11
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,210
Theo ngân sách.

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,890
Theo mô tả công việc.

13
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,280
Nếu chúng ta chỉ tập trung vào quy mô dự án,

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,560
thể hiện dưới hình thức chia nhỏ khối lượng công việc,

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,580
trong giai đoạn lên kế hoạch, 

16
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:58,000
bạn sẽ có định nghĩa rõ ràng,

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,770
to be decomposed into workable elements-- elements that

18
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:09,930
can be executed and can be properly resourced.

19
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,040
And you time phase that, meaning that the work-- once it's

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,500
allocated into executable chunks is also

21
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,050
time phased to a schedule.

22
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:25,690
The other dimension to that is the resourcing,

23
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,550
ensuring that you have the right people to do the task,

24
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,320
and that that task is properly scoped so when

25
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,170
the resources are allocated, they're ready to go,

26
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,700
and they're set up for success right from the start.

27
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,960
That is very key for a project manager.

28
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,480
As it is with any activity, in any work or personal

29
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,090
endeavour-- is you want to set up people for success.

30
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:53,960
One thing I need to emphasise about planning

31
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:59,130
is a project plan, which sounds like it's obvious.

32
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,680
In my experience, there have been

33
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,360
projects where they have been poorly planned

34
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,600
and there's nothing documented.

35
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,759
Or if there is something documented, that it is not

36
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,220
an executable document.

37
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,585
So the project management plan is key to execution.

38
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:18,460


39
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,290
Some of the other aspects in the project management

40
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,230
plan-- it defines for all stakeholders,

41
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:29,180
and it's a point of reference as to what the project is about,

42
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,010
in terms of the mission, the vision

43
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,090
of the project, the objectives.

44
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,940
How the project is going to be executed,

45
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,250
the processes and procedures that will be applied.

46
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,060
How the project will be scheduled.

47
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,530
What is the budget.

48
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,410
Who are the resource allocations,

49
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:53,650
and how is the project going to be monitored and controlled,

50
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,062
which is like a feedback mechanism.

51
00:02:57,062 --> 00:02:57,562
