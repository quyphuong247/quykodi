FRANK SCHULTMANN: We've come to the end

2
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,240
of the second week of the Introduction

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,330
to Project Management course.

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,070
Before moving on to next week, let's recap the key areas

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,260
that we explored this week.

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,340
We have in some detail explored the first phase

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,260
of the project life cycle, which we referred to as initiation.

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,190
We highlighted that this is often

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,090
the shortest phase of the life cycle,

10
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,720
but arguably very important, as it lays the foundation

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,000
for your project.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,495
The foundation that is established

13
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:41,520
can set your project up for success or failure.

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,370
We emphasised the importance of setting objectives

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,250
and determining project success criteria in this phase

16
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,990
so that you have an overview of what you need

17
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,520
to achieve in your project.

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,890
Through the review of a couple of scenarios,

19
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,060
we also noted that it may happen that you have not

20
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,610
been in a position to select your own team members to work

21
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,190
with you on the project.

22
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,120
You're likely to have identified possible risks

23
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,610
and the stakeholders you might engage with.

24
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,580
The best way to understand this phase of the project is that

25
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,230
you, as the project manager, gain a bird's-eye view or a big

26
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,480
picture view of what the project is before you begin to consider

27
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,020
the available options to address the project outcomes.

28
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,990
It's now time to turn our attention to the frequently

29
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,750
asked questions for this week.

30
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,360
The first question is on setting the project objectives.

31
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,980
We have referenced the SMART acronym as a way

32
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,380
to help set clear objectives.

33
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,670
What does SMART stand for, and why do we use it?

34
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:53,750
The acronym SMART stands for specific, measurable, aligned,

35
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,620
realistic, and time-bound.

36
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,030
These are five dimensions that enable

37
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,170
you to set clear and specific objectives that

38
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:07,110
are challenging yet achievable, and set boundaries within which

39
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,030
you can measure achievement.

40
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,710
It is best practise to set a small objective so that all

41
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,370
stakeholders are clear on what the stated project objectives

42
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,420
are.

43
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,280
The next question that often gets

44
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,960
asked is, what is the difference between assumptions,

45
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,290
dependencies, and constraints of a project.

46
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,182
In project management, assumptions

47
00:02:31,182 --> 00:02:35,360
are factors that are either true, real, or certain

48
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,250
that we'll need to consider in our forward planning

49
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,590
with no proof of certainty, thus they may or may not eventuate.

50
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,480
Assumptions affect the every day phase of the project management

51
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,470
life cycle.

52
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,000
Dependencies are relationships between specific tasks

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,740
internal to the project.

54
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,470
Thus, task B requires task A to be completed

55
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,650
before task B can be started.

56
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,540
Constraints are the restrictions or limitations

57
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,040
that will affect the performance of a project.

58
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,060
Constraints are most often related to not

59
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,290
being able to change a set schedule or approved budget.

60
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,750
The final question for this week is,

61
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,080
I think I know what is required to undertake the project.

62
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,000
Should I still be considering multiple options or approaches

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,190
in the initiation phase?

64
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,130
Shouldn't I just save time and start immediately?

65
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,200
The simple answer is no.

66
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,860
Even though we might think we know what to do,

67
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,330
it is important to take time out to first consider

68
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,430
the big picture.

69
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,250
Use creative thinking techniques like brainstorming

70
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,800
to challenge yourself to generate multiple solutions

71
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,060
to dealing with the problems or challenges

72
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,580
in delivering this project.

73
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,260
It is costly and time consuming to have to return

74
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,010
to the drawing board later.

75
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,850
Before moving ahead, ensure that you

76
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,890
know as much as you can about your project and the quality

77
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:11,110
of the available options to achieving the outcomes.

78
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,780
To end off, let's take a minute to prepare you

79
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,250
for next week's lessons.

80
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,500
Week 3 is focusing on the planning phase of the project

81
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,450
management life cycle.

82
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,500
This is crucial to achieving project outcomes

83
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,620
and objectives.

84
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,320
The key questions we will be answering next week

85
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,060
are, how do you define the scope of the project?

86
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,680
What planning needs to be done?

87
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,510
What resources do I need?

88
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,690
When does it need to be done by?

89
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,350
And, how much will it cost?

90
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,450
See you next week.
