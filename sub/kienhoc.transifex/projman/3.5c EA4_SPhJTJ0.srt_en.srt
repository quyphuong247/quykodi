00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,010
STELLA BACHTIS: In our previous activity,

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,700
we successfully scoped a project around building a house,

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,430
and then determined the order in which the activities might

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,000
be performed.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,870
We are now in a position to review this information

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:27,330
in a timeline schedule, also referred to as a Gantt chart.

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,620
Just as a quick reminder, a schedule

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,466
is an overview of the duration assigned for each activity.

9
00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:35,840
Let's take a look at the schedule

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,650
based on the 11 project activities we identified

11
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,560
together, with the estimated duration in days assigned

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,190
to each activity.

13
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,080
You will notice that each activity follows the last

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,400
in a back to back manner.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,390
While some activities are reliant on others,

16
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,180
and it is possible to work in this manner,

17
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,340
it may not be the most efficient way for a project manager

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,300
to proceed, as each relies on the completion of another.

19
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,480
In practise, there is often a great deal of pressure

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,650
to complete projects within a shorter amount of time.

21
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,080
Say, for example, that in our case,

22
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,520
we are aware that summer is the best time of year to sell

23
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,990
a property.

24
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,720
We dearly want to achieve this with our build project,

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,690
yet if we take 63 days to complete the property

26
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:31,440
and then market and sell it, summer may be over.

27
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,330
If, however, we can finish the project, in, say, 39 days,

28
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,340
we have a better shot at delivering it to a buyer

29
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,240
during the summer season.

30
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,780
How might we reduce the current project duration of 63 days,

31
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,280
given we still have all 11 activities to complete?

32
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,220
In order to reduce the amount of time

33
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,460
it takes to complete this project,

34
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,690
we will need to consider the existence of dependencies.

35
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,530
Dependencies are the relationships

36
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,430
between the preceding tasks and the succeeding tasks.

37
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,750
In other words, if we take another look at the first three

38
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,080
activities of building the house, which are preparing

39
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,700
the lot, laying the foundation, and erecting the wall frames,

40
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,490
we need to consider the interrelationships that

41
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,190
may exist.

42
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,630
Simply put, we cannot start activity three,

43
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,850
which is erecting the walls, before we have completed

44
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,410
activity two, which is laying the foundation,

45
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,600
which in turn cannot be achieved before activity one,

46
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,940
which is preparing the lot and making sure that it has been

47
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,770
completed.

48
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,410
Laying the foundation, therefore, has one dependency,

49
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:49,150
while erecting the wall frames has two dependencies.

50
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,430
The key to reducing the schedule is

51
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,140
to identify activities that do not have dependencies.

52
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,740
Or, in other words, activities that

53
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,330
can start without waiting for another

54
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:06,010
to be completed and occur at the same time as others.

55
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,460
In the next activity, prepare your project schedule

56
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,950
by considering any dependencies, and realigning

57
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:17,850
those activities that could be completed at the same time.

58
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:22,210
Note that you cannot change the duration of the activities.

59
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,080
Your objective is to consider dependencies,

60
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,340
in order to reduce the overall project duration.

61
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,025
