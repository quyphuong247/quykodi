JOHN SING: Monitoring and reviewing team performance

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,520
is an important monitoring control activity

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,500
that takes place in parallel with project execution process

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,980
activities.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,580
This may not be applicable to all projects in which there

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,800
is no need for a team of people to assist,

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,220
such as smaller type projects, which may only

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,410
require one or two people.

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,870
However, for the larger, more complex projects,

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,190
a team of people is required.

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:34,210
Recall from Peter's project, in which a team is required

12
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,850
and roles and responsibilities clearly assigned.

13
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,340
The project is measured regularly

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,350
against the project plan to ensure it is tracking according

15
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,480
to that plan.

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,090
Any variances from the plan would

17
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,120
need to be then investigated and a decision

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,180
made as to whether any action is required.

19
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,440
Using Peter's scenario, how might he

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,650
go about monitoring his project progress and team performance?

21
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,180
There are various processes that can be put in place.

22
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,970
You'll remember in Peter's project,

23
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,490
there are a variety of team members

24
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,349
that he needs to manage.

25
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:08,440
First he will need to collect project progress information.

26
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,420
Now that Peter has timely information

27
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,510
about the status of his project, he

28
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,070
is then in a position to investigate any variances

29
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,020
from the original plan.

30
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,680
Peter also then has an opportunity

31
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,920
to discuss the progress status with his team

32
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,000
and determine if any corrective action may be required.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,480
If a decision is taken that corrective action is required,

34
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,210
this will need to be approved and accepted by the team.

35
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,570
In Peter's project, if a project team member

36
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,620
is struggling to deliver on their part,

37
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,310
open and effective communication and

38
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,440
collaboration amongst the team members

39
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,450
may enable other team members to step in and assist.

40
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,240
The purpose of this is to try and keep the project on track

41
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,890
or minimise further variance.

42
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,820
Clearly then, for projects that require a project team,

43
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,300
the project manager needs to guide the leadership

44
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,500
and management to promote a positive, collaborative project

45
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,730
team environment and continuously

46
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,495
and consistently monitor team performance.

47
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:02,995
