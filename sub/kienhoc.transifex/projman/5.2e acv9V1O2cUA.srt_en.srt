00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,110
ANTON JORDAAN: Week five has been primarily focused

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,880
on how you lead and manage a team.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,540
Leadership skills can be developed over time

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,780
and are adaptive to different situations,

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,990
depending on the people involved, the issue

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,840
or challenge that is presented, or the motivation that

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,960
is required in a particular setting.

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,950
The next activity, which is similar to the radar graph

9
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,960
that you completed in week one helps

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,900
you assess your current skills as a leader.

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,730
Please respond to all the statements

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,800
for the five dimensions.

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,170
Consider how you might respond to each statement

14
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,710
and then rank your responses using the scale provided.

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,760
Bear in mind, there are no incorrect answers,

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,210
and your responses are not viewable by other participants.

17
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,990
Let's consider by way of an example.

18
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,350
Under the organisation dimension,

19
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,780
a statement might be, you are usually well-organized

20
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,590
in preparing your team for an activity.

21
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,610
Now think about a recent scenario,

22
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,970
where you might have led a group or team of people

23
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,380
and then, using the five-point scale,

24
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,970
select the option that you most closely associate with.

25
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,970
Once you have entered all your responses,

26
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,660
you'll be provided with a radar graph identifying

27
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:22,200
your areas of strength and areas you could further develop.

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,860
Your result is presented in red.

29
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,080
You will also note a blue shaded area on the graph.

30
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,730
This area typically reflects the result for project managers.

31
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,770
Your result provides a representation

32
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,920
of your current skills measured against the five dimensions.

33
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,380
If you have scored less than 75% in any one of the areas,

34
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,670
we have provided some information and feedback

35
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,802
that should help you further develop these areas.

36
00:01:48,802 --> 00:01:51,260
The activity has been designed to help you learn a bit more

37
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,190
about yourself and to assist with identifying

38
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,820
the areas of focus in your development

39
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,250
as a leader in a project management role.

40
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,000
