00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,790
ANTON JORDAAN: So we have now progressed to the execution

2
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,060
phase of our project.

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,650
Execution is all about putting your project planning

4
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,020
into action and ensuring the objectives

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,260
and deliverables are met.

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,070
The focus of the project now becomes that

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,640
of delivery or implementation.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,410
It is in this phase where the value of the project is

9
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,390
realised as a result of all of the planning that has been

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,580
done.

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,590
As we have seen in previous weeks,

12
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,370
it is also the phase where a lot of value

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,550
can be lost as a result of things

14
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,950
going wrong when trying to deliver your project.

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,290
For this reason in particular, you really

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,670
want to make sure that you are doing the project right

17
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,830
and to try and avoid things going wrong.

18
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,700
Four key questions to keep in mind

19
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,190
doing project delivery are, first,

20
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,520
am I delivering to the plan specifications

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,090
and requirements?

22
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,050
Am I able to secure supply of the necessary resources?

23
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,230
Will I be able to manage and control the project scope?

24
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:09,200
And finally, how will I be able to control quality?

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,890
To address these questions, let's consider

26
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,850
the importance of your leadership

27
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,740
and your ability to communicate with other parties that

28
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,510
may be involved in assisting you deliver your project.

29
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,790
Building and maintaining open and honest relationships

30
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,230
with your project team and stakeholders will make

31
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,150
project execution a lot easier.

32
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,610
Let's set up a couple of questions

33
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,800
then to frame our discussion.

34
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,530
One, how do you engage with and manage stakeholders?

35
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,180
And two, as a leader, how might you motivate, communicate,

36
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,250
and lead your team?

37
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,854
Think carefully about the processes

38
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,770
that you will need to put into place to ensure

39
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,420
that you, your team, and other external stakeholders

40
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,902
are kept informed of progress throughout the execution phase.

41
00:01:54,902 --> 00:01:55,402
