00:00:07,869 --> 00:00:09,910
STELLA BACHTIS: We have discussed risk management

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,580
as a continuous process that requires identification

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,570
of possible risks and assessment of the likelihood

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:22,550
and impact these risks might have should they eventuate.

5
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,450
Don't forget that although a risk event might be considered

6
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,410
highly unlikely, the impact could well

7
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,090
be catastrophic to the project.

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,410
In assessing the risk, we would therefore

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,550
need to consider both the likelihood and the impact.

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,020
The following activity will help you perform a first step risk

11
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,900
identification and high level evaluation of the risk

12
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,500
profile of a project.

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,000
A useful starting point is to create different areas

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,090
or categories of risk.

15
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,880
Categories could consist of economic risks,

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,880
political risks, commercial risks, organisational risks,

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,890
and technical risks.

18
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,480
Although PESTLE is a well-known acronym

19
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,230
in the domains of marketing and organisational strategy,

20
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,600
it can also be used as an aid to help identify

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,710
risk areas in your project.

22
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,520
PESTLE stands for political, economic, social,

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,880
technological, legal, and environmental.

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,990
In our PESTLE activity that follows,

25
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,230
we would like you to think of yourself as the owner

26
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,250
of an organisation that builds new homes for customers across

27
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,900
the country.

28
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,770
From this perspective, consider the various risk categories

29
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,610
in the template provided and perform a basic assessment

30
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:50,600
of each of the risk categories on a scale of one to five.

31
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,050
One represents a low risk and five, a very high risk.

32
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,010
You would typically need to complete such a template

33
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,550
during the planning stage of a home build

34
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,280
to identify the risk profile of each individual home

35
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,950
construction project.

36
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,080
Once you have assigned a score between one and five

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,100
in each of the PESTLE categories,

38
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,020
you are able to observe your risk assessment out

39
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,380
of a maximum of 30 and the interpreted result

40
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,930
will provide you with an indicative level

41
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,470
of risk for your project.

42
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,707
