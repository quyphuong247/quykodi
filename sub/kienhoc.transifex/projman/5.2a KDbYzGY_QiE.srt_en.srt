JOHN SING: The way in which a project manager

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,040
leads his or her team will influence project achievements.

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,751
Teamwork is a critical factor in project success.

4
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,000
One of the key responsibilities of the project manager

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
is to assign roles to the team members

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,280
during the execution phase.

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,370
Recruiting the right skill set, assigning

8
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,010
roles and responsibilities, and encouraging and supporting

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,100
the project team are just some of the challenges

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,790
to be considered.

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,090
So how might we do this?

12
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,020
Let's consider a checklist.

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,890
First, make sure that each team member

14
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,160
is clear about their role within the project,

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,260
and the responsibilities that need to be fulfilled

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,480
within that role.

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,250
Detail given at this point reduces any role confusion

18
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,230
about who does what.

19
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,140
In larger projects, you may want to consider creating a project

20
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,370
team organisational chart.

21
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,250
This chart provides the overall structure

22
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,560
of the team, their roles, and information about

23
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,530
who reports to whom.

24
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,269
You may want to assign specific tasks and responsibilities

25
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:06,457
for each deliverable of the project.

26
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:08,540
This will ensure that all tasks have been assigned

27
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,270
to an individual team member who is

28
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,310
responsible for the production or execution of their allocated

29
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,920
project deliverable.

30
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,880
Lastly, it may also be a good idea

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,670
to capture the roles and responsibilities of your team

32
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,820
by developing a team charter.

33
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,160
A team charter is a set of documents that outlines

34
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,070
the goals and purpose of the team, expected behaviours,

35
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,110
and team relationships, including policies

36
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,040
and procedures to be followed.

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,780
It also outlines the quality, work practises,

38
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,200
and processes that facilitate good working relationships.

39
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,960
The overall intention is to support team performance

40
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,340
throughout the duration of the project.

41
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:42,840
