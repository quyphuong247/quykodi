00:00:07,712 --> 00:00:10,470
STELLA BACHTIS: The execution phase of the project management

2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,640
life cycle brings together all the work

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,960
that you have completed in initiation and planning.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,160
It is in this phase where all of the tasks

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,410
are implemented and completed for the project before handover

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,270
and closure.

7
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,920
Execution requires clear leadership and communication

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,530
skills with your team and engagement

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,970
with stakeholders on a regular basis

10
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,090
to ensure there is clarity in the delivery of the project

11
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,730
objectives.

12
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,930
Your ability to communicate effectively

13
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,590
with your team and stakeholders will set

14
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,710
the tone for this entire phase.

15
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,840
Effective communication is about delivering information, giving

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,450
clear instructions, listening to responses,

17
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,600
and providing constructive feedback.

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,390
It will also include successful management

19
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,370
of any conflict that may arise.

20
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,610
Your ability to be fully prepared and organised

21
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,100
provides a platform to set all activities in motion

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,450
that need to be completed.

23
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,860
Thorough preparation and organisation will also help you

24
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,960
deal with any uncertainties that may arise in a constructive

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,010
and deliberate way.

26
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,030
Lastly, your ability to carefully and systematically

27
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,570
coordinate all activities, so that they

28
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,530
are completed on time, is critical to success.

29
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,480
In order to do this successfully,

30
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,520
continuous communication with both internal and external

31
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,510
stakeholders is required.

32
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,200
And a certain level of negotiation and compromise

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,300
needs to take place to ensure all objectives are

34
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,590
met by each stakeholder.

35
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:54,210
This can be a challenging phase for any project manager.

36
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,490
But consistency in your approach and your ability

37
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,670
to follow your plan with reasonable flexibility

38
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,040
are the key to success.

39
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,551
