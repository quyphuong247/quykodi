00:00:08,079 --> 00:00:10,120
STELLA BACHTIS: The purpose of the planning phase

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,550
of the project life cycle is to put plans

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,830
in motion so that you can execute or implement

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,350
the project properly.

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,620
Without clear and thorough planning,

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,550
you run the risk of having insufficient resources,

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:27,420
bad time management, and overspending on your project.

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,530
You are not yet ready to proceed to the next phase

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,770
of the project management life cycle

10
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,070
until these plans are in place.

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,340
Key questions you need to address

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,870
include how do you define the scope of the project?

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,410
What planning needs to be done?

14
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,050
What resources do I need?

15
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,490
When does it need to be done by?

16
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,800
And how much will it cost?

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,230
In order to achieve some robustness

18
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,280
in dealing with these questions, we

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,120
would need to gather more information around the project

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,950
objectives, what needs to be delivered,

21
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,870
and how you might go about doing those things.

22
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,860
Let's use our canvas to develop our thinking.

23
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,740
So where do we go from here?

24
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,290
A good starting point is to recap the three main areas that

25
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,690
are in the planning phase of the life cycle, which are scoping,

26
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,930
scheduling, and costing.

27
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,460
Scoping looks at the requirements and activities

28
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,430
that need to be completed to meet the project's objectives.

29
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,250
This is an overview of what needs to be done

30
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,150
and helps in defining the project scope.

31
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,560
This information provides the basis

32
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,970
to develop a work breakdown structure that carefully

33
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,740
considers all of the activities and deliverables that

34
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,400
need to be completed.

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,250
The work breakdown structure can be

36
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,670
organised in several different ways,

37
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,650
depending on the method that works best for you.

38
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,860
Remember that you are accountable every step

39
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,730
of the way, so robust plans now enable a smoother workflow

40
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,290
later.

41
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,410
Now think about how you might sequence these activities.

42
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,830
Is there a specific order that will work best

43
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,940
to complete all of the tasks.

44
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,990
Which should go first and why?

45
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,620
Think about the relationships between the activities

46
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,740
and how they might work optimally

47
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,040
in a particular order.

48
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,700
You will also need to consider the dependencies

49
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,290
for each activity before refining your schedule.

50
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,460
The schedule is usually illustrated in a Gantt chart

51
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,940
so that you may clearly see what needs to be done.

52
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,890
The Gantt chart also provides the opportunity

53
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,050
to consider the time frame that each activity needs

54
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,270
to be completed in.

55
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,180
Now that you have a schedule in place,

56
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,490
you can determine the costing for the resources required

57
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,970
to complete each of those activities.

58
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:57,390
You will need to identify human resources, material, equipment,

59
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,800
and how much time is required to deploy

60
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,290
them to complete an activity.

61
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,710
You can then begin to consider your financial constraints

62
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,920
and how you will arrange the budget to pay for the resources

63
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,420
to complete the project.

64
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,850
Planning is usually the longest part of the project life cycle,

65
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,020
and for good reason.

66
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,060
Getting the planning right from the start

67
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,020
encourages you to do sufficient research,

68
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,570
to look into the future so that you can time

69
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:30,130
manage all of the resources and activities required

70
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,510
to execute the project.

71
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,462
