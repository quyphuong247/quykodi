FRANK SCHULTMANN: We've come to the end

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,730
of week four of the introduction to project management course.

3
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,610
Before moving on to the next week,

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:20,150
let's recap the key areas that we touched on this past week.

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,650
We have taken a detailed look at identifying and managing

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,460
risk in this week's lessons.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,120
Risk management is a key activity in both the planning

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,140
and execution phase of the project life cycle.

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,760
Dealing with risk is an inevitable part

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,140
of managing projects.

11
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,510
We highlighted the importance of planning

12
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,890
in phase two of the life cycle.

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,040
Risk management, a process for identifying, assessing,

14
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,310
and responding to risk.

15
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,140
Identifying and assessing risks, and by considering

16
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,570
both the likelihood and impact on your project,

17
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,390
enables you to develop response strategies

18
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,770
and plans to respond to them.

19
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,830
The benefit of having a risk management process

20
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,070
is to regularly review your project progress

21
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,540
and to proactively identify possible risks and responses

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,370
before they occur.

23
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,600
Through the review of a couple of scenarios,

24
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,710
we also observed that depending on the context,

25
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,210
the type of risks will vary for different projects.

26
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,370
Risks are always present, but once identified

27
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,880
need to be continuously monitored and reviewed.

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,760
It is now time to turn our attention to the frequently

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,880
asked questions for this week.

30
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,460
The first question is, what is a risk register?

31
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,400
And what is its purpose?

32
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,300
The output from our risk identification session,

33
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,310
or workshop, is captured in a document or template called

34
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,420
a risk register.

35
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,070
The risk register records the risks

36
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,560
that have been identified and assessed

37
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,440
together with our proposed risk responses.

38
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,680
At the risk identification phase,

39
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,320
the risk register will include the risk categories,

40
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,419
identified risks, potential causes,

41
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:13,040
and anticipated responses.

42
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,120
It is important to know that the risk register is a living

43
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,530
document that is constantly reviewed

44
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,510
and allows for new risks to be added as they are identified.

45
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,540
The next question is, what is risk contingency?

46
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,970
Risk contingency is about having a plan B to deal with the risks

47
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,720
when they eventuate.

48
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,860
Risk contingency is about preparing

49
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,870
for events, such as the loss or change of data, team members,

50
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,350
stakeholders, suppliers, and other disruptive, unknown

51
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,860
conditions.

52
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,830
The need for drawing up contingency plans

53
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,450
emerges from a thorough analysis of the risks in your project.

54
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,350
The final question for this week is, what is residual risk?

55
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,400
Risk response actions do not only

56
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,450
occur when a risk eventuates.

57
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,000
In most cases, your responses are preventative measures

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,820
that are taken as soon as you identify the risk.

59
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,580
At this point, you may revisit your risk register

60
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,540
to assess the status of a risk once

61
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,660
a preventative or mitigating actions are complete.

62
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,020
Any risk that still remains thereafter

63
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,700
is known as residual risk.

64
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,800
To finish, then, let's take a minute to prepare you

65
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,060
for the next week lessons.

66
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,910
Week five will focus on leading a team

67
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:35,920
and engaging stakeholders in the execution phase of the project

68
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,340
life cycle.

69
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,700
The manner in which you lead, communicate,

70
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,540
and engage with others will impact the successful project

71
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,190
completion.

72
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,030
The key questions we will be exploring next week

73
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,300
are: who are your team members?

74
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,430
Who are your internal and external stakeholders?

75
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,430
How do you engage with stakeholders?

76
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,190
What skills do you require to lead a team?

77
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,740
And how do you communicate effectively

78
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,790
with an internal and external stakeholders,

79
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,670
so that project outcomes are met?

80
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,667
See you next week.

81
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:13,166
