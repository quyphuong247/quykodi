00:00:08,016 --> 00:00:09,640
STELLA BACHTIS: Before we end week six,

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,220
or close our project so to speak,

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,310
let's do a quick recap of the project management canvas

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,690
that encompasses the project management life cycle.

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,410
The project management life cycle

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,830
starts with initiation, the phase where the project manager

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,190
determines what the project is about

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,430
and the key problem that needs to be addressed.

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,290
This is where the high level plan is created,

10
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,140
clearly outlining the objectives and success

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,420
criteria of the project and how he or she

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,670
might go about planning for and executing the project.

13
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,190
It is during initiation that the project manager investigates

14
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,480
and considers a range of possible options of how

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,490
the project could be approached and aggregates information

16
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,790
to support the various approaches.

17
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,860
Once the project manager is satisfied with the selected

18
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,590
approach and high level overview,

19
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,720
in-depth planning on scoping, scheduling, and costing

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,570
can begin.

21
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,980
Attention to detail in the planning phase

22
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,400
is particularly important to ensure

23
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,070
maximum value is captured in the early phases of the project.

24
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,200
Quality planning will take time and require the project manager

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,540
to have thorough knowledge of who will be doing what, how,

26
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,830
and by when.

27
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,910
Planning forms the basis of good project execution.

28
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,890
It is in the execution, or implementation phase,

29
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,520
that the project manager leads the team

30
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,140
to execute the deliverables of the project.

31
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,600
Managing stakeholder expectation is foregrounded in this phase

32
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,640
to ensure that stakeholders are kept

33
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,830
informed each step of the way.

34
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,000
Stakeholders have varying levels of interest and influence

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,240
in the project and require constant monitoring

36
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,010
and management to ensure their expectations do not

37
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,610
become misaligned and are proactively managed

38
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,979
throughout the duration of the project.

39
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:12,180
Closure is the final phase in the life of a project.

40
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,610
Once all the deliverables have been implemented,

41
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,320
the project will be completed and closed and subsequently

42
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,530
handed over to the buyer or the project sponsor.

43
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,800
Encouraging honest feedback from stakeholders is important

44
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,930
to ensure that any future projects can be improved upon

45
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,640
and risks avoided through lessons learnt.

46
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,700
Remember, monitoring and review are continuous processes

47
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,580
undertaken throughout the project life cycle.

48
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,710
Through ongoing monitoring and review,

49
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,590
the project manager exercises control over implementation

50
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:52,110
and can identify and respond proactively to any risks

51
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,800
or issues that occur, thus minimising the impact of those

52
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,130
issues on project delivery and project outcomes.

53
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:00,998
