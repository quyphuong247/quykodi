00:00:07,845 --> 00:00:09,720
ANTON JORDAAN: The goal of project management

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,870
is to ensure that the project is delivered to the buyer

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,300
and the project outcomes accepted.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,750
In doing so, the buyer agrees that the quality specifications

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,970
have been met.

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,660
Projects are based on results, so the project manager

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,250
must ensure that outcomes have been achieved and delivered.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,330
A key step here would be to update the project

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:32,140
plan with the actual outcomes from the final stage

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,280
together with confirmation that the project has been accepted.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,860
Bear in mind that project handover

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,270
can be undertaken in stages or done as a single handover

13
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,940
process at the end.

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,240
As the project manager, you are the person

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,960
who needs to provide confirmation

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,470
that the project can be closed.

17
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,100
It is at this point that stakeholders

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,010
will be advised that the project is coming to an end,

19
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,300
and that all outstanding documentation needs to be

20
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,340
submitted for final execution.

21
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,239
So how might Peter go about closing out his office project?

22
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,100
First, he will need to finalise any contracted services,

23
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,450
including any outstanding documentation, warranties,

24
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,070
and other unresolved issues that still need to be completed.

25
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,370
He would communicate pending closure to suppliers

26
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,450
and contractors, such as IT services

27
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,110
and the venues where student interviews were conducted.

28
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,500
Once Peter has confirmed that the work has been delivered

29
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,790
according to the contracts, they can submit final invoices

30
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,500
for settlement.

31
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,410
Second, any documentation, such as drawings, specifications,

32
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,310
manuals, and warranties, should be collated and formally

33
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,960
handed over to Peter's management team and the project

34
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,590
sponsor.

35
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,790
He would also need to include any original documentation that

36
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,150
outlined objectives and success criteria in the handover

37
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,839
process.

38
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:53,380
Peter would then have the opportunity

39
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,720
to demonstrate the benefits of the project

40
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,760
to key stakeholders.

41
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,360
He would need to articulate how the youth unemployment

42
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,740
policy has been implemented and the opportunities that

43
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,200
have resulted for young people leaving school.

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,840
This is the final important step in the management

45
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,930
of stakeholders' expectations.

46
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,100
Once Peter has formally handed the benefits over

47
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,240
to key stakeholders, he would need

48
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,070
to ensure that the project team members are reassigned;

49
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,750
surplus equipment, materials, and supplies disposed of;

50
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,160
and any facilities released.

51
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,430
It is recommended that Peter and his management team

52
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,450
hold a closure meeting to acknowledge

53
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,820
the completion of the project.

54
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,130
Details of such a meeting could include

55
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,940
reviewing the outputs or outcomes; confirming

56
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,560
the arrangements for any follow-up work;

57
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,770
thanking the team, the sponsor, and the stakeholders

58
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,690
for their support; and presenting the completion

59
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,350
report for approval and sign-off.

60
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,966
