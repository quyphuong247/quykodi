00:00:07,905 --> 00:00:10,030
STELLA BACHTIS: The purpose of the initiation phase

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,230
of the project life cycle is to figure out what exactly it

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,670
is you need to do, and then to consider a range of options

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,140
to achieving the same outcome.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,090
Without a clear understanding of what you need to do

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,380
and the options that are available to you,

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,740
you cannot proceed to the next phase.

8
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,060
Key questions you need to address would include

9
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,770
is this a project?

10
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,310
What is the problem that I need to solve?

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,170
What to do I need?

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,130
And what are my options to achieve the outcome?

13
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,180
Let us use our canvas as a workbench

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,180
to develop our thinking.

15
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,450
So where do we go from here?

16
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,530
A good starting point is working through a high-level plan.

17
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,610
Take a bird's eye view of the overall project landscape,

18
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,510
and visualise the various parts that will need to be completed.

19
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,600
Now consider a number of different options

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,770
to achieve the various outcomes.

21
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,140
This is also known as the project overview.

22
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,950
Now that you're starting to get a better understanding of what

23
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,450
is required, it is useful to set SMART targets.

24
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,590
SMART refers to making objectives more specific

25
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,020
by ensuring they reflect five dimensions.

26
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,940
These are specific, measurable, aligned, realistic,

27
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,840
and time bound.

28
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,380
SMART objectives help to reduce uncertainty, and clarify

29
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,540
what will be achieved in the project.

30
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,450
From these objectives, you can start

31
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,590
to develop success criteria which

32
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,330
will determine what the project might look like

33
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,530
and how success will be measured at the end of the project life

34
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,020
cycle.

35
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,600
The initiation phase lays the foundation for the project.

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,900
This is the formation of a triangle where scope is clear,

37
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,190
and the elements of time, cost, and quality are understood.

38
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,300
Also bear in mind that as a project manager,

39
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,110
you are accountable for overall project delivery.

40
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,910
In order to be effective in managing your project,

41
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,760
you will need to ensure that you are given the necessary

42
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,240
authority within your organisation to call on other

43
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,920
resources in the organisation.

44
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,440
Only once you have clear understanding of what

45
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,760
it is you need to do in this phase

46
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,184
are you ready to proceed to the next phase of the life cycle.

47
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:23,684
