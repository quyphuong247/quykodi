00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,580
SELLA BACHTIS: The focus of week four

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,880
has been on all things risk related.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,400
It is a good reminder that risks are inevitable and need

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,790
to be dealt with throughout the project life cycle.

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,490
It is important to monitor and review risk

6
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,390
throughout your project.

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,060
The risk management process supports the ongoing nature

8
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,050
of the monitor and review activity.

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,040
It is worthwhile to touch on three of the key risk

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,140
management activities.

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,200
The first is the risk identification activity,

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,750
which requires a good deal of 'what if' scenario building.

13
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,340
The objective here is to identify a possible situation

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,270
or event that may occur that will create uncertainties

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,100
and challenges affecting the deliverables of a project

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,640
and ultimately causing its failure.

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,730
Risk identification should review a range of categories,

18
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,110
which can emanate from both the internal or external

19
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,000
environment the business operates in.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,520
Economic, organisational, political, technological,

21
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,430
environmental, and legal are all potential categories

22
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,960
to consider when identifying risks that

23
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,060
may impact on your project.

24
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,280
In addition, you should also think

25
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,990
how the emergence of one risk might

26
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,270
lead to risks in other categories

27
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,000
or areas of your project.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,100
The next risk related activity is

29
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,660
undertaking a risk assessment.

30
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,750
Risk assessment involves assessing

31
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,010
the likelihood of the risks that we have identified,

32
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,510
as well as the possible consequence

33
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,450
if that risk should eventuate.

34
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,870
By following a risk assessment process,

35
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,350
a project manager should be able to identify

36
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,980
factors that may contribute to the risk and the actions

37
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:01,080
necessary to reduce, control, or eliminate the risk.

38
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,330
The risk response activity considers an appropriate risk

39
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,360
response to the risk you have identified and assessed.

40
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,780
Ideally, the best response would be to avoid the risk entirely.

41
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,950
However, uncertainty and risk are part and parcel

42
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,410
of most projects and remain variables

43
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,970
that need to be managed.

44
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,820
If the project risk cannot be avoided,

45
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,350
we need to consider other appropriate risk responses,

46
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,160
such as reducing, which means limiting the likelihood

47
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,620
or severity of the impact of the risk, accepting the risk,

48
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,780
where the cost of managing the risk is acceptable,

49
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,700
or transferring the risk, which is shifting the risk from one

50
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,260
party to another.

51
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:42,912
