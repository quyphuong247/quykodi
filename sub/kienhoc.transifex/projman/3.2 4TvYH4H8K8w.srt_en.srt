00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,020
STELLA BACHTIS: The canvas video provides an overview of what

2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,800
we are focusing on this week.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,760
It points out the key areas that we

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,660
will be discussing, which are scoping, scheduling,

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,170
and costing.

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,410
Often, project managers tend to gloss over the planning phase,

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,460
or they don't give it the necessary time required.

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,300
The result is that they inevitably

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,050
have to compromise on something later in the project

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,560
to get it finished on time.

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,020
In order to define the scope of a project,

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,470
it is necessary to first establish

13
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,810
the project objectives.

14
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:47,910
Remember, this is something that we discussed during initiation.

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,120
Gaining an overview of what the project is all about

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,440
and considering what needs to be achieved during initiation

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,210
prepares the project manager to formally clarify objectives

18
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,090
and begin scoping the project.

19
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,040
Scoping forms the foundation of the planning phase

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,230
and considers the overall deliverables of the project.

21
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,600
To define scope, you need to start

22
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,030
by identifying the following.

23
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,170
First, clarify around the objectives.

24
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,240
Second, the tasks that need to be performed.

25
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,890
And third, the resources that will be required.

26
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,690
Once you have identified these elements,

27
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,160
you will need to determine the limitations or parameters

28
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,570
of the project, and clearly identify any aspects that

29
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,540
are to be excluded.

30
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,000
Let's take a look at Peter's office project.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,370
Peter's office project is quite different

32
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,220
from the other scenarios we have looked at.

33
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,320
The reason for this is because the project

34
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,210
has been handed to him without him being involved

35
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,470
in initiating the project.

36
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,180
Moreover, he has never managed a project before.

37
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,440
As a result, he is in a pretty difficult position,

38
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,600
as the information has just been thrown

39
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,260
at him with the directive to just get on with it

40
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,280
and make it work.

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,810
The project objective has therefore already

42
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,540
been identified, as the development and implementation

43
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,830
of a system to help school leavers find jobs

44
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,310
in the local community.

45
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,650
If Peter is going to be successful,

46
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,600
he's really going to have to unpack

47
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,140
that broad objective by breaking it down

48
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,790
into smaller objectives.

49
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,080
So where should Peter start?

50
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,970
A good starting point would be for Peter

51
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,550
to identify the activities that are

52
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,270
the next level down to implement such a system.

53
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,960
Once he's able to identify those smaller, more manageable

54
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,440
activities, he can systematically

55
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,090
start planning how these activities might be done.

56
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,780
An example of this is meeting with stakeholders

57
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,790
on a regular basis.

58
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,190
On the one hand, Peter is quite fortunate

59
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,790
that he has been given an objective.

60
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,770
On the other hand, it will be quite challenging for him,

61
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,550
as he was not part of the design and thinking processes

62
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,740
in the initiation phase.

63
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,030
When scoping a project, you need to be

64
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,980
very clear as to what is included in or excluded

65
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,260
from the project scope.

66
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,400
From a terminology point of view,

67
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,110
this is defined as being in scope and out of scope

68
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,960
of the project.

69
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,650
Poor scope definition leads to the inclusion

70
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,330
of additional items or functionality,

71
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,370
which will have negative impacts on the project cost

72
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,300
and lead to delays in completion.

73
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,820
It is worth noting that while you're scoping your project,

74
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,000
you're not yet considering time and cost implications.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,320
At the scoping stage, you really just want

76
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,900
to understand what needs to be done to deliver the project.

77
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,300
To further consider what might be in scope and out of scope,

78
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,260
let's reference Peter's office project again.

79
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,140
The overall deliverable is to develop and implement

80
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,610
a system to help school leavers find jobs within the community.

81
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,880
What is in scope in this example is the development

82
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,680
and implementation of policies and procedures within

83
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,690
Peter's organisation.

84
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:18,560
What is considered out of scope for Peter is each stakeholder

85
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,459
developing and implementing their own policies

86
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,100
and procedures within their organisations,

87
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,910
such as schools and community organisations that he will be

88
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,790
dealing with throughout the project life cycle.

89
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:36,000
It is an important task to identify in and out of scope

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,690
activities early to clarify any issues that may become

91
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,650
contentious at a later stage.

92
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,530
A common term used in project management during scoping

93
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,570
is the Work Breakdown Structure or WBS.

94
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,940
A Work Breakdown Structure represents

95
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,440
one of the most important project management

96
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,040
deliverables.

97
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,650
Once the objectives and scope have been defined,

98
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,030
a project manager should have a pretty good idea

99
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:08,420
of how work will be broken down into activities and tasks that

100
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,900
would need to be executed.

101
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,260
The Work Breakdown Structure organises and represents

102
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,870
the overall scope of the project.

103
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,890
It follows then that if a deliverable does not

104
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:24,890
appear on the WBS, then it should not be undertaken.

105
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,790
Have you perhaps given some thought

106
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,140
as to how you might approach developing a Work Breakdown

107
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,640
Structure for your own project?

108
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,440
A good approach to developing the Work Breakdown Structure

109
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,800
is to start by identifying all of the project deliverables,

110
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,410
and then to sub-divide the work that needs to be undertaken.

111
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,380
The WBS is established in the planning phase of the project

112
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,530
and will provide the basis for the project manager

113
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,740
to then develop the project schedule.

114
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,400
The WBS will be revisited and further refined

115
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,140
once project risks have been identified and assessed.

116
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,590
Let's contextualise the Work Breakdown Structure

117
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,740
of Peter's office project.

118
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,870
As you can see, the image represents

119
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,670
activities that need to be done to complete the project.

120
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:18,320
The first deliverable or major task, Task 1,

121
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,260
is for Peter's organisation to develop its own policy

122
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,960
on employment for young people.

123
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,120
The next major task, Task 2, is to develop an action plan

124
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,600
with secondary schools to create pathways.

125
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,290
Task 3 is to develop joint procedures

126
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,550
with community services.

127
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,310
For each of the major tasks, there

128
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,460
are sub-tasks that need to be completed

129
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,780
to meet that deliverable.

130
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,090
Sub-tasks are the smaller tasks that

131
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,660
need to be undertaken to complete a major task.

132
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,850
In other words, Peter will consider the major tasks,

133
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,030
and then break them down into sub-tasks

134
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,770
that need to be completed.

135
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:59,150
In the example of the Work Breakdown Structure,

136
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:03,400
you will note that major Task 2 requires the development

137
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,430
of an action plan.

138
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,970
To complete such a large task, Peter

139
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,960
needs to identify and complete sub-tasks

140
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,680
that will contribute to the achievement of the major task.

141
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,340
One such example of a sub-task is the organisation

142
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,230
of a conference with heads of schools.

143
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,130
There will be other sub-tasks that he

144
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,810
will need to consider before putting an action

145
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,240
plan together.

146
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,850
A WBS is developed following a step-by-step process.

147
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,290
The smaller and more clearly defined

148
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,000
each step is, the more likely successful completion

149
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,706
of a major task is in any project will be.

150
00:07:44,706 --> 00:07:45,130
Right.

151
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,110
Now that we have clarified our scope

152
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,750
and have a better understanding of the role of the WBS,

153
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,590
the next step is to put together a schedule.
