STELLA BACHTIS: Effective communication

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,460
is a shared process between project manager, project team,

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,720
and project stakeholders.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,940
Effective project communication creates an environment

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,470
which allows for sharing of issues and celebrating wins.

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,000
For both the project team and stakeholders

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,850
to be engaged and supportive of the project,

8
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,870
the project communication plan needs

9
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,060
to be open and transparent.

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,190
Project managers have to keep everyone

11
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,170
who has an interest in the project in the loop

12
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,720
and communicate relevant project information to them.

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,110
Project communication is often quite challenging,

14
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,070
given the varying interests of stakeholders

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,710
and their potential influence on the project outcomes.

16
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,940
There are, however, some tools that

17
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:01,260
can assist you in facilitating more efficient communication.

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,569
Let's take a quick look at some of the readily accessible tools

19
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,200
that are currently available.

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,010
The advent of modern technology has certainly

21
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,470
been a great enabler in creating centralised, accessible storage

22
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,540
repositories to support and enhance project communication

23
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,540
and collaboration.

24
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,650
Dropbox, OneDrive, a Google Drive, or iCloud

25
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,180
allows you to control access and invite collaborators

26
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,680
to key documentation.

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,090
Nominated collaborators can access, edit, comment,

28
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,760
and approve documents in shared files,

29
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,320
allowing for real time access.

30
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,230
Using modern technology in the context of Peter's office

31
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,340
project would be a great tool to keep stakeholders

32
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,750
in the loop with progress information

33
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,630
and updated documents in relation to the project.

34
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,680
Peter's stakeholders, in particular the schools

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,750
and community organisations, might decide to share

36
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,950
their system implementation policy and procedure documents

37
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,480
as they relate this to the project.

38
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,070
The objective might be that all stakeholders will

39
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,960
be able to create better alignment by sharing this

40
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,220
with Peter to help inform Peter's design process.

41
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,020
Peter can easily access those documents

42
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,130
and collate them within the overall objectives

43
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,290
of his procedure.

44
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,770
It also assists Peter with an opportunity

45
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,770
to question any points that he is unsure of

46
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,670
or that don't align with the initial outcomes

47
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,910
of the project.

48
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,520
A centralised system can also be password protected

49
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,750
and permission given only to those

50
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,910
stakeholders responsible for any document

51
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,270
development or adaptation.

52
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:47,160
Publishing a project schedule and updating it regularly

53
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,340
is another essential communication tool for those

54
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,630
involved in your project.

55
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,260
It is an easy and effective way to allow

56
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,390
project team members to view the project status they require.

57
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,790
Basecamp is another useful online tool

58
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,820
that readily enables this and has a number of useful plugins

59
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:12,310
that help users visualise the schedule and related tasks.

60
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,600
From a project management perspective,

61
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,610
it provides a project manager greater control

62
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,200
over the monitoring and review of the activities that

63
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,440
have been scheduled.

64
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,930
As you may remember, certain activities in a project

65
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,770
can be completed simultaneously, as they

66
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,610
don't rely on any dependencies.

67
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,120
Therefore, this visual representation

68
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,720
that is accessible to all stakeholders and provides them

69
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,200
with a very clear overview of when

70
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,560
they should start and complete the activities for which they

71
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,650
are responsible.

72
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,440
This form of communication would work particularly

73
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,900
well for Anne's wedding project, since she

74
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,990
is reliant on quite a few external stakeholders

75
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,430
to compete certain tasks and deliver them within the very

76
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,370
demanding time frame.

77
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,030
These are but a few of the tools that

78
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,520
are available to enable effective communication.

79
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,910
It is important that you select tools

80
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,920
that are best suited to the size and complexity of your project.

81
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,723
