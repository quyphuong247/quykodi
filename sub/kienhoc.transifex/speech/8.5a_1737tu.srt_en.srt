00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,360
MATT MCGARRITY: We've spent a lot of time thinking about your argument for this

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,390
speech, your persuasive argument.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,990
What I would like to do now is just talk a little bit about fallacies.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,480
Fallacies are flawed arguments.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,360
And in this segment, I want to talk about fallacies of claims and data.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,660
So in that sense, we're back to these key notions of claim, data, warrant.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,740
All of the stuff that we were talking about way back in

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,020
the impromptu speech.

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,290
And fallacy comes from the Latin that means, trick or deceit.

10
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,670
My concern with fallacies is twofold.

11
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,800
One, you should avoid fallacies.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,970
And you should avoid committing fallacies.

13
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,650
I call these fallacies on the page.

14
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,470
You should avoid writing a flawed argument.

15
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,655
And that's a chief concern.

16
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:47,620
And you can take a lot of fallacy classes, logic classes that are

17
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,640
concerned with avoiding performing a fallacy.

18
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,560
As speakers, we've got an additional concern.

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,930
Not only should you avoid fallacies, but, you should avoid sounding like

20
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,320
you're committing a fallacy.

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,720
So not only should you avoid fallacies on the page, you should make sure that

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,950
your audiences understand that you're not engaging in a flawed reasoning.

23
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,270
That's a higher bar.

24
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,870
That requires you to think more through the ears of your audience and

25
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,700
how they're going to interpret what you say.

26
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,760
So I want to talk a little bit about these fallacies, and how

27
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,850
you can avoid them.

28
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,610
And what you want to be doing to make sure that your audience knows that

29
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,640
you've got a good argument.

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,380
So like I said, we're going to be talking about fallacies

31
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,200
of claims and data.

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,140
So let's begin with a fallacy of a claim.

33
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,090
A false dilemma.

34
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:39,980
A false dilemma simply is reducing a complex issue to two issues.

35
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,520
And I've got a sample text here that I'm going to read to you.

36
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,890
I've used this sample text for years.

37
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,480
I went ahead and looked on it so I could make the proper attribution.

38
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,360
And I plugged in this quotation.

39
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,590
And, like, every fallacy website online uses this quotation.

40
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,050
I don't know where it started from, but this is usually popular.

41
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,170
But it's a good illustration of a false dilemma.

42
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,480
So it's from a book called Hostages to Fortune.

43
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,190
"Gerda Reith is convinced that superstition can be a positive force.

44
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,449
'It gives you a sense of control by making you think you can work out

45
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,630
what's going to happen next,' she says.

46
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,800
"And it also makes you feel lucky.

47
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,500
And to take a risk or to enter into a chancy situation, you really have to

48
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,380
believe in your own luck.

49
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,100
In that sense, it's a very useful way of thinking, because the alternative

50
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,600
is fatalism, which is to say, 'Oh, there's nothing I can do.' At least

51
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,790
superstition makes people do things."

52
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,170
Alright, well that's a false dilemma.

53
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,240
The opposite of superstition is not fatalism.

54
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,340
It's not those two choices.

55
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,485
It's not either I am superstition--

56
00:02:41,485 --> 00:02:46,730
either or I'm going to cast lots in order to determine what the day looks

57
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,770
like, or, that's it, I'm committing suicide.

58
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:54,100
Those are not the two options that we are presented with in this life.

59
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,500
The opposite of anything of superstition would be "not

60
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,300
superstition." Presence absence.

61
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,590
So, this is creating only two options where there are

62
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,260
multiple options around.

63
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:05,800
OK.

64
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,810
And to do so is to minimize unnecessarily your argument, the range

65
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,050
of possible actions, to only two.

66
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,070
So that's one fallacy of claim.

67
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,190
Another policy of claim is begging the question, which would be simply

68
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:23,010
supporting a claim with the claim itself (slightly restated).

69
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,980
So the famous example of this is, since I'm not lying, I'm clearly

70
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,070
telling the truth.

71
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,640
Those are both the same claims.

72
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,380
There's nothing outside of the claim.

73
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:32,630
Right.

74
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,720
The nice thing about a claim and data is you've got the claim, and then

75
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,210
you've got something exterior to the claim, something separate from the

76
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:43,460
claim that we can use to validate that claim or to prove that claim.

77
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:48,000
So with begging the question, you have the claim and then you swap it around,

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,480
you have it put on a silly hat and a fake moustache.

79
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,150
Aha!

80
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,860
No it's still not data, it's still just the claim.

81
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,380
OK.

82
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,070
So begging the question, you're not providing enough of a break between

83
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,270
the claim and the data.

84
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:04,500
Once again, either with false dilemma or with begging the question, if

85
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,190
you're looking at your argument and you know a oppositional audience

86
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:14,050
member might hear that piece of your speech as begging the question or as

87
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:17,790
one of these, you want to go out of your way to demonstrate, in this case,

88
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,829
why the data is separate from the claim.

89
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,150
Talk through why you're not actually begging the question.

90
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,270
Another fallacy of claim would be slippery slope reasoning.

91
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,810
So in slippery slope reasoning, one event leads to another, to another, to

92
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,400
another, without the necessary logical connections.

93
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,140
So we hear these arguments a lot in terms of development.

94
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,990
So if we improve this highway, it will lead to urban sprawl and the absolute

95
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,630
destruction of our local environment.

96
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,040
Well, pump your brakes there chief, because you went from zero to sixty

97
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,730
pretty doggone fast.

98
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,840
Each one of those probably require separate proof.

99
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,700
If we improve this highway, it will lead urban sprawl.

100
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,860
That's an issue that demands demonstration, that demands evidence.

101
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,100
You can't simply assume that and immediately jump on to the next claim.

102
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,410
Here is really important, because, for you--

103
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,190
the argument that you're making-- you may see and understand these logical

104
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,210
connections.

105
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,880
But if that target audience doesn't see and hear those logical

106
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,130
connections, they could assume you're engaging in slippery slope reasoning.

107
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:29,270
So be very careful to make sure that you're proving your argument, that

108
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,700
you're not assuming too much.

109
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,600
Because the goal is not convince you.

110
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,650
You're already on your own side, I would imagine--

111
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,920
unless you're a self-loathing persuader--

112
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,500
I assume you're on your own side.

113
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,070
Your goal is to think through how that audience is going to hear.

114
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,480
And they may not see that logical connection, so you need to

115
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,070
prove it for them.

116
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,620
So those are some fallacies of claims.

117
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,850
Then we get into fallacies of data.

118
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,640
So here, is there something flawed about the data source and its

119
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,900
relationship to the claim?

120
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,340
So an ad populum.

121
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:07,470
An ad populum is appealing to popular support as the sole basis for support.

122
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,510
And especially sole basis when it would be the

123
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,530
inappropriate basis for support.

124
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,350
So, hypothetically you could say, "Millions of gamers--

125
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,710
computer gamers-- bought the Wii.

126
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:20,030
Therefore, it is the best system around." Well, best system around is a

127
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:24,540
value claim, and you are using merely a numerical claim to back that up.

128
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,310
So popular support for the thing doesn't mean it's the best, you'd have

129
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,350
to identify what constitutes best-- best graphics, best whatever.

130
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:38,370
You could have populus support without being a fallacy if you said, the Wii

131
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,450
is the bestselling system around, and it's the bestselling because it was

132
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,940
bought by the most people.

133
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,110
That's clear.

134
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,920
That's not a flawed argument.

135
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,730
But it's because the claim and the data are logical

136
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,810
connections for one another.

137
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,680
So ad populum is where there's that sort of slippage, there's that missing

138
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,170
piece, where popular support isn't really what you needed in order to

139
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,680
prove that claim.

140
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,940
And I want to end this small lecture with another fallacy

141
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,230
of data, a red herring.

142
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:11,670
So in a red herring, what we're saying is that you're raising irrelevant data

143
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,940
to distract.

144
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,020
Right.

145
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,400
The etymology--

146
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,680
the hypothetical, perhaps, etymology of this term--

147
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,640
is that, back when the rich landowners engaged in fox hunts across the

148
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,850
British countryside, they'd be riding their horses.

149
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,860
The dogs would be chasing a fox.

150
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,070
The fox would run through somebody's field of oats--

151
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,620
I don't know what they grow--

152
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,060
so it'd run through their field.

153
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,100
And then the fox would run into the field.

154
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,690
The dogs would run through the field.

155
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,070
The men on the horses would come through and trample down the field.

156
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,750
And so the farmers--

157
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:53,020
so the story goes-- would drag herring or some other really smelly fish

158
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,110
around the edge of their field.

159
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,030
So the fox would run through the field, and then the dogs would smell

160
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,840
the fish and they'd be all confused.

161
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,660
That's what a red herring fallacy is supposedly doing.

162
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,890
It's throwing you off the scent of the claim.

163
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:08,220
You're listening to a speech and then the data comes up.

164
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:08,770
Argh!

165
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:09,750
Confused!

166
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,830
What were you talking about?

167
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,460
I'm convinced.

168
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:17,190
So a red herring is irrelevant data raised in order to distract the

169
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,520
listener from the argument.

170
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,590
And I'm going to have you watch, at the end of this video, on the page,

171
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,840
there's a YouTube video of--

172
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,270
it's on the page, it's not in this lecture clip--

173
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,910
a clip of Nixon's Checkers speech.

174
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,809
So this is often claimed as a red herring.

175
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,970
Just a little bit of background if you're unfamiliar with it.

176
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,909
After his 1950 election to the Senate--

177
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,960
after his 1950 election--

178
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,990
Nixon had a special fund set up to support further campaign efforts.

179
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,570
And this ended up with a travel allowance for Nixon.

180
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,960
So when Nixon ran as vice president on the Eisenhower ticket in 1952, this

181
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,420
fund came back and it was reported on as being ethically dubious.

182
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,660
And so this is often been critiqued as being a red herring issue.

183
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,410
Because what he does is he goes through and gives himself an audit,

184
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,720
and then at the end of his speech-- and television's very much in its

185
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,760
infancy here-- at the end of this speech he says, now people have

186
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,860
critiqued me for a number of reasons, but we received a dog as a gift.

187
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,320
And I've got two little girls and they love the dog, but I'm not going to

188
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,740
give back the dog.

189
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,850
No one was saying that he should give back dogs.

190
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:29,110
The were talking about campaign funds and misattribution and ethically

191
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,310
dubious behavior.

192
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:34,900
This was well before Watergate, but that was the issue, is that some saw

193
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:42,120
that piece of evidence as an overly maudlin attempt to distract from the

194
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,600
key issue of inappropriate use of funds.

195
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,740
So you can go ahead and take a look at this clip, this small segment, as this

196
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,190
performance of what some have critiqued it as being, a red herring.

197
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,440
