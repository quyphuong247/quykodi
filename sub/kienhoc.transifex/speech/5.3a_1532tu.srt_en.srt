00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,590
MATT MCGARRITY: We started out this week by talking about some general prompts for

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,350
coming up with key ideas-- main points.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,750
Then we started thinking about some potential arrangement patterns and how

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,660
you might start dialing that in.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,440
And so what I'd like to do now is talk a little bit about refining your

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,500
arrangement invention.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,230
And this is really revising your structure.

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,530
These are principles for revisiting your outline--

9
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,930
for revising what you've got mapped out up to this point.

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,600
And one of the very first public speaking textbooks I started with when

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,520
I started teaching public speaking was Osborn and Osborn.

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,120
And now it's Osborn, Osborn, and Osborn.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,030
And who knows, in 10 years there maybe five more.

14
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,940
But Osborn, Osborn, and Osborn's Public Speaking texts-- one thing that

15
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:49,200
they've had in that book for many, many years is these key principles of

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,290
arrangement.

17
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,100
And I think they're very useful.

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,120
They are simplicity, balance, and order.

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,720
So I want to spend a little bit of time talking about these principles of

20
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,690
good arrangement--

21
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,940
of good speaking--

22
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,970
because they can be very useful in going back and making revisions to the

23
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,590
outline that you have.

24
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,590
So this is kind of-- as you've got some ideas down on paper--

25
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,130
maybe you've done a run-through or two, but you're really starting to

26
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,880
take a hard look at what that order is-- what the arrangements is.

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,850
We should be thinking in terms of simplicity, balance, and order.

28
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,740
So let's go ahead and start with simplicity.

29
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,680
The key question here is, have you eliminated all the unnecessary clutter

30
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,410
from your speech.

31
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:29,950
OK?

32
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,100
Have you gotten down to the key ideas.

33
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,330
And certainly, Steve Jobs is well known--

34
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,250
was well known-- for being sort of a master of simplicity.

35
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,230
And one of his talks--

36
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:47,010
one of the things he said was that, "Simple can be harder than complex.

37
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,850
You have to work really hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple.

38
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,550
But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move

39
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,450
mountains."

40
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,850
So this idea--

41
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,160
of not just simplicity but sort of the sublime simplicity--

42
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,490
really getting to a core idea--

43
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,509
removing all that unnecessary clutter--

44
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:10,729
And we want to do that in public speaking as well.

45
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,020
And this isn't dumbing stuff down.

46
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,130
And I want to be very clear on this.

47
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:22,960
It's not about making your contents simple, but achieving sort of elegance

48
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,600
in design of that presentation--

49
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,220
achieving simplicity without being simple.

50
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,220
That's a real task.

51
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,750
And that's why it requires so many multiple passes on pulling together

52
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,490
that speech outline.

53
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:42,790
So one of the first things under simplicity is limit your main points.

54
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:48,110
Don't ask us to hold too many big ideas in our head at the same time.

55
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:53,510
Through a little bit of thinking, you can figure out how to get all the same

56
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:58,010
content that was in a speech with seven main points and four sub-points

57
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,020
under each into a speech that has maybe four main points.

58
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,770
And between two and four sub-points under each.

59
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,980
It just takes a little bit of sort of figuring what has to be in there.

60
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,190
Keeping it simple.

61
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,260
And I want to get to this story.

62
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,600
And this is a very not a sad story It would be sad if this person knew that

63
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,320
this story happened.

64
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,080
So here at the University of Washington, a number of years ago, I

65
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,800
was a co-teaching a course.

66
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,620
And so I would sit in on the lectures.

67
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,650
I'd sit way in the back of the lecture hall.

68
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,150
But I had to be partially responsible for the content that was going on.

69
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,320
And the large class that I was co-teaching had a guest

70
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,710
lecturer that day.

71
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,480
Great person.

72
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,920
Just a master of their field.

73
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,490
Very well respected in the scholarly realm.

74
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,750
And a wonderful human being.

75
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,980
And delight.

76
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,130
A beautiful, beautiful soul.

77
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:59,770
But on in question, this he or she--

78
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,790
this "shim"--

79
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,510
was doing a presentation on their area of research.

80
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,690
And it's a large lecture hall so there was probably about

81
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,770
200 students in there.

82
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,990
Not an uber lecture, but a big lecture.

83
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,350
So about 200 students in there.

84
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,480
Keep in mind, I'm sitting up in the back so I can see everything

85
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,460
that's going on.

86
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:22,410
And this guest lecturer had projected up on the screen the 17

87
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,250
points he or she--

88
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,940
I do not want this person to know that this is about them.

89
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,900
It was a wonderful person.

90
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,710
But it was bad.

91
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:36,390
They had up on the screen the 17 points that they were going to discuss

92
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,700
in their 45 minute talk.

93
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,930
17 points that they were going to say.

94
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,190
It was written on the overhead--

95
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,690
projected up on the screen.

96
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,980
Today we're going to cover one through 17.

97
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,590
Sitting in the back here's what I saw.

98
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:55,610
I saw students come in, go find their seats, sit down, look up, see that

99
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:01,750
list of 17 things and out went the laptop, in went the headphones.

100
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,770
And they were gone.

101
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,120
Right?

102
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,950
They were physically there, but mentally they were miles away.

103
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,920
I saw other people come in, sit down, do the same thing--

104
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,570
look at those 17 points--

105
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,390
their headphones when in, shades went down, and they were

106
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,660
asleep the entire time.

107
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,280
Not the most comfortable place to sleep but that's where they chose to

108
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,010
sleep because they weren't going to stick around for these 17 points.

109
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:22,920
And here's what I saw.

110
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,130
And this happened on more than one occasion.

111
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:30,030
I saw people walk into the class, take a look up at the screen, and walk

112
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,090
right back out.

113
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,610
And they left and they didn't come back for the rest of the day.

114
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,180
And it was not that bad of a lecture.

115
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,230
But people just saw 17 point.

116
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,400
That's a crazy amount of content.

117
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,730
And what was really going on--

118
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,930
I wouldn't say tragedy, it wasn't tragic--

119
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,560
but what was going on is there weren't 17 points.

120
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:59,230
There were probably three main ideas with three to four main ideas under

121
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,530
each one of those.

122
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:00,950
OK?

123
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,750
But what had happened is this speaker didn't provide that

124
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,260
hierarchy of meaning.

125
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,840
They didn't simplify the key ideas.

126
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,530
Rather, they took all those main points and sub-points, and pthththt,

127
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,080
put them all flush left.

128
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,360
So there wasn't a difference between a big idea and a medium-size idea and a

129
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,580
small idea.

130
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,030
They didn't get to say, There are three things I want to talk about.

131
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:22,880
Here is the first thing.

132
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,760
And under this, there are two things I want you to remember.

133
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,180
OK?

134
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,750
That's a much simpler way of organizing that presentation.

135
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,630
But what they had done is they said, Here's everything that

136
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,490
I'm going to say.

137
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,580
And I'm not going to break it out in terms of it's level of priority.

138
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,270
So simplify.

139
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,440
Take all that thing and provide us with a sense of--

140
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,020
a way of distinguishing main points and sub-points.

141
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,320
Big ideas, small ideas, developing detail--

142
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
but simplified.

143
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,590
Limit your main points.

144
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,880
And in doing so, by providing us with here's a key idea, here are some

145
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,360
smaller ideas, here's the developing detail, you're giving us a sense of a

146
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,460
relationship to the material.

147
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,690
So again, if you're informing us, we're novices.

148
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:11,430
You got to tell us, this is a bigger idea and encompasses this one, which

149
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,670
encompasses this one.

150
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,310
You're providing filtering function.

151
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,010
You're providing meaning to the content in addition to just giving us

152
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,170
the content.

153
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:24,570
So as you're looking at your outline, you're thinking in terms of, what is

154
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,470
the hierarchy of ideas.

155
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:31,610
How can that help someone understand this concept?

156
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,170
Can you group like ideas together?

157
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,760
So instead of having 17 points, can you say, You know what, these five

158
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,460
kind of bind together.

159
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,870
I'm going to make that a discrete point and talk about it

160
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,840
as a discrete thing.

161
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,090
So the issue is, simplify.

162
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:53,560
Now I generally like my main points to be somewhere between three and five

163
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,170
big points on long speeches--

164
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,740
speeches between an hour or to two hours.

165
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,480
And I can find a way of getting all my material in there.

166
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:07,830
But I'm constantly providing context as people walk into the information.

167
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,560
Here's where we are.

168
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,150
This is one big idea but it has two smaller ideas.

169
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,600
Now we're in the first small idea.

170
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,440
Here's some detail on it.

171
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:20,160
So I'm performing that outline for them because it provides a hierarchy

172
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,710
of meaning.

173
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,400
Certainly I don't want to probably go more than four main

174
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,790
points on a short speech--

175
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,030
10 minutes or less.

176
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,580
But none of these are written in stone.

177
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,010
Or if they are written in stone, that was a waste of somebody's time.

178
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,929
Because it all depends.

179
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:39,090
It all depends on the content and it depends on the audience.

180
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:45,280
But the issue is, you want to be aiming for simplicity, elegance, doing

181
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,060
the hard work of figuring out how to reduce the content to its core

182
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,450
component without dumbing it down.

183
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,600
And that takes a lot of time and a lot of effort.

184
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,340
But you can probably start seeing it, not only in your speeches, but the

185
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,590
speeches of others.

186
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,400
