1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,450
SPEAKER 1: So where we left off was at the level of claims and evidence.

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,720
So we've got the basics bones of this argument down.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,880
Now, I start wanting to add flesh and sinew.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,750
OK, so we've got the basic bones of the argument down, claims and

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,390
evidence, and so now, the challenge is balancing claims and evidence so that

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:25,170
you sound good, you sound smooth, and the speech is clear.

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,040
And discussing evidence is vitally important, because what you're doing

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,250
when you're discussing evidence, well, is you're helping the audience

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,040
distinguish between key idea and supporting idea.

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,870
Remember back to the discussions we had about the difference between

11
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,910
literacy and orality.

12
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,370
The audience doesn't hold onto, they don't have a physical copy of your

13
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:46,650
communique.

14
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,450
They're only listening to you.

15
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,910
So they can't hear boldface or italics.

16
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,110
They certainly can't see what you've got underlined in your speech, so you

17
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,230
have to help us follow along and distinguish between high priority and

18
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,740
low priority ideas by virtue of your performance.

19
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,180
Claims and evidence provide that role.

20
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,380
The claim is really what you want us to remember and understand.

21
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,500
The evidence is there to support it.

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,840
And this works across all types of scenarios.

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,840
When I work with scientists or with business leaders, it comes down, more

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,200
often than not, to talking to them about--

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,100
talking to evidence well.

26
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,370
Being able to distinguish between claim and evidence.

27
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,170
It's an absolutely essential part of speaking clearly.

28
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,030
So then the issue is, when you stand up to speak and you're doing these two

29
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,670
point impromptu speeches, how do you discuss that evidence?

30
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,460
Well, remember, we said that the role of evidence is to validate the claim.

31
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:46,560
So when we're discussing evidence, your chief goal is to explain how and

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,060
why the evidence supports the claim.

33
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,870
Don't wander off on a tangent just talking about the evidence.

34
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,940
You're talking about that evidence for a purpose, and that purpose is

35
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,650
explaining why this evidence advances this claim.

36
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,810
Why this evidence demonstrates this claim.

37
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,270
And so when discussing that, you want to make sure that your brief because

38
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,990
you are driven by that purpose.

39
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,380
For any piece of evidence there's probably a thousand different things

40
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,440
that you could say.

41
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,590
You're not going to say all of those.

42
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,230
You're going to say only the stuff that relates to advancing that claim.

43
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,800
And this is going to provide you with a set of criteria

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,650
for staying on topic.

45
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,200
Does this really relate to the claim?

46
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,810
If not, move on.

47
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,170
And so you are explaining the how and the why.

48
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,990
And we can actually see this outside of this impromptu speech.

49
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:37,050
So I'm going to show a video here in a moment, and it's an older video.

50
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,815
It's J. Allard, who was corporate vice-president for Xbox, when they

51
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:46,030
were getting ready to roll out the Xbox 360 gaining console.

52
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,540
And he's being interviewed, and he's being asked about controllers.

53
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,090
He's talking about video game controllers, and what you're going to

54
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,470
hear him say is--

55
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,390
he's got this claim, control should be invisible.

56
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,310
Now, this is way back before the Kinect, and we are all dancing around

57
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,250
in front of our TVs like idiots.

58
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,460
But so when he says control should be an invisible, he means

59
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,940
they should be intuitive.

60
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,890
But you can hear how he's got a claim and two pieces of evidence.

61
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:18,720
But listen to how he tacks back and forth between the claim and evidence.

62
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,830
He's got the claim.

63
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,300
He'll discuss the evidence a little bit, tie it back to the claim, move

64
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,520
onto a little bit more evidence, tie it back to the claim and wrap up the

65
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,130
entire point.

66
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,090
And that's what we're going to be aiming for.

67
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,160
That's what we're going to be working on specifically in this lecture here.

68
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,800
So let's go ahead and take a listen to J. Allard talking about the need for

69
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,730
controls to be invisible.

70
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,310
J. ALLARD: I think controllers are incredibly important, and the

71
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,575
important thing about controls it that it becomes invisible.

72
00:03:45,575 --> 00:03:49,430
To the extent that you have to think about controls, you get distracted.

73
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,920
What I think would be a bad strategy with controls is to

74
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,810
do something radical.

75
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,400
We introduced Live Arcade this year.

76
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,420
And I have a number of friends that aren't hardcore console passionate

77
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,410
gamers that want to sit down and play 50 hour games, so I've downloaded all

78
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,520
the Live Arcade games.

79
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,290
I've got a big screen TV, and they want to play Puzzle Collapse in my

80
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,220
living room.

81
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,340
Simple game.

82
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,620
It's D, pattern A. For you and for most years your readers, it's no big

83
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,510
deal, right?

84
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,649
For most of my friends that don't play console video games,

85
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,459
they're looking down.

86
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,060
They're looking down.

87
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,530
They're trying to find the A button, because it's not the

88
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,990
home keys for them.

89
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,410
So I think what we have to do is we really have to embrace the fact that

90
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,730
we're starting to standardize the controls, they're starting to become

91
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:34,630
invisible, and just like the keyboard and mouse got to a certain point, all

92
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,660
the capabilities were there, and then we locked on it.

93
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,050
We're not moving the letters around, guys.

94
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,720
We're not moving the function keys.

95
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,660
The numeric keypad is laid out a certain way.

96
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,180
We've come to a place now where game controls, I think, are very, very

97
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,240
good, and we want to make them more invisible.

98
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,130
So my emphasis is less on radical innovation.

99
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,110
My emphasis is more on really becoming truly invisible so that you can be

100
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,700
immersed in the experience.

101
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:03,730
SPEAKER 1: So what's going on in there is you want to be able to have a

102
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,200
structure to how you move through the point.

103
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,660
So when I coached speech, competitive speech, I coach with a guy named

104
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,930
George LaMaster.

105
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,330
Absolutely, wonderful speaker.

106
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,660
Wonderful speech coach, and he would talk about this in terms of saying,

107
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,370
for each claim, you wanted to state it, explain it, prove it, conclude it.

108
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,800
Now, you've probably seen that elsewhere.

109
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,310
I've certainly heard that when talking about writing a paragraph.

110
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,330
But for each one of your claims in this impromptu speech, you can think

111
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,680
in terms of state it, explain it, prove it, conclude it.

112
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,950
And that has you relating the claim to the evidence.

113
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,400
Let me unpack each one of these.

114
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,750
So first off, state it.

115
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,840
Just give us the claim, your key idea.

116
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,490
The thing that if we were taking notes, we'd better write down.

117
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,850
So in the clip we just watched, J. Allard's idea was

118
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,770
control should be invisible.

119
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:58,160
And since that is of a higher priority then the support that's going to come

120
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,752
after it, as a delivery note, it should probably be slower and you

121
00:06:01,752 --> 00:06:04,780
should probably throw a pause in before and after that claim.

122
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,050
And I'll demonstrate this here in a moment.

123
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:07,580
State it.

124
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,620
Explain it.

125
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,700
Spend a little bit of time unpacking the evidence and

126
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,050
priming us for the evidence.

127
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:14,580
Unpacking--

128
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,970
sorry, spend a little bit of time unpacking the claim and priming us for

129
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:18,990
the evidence.

130
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,860
So you've stated it, and then you've got-- sometimes I refer to these as

131
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,080
buffer sentences.

132
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,440
You're building a bridge between that claim and that evidence.

133
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,960
And auditorily, we've heard the claim, and as it's sinking in, you're just

134
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,450
elaborating on it.

135
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,760
You're not immediately jumping to the evidence.

136
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,200
You're just sort of unpacking that claim a little bit, giving us time to

137
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,480
process it, so that when we fully understood it, then you're hitting us

138
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,230
with the evidence.

139
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:51,650
Here, too, you'd probably also, in many cases, preview the support.

140
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,130
I'm going to ask you to do that in the impromptu.

141
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,480
I'm going to ask you to say, I can think of two reasons why this is the

142
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,630
case or two cases of this.

143
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,060
So then you get into the actual evidence.

144
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,810
Prove it.

145
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,080
Get into the details of the evidence, and how they relate to the claim.

146
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,610
So here's where the evidence is.

147
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:12,370
On your note card, you've got probably a line for the claim, and then you've

148
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,890
got a couple lines for the evidence.

149
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,230
So if you looked at the card, it looks like all your time should be spent

150
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:17,920
with evidence.

151
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,520
No.

152
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,760
We want to get to the evidence, but you've got to walk us through context.

153
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,700
We've got to know why this evidence is coming and how it's going to relate to

154
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,890
the claim that you're doing.

155
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,320
State it, explain it, prove it.

156
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,970
Here's where you're just walking us through the evidence.

157
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,560
But Then, conclude it.

158
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,270
Walk us back out of the point.

159
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,480
Reinforce the claim.

160
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,990
Reestablish the claim and reinforce its relationship to the thesis.

161
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:47,160
So once again, in that J. Allard clip, it was control should be invisible.

162
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,020
He talks through one example and sort of illustrates that idea.

163
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,320
He talks through another example and illustrates.

164
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,870
When controls are invisible and when they're not invisible, intuitive and

165
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,420
not intuitive, and then he telescopes to back out.

166
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,940
And the last few sentences are, so in the end, I really think that we should

167
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,860
get to a point where controls are just more intuitive and increasingly more

168
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,020
and more invisible.

169
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,720
He restates the claim.

170
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,550
You may have heard, in all your writing instruction up to this point,

171
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:18,440
don't repeat yourself, and that makes sense if I'm holding onto your essay

172
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,780
and I can read the lines or I can underline the important thing.

173
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,940
Your audience is trapped by the flow of time.

174
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:30,260
They can't rehear what you said 10 sentences ago unless you say it again,

175
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,330
or they recorded you.

176
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,840
So here's an opportunity.

177
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,730
You walk us into the point, state it, get us to the evidence, explain it,

178
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:42,370
prove the point by discussion of the evidence, and then you telescope back

179
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,809
out for conclude it.

180
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,390
So I'm going to demonstrate this.

181
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:51,350
So last week, at the last lecture of last week, I said that MOOC providers

182
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,070
shouldn't pressure universities to offer university

183
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,530
credit for MOOC classes.

184
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,230
So let's say this time, I'm going to argue the opposite.

185
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,460
So yes, they should.

186
00:08:59,460 --> 00:08:59,890
Why?

187
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,255
Because establishing credit strengthens the quality of MOOCs, and

188
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:06,260
then I've got two pieces of support here.

189
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,280
Universities can always reject the claim.

190
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,740
And I've got my two pieces of support here.

191
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,840
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to go ahead and go through this

192
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:22,310
point, and for each one of these, I'll highlight where I am in the state it,

193
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,600
explain it, prove it, conclude it.

194
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,333
