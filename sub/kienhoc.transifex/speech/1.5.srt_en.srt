MATT MCGARRITY: So here we are at the end of the content for week one.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,000
And now, it's time to do a speech.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,670
The goal is to have you doing speeches more and more and more.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,540
Remember, instruction, imitation, and practice.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,260
Instruction, imitation, and practice.

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,530
We've had instruction.

7
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,800
And this introductory speech is going to speak to imitation and practice.

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,170
Now, this is just a light speech.

9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,580
It's an introductory speech.

10
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm using it because I want to set a baseline so you can see how you

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,750
improve over the course, what skills you need to work on as

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,520
we go over the course.

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,450
It's an opportunity for us to get to know each other in the medium that

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,510
we're working in.

15
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,320
So lots Coursera courses have discussion forums where

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,480
you introduce yourself.

17
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,920
I want to have those as well.

18
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,940
But we should also be using speech as a way of getting to know each other.

19
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,850
This will allow us to develop a pool of model speakers.

20
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,570
In a second, you'll see what I'm asking you to do in this

21
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,570
introductory speech.

22
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,250
But identifying a model of imitation is one of those things.

23
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,570
So this allows us to develop that pool.

24
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,170
And it allows us to start analyzing good speech-- what

25
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,040
works and what doesn't.

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,980
What is an introductory speech that really stands out from the crowd?

27
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,020
So this introductory speech is very brief.

28
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:17,020
In one to four minutes, tell us who you are and where you live.

29
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,310
Just tell us who you are and where you live, why you signed up for the

30
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,800
course, and what types of presentations you want to work on.

31
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,150
And then here's the imitation element.

32
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,550
Who do you think is an effective speaker and why?

33
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,380
So give us the name.

34
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,650
And we can go look them up on our own.

35
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,570
But give us a name and give me one reason why that person is

36
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,440
particularly strong.

37
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,140
So I didn't write this out.

38
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,040
I didn't plan this out.

39
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,080
But since this is an introductory speech, I'll introduce myself again.

40
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,260
So I'm asking you who you are, where you live, why you signed up for the

41
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,650
course, what types of presentations you want to work on, and what types of

42
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:01,930
presentations you normally give, and who is a model speaker and why.

43
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,520
So for me, here's how this would sound.

44
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,190
Hi.

45
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,510
My name's Matt McGarrity.

46
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,440
I live in Seattle, Washington.

47
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,826
I signed up for the course because I was paid to.

48
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:12,280
No, I wasn't paid to.

49
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,590
I signed up for the course because I do a lot of speaking.

50
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,540
But I've started to do speaking in new types of genres.

51
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,090
And I want to improve that skill.

52
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,100
So the types of presentations I normally give are

53
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,910
lectures in front of classes.

54
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:32,340
And what I want to work on are shorter presentations aimed with less audience

55
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,710
response where I'm not really seeing the audience.

56
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,510
So that's the genre I've been working in lately.

57
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,450
Now, a model speaker who I think is particularly good is Robert Reich,

58
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,860
former US Secretary of Labor.

59
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,000
And the reason I think he is so good is because he's energetic.

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,990
He's funny.

61
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:53,530
But he's also very good at moving between a key idea that he wants you

62
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,700
to understand and some really deep detail.

63
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,730
And he doesn't get lost in the detail.

64
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,250
And he doesn't ignore it either.

65
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,410
He balances the general claim and the specific support very well.

66
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,350
And I think that's an admirable trait.

67
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,070
And it's one that I wish I did better.

68
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,850
Thank you.

69
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,710
So that would be a good sample speech or a sample speech anyway.

70
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,140
I want you to do this.

71
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,500
In the next video lecture, we'll talk about how you go about posting these

72
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,720
and also a little bit how you should be thinking about practicing these.

73
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,870
Let me just say by way of preview, when you, in this class, perform a

74
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:34,260
speech for a video, I would really ask you to not record it 1,000 times.

75
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,470
And I want you to go with a speech.

76
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,510
So once you start it, once you've got the camera

77
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,880
rolling, record that speech.

78
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,750
If you find yourself in a problem speaking, if you find yourself in a

79
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,335
dark alley of your main point, I don't want you to stop the speech, restart

80
00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:53,520
it, and we never see that.

81
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,470
I want you to start working on practicing getting yourself out of

82
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,280
that situation, because that's what you're going to have to do when you

83
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,120
stand up in front of a live audience.

84
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,980
Your business presentation is going to look pretty crummy if you get five

85
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,120
minutes and you go, oh, stop.

86
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,900
Everybody forget what happened over the past five minutes.

87
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,800
You don't have that capacity.

88
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,710
So you need to be working on getting yourself out of issues,

89
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,100
practicing past them.

90
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,620
You forget what you're going to say.

91
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,329
Take a moment in the speech, regather your thoughts, and keep going, because

92
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:24,720
that's what we're working on-- dynamic abilities of responding to what

93
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,110
happens when you stand up to speak, what happens when

94
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,370
there's an audience there.

95
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,900
And I'll speak more in the next lecture to how we do this, how we

96
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,030
should be practicing these speeches when we don't have audiences, because

97
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,540
that's, in essence, the situation we find ourselves in for most of these

98
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,440
speeches in an online course.

99
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,930
But we'll talk about that in a bit.

100
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,570
For now, post those speeches online.

101
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,990
I want to know who you are.

102
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,730
I want to know what type of speeches you want to focus on.

103
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:54,630
And I certainly want to know and expand my own knowledge of really good

104
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,880
model speakers.

105
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,683
