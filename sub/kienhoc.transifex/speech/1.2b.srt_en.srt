MATT MCGARRITY: Some of the earliest thinkers in rhetoric argued that the

1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,260
study and practice of rhetoric involved five main parts.

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,320
Invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,460
And these more or less tracked sort of the lifespan of the

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,130
development of a speech.

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,325
So we start off with invention.

6
00:00:18,325 --> 00:00:21,580
And invention here means coming up with ideas.

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,260
So that the first thing that's going to go into a good

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,730
speech is good material.

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,870
So invention means thinking through all that content.

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,770
And there are a number of strategies for coming up with good ideas.

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,310
Figuring out what is going to be useful for an audience.

12
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,040
If you're explaining a new concept, what do they need to hear?

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,680
What a good examples for explaining that idea?

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,370
So all these ways of coming up with good content.

15
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,600
We start our study of public speaking with just that very thing.

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,220
How do we come up with ideas well suited to public speaking?

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,700
Once we've got those ideas, we need to think in terms of, how do we arrange

18
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,430
these in a way that's going to be easy for an audience to follow along with?

19
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,050
So on any given topic, how much background information do you need to

20
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,990
give for this particular audience?

21
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,210
How should you arrange the points?

22
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,220
What's the, sort of the narrative flow?

23
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,600
Or what's the organizational pattern that should drive those key ideas?

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,070
How long should the introduction be?

25
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,450
All of these are questions about how that audience is going to experience

26
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,300
the time of your speech.

27
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,180
And in many ways, arranging a speech is much more difficult than

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,470
arranging an essay.

29
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,650
Because in an essay, the audience controls that communique, right?

30
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,850
If they forgot something or if they lost their place, they can go back.

31
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,000
You know, they can flip the page back.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,140
But they don't have that as a listener to a speaker.

33
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,970
The audience member must listen to the speaker's flow of information in

34
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,830
chronological time.

35
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,440
So you have to make decisions about how an audience member can easily

36
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,170
follow along with that information.

37
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,950
So invention, arrangement, style.

38
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,800
Here we're putting words to the ideas.

39
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,190
So obviously, some speeches are stylistically rich.

40
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,750
So Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address would be a

41
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,160
good example of this.

42
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,210
And some speeches are more stylistically plain.

43
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,120
So let's say a business presentation.

44
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,660
Yet both of those have a style.

45
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,370
And, in fact, the decisions about style need to be worked in tandem with

46
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,290
who that audience is and what that topic is.

47
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:26,000
So you need to think strategically about the style you're using based on

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,530
what's going to be useful for that audience.

49
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:28,720
Right?

50
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,160
If it's too complex.

51
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,670
Without a doubt, everybody here listening to this has probably been in

52
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,910
a presentation where the speaker had so much jargon, it was impossible to

53
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,880
follow along with.

54
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,280
That's a stylistic choice, and often it's a bad stylistic choice to put in

55
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,650
too much of jargon in a presentation.

56
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,780
So invention, arrangement, style, memory.

57
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,150
So here we're talking about memory as sort of remembering your planning,

58
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,010
remembering your orientation.

59
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,200
So for ancient rhetoricians, memory was tremendously important.

60
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,240
Because in the Greek and Roman traditions, they would give these

61
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,840
really long speeches often in a very high ornate style.

62
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,560
But it remains important to study memory, because a speech is

63
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,440
spoken and not read.

64
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,900
And if you don't practice your speech, you won't be familiar with it.

65
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,910
And if you aren't familiar with your speech, you're probably going to read

66
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,150
it to that audience.

67
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,570
And this is a class in public speaking, not in public reading.

68
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,520
And so you really shouldn't try to memorize your speeches word for word.

69
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,110
In most cases that's only going to exacerbate any fear you have about

70
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,240
public speaking.

71
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,710
But you should know the main parts of your presentation.

72
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,160
And this often comes down to a matter of knowledge and practice.

73
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,440
So you need to know that material well enough so that you can talk about the

74
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,690
topic intelligently.

75
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,770
That's sort of an invention category.

76
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:49,390
But you also need to practice through the speech enough so that you know how

77
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,870
to explain this topic to this particular audience.

78
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,200
That sort of arrangement and style.

79
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,950
But all of that comes together by understanding practice.

80
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,250
By remembering what is the orientation of your speech?

81
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,130
So you don't have to read it off of a card to us.

82
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,100
And then finally, invention, arrangements, style, memory, and

83
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,620
delivering.

84
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,610
The final part of the study of public speaking is the one that people fear

85
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,810
the most, right?

86
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,410
And that's standing up in front of an audience and actually

87
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,260
delivering the speech.

88
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,380
But one of the things to know here is, if you kind of have all those other

89
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,470
cannons down, the delivery part probably won't give

90
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,070
you that many headaches.

91
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,920
You've got excellent ideas, arranged clearly, spoken in an exciting and

92
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,060
accessible style, and you know the content deeply.

93
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,340
Well delivery's going to be less of a concern.

94
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,740
But delivery doesn't solve problems at the other stages, right?

95
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,500
If you've got unclear ideas, poorly arranged in a confusing style, but

96
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,030
good heavens, such delivery.

97
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,430
It's probably still bad speech, right?

98
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,650
So we're going to take these cannons of rhetoric, these

99
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,310
principles of rhetoric.

100
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,500
And by the way, when I say canons of rhetoric, that means cannons as in

101
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,900
principles, not cannon like boom, boom, boom.

102
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,400
So we'll take these cannons of rhetoric as guides for composing

103
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,020
speeches that are good.

104
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,180
Creating speeches that are good, and because they're good, they can be

105
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,880
delivered well.

106
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,900
These very much work together.

107
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,700
More to the point, these cannons of rhetoric help organize our time.

108
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,210
So you'll notice in each speech assignment, we

109
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,660
followed the basic pattern.

110
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,640
We'll start off with an overview of the assignment, and then we'll talk

111
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,780
about invention.

112
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,680
We do this in the informative speech, for example.

113
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,880
Here's what the informative speech is, here's some invention guides for

114
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,870
informative speaking.

115
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,000
How to figure out what you're going to organize the talk around.

116
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,420
The evidence, the examples, the ideas in that talk.

117
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,110
Then we'll move on and talk about arrangement for that

118
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,910
particular type of speech.

119
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,200
Then we'll look at style.

120
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,830
What are some models for style for that type of informative speaking.

121
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,700
How can you practice these informative speeches and find models of imitation

122
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,940
for these informative speeches that are going to be good?

123
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,580
And then, of course, for each speech assignment, we'll end by talking about

124
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,960
the delivery concerns for that particular speech.

125
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,640
So not only are we sort of moving from simple to advanced in terms of

126
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,140
impromptu, informative, and persuasive speeches.

127
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,580
But within each one, we're doing invention, arrangements, style,

128
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,095
memory, and delivery, invention, arrangement, style, memory, and

129
00:06:21,095 --> 00:06:22,900
delivery, and so on.

130
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,820
So I come to public speaking from the rhetorical tradition.

131
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,370
Although you could approach speech from a number of different traditions

132
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:34,330
without a doubt, but this one has been refined over millennia.

133
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,860
And it allows us to think closely about the various components that go

134
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,040
into an excellent speech.

135
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,570
So I sort of ended our discussion of rhetoric.

136
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,170
And in the next lecture, we're going to turn our discussion to the

137
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,710
fundamental differences between speaking and writing.

138
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:55,670
The short summary here of the next two to three lectures is why most speeches

139
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,540
are better without a manuscript.

140
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,200
So we're going to take that up in the next lecture.

141
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,500
