the parents after

1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,240
they requested

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,370
her to do so and i might add free of charge in your richard is anyone to do

3
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:12,348
that

4
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:15,159
on this and he said the on the world trade center case though that it was

5
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:18,599
before those people have been named we did a google search did that that the

6
00:00:18,599 --> 00:00:20,690
guy's name is all over

7
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,679
nexus all over and the newspapers multiples times

8
00:00:24,678 --> 00:00:28,788
i don't know about the exact date of that but i do know when soviet put forth

9
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:32,160
a prediction when it was publicized might be a different matter

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,648
but which she put forth a prediction that name was not now well in the f_b_i_

11
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:39,740
uh... the video which you sent us which is her f_b_i_a_

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,399
testimony

13
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,049
according to you guys that was at least some two weeks after this guy in oregon

14
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:47,899
reston after his name was aria

15
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:50,229
and the shunned really the case they were already searching

16
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:52,589
in the park is not correct

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,569
on they were searching in the park during the time but not

18
00:00:56,569 --> 00:00:57,280
alan

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,090
not during a time when she talked to the family income where they were

20
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,930
only when they did the interview and sharon james do you feel she is so

21
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:06,790
successful and i talked with c_s_ sherin james

22
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,440
myself personally she testified to the fact that during the time when she got

23
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,049
the notice that she received from

24
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:15,579
uh... tennessee

25
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:19,539
that she felt that that was a delegation from the standpoint that he was in las

26
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:24,520
vegas and had never in fact in tennessee and she felt he must have had some type

27
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:27,039
of insurance connection in tennessee

28
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,070
the point being

29
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:33,919
he was found allied in well granted it was after the time it'll be a thought

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,840
that you would

31
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,709
but nonetheless that he was found alive and well so they were centers and wait a

32
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:41,880
minute i would like to adhere first and foremost

33
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:45,938
that sylvia's this a_c_ teachers spiritual teacher and humanitarian

34
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:49,599
the actual first and foremost on our web sites a psychic

35
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,069
first and foremost uses spiritual teacher appear that sex is siding on my

36
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:54,239
part of that

37
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,618
this this psychic part of it is a part of that i could not initiate work in

38
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,289
this world so ensure accurate on her website when you go go over

39
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,179
and i just went to a website is so they're brown psychic and spiritual

40
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:06,090
teacher

41
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,280
exactly for so far though she's a psych

42
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,909
well first she has

43
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:15,389
did you can't separate the psychic part from her spirituality but destination

44
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:17,828
money from being a psychic

45
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:23,058
she supports a religious organization and her corporation for being a psychic

46
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:28,149
yes that's a fact alone which is returned back to her spirit organization

47
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:32,149
ever corporation sylvie gets no money all firmer psychic readings personally i

48
00:02:32,149 --> 00:02:35,989
want to bring james randi james you've actually call soderberg fill-in we spoke

49
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,028
to said to understand who's a retired senior special agents charge the f_b_i_

50
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:40,879
los angeles he's worked with sylvia

51
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,109
he says says he's worked with her quite a bit and he says this about a racist

52
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,569
code i work with numerous psychics in the past

53
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:49,498
and very few are really on target the sylvia brown is probably one of the most

54
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:50,599
accurate psychics

55
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:53,430
in the country and that's from a former senior f_b_i_ official are you saying

56
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,248
he's wrong

57
00:02:55,248 --> 00:02:58,489
i think that brad she doesn't know enough about his subject i'm not talking

58
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:00,230
about law enforcement now

59
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:02,018
not talking about detect your work

60
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:05,689
but he has to judge these things much more carefully i would think addison

61
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:09,039
he has to not at the total

62
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,128
redeemed everything that she says about anyone fact

63
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:13,549
and evaluate that

64
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,980
what you've done here and what has been done here i should say

65
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:18,278
is that

66
00:03:18,278 --> 00:03:21,199
cases that were successful are apparently successful

67
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,829
have been selected another very much like the the racetrack a

68
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,618
devoted who go live now to see if i could finishes foreigners

69
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:32,209
decision for executive

70
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:36,899
the point is that the fellow at the racetrack keeps on very proud to tell

71
00:03:36,899 --> 00:03:41,239
you about the number of horses idid bet on that have come right up front and

72
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,729
that made money in such but he's in tatters because he doesn't win in the

73
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:50,029
long run politically let ladies out forget about the way you want to get

74
00:03:50,028 --> 00:03:53,109
your point windowsill be maintains a she's not a hundred percent accurate as

75
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:57,199
she never claims to be add a little girl when she told trong hoang bricks frantic

76
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,959
parrots and he was dead and where to find his body she sounded pretty certain

77
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:01,689
she didn't say

78
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:05,460
i think he's dead but i could be wrong she said he's no longer with us and

79
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,909
here's where his body is because ait we still don't have the bottom of this case

80
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:12,788
we don't know if you don't you think you may be dead

81
00:04:12,788 --> 00:04:17,128
no night john hardback but we need to be you know if she could have seen another

82
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:17,999
person that was

83
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:21,759
that was all i wanted to say i can maybe it's another person she said he's dead

84
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,259
and here's where i a m your stand that this is what she said that

85
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,110
she is also claimed she is not a hundred percent

86
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,040
she is a vessel by which her the energy conservator information concerning she's

87
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,689
just merely a vessel from god

88
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:36,579
you can't separate the two

89
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:37,909
and four

90
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:44,910
randy as a professed eight eunice to judge anyone on spirituality is jsuazoc

91
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:49,519
okie has now negated now when he is all mickey everything she does is through

92
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,258
guide with guide she gives got credit for everyday grannies are professed

93
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:57,408
eight years who claims that anyone who believes any religion

94
00:04:57,408 --> 00:05:02,748
is weak minded and superstitious he's begin christianity he's making why is a

95
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:06,270
great at behave better that's like a high school debating tactic to attack

96
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:10,098
the guy has asked the question i think i think it's an example right but wait a

97
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:10,909
minute

98
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,770
anderson you cannot separate the psychic ability from the spirituality waiting

99
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:18,659
but without looking at a later could buy up to me asking questions of my god list

100
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,120
too

101
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,569
all of course not okay but so you know black and white why are you doing is

102
00:05:23,569 --> 00:05:27,370
you're doing a fair-minded reporting what he's doing is he's judging

103
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,500
and as a magician

104
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,410
he doesn't have the credentials to judge anyone up here and i think ability

105
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,760
amazed i ought to take a short break and i wanted to discussion

106
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,759
again appreciable to be on the program director

107
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:47,759
or computer discussion sylvia brown joining us on the browns business

108
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,649
manager linda ross seems like it a bunker james randi ugly no i want to ask

109
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:56,129
you something 'cause earlier sean hundreds parents had stated that bound

110
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:58,970
on the montel williams show after they were told a sean was dead

111
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,570
they want to speak to sylvia more outside of the primers and show we're

112
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:05,930
told that they'd have to pay her rate of seven hundred dollars for half hour is a

113
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,639
trend high rule

114
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:10,299
a stand with my life

115
00:06:10,298 --> 00:06:10,899
agnes

116
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:14,598
that that is not true now somebody might have told her that that was a connected

117
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:19,319
with our office that i can attest to but silly has never ever

118
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:19,830
charged

119
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:23,748
any individual who is coming with a missing person case or law enforcement

120
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:24,769
of tea

121
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:28,749
that i want to be clear they didn't say based more unclear who told them that so

122
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:31,250
exactly strengthens our mail

123
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,170
it could've been somebody from the show who didn't know anything but

124
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,910
our staff thus the shortest turned that any member of our staff is being with

125
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:39,539
some of the year

126
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:42,689
it's been twenty years i myself have been there thirty five

127
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:47,379
i had never ever and i seen people from all walks of life religious whatever but

128
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:50,139
she does a senate also for a half-hour it

129
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:53,269
she does make seven hundred out she doesn't make seven hundred dollars

130
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:56,098
the seven hundred dollars that you charge is

131
00:06:56,098 --> 00:06:56,908
unsolicited

132
00:06:56,908 --> 00:07:01,069
she never asks for anyone to do that dealing with

133
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:05,580
at the same with our religious police or every if the people come to us

134
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:09,408
seeking our help took what i really want to question james rainy before we go

135
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:11,588
into him

136
00:07:11,588 --> 00:07:15,949
for now anything bordering on a malicious persecution sylvia why doesn't

137
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:17,429
he go after

138
00:07:17,428 --> 00:07:21,658
and charlotte has a true sharply at times there but i wouldn't let out so we

139
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:24,430
could what's so bad about soderberg

140
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,788
there's nothing you

141
00:07:25,788 --> 00:07:29,180
intrinsically bad about sylvia brown that is a bad about all of the people

142
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,379
who pretended

143
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:34,089
to the greeting people out there who need them or believe they need them

144
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:35,858
that they can speak to the dead

145
00:07:35,858 --> 00:07:41,168
no i don't know if you're still going to be clear great figure windshield buying

146
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:45,408
hide the laughter sylvia brown because she is a major figure in the field and

147
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:49,759
she gets a lot of publicity a lot of exposures on shoals all over the world

148
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,879
she is one of the major figures that i go after yesterday's your chance of a

149
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,329
proud to take a test of her psychic ability

150
00:07:56,329 --> 00:07:59,478
what do you know exactly that test be very quickly

151
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:03,709
very quickly well she would dil readings for ten people

152
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:05,988
ten people live with the chosen

153
00:08:05,988 --> 00:08:09,138
because they believe sylvia brown and that they believe she has powers and

154
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:12,728
they believe in psychic powers of that chart she would do send readings we

155
00:08:12,728 --> 00:08:16,558
would them shuffle those ten readings and give them all up to the people who

156
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:20,099
had the readings done for them an awsome to sort them out which one is your

157
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:23,838
reading it should be pretty evidence that you could take the reading it was

158
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:28,279
made for you window you could without ever take that test

159
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:32,250
absolutely not because she has nothing to lucky all right we have to do it

160
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:37,849
wait a minute recently hill shutting them shouting which has become ok first

161
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:40,770
of all she has nothing to prove to randy

162
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:45,549
do you want somebody who's an a_p_ is is already coming up but i felt a lot of

163
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:49,500
indians thing all right below your desolate habitat

164
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,669
line or give cochran cable news that we just don't like on the show settling

165
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:55,309
that you're saying so they would not take the test but now because she has

166
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:57,759
nothing to prove to james randi

167
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,129
occasion epping to prove to james randi per square inch of work

168
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:05,889
speaks for itself lolololol only return false hopes that the audience years

169
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:08,970
