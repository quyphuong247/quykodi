00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,980
MATT MCGARRITY: What I want to do now is I want to shift a little bit.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,480
So we've been talking about what public speaking is and

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,500
how to avoid it.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,100
I want to show you a clip, a regrettable clip, of someone who

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,200
didn't avoid it.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,560
I've got this clip that I've shown for a number of years, and we've got a

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,800
release to show it thanks to the city of Bloomington.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,060
Before I came to the University of Washington, I was a graduate student

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,420
at the Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana.

10
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:32,470
And at the time that I was there, they were considering passing a ban on

11
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,880
smoking in public places, and this was a city wide ban.

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,200
And so there were arguments for and against, this will protect public

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,510
health, this is an unfair governmental overreach, whatever.

14
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,850
So the city council was holding a meeting, and this is--

15
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:51,560
at city council meetings, citizens can get up and deliver speeches.

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,790
And so I just happened to be videotaping a cable access television

17
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,060
of city council meetings.

18
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,800
I assume everyone does that.

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,620
And so I was videotaping this, and I got this clip and I've used it for

20
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:11,670
years, because it illustrates just so much about what happens when public

21
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,090
speaking apprehension occurs.

22
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,010
So what I want you to do is I want you to watch this clip for two things.

23
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:22,960
I want you to watch this clip first for what is he doing that you think is

24
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,980
making him nervous, that's making him more apprehensive?

25
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,480
And then second, what is he doing that shows that apprehensiveness?

26
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,490
How is he performing it, so that anyone sitting there or watching the

27
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,160
video knows, oh, this guy's losing it.

28
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,170
So I want you to watch for these two things, what's he doing that may be

29
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,870
making him more nervous, and how's he performing that nervousness so that

30
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,120
you knew that it's occurring?

31
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,910


32
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,250
SPEAKER 2: There are over 4,000 chemicals in cigarette smoke.

33
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,650
We know that.

34
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,310
Any science professional can tell you that smoke itself does not cause

35
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,030
cancer, smoke's a combination of a bunch of different chemicals.

36
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,380
Cancers caused by the body's reaction, negative reaction, to a particular

37
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,680
chemical or chemicals.

38
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,920
All of the suspect chemicals that are in environmental tobacco smoke are

39
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,400
regulated by OSHA.

40
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,730
They all have maximums set for public workplaces.

41
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:26,330


42
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:32,900
To refer to something as being scientific, for it to be reliable, you

43
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,470
have to have three things.

44
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,830
One of them has to be measure only what is intended to measure, the

45
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,500
variables examined are the only differences between the measured

46
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,660
phenomenon, and what is taken at zero risk.

47
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,520
And the results must be reproducible in a laboratory.

48
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:57,540


49
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,110
All of this excitement, the reason everybody's turned out so much for

50
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:06,700
this, is because it's all open to interpretation.

51
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,285
No one has any facts.

52
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:15,380
All you have is the studies done, which were questionnaires, basically.

53
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,620
They were questionnaires, or if you felt very strongly about this, or kind

54
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,430
of strongly--

55
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:26,090
that's where they got the information in the epidemiological studies that

56
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,560
they used, the EPA used, everyone else used.

57
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,305
There are lots of pollutants generated.

58
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:42,060
Automobiles, power generating plants, things like that.

59
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:49,270
One of the major generators of pollution, or was at one point, was

60
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,790
hospital incinerators.

61
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:58,330
One of the number one producers of dioxin, which is linked directly to

62
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,760
breast cancer.

63
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,370
It's been proven that ETS doesn't cause breast cancer.

64
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,692
If you--

65
00:04:05,692 --> 00:04:07,380
excuse me, I can't get my breath.

66
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,940


67
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,740
SPEAKER 3: Just relax.

68
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,990
You have a minute.

69
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:16,680


70
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,269
SPEAKER 2: I'm not a public speaker.

71
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,160
I'd like to let somebody else do it.

72
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,060
Anyway, all references that I've seen, I've probably done 300 hours of

73
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,850
research since this all started.

74
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,840
I went to the website, the hospital gave.

75
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,380
It's an anti-tobacco lobby called Americans for Nonsmokers Rights.

76
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,010
It was founded by a gentleman named Stanton Glantz.

77
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:49,620
Stanton Glantz is the one who started the number of 53,000 back in 1991.

78
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,110
If you look at any of these other articles, he refers to it a lot.

79
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,520
He never references it with any kind of study or anything, he

80
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,900
just uses the number.

81
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,940
You can see it, and see I have an article from 10 years later, luckily,

82
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,130
it's still the same number.

83
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:09,160
I guess ETS hasn't killed anybody.

84
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,020
It kills the same number every year.

85
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:18,400
Every single article, it's 53,000.

86
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,470
Most of you have gotten studies from the Oakridge National Laboratory.

87
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,000
SPEAKER 3: Mike, you're out of time.

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,610
SPEAKER 2: I am?

89
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,590
SPEAKER 3: You've used three minutes plus.

90
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,600
SPEAKER 2: Thank you for your time.

91
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,370
MATT MCGARRITY: Wow, that hurts to watch.

92
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,760
I have watched that clip hundreds of times, and every time I do I'm like,

93
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,580
come on, dude, this time you can do it.

94
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,960
This time you're going to be awesome and excellent.

95
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,570
And it hurts to watch.

96
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:47,410
And what hurts more is he's doing so much stuff that is actually causing

97
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,360
his apprehension.

98
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,320
And what kills me is, a lot of that stuff is avoidable.

99
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,860
So you see he walks up there with a stack full of notes.

100
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,610
He has not prepared that as a speech, as a presentation.

101
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,130
That's a city council meeting, normal citizen commentary at a city council

102
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,780
meeting is three minutes.

103
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,710
That's an impromptu speech.

104
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:15,600
Just as a quick test here, this was at a city council meeting arguing for a

105
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,500
ban on smoking in public places.

106
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,390
Was he for or against the ban?

107
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:25,120
He was against it, but you wouldn't necessarily know that to look

108
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,550
at that clip, OK?

109
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,760
Because it is so muddled that it's hard to suss out

110
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,840
exactly what he's saying.

111
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,030
The claims are not clear.

112
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,850
And, in fact, he spends so much time talking about evidence.

113
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,940
ETS, he never defines this term.

114
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,710
ETS is environmental tobacco smoke.

115
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:46,710
In essence what his argument is is the research indicating environmental

116
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,440
tobacco smoke is dangerous is flawed.

117
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,740
That's his argument, but you can't get at it through what he says.

118
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,290
But he's doing so much that's only making his

119
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,740
apprehension that much worse.

120
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,060
I asked you to look for two things.

121
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,650
What's he doing that's making it worse, and how's he telegraphing that

122
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,010
knowledge to you?

123
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:06,960
What's he doing?

124
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,380
Well, he's not thinking about the speech as a speech.

125
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,710
He's getting up there and he says he spends all these hours of research,

126
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,580
but he didn't think about how to craft this as something that could be

127
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,640
followed along with as a listener.

128
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,850
So that's avoidable.

129
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,160
You can get around some of these apprehensive issues by

130
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,780
planning a good speech.

131
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,690
We talked about skills training, that would be one way to reduce

132
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,220
apprehensiveness there.

133
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,520
But I want to continue on in the next lecture and talk about the thing that

134
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,860
stands out most to me in that clip, which is his breathing.

135
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,390
You may notice at the end he steps away and he says, I

136
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,580
can't get my breath.

137
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,620
We're going to take that up in the next lecture.

138
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,260
This was about apprehension.

139
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,130
Apprehension is totally normal.

140
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:52,370
Everyone is going to experience some type of public speaking apprehension.

141
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,320
Either because you have a propensity towards it, or certain situations are

142
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,410
more or less apprehensive than others, create more apprehension than others.

143
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:06,980
There are some distinct and useful prevention techniques, techniques that

144
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,240
I wish that speaker would have known of so that he didn't have to go

145
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,370
through that.

146
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:17,130
One, is being more familiar with a variety of speaking situations,

147
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,490
becoming desensitized to any one speaking situation as being

148
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,670
apprehensive.

149
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:27,320
Two, changing your approach to public speaking, not making it about an

150
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,660
overly formal presentation.

151
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,780
In that video that we just watched, after he has his mild heart attack, he

152
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:39,179
steps back and he regathers his thoughts and he starts just talking to

153
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,419
the city council.

154
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:44,350
That second part of the speech is infinitely better than the first,

155
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,470
because then it's much more on the communication orientation than the

156
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,740
performance side.

157
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,980
But we can change how we think about public speaking, and in doing so,

158
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,310
reduce some of our level of apprehension.

159
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:00,170
But of course, and what this course is about, is skills training,

160
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:05,340
understanding how to put together a speech and perform a speech, so that

161
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,850
you're just good at it.

162
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,450
And if you're good at it, you're probably going to feel less

163
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,860
apprehensive in any one situation.

164
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,280
So in the next lecture, we're going to talk about the breathing and

165
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,900
projection problems that he had.

166
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:21,130
But we can end now by saying that was painful apprehension.

167
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,710
Speech apprehension is real, and it hurts.

168
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,290
It hurts to watch and it hurts to experience.

169
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:31,150
But, and this is what gives me hope at least, it is avoidable.

170
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,160
It is manageable.

171
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,610
And that's what we need to be working on.

172
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,300
