MATT MCGARRITY: This week is going to be about moving from your informative

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,590
idea to the outline itself.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,870
So the entire week is really structured around this process of

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,430
moving from what you think you want to talk about in that informative speech,

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,540
up to having some type of rough outline.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,450
And so my goal is by the end of this week, you'll have something that you

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,570
can be working with and practicing with.

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,960
And as we're doing this week, this a very important week.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,710
And we're really focusing in on invention and arrangement for your

10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:28,870
informative speech.

11
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:33,400
And I just kind of wanted to give you a sense for what the difference here

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,460
is between the impromptu and the informative speech.

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,340
So in your impromptu speech, you were dealing with a

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,300
couple of moving pieces.

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,660
You had your thesis statement, you had your two claims, and you had some

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,430
support under each one of those claims.

17
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,250
Well certainly, the informative speech is more complex than

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,660
those impromptu speeches.

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,780
And especially when you are dealing with providing new information to an

20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,650
audience that doesn't know what you're talking about.

21
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,540
You're going to be working in the realm of complex details.

22
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,510
And so I think it's useful to think about having sort of

23
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,260
three levels of meaning.

24
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,230
Now in the impromptu you probably had two levels of meaning.

25
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,200
You had your claim and your evidence.

26
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,950
But in this informative speech, I think it's useful to be thinking about

27
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,200
three levels of meaning.

28
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,570
So what are these levels of meaning?

29
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,760
Well, these are ways that we are going to organize our speech.

30
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,520
So just very briefly, I kind of want to talk to what these levels are, how

31
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,270
these levels are going to structure our time this week, and how this

32
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,540
relates to the evaluation rubric, that feedback form.

33
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,330
So to begin with, when I'm talking about levels of meaning, you could

34
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,160
come at this through various different ways.

35
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,450
If you were outlining it in a very traditional outline format, you could

36
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,950
talk about this as, you know, main claim, sub claim, and evidence.

37
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,380
Or you could talk about it in terms of main point, sub point, and details.

38
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,110
If you're teaching, sometimes we use a language of chunking.

39
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,510
So you could talk about as your big chunk, the bits and pieces within that

40
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,450
chunk, and then the specific details that you're driving with.

41
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,550
So at the end of last week, when we were working on speech goals, I talked

42
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,130
about a speech that I might do on kairos, this

43
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,880
rhetorical concept of kairos.

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,510
So here's what this outline might look like.

45
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:10,080
And as you're looking at it, what you can see is there are main points,

46
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,180
there are sub points, and then there are details underneath those points.

47
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,830
So these are these three different levels of meaning.

48
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,430
And it's a way of thinking through the inter-relationship between when you're

49
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,460
in the deepest bit of detail, and when you're telescoping back out to sort of

50
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,860
the broader points.

51
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,230
So this is going to structure at least this week.

52
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,040
Because in the next lecture, what we're going to be working on is really

53
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,330
nailing down what those main points are.

54
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,700
Those big chunks.

55
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,590
Those ideas that you know you have to cover in order to be

56
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,140
clear for your audience.

57
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,910
Then we're going to start thinking about, well, if those are the big

58
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,540
chunks, what are the, how are we arranging the speech so that those

59
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,420
chunks make sense, those main points make sense.

60
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,170
And that's bringing us into the level of the sub point, or the sub claim.

61
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,590
This will probably cause us to revise a little bit what

62
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,740
those main points are.

63
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,390
Remember last week we talked about that cyclical model of speech

64
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,060
composition.

65
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,310
Well, we're in the thick of that now.

66
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,660
We're in the process of putting something down on paper, practicing

67
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,710
it, and revising it.

68
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,290
So we'll start off by sort of trying to figure out what

69
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,350
these main points are.

70
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,510
And then we're going to start thinking more to arrangements terms of what

71
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,670
these some points are.

72
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,150
And then finally, at the end of the week, what we're going to do is get

73
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,440
into the details.

74
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,630
Those bits and pieces.

75
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,720
That evidence, those examples that you're using to really highlight and

76
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,950
clarify what you want to say in that informative speech.

77
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,330
And then the last thing we will do, is we'll telescope back out and say how

78
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,930
do you talk through these various levels of meaning in a way that add to

79
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,230
their strengths, add to their clarity, and sound good.

80
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,690
So that's kind of what these levels of meaning are and how we're going to be

81
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,690
spending our time.

82
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,580
So what does this do for us in terms of the rubric?

83
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,690
And I come back to this again because I think moving through that rubric is

84
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,360
very useful.

85
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,090
Because it allows us to kind of focus in on specific skills.

86
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,560
And when it comes time to provide peer evaluation, you are

87
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,890
getting quality feedback.

88
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,580
And I do strongly believe that good speakers are

89
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,000
often good speech critics.

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,760
And so you're just expanding your sense of judgment.

91
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,660
So how did these levels of meaning map on top of that?

92
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,899
How does what we're doing this week map on top of the rubric that we've

93
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,290
covered thus far?

94
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,050
Well when we're talking about including appropriate and varied

95
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:24,020
evidence, we're going to be spending time talking about just that.

96
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,790
Use evidence to explain the topic clearly and effectively, we're going

97
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,150
to be doing that.

98
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,130
Certainly when we're talking about balancing breadth and depth, that's

99
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,290
what I'm getting at here.

100
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,050
Is having main points that make sense, but then also getting into the

101
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,730
nitty-gritty details of that speech and giving us a real solid sense of

102
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,350
what's going on.

103
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:48,970
But being able to do both, give us context as well as content.

104
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,040
The other issues on that rubric are addressing points that are appropriate

105
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,630
for the topic and the audience.

106
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,850
This is the realm of invention.

107
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,040
Certainly, that's one of the things we're going to be concerned with in

108
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,130
the next lecture.

109
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,350
Arrange the speech in a logical manner.

110
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,980
Two lectures from now, that's exactly what we're going to be doing.

111
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:08,640
So once again, that feedback form, that rubric are not just random terms.

112
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,810
Those are, in many ways, the learning objectives for the assignment.

113
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,650
And so you can look to that rubric as a way of understanding what we're

114
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,740
doing in informative speaking, as well as using it as a guide for helping you

115
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,540
improve your own speech.

116
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,260
So once again, once we leave this video lecture, we're going to start by

117
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,950
figuring out what your major ideas are in this informative speech.

118
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,890
Then we're going to shift in to how you can discuss them well through

119
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:37,280
smaller bits and pieces, that level of the sub claim.

120
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,300
And then we're going to get in to demonstrating those

121
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,600
ideas through detail.

122
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,390
Now throughout this week, we're going to stick to an outline structure.

123
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,800
And I think that's very useful in informative speaking, and especially

124
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,160
for informative speaking in extemporaneous situations.

125
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:57,310
But remember always, the goal is to prepare a good speech, not to prepare

126
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,960
a good outline.

127
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,250
And I mean by that, that outline's a visual artifact.

128
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,450
I think there's a lot of benefit to it because it can help us highlight the

129
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,140
differences between big ideas and small ideas.

130
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,320
But it's visual.

131
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,470
It's apprehended by the eye, not by the ear.

132
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,060
The goal is to use that outline to be able to put something together that

133
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,230
sounds good when you stand up to speak.

134
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,650
So I just wanted to start off this week with a sense of what we're going

135
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,340
to be doing.

136
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:28,260
Because all the pieces, all the video lecture really gel towards the end.

137
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,460
But we're moving from main ideas, to sub points, in to details.

138
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,320
We're moving to these three levels of meaning throughout this week.

139
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,570
