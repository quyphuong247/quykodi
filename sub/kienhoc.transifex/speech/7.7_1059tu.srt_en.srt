00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,090
MATT MCGARRITY: So we talked about ill and blame, problem and cause.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,760
Now we turn to cure and consequences.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,780
So in cure, we're thinking in terms of, what is your solution?

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,140
What are you recommending?

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,390
What is the plan that you support?

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,590
Then under that, we want to think in terms of solvency and workability.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,650
Solvency.

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:26,230
Does your solution actually solve for the ill and/or the cause?

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:31,030
So is this something that's on point?

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,230
So let's say I was talking about traffic.

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,370
Oh, you know, here in Seattle the traffic is terrible.

12
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,940
And it's significant.

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,650
Here's how many people it slows down.

14
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,300
Here's harmful.

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,460
Here's what it does.

16
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,370
It hurts business in so many ways.

17
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,540
Why is this happening?

18
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,310
We don't have enough east-west corridors in the city proper.

19
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,170
Cure.

20
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,230
Here's my cure.

21
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,800
Everyone should have jet packs.

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,540
Ah, yes.

23
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,540
That would eliminate traffic problems altogether.

24
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,150
We would all have jet packs and we would fly to our destination.

25
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,410
Is that solvent?

26
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,519
Well, it's not really getting to the root cause.

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,170
And it's certainly not workable.

28
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:07,860
Awesome?

29
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,730
Yes.

30
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,620
Without a doubt.

31
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,260
I would totally vote for any policy that supported jet packs.

32
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,800
But it's not really getting to the root cause.

33
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,240
If we don't have enough east and west corridors, it seems like the

34
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,900
implication is the cure would be we need more or better or different

35
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,830
east-west corridors, if that's what's driving the problem.

36
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:32,940
So that cause and that solution should speak to one another.

37
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,870
And in so doing, we say your policy is solvent.

38
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,510
It's solving for the problem.

39
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,770
Beyond that, the question we want to ask of the cure is, is it workable?

40
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,830
Can we actually do it?

41
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,490
If it was to build more east-west corridors, is there space?

42
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,550
Is it zoned for that?

43
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,050
It's great to have an idea, but you've thought through implementation.

44
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:57,290
Is this a solution that actually can be implemented well?

45
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,880
So under cure, I want to know what the plan is.

46
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,850
And how is it solvent?

47
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,120
And how is it workable?

48
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,350
And then that takes us to the last one, consequences.

49
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,730
So under consequences, we can think in terms of social and material

50
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,980
consequences.

51
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,660


52
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,400
Is it going to have--

53
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,030
if we implement your plan and it solvent and it's workable, is it going

54
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,280
to do stuff materially, in the physical realm?

55
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,630
So is this plan going to cost a lot of money or is it going to

56
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,450
generate some money?

57
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,490
Is it going to have social consequences?

58
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:39,080
Is it going to change attitudes for the better or for the worse?

59
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,870
So here--

60
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,270
and this one just because we're in the realm of policy I tend to use more

61
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,800
Washington State examples.

62
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,080
So here in Washington we not too long ago privatized liquor sales.

63
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,540
So up until recently, any time you wanted to buy a bottle of liquor you

64
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,750
had to go to a state liquor store.

65
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,590
So there wasn't private organizations selling liquor.

66
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,200
You had to go to a State liquor store.

67
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,370
So all the arguments about whether or not we should do this-- it was a

68
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,400
popular initiative.

69
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,530
And so one of the points of clash, one of the points of contrast was over the

70
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,530
material and social consequences of privatizing liquor sales.

71
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,620
So those who were opposed to privatizing liquor sales said there

72
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,030
will be negative material and social consequences if this bill is passed.

73
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,580
Material consequences.

74
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,660
It is really going to hurt State finances.

75
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,550
The State made a fair bit of money off of selling liquor.

76
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,680
So they said, this is really going to hurt State finances.

77
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,260
Moreover, there will be a social consequence.

78
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,660
We'll see more liquor stores opening up, maybe less qualified people

79
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,960
checking IDs, perhaps an increase in underage drinking.

80
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:54,260
And so there's negative social interaction that's happening around

81
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,750
this increased accessibility to liquor.

82
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,730
So that's what those who are against it were arguing.

83
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:03,070
Those who are for the bill also argued that their were positive material and

84
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,480
social consequences.

85
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,440
They said, well, materially, yeah, the State won't have money.

86
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,220
But private industry will.

87
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,080
More mom and pops will be able to sell liquor and generate revenue for

88
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,130
themselves rather than having the State do it.

89
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,350
They said, well, that's not really the State's domain.

90
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,829
They shouldn't be in charge of liquor sales.

91
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,390
This should be private industry.

92
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,760
So they were arguing for a positive material consequence.

93
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,980
So too with positive social consequences.

94
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,970
Well, we're getting the State out of something that it shouldn't be in.

95
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,470
This is a matter of private commerce.

96
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,190
And in the realm of private commerce, we shouldn't have the State

97
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,350
interfering.

98
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,240
So both sides had approached consequences.

99
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,210
Implementation.

100
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,800
What happens the day after the bill is passed?

101
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,940
So as you're moving through these stock issues, ill, blame, cure,

102
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,100
consequence, they're going to help you figure out what you want to argue and

103
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,830
what you need to argue.

104
00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:00,150
Arguing for a change means you probably need to prove most or all of

105
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,820
your stock issues.

106
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,730
If you're arguing for a change, you need to be able to

107
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,350
show there's a problem.

108
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,810
I know what's causing it.

109
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,510
I've got a solution that solves for that problem.

110
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:15,550
And the positive consequences outweigh the negative ones.

111
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:22,010
If you're arguing against change, you could argue against all

112
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,060
of those stock issues.

113
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,610
Or you could really just put all your eggs in one of the baskets.

114
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,650
So if someone's saying there's a huge problem and here's what's causing it

115
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,120
and here's how to solve it, the other side could say,

116
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,180
it's not a huge problem.

117
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,750
It's not a huge problem at all.

118
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,480
Why would we waste money on something that's not a huge problem.

119
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,880
We'll get to this later.

120
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,370
But here we're talking about stasis, clash points.

121
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:51,210
Is there a debate over the very nature of the problem or over what's causing

122
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,790
the problem or whether or not the policy solves for the problem or

123
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,230
whether or not the policy in solving for the problem has too many negative

124
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,500
consequences?

125
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,460
But in both, no matter how you're coming into your issue, these stock

126
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,670
issues can help you think through the case more deliberately, more

127
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,920
carefully, more accurately.

128
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,840
So in the next lecture, we'll actually do this.

129
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,600
We'll work through a specific case of stock issues and talk about how burden

130
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,700
of proof is operationalized there.

131
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,950
