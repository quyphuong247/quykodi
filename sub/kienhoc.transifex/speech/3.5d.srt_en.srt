MATT MCGARRITY: So now that we've talked about pacing and pausing, I

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:07,010
want to in this unit by talking about gestures and movement.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:11,430
Once again to think back to that grading rubric that we talked about at

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,940
the beginning of the assignment, you'll notice we've talked about each

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:14,740
one of those elements.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,750
And the last element on there is the speaker used gestures and movement

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,900
effectively and appropriately.

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,770
So I want to end by talking about these issues.

9
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,110
When we think about gestures and movement, ultimately it comes down to

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,590
we want the gestures a movement to augment clarity for the speeches that

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,834
we're working on, and to look purposeful, to look intentional.

12
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:35,020


13
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,060
If you'll remember back to that speech apprehension video where the guy was

14
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,860
at the city council meeting.

15
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,040
And he took off his glasses.

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,570
And they were doing this and all that.

17
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,690
That clearly was unintentional movement.

18
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,850
He had no idea what was going on.

19
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,580
His arm was off doing its own thing while he was speaking.

20
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,140
He was so nervous.

21
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,190
So we want to make sure that our movement and gestures look purposeful

22
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,330
and add to clarity.

23
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,020
So let's talk about gestures first.

24
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:05,700
So gestures should clearly relate to your content.

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,350
If you remember back to when we talked about literacy and orality, we don't

26
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,900
have bold or italics when we stand up to speak.

27
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,540
But gestures can perform some of that role.

28
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,230
They highlight certain ideas they under score certain words.

29
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,820
But gestures don't illustrate.

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,250
You shouldn't be thinking about it that way.

31
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,600
We're not doing public speaking through sign, although I think that

32
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,990
raises a whole host of really fascinating challenges--

33
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:34,370
how signing for a speech is different from signing conversationally.

34
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,490
But we're not doing that in this class.

35
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,570
And so in that sense, our gestures don't need to illustrate.

36
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,120
So you don't say, the other day I got out on a boat and the seas were rocky,

37
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,060
but the sun was shining.

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,230
You're not doing that.

39
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,290
But they do need to work in tandem with what you're saying.

40
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,950
So in this sense, if you want to gesture, make sure you're gesturing.

41
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,590
We sort of often do this.

42
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,260
It's part of how we communicate.

43
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,240
Now if you do gesture, make sure the gestures are coming up and out.

44
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,710
They're here.

45
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,420
They're part of the performance.

46
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,420
We could talk about this as your gesture box.

47
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,500
Here's my gesture box.

48
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,930
It's right here in front of me.

49
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,080
My gestures come up and out into the gesture box.

50
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,520
Most of them are going to be here.

51
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,380
Maybe occasionally I want to do a point up here, but only very rarely.

52
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,620
I don't say, I'm not doing my impromptu speech.

53
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,940
I strongly believe in lighting.

54
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,020
Lighting is wonderful for two main reasons.

55
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,970
First and second-- so first.

56
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,540
We're not doing that.

57
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,030
Your gestures are coming out and into the gesture box.

58
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,560
Now why we want to do that is, this is where we want our attention to be.

59
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,010
Sometimes when people are nervous and they don't know what to do with their

60
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,755
hands, they'll lock them in at their sides.

61
00:02:39,755 --> 00:02:43,060
The problem is, they still got all the energy that they want to express when

62
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,590
they're getting up, and standing, and delivering that speech.

63
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,750
So they end up talking with their hands anyway.

64
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,060
So what happens is, they end up doing this.

65
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,480
We talk about this being a flipper baby.

66
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,410
Don't be a flipper baby.

67
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,950
Plus, if you're doing this, where's that drawing the attention?

68
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,990
Unless you're doing an informative speech about your pelvis, they don't

69
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,840
belong there.

70
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,320
Bring them up and out.

71
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,320
This is where you want our attention so those gestures are coming up into

72
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,820
this gesture box.

73
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,310
And you're using them to illustrate, to underscore, your key ideas.

74
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,860
But they should look purposeful and they should augment clarity.

75
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,600
So if you want to gesture on your preview--

76
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,920
I often do that--

77
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,690
there are three things I want to talk about-- first, second, and third.

78
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,440
If it looks natural, great.

79
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,970
If not, don't do it.

80
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,060
Just like we did on the transitions when we were talking about

81
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,970
transitioning, it shouldn't look forced.

82
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,040
So too with there are three things I want to talk about--

83
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,880
first, second, and third.

84
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,950
We don't do that.

85
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,800
They should help augment clarity, but they should look natural.

86
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,630
And above all, they should be intentional.

87
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,730
You should look like what you're doing-- or at least

88
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,600
you're aware of it.

89
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,510
And this holds true when we talk about movement.

90
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,390
So in movement, we talked about you can maybe move on a transition.

91
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,780
This is a way of being comfortable--

92
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,430
being able to use your physical space as a way of illustrating how

93
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,040
comfortable you are in the space, but also highlighting the fact that you're

94
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,990
no longer on point one.

95
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,320
You're over here on point two.

96
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,240
Now, you don't have to move.

97
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,300
But if you do move, it should look purposeful.

98
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,120
It should look clean.

99
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,210
It should look intentional.

100
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:16,045
What you don't want and sometimes you see, is a movement where the speaker

101
00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:17,279
is standing up there.

102
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,079
And they're talking to you, but clearly they're not very aware of what

103
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,740
they're doing.

104
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:25,620
They just kind of look a little unhinged and ill at ease.

105
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,390
So the movement should look purposeful.

106
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,680
But as with gesture, if you want to move, make sure you're doing.

107
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,620
We have two things that happen in this regard.

108
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,020
Sometimes people stand there.

109
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,340
And then they're just like this the whole time.

110
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,480
And they're doing their talk.

111
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,030
If you have two functioning feet, use them.

112
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,230
Stand on two feet.

113
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,470
The other thing is, if they are standing, they're nervous.

114
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,550
They still kind of want to move.

115
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,870
They've got all this nervous energy.

116
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,630
So they start putting their weight in their back pocket, and

117
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,320
they're doing this.

118
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,980
I don't know, you're not dancing for us in this speech.

119
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,940
Or the other thing is just slowly kind of going back and forth.

120
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,730
If you're reading your notes and you're not looking at the audience,

121
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,560
you might find yourself doing this.

122
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,740
In this class as you video your performances, you might go back and

123
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,500
take a look at that.

124
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,330
If you watch your speech on twice speed and you get a little motion

125
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,450
sickness, you're probably see-sawing back a little bit too much.

126
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,200
So movement should be purposeful.

127
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,530
You might even plan it.

128
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,860
I know I'm going to walk on my point one.

129
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,450
If you're practicing your speech, practice the speech as much as you can

130
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,570
as you will deliver it.

131
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,730
So don't practice your speech sitting at a desk, if you're going to be

132
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,210
standing up delivering the speech.

133
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,710


134
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,600
Practice the speech as you will deliver it.

135
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,950
Because then you'll sort of learn what is comfortable, what's uncomfortable.

136
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,370
Those movements will become more natural.

137
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,960
One sort of the last thing just generally on movement

138
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,390
that I want to mention.

139
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,240
And again, this doesn't necessarily work as much for this class if you're

140
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,550
videoing your speeches, but certainly when you're in

141
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,970
front of a live audience.

142
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:02,270
I typically want to be able to throw my arms out in a V and capture most of

143
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,310
my audience.

144
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:08,010
So if I'm up here and my audience is all the way to the side, if I've got

145
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,490
room, I want to go ahead and move back, so I can always capture them.

146
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,580
So I'm not blocking out my audience.

147
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,890
Hello there.

148
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,225
You know, I'm capturing them in the--

149
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:18,415
I'm giving them a big hug.

150
00:06:18,415 --> 00:06:20,080
Give your audience a hug.

151
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,070
So I'm capturing most of that audience.

152
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,610
But that's a way of sort of using movement.

153
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,260
And I can address these different components of the room.

154
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:32,490
So even if you don't walk formally and a long distance on your transition--

155
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,180
let's say you don't have a lot of space, but you really want to move.

156
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,190
You can do the same thing with just a few shuffle steps.

157
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,810
Boy, this is true for two reasons-- first and second.

158
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,780
So the first thing is blank, blank, blank.

159
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,650
I'm doing my first point.

160
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:48,750
But not only that, this second reason is blank, blank blank.

161
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,760
So that's movement that's still working to highlight the transition

162
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,630
that I'm making.

163
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:56,260
But my footprint's pretty small.

164
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,660
So we've talked about breathing and projection.

165
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,620
We've talked about pacing and pausing.

166
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,560
We've talked about gestures and movement.

167
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,550
We will spend more time talking about delivery when we get to be informative

168
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,740
and persuasive sections on delivery.

169
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,390
But for now, what I want you to do is, at the end of this video, there's a

170
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:18,520
link to this YouTube playlist that I have on the class YouTube website.

171
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,870
And what I want you to do is watch those sample videos.

172
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,610
And I've got notes indicating things that I think are interesting in each

173
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,720
one of those.

174
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,650
Watch those.

175
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,820
Analyze them.

176
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,370
Discuss them in the discussion forums set up for the

177
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,520
analysis of these speeches.

178
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,800
And as you're doing that, look at that delivery for what's working and what's

179
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,480
not working.

180
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,750
But also, be thinking back to imitation.

181
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,800
Delivery is a really ripe area for studying imitation--

182
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,740
identifying something that someone does physically, or through tone or

183
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,080
pitch, that you really like and you can carry off.

184
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,710
So think about how you're going to start incorporating that into your own

185
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,910
speech repertoire.

186
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,690
So for example, years ago I had a colleague here in this department.

187
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,660
And he was doing a presentation.

188
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,110
He was doing it on discourse analytics.

189
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,150
And so he kept talking about this one term.

190
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,840
And throughout the speech he had this gesture.

191
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,620
And it was, oh, he really got into it.

192
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,900
And he was very precise when he was talking about words.

193
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,620
And I was watching.

194
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,840
And I'm like, done.

195
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,160
That is mine now.

196
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,080
I hope there's no plagiarism case on gestures because I own that.

197
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,700
And over the time, over the years, I just find myself

198
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,640
doing it more and more.

199
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,400
It's natural.

200
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,035
It's not forced.

201
00:08:26,035 --> 00:08:30,900
But I saw something-- it seemed to fit within my natural delivery system.

202
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,929
So I tried to incorporate it into my own speech repertoire.

203
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,549
So as you're watching those videos, analyze them.

204
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,450
But also think about good models of delivery imitation.

205
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,700
