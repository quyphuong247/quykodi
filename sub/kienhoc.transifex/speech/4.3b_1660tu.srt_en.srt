00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,350
MATT MCGARRITY: OK, so as I mentioned, this is for a speech I had to give.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,830
It's about 45 minutes and there was about 15 minutes after that of Q&A.

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,790
And I had to deliver the speech on April 19, 2011 here.

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,550
So you'll notice that the short outline, the last version, was

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,000
actually polished up and sent out on that day.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,970
And that's really the outline I use for them.

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,140
If I referenced notes, I had them there.

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,380
But so I started on the speech 11 days before I delivered it.

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,820
Probably should've started earlier but, hey, we all get to that area.

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,470
So once again I've got here, on my ideas, if you take a look at this.

11
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,450
As it opens up here slowly.

12
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,700
No.

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,574

14
00:00:45,574 --> 00:00:46,876
Yes.

15
00:00:46,876 --> 00:00:51,770
So if you look on here, I had some basic ideas.

16
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,600
And I'm walking through, I'm trying to--

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,260
Titles.

18
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,370
Having to come up with a title sometimes helps me.

19
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,920
Often if you're invited to do a talk they want it to have a title.

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,030
I used to think that was a real pain but now I've come to see it as sort of

21
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,870
helpful as well as another heuristic for helping me narrow in on an idea.

22
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,950
So I'm just really trying to throw out all the stuff I have

23
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,020
into this basic document.

24
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,560
Then I cogitate on that for a few days.

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,050
And then you'll notice here on the 11th, I'm pulling this

26
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,480
into a bigger draft.

27
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,380
So here you see I've got a bunch of smaller points.

28
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,490
It's still pretty embryonic, I don't have a lot of evidence on there.

29
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,560
But this gives me a time.

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,980
And you'll notice after I've done this for a few days I want to reflect a

31
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,670
little bit, so I had some thoughts on goals.

32
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,360
And I'm really asking, who is the audience here and what

33
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,730
should the talk do?

34
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,425
So I--

35
00:01:43,425 --> 00:01:44,050
look at that--

36
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,870
I even go in here and I list constraints and opportunities.

37
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,540
I haven't revisited this in about a year or so.

38
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,460
So I'm trying to think through, what are some of the constraints?

39
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,670
what are my opportunities?

40
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,820
What are the goals of this presentation?

41
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,470
I had some general goals when I started to work on

42
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,250
those five days before.

43
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,420
But now I'm really making another cycle through this.

44
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,670
Then I've got a different--

45
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,650
this is same day.

46
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,520
Now this is starting to look more like a draft in here.

47
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,230
So I've got evidence that I've looped in.

48
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,860
I now am probably in that first phase.

49
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,540
So all of this early--

50
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,380
all of these--

51
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,760
are probably in that planning stage.

52
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,590
I'm just trying to pull my ideas together.

53
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,800
Then, this is that first major outline.

54
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,080
Here I've got something looking like key points.

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,200
I've got an opening.

56
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,800
I've got sort of a first point, I've got a second point, a third point, and

57
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,240
a conclusion.

58
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,330
But it is a whole bunch of stuff on here.

59
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,130
So I would've run that.

60
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:49,090
I would have run that, and then you'll notice later that night.

61
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,640
So on the 13th and the 13th.

62
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,240
So I ran that a couple of times.

63
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,330
And then later that night, I went in and I made some changes.

64
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,540
So now, let's see what I've done here.

65
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,800
It's still not--

66
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,230
it's still a little long.

67
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,470
But I've changed some things.

68
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,750
I've made some adaptations.

69
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,760
I've cut some evidence, I've included different evidence, based on my

70
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,490
experiences running that draft three.

71
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,280
So then I've got draft four.

72
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,110
Looks like I ran that on the 14th and then probably again on the 15th.

73
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,720
So by the 15th I can go back in and I make some pretty small changes.

74
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,150
I'm starting to think through, if I was just trying to headline the key

75
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,960
ideas, what would they look like?

76
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,560
So I've got some basic ideas, but I'd run, and then I'd go back in.

77
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,890
I got another draft.

78
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,520
Again it's got a lot of evidence in here.

79
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,760
Now it's getting shorter.

80
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,510
A little bit more targeted.

81
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,240
Then I've got my draft seven on the same day.

82
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,580
I'm making some changes here, now I've got a lot of evidence.

83
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,500
So I've consolidated some points.

84
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,790
So instead of having two or three separate points devoted to this, I

85
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,535
take all the evidence and I put it under one new main point.

86
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:56,640
So I've made some revisions based on that.

87
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,760
Then you'll notice on the next couple of days I revised the chunks.

88
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,140
So instead of revising the whole thing for this, I went in and revised

89
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,210
discrete parts of the speech.

90
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,480
Because they felt like different elements, different components.

91
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,790
So this is kind of my revised version of chunk three, chunk one, chunk two.

92
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,649
I do a run through of each one of these.

93
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:21,440
I've got some notes on performance, what did I say?

94
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,250
I need more intro conclusion stuff.

95
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,470
Final section felt pretty good, it needed more humor.

96
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,930
It felt too pleading, apparently I was feeling fairly desperate.

97
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,010
I do one big run.

98
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:37,360
I've got my time marked in here and also manually written on my script.

99
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,630
So I've got a couple of small notes about the performance.

100
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,740
Then I've got my last major draft.

101
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,620
Okay, here, this is pretty short, right?

102
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,570
And it's tidied up and I don't have all the evidence written out in full.

103
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,420
Rather at this point I know what that evidence says.

104
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,530
So I don't need to write out what used to take up half a page.

105
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,245
What the NSSE evidence is, at this point I know it.

106
00:05:01,245 --> 00:05:03,630
So I just got to remind myself that's where I talk about it.

107
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,980
So this is a shorter draft.

108
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,250
This gives me something to practice with.

109
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:11,940
So you notice this was on the day before I deliver the presentation.

110
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,120
So then I spent some time revising the short outline.

111
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,350
So this is my talking outline, this is for a 45 minute talk about a page.

112
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,820
And so I practice a couple of times with this, made some revisions to

113
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:29,730
this, printed it out, and took this one page with me to the talk.

114
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,370
Once again, 45 minute talk, 15 minutes for Q&A.

115
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,290
So I took this with me to the talk.

116
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,750
And of course when it came time to present I didn't really even use this.

117
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,140
Because I'd run it so many times and I'd made so many revisions I just knew

118
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,840
the presentation.

119
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,810
If I needed to, this was there.

120
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,650
And I never want to do a presentation without the capacity of notes, right?

121
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,090
In case I do lose my way.

122
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,650
But this is the end result of running it through multiple revisions.

123
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,080
It took me a few days.

124
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,350
It was a major presentation, it was a very large presentation.

125
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,110
It was one important to me because I was presenting for colleagues and

126
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,220
people who I held in high esteem.

127
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,800
So I wanted it to be a coherent presentation.

128
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,790
But that's just a way of giving you another demonstration of what this

129
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,170
process might look like.

130
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,080
This once again I would hold up more as that ideal model.

131
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,390
I did a lot of revising and a lot of drafting.

132
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,680
Many of the other presentations I do will probably have

133
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,430
something like the ideas.

134
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,810
Maybe something looking more like draft four.

135
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,810
And then maybe just the short outline.

136
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,780
So it would have gone through a couple of versions but not nearly as many as

137
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,220
this one went through.

138
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,270
Now, this process that I've been discussing is but one suggestion.

139
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,990
As in all aspects of this course, if it is useful to you, use it.

140
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,820
If it's not, set it aside.

141
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,530
But this method has worked well for me and for many of the people I coach.

142
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:53,890
And once again, it comes back to one of the key issues of this class.

143
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,890
Which is not simply being able to do a good speech, but

144
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,810
becoming a good speaker.

145
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:03,600
And becoming a good speaker requires getting a sense for what your unique

146
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,710
delivery style is.

147
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,940
What writing works for you, and you in front of an audience.

148
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,610
I will say there are some benefits to this method.

149
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,030
And as the more I've grown to have faith in it.

150
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,880
So if I'm doing a big presentation, and I'm really trying, and it's

151
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,360
something that it's a tough speech to get into line.

152
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,150
So I'll do that first massive outline and I'll do that first pass.

153
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:33,310
At the end of that first pass I am marked by extreme despair.

154
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,350
And I mean this has happened countless times in my house, in the

155
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,900
basement, in my office.

156
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,880
I'll walk around doing the speech and at the end of that first pass it's

157
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,640
just, this will never happen.

158
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,010
I am a failure.

159
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,320
But I've done it enough times now where I'm like, no what?

160
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,780
Just have faith, it'll all shake out in the end.

161
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,410
This is draft one and it's going to go through four or five more drafts.

162
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,000
It'll get there.

163
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,850
So I've come to place a lot more faith in this.

164
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,240
But the benefit is by the end of running this process

165
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,710
I don't need notes.

166
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,490
People often ask me, well, how do I memorize a presentation?

167
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,100
You don't.

168
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,680
You know the presentation then you just do it.

169
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,150
And the answer is, how do you get to know it?

170
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,010
By doing it.

171
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,890
By running it, by developing it in a way that you can deliver it.

172
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,080
So by the end of this process I don't need notes.

173
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,000
I've written what I want to deliver and I practice delivering

174
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,070
what I want to say.

175
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,960
So I would recommend that at least you try this process.

176
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,490
Try it on the informative speech that you're working up for this class, or

177
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,170
at the very least the next presentation that you have to give.

178
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,820
Give this process a whirl and see if it helps you out.

179
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,070
