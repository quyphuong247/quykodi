MATT MCGARRITY: Having discussed a process for pulling together an

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,790
informative speech--

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,960
in that last lecture I talked about some of the planning stages, trying to

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,760
puzzle through some of the various elements.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,160
Let's go ahead and start that now.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,500
For informative speeches in general and for your informative speech-- if

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,690
you choose to do it for this class and upload it-- how you

8
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:20,510
puzzle through that.

9
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,400
So I want to talk a little bit about planning an informative speech.

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,580
What are some of the things that you need to keep in mind at the very

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,080
beginning of that type of a project?

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,520
So I think one of the ways that you can start this is by puzzling through

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,800
some of the constraints you face as an informative speaker.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,220
So you may remember back to the very first week of this class we talked

15
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,190
about speaking situations, the rhetorical situation.

16
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,110
So I'd like to use that as a lens for thinking about some of the constraints

17
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,960
that you face and the opportunities that you face as someone who's

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,280
speaking to inform.

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,070
So in this video lecture I want to talk a little bit about adapting to

20
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,490
your rhetorical constraints.

21
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:02,170
I want to talk very broadly about some general types of informative speeches.

22
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:07,250
Then a little bit about dialing in your topic and adjusting your topic to

23
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,960
the time constraints in your audience.

24
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,680
And then, finally, spending some time thinking through what you might choose

25
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,830
to do for a speech for this particular online course.

26
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,000
So let's return to the speaking situations, to the constraints in a

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,510
rhetorical situation.

28
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:27,800
Well, typically a speaker addresses a number of constraints--

29
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,410
the topic, the audience, the speaker, the occasion and setting,

30
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,030
and the time allotted.

31
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,640
So let's kind of think through each one of these and how these might limit

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,150
and open some possibilities for informative speaking.

33
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:45,540
So, in thinking through some of these various rhetorical constraints, we

34
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,090
first are presented with topic.

35
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,410
So, in this class, this is a rare opportunity.

36
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,060
Speech classes are sort of an arbitrary situation where people are

37
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,140
bound together.

38
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,710
That public, that audience is called into being by no other reason than

39
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,780
giving a speech.

40
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,080
And that doesn't happen anywhere else, right?

41
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,230
If you're at your job, there is a reason that you are being called to

42
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,830
present on an idea.

43
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,210
It's either to give an update or to present us with new information.

44
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,500
If you are pulling an audience together, there's a reason for that.

45
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,200
Normally, the topic is the reason people gather together.

46
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,370
Not merely the idea of engaging in a speech.

47
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,850
So, as you're working through informative speaking, for this class

48
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,540
and for outside this class, you want to start thinking about,

49
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,600
well, what is the topic?

50
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,050
What's the topic going to be for this presentation?

51
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,340
Is it pre-selected?

52
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,140
If so, what flexibility do you have?

53
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,940
Are there some things that you know have to be in the presentation itself?

54
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,190
So sometimes if I'm called to speak and I am doing sort of fund-raising

55
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,930
type stuff, people will give me some information.

56
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,130
They're like, whatever you say, make sure you include this.

57
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,440
So that's a constraint.

58
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,080
I know that whatever I say, I've got to find some way to incorporate that.

59
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,310
As a side note, any time somebody gives me stuff to speak on, more often

60
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,830
than not, they've written it as copy.

61
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,830
But they haven't written it as it would be used in a speech.

62
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,430
So I always want to get that ahead of time so I can revise it and make it

63
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,220
part of my presentation.

64
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,310
Because if I'm trying to read it, it's too much information.

65
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,160
So, I'm thinking through the topic.

66
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,020
What sort of flexibility do I have?

67
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,130
So, do I have all the key information that I need?

68
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,860
Do I need to maybe do a little bit of background research on this topic

69
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,400
before I actually present on it?

70
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,500
So the topic itself is a constraint on what you are going to be able to do in

71
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,710
that presentation.

72
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,660
So is the audience.

73
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,360
How much does that audience already know?

74
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,540
If the audience does know a lot, are they favorably disposed towards your

75
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,630
topic or do they not so much like it?

76
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,430
And if it's negative, do you need to--

77
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,150
to achieve your goals, do you need to respond to those

78
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,770
concerns at that time?

79
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,722
So if they've got some bad preconceptions about your topic, and

80
00:03:54,722 --> 00:03:58,190
you want to inform them, do you need to address their concerns?

81
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:03,050
Or are they minor and you don't and addressing it just calls more

82
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,870
attention to it and eats up time that you could spend on other things?

83
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,850
So once again, in the informative speech, you're

84
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,440
making a lot of judgments.

85
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,820
And at the very broadest lever, figuring--

86
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,019
at the very broadest level, figuring out what you're going to address is a

87
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,519
matter of thinking through these various potential constraints.

88
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,920
Constraints on you as a speaker.

89
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,910
What's your background with the topic?

90
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,260
How long have you been working on this?

91
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,610
Does the audience know about your expertise?

92
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,710
If not, do you need to tell them?

93
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,970
Would that help the audience understand the speech better and maybe

94
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,315
take you, as a speaker, as an expert on the topic, do you need to inform

95
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:39,360
them of that?

96
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,500
The occasion.

97
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,890
What are the expectations around this presentation?

98
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,330
What do people think they're going to be getting out of this?

99
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,430
What's the room set up like?

100
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,290
Will there be questions afterwards?

101
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,930
In which case, all of these are going to shape what you can actually talk on

102
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,690
or how much time you want to allocate to the talk itself, how much time you

103
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,530
want to allocate to questions.

104
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,170
That's the big one here, time.

105
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,050
How much time do you have?

106
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,510
Because that's going to affect what points you include.

107
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:13,420
So as you're starting to think through and develop a topic--

108
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,340
develop a presentation, you're developing it in response to a set of

109
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,050
ideas or a set of expectations.

110
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,100
Some of these may be already set.

111
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,720
Some of them may be at your discretion.

112
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,050
Some of them are flexible.

113
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,490
But I do think that rhetorical situation and some of those questions

114
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,480
can help you puzzle through and begin this process of fitting the speech to

115
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,880
the situation, so that it's really achieving what it needs to achieve.

116
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,440
So now I want to shift a little bit and help you think through some of

117
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,580
your other options.

118
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,600
So, just very broadly, what are some of the types of informative speeches

119
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,420
you might get?

120
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,860
Well, certainly there are presentations on objects.

121
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,930
So I mentioned, a while back, talking about someone in technology who would

122
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,110
be introducing somebody to a new product, a technology product.

123
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,490
Here are the features it has.

124
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,760
That's an informative speech.

125
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,510
It's a discussion of an object.

126
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,600
Or an event.

127
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:10,280
Maybe you want to make sure people know about a

128
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,630
fund-raising walk or something.

129
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,930
You need to be able to speak on that in a way that informs them what the

130
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,230
event is, when it's happening, and what it's for.

131
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,310
Presentations on people and places.

132
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,260
If I was going to talk about the major attractions of Seattle, that's an

133
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,110
informative speech.

134
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,360
Or processes.

135
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,220
So I've taught a class on how to apply to graduate school.

136
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,080
A speech on that is an informative speech.

137
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,890
It's providing my approach to it, but I'm incorporating some knowledge,

138
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,740
experience, research, into that talk.

139
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:46,000
But it's a discussion of a process, how one does something.

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,780
Explaining new ideas to us.

141
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,745
Universal design as a way of thinking about how to develop classes or how to

142
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:55,550
develop technology.

143
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,880
Not thinking about people who are capable and have problems with

144
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,990
capability but just designing everything universally, so that

145
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,520
everyone can access it.

146
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,840
And then certainly we get into the types of presentations that I know at

147
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,090
least many of you in this course are dealing with--

148
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,310
progress reports, project updates, quarterly--

149
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,780
talking about quarterly earnings, or survey data, providing informative

150
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,070
speeches at your workplace.

151
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,150
Or, if you're a scholar, presenting research as a

152
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,760
teacher, or as a student.

153
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,980
All of these are different sub-genres of informative speaking.

154
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,230
