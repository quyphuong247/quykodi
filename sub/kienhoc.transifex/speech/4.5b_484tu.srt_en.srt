MATT MCGARRITY: Now that you have some concrete goals you know, now's when we

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,810
start this process of really dialing it in.

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,850
What sort of modifications do you need to make to the topic or to your time

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,770
limits or to the goals in order for this to work?

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,110
But above all, these goals are getting you to the point where you should be

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:24,090
thinking about your speech from the perspective of the audience, OK?

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,700
If they're unfamiliar with this concept, what questions are going to

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,680
pop up in their mind?

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,060
Or if they're unfamiliar with this concept, what terms

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,310
do they need defined?

11
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,290
How can you think through the ears and eyes of your audience?

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,800
Because that's what an informative speech is about.

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,310
Being able to meet audiences where they are and achieve your goals for

14
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,350
that audience.

15
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,060
It's not just about what you want to say.

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,400
It's about what they need to hear and understand.

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,240
So here we are.

18
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,460
That was a very loud so.

19
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,480
I hope that came through on the mic as echo-y as it did in here.

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,210
So--

21
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,300
I said it again.

22
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,120
So now we're at the end of the content for this introduction to the

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,200
informative speech.

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,370
What I want you to do, if you haven't already, is identify a topic for the

25
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,950
speech assignment.

26
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,830
Take that topic and walk it through the rhetorical situation.

27
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,070
What are the constraints the bear upon you in developing that topic for this

28
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,920
audience for this rhetorical situation?

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,420
As you're doing that, start the process of drafting up some concrete

30
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,680
speech goals.

31
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,890
And then this will also give you a hint as to other research

32
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,770
you need to do, OK?

33
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,040
If there's certain areas where you're like, oh, I really need to address

34
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,530
that point, now's the time to start pulling that research together.

35
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,480
The idea is you've got all that work now done at the end of the lecture

36
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,200
content for this week so that at the beginning of next week, we're going to

37
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,570
start getting into much more precise stuff on invention arrangements.

38
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,070
Really starting to move from that planning stage into the concrete

39
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,080
details of piecing that presentation together.

40
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,520
That's is, if you're doing a mock up for this class.

41
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,450
Even if you're not I want you to take the material from this week and apply

42
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,850
it to the very next presentation that you give, the very next informative

43
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,610
presentation that you give in any context.

44
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,020
Make sure you're walking through a process that allows you to develop a

45
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,120
speech that works well for you and for your audience.

46
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,460
Think very concretely about your speech goals.

47
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,130
Because that's going to give you a sense of purpose and it's going to be

48
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,650
better for your audience.

49
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,000
So that's where we are at the end of this week.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,370
I'll see you next week with some good content about informative speaking.

51
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,620
