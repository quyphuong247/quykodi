my mother and father had been saving money for years to be able to buy that

1
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:30,919
machine

2
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:33,109
and the first day is going to be used

3
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:34,100
even grandma

4
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,510
was invited to see the machine

5
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:39,929
and grandma was even more excited

6
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:44,189
throughout her life she had been heating water with firewood

7
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:46,319
 and she had hand washed

8
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:48,319
laundry for seven children

9
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:51,370
and now she was going to watch

10
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:52,129
electricity

11
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,840
do that work

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,919
my mother my mother

13
00:00:55,918 --> 00:00:58,129
carefully opened the door

14
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:02,640
and she loaded the laundry into the machine

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,560
like this

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,750
when she closed the door grandma said no no no no let me let me

17
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,980
push the button

18
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,439
and grandma

19
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:14,569
pushed the button

20
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:15,728
and she said

21
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:16,840
ooh

22
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,118
fantastic i want to see this give me a chair give me a chair i want to see it

23
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:23,670
sat down in front of the machine

24
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,820
and she watched

25
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:30,129
the entire washing program she was mesmerized

26
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:32,149
to my grandmother

27
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,490
the washing machine was a miracle

28
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:36,759
to date

29
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,170
in sweden and other rich countries

30
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,840
people are using so many so many different machines they are so

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,930
full of machines i can't even name them all you know

32
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:50,279
and and they also when they'd when they don't want to travel

33
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:52,519
they use flying machines

34
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:55,239
that can take them to remote destinations

35
00:01:55,239 --> 00:02:00,368
and yet in the world there are so many people who still need the water on fire

36
00:02:00,368 --> 00:02:03,000
and eight cook their food on fire

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,500
sometimes they don't even have enough food

38
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,530
and they lived de lo the poverty line that to billion

39
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,729
fellow human beings

40
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,479
will leave the on less than two a dollar a day

41
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:15,180
and the richest people over there

42
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:21,079
as one million people and they merely bob court i caught the airline

43
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,269
because they have more

44
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:26,379
spend more than a controller today you know on their consumption

45
00:02:26,378 --> 00:02:30,228
but this is just want to three million people and obviously there are seven

46
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:34,149
million people in the world so there must be one do three

47
00:02:34,149 --> 00:02:37,748
four billion people more will it do you need to be in the poverty line and the

48
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:38,549
airline

49
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:40,329
they have a nick leeson

50
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:44,150
but the question is how many have washing machine

51
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,900
i'd done this scrutiny or market data

52
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,870
and i found

53
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,149
that indeed the washing machine has penetrated

54
00:02:51,149 --> 00:02:54,808
deal with the airline and today there's an additional one billion people out

55
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:55,560
there

56
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,019
will live bob the wash line

57
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:04,218
vacancy alone for more than forty dollar per day

58
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:06,668
thirteen billions have excess the washing machine

59
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:08,169
and the remaining

60
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:09,599
five billion

61
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:10,938
how do they watch

62
00:03:10,938 --> 00:03:12,579
what will be more precise

63
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,640
how do we most of the women in the world walks because it remains the hard work

64
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,858
for women to watch

65
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:23,049
there was like this by hand

66
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:26,819
it's paul dekhte hein consuming

67
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:30,498
labor which they have to do for hours every week

68
00:03:30,498 --> 00:03:34,438
and sometimes they will send to bring water from faraway to do the laundry at

69
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:38,789
home or they had to bring the laundry away to a stream far off

70
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:41,429
and they want the washing machine

71
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:45,299
they don't want to spend such a large part of their life

72
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:46,519
doing this hard work

73
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,609
we still relatively low productivity

74
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:51,819
and there's nothing different in their wish

75
00:03:51,818 --> 00:03:56,429
than it was from my grandmother nuclear dude generations ago in sweden picking

76
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,979
water from the stream

77
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:00,779
heating with firewood and washing biker

78
00:04:00,778 --> 00:04:05,429
they want the washing missing in exactly the same way but when i lecture to

79
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:07,020
environmentally concerned students

80
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,670
they can't make no everybody in the world cannot have cars and washing

81
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:12,119
machines

82
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,028
have compelled his woman dirty and going to have the washing machine

83
00:04:16,028 --> 00:04:20,168
and they lost by students at boston over the last two years about how many of you

84
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:24,079
and i think he was a card as some of them probably raise their hand miller's

85
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,769
yeah i don't use a car

86
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:28,149
and then i put the really tough questions

87
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:32,578
how many of you hand wash your genes and your bed sheet

88
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:35,689
no one raised their hand

89
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:38,569
even the hog according the green movement

90
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:43,468
use washing machine

91
00:04:43,468 --> 00:04:47,308
so how come something that everyone views and they think others with most of

92
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:48,620
the what the especially with this

93
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,019
i had to do in another six about the energy use in the world here we are

94
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:55,469
nokia you see the seven million people up there

95
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,979
the air people of the worst big brother

96
00:04:57,978 --> 00:05:00,550
bid by all the people and the fire people

97
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,949
at one unit like this

98
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:07,960
but energy use lethal force if you would all you would call with our guests

99
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:11,528
that's what most of the electricity and energy in the world this

100
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:14,610
and needs twenty units used in the entire world

101
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,908
and the reaches bonding and they use six up

102
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:19,149
half of the image is used

103
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:21,258
by one-seventh of the world population

104
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:24,929
and these ones who have washing machine but not the house for the by the

105
00:05:24,928 --> 00:05:25,349
machines

106
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,409
that used to

107
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:30,259
this group used to eat one leach

108
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:34,050
and they are setting a precedent over there they don't even use one leach that

109
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,598
makes twelve

110
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:40,098
but the main concern for the environmentally interested students and

111
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:43,509
they are right is about the future

112
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,560
what are the printing we ask for a long veterans without any really advanced

113
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,728
analysis to two thousand feet you've got to do things that can increase the

114
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:56,348
energy use first population growth second economic growth

115
00:05:56,348 --> 00:05:59,829
bubble asian growth we may need a car among the poorest people here because

116
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:03,139
they are high child mortality and they have many children per woman

117
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:06,050
and that they would get to excel but that won't change their images used very

118
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:06,780
much

119
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:08,848
what will happen is a case

120
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:09,569
economic growth

121
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:14,098
the best of hearing the emerging economies i called and then you eat

122
00:06:14,098 --> 00:06:18,228
they will jumped the airline wap they would say and they would start to use as

123
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:22,120
much as the old west are doing well read

124
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,780
and these people they want the washing machine i told you a bit and all that

125
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:29,209
and they will dot but then did you use in the hope that the poor people get the

126
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:30,459
into the electric light

127
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:33,509
they would get to shock family without a stop in population growth

128
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:38,300
but the total energy consumption will increase to twenty two units and these

129
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,430
twenty-two units you know

130
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,340
spin the richest people use most often

131
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:47,019
so what's needed to be done because

132
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:51,319
the race the high probability of climate change is re

133
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,360
israel

134
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,038
of course they must be more energy efficient

135
00:06:56,038 --> 00:06:59,908
they must change behavior to some way they must also start to creep use green

136
00:06:59,908 --> 00:07:04,069
and which much more green engines but dont feel they have the same energy

137
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:07,439
plans on several persons they shouldn't give advice to others what to do well

138
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,139
what a lot to do

139
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,679
fear we can get

140
00:07:12,678 --> 00:07:14,128
here we can get

141
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:17,379
more green energy all over this is what we hope many had

142
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:19,949
is a real challenge in the future

143
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:23,619
but i can assure your that this woman and a far better lighting real

144
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:25,339
she wants the washing machine

145
00:07:25,338 --> 00:07:29,259
she's very happy about a minister of energy that provided any preceded

146
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:29,699
reveron

147
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,389
so happy that she even even voted for heart you know what

148
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:36,829
and she became a day tomorrow so if the president-elect over

149
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:40,778
one of the biggest democracies in the world you know moving from in this job

150
00:07:40,778 --> 00:07:42,689
energy too oppressive

151
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:49,689
if you have democracy people in wartime vote for washing machine laminin

152
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,550
and what and that he played

153
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,060
my math

154
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,848
explain the magic with this machine that very very

155
00:07:56,848 --> 00:07:58,058
the she said

156
00:07:58,059 --> 00:07:59,769
now homes

157
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:03,110
we had no did the laundry them if she would make it work

158
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,650
and now we can go to the light

159
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:07,609
because this is the magic

160
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,650
loads of laundry

161
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:10,959
and what do you get out of the machine

162
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,818
you gift books

163
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:14,669
part of the machines

164
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:15,478
children's books

165
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:17,938
and mother got time to read for me

166
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:22,718
seal of this i've got the a_b_c_ this is why i started my career as professor

167
00:08:22,718 --> 00:08:25,029
when my mother had time to read for me

168
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:26,809
and short of accounts for a second

169
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,370
tim anderson study english and learned that

170
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,619
as a foreign language

171
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:35,918
and she read so many adult burns so many different melbourne sia you know and and

172
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:38,240
we really will be there la

173
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,259
this machine

174
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:43,100
and what they said that my mother and me

175
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,070
fact you industrialization

176
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,980
thank you's deleon

177
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,700
thank you cholera station

178
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,778
and thank you can make the processing industry that gave us time to read both

179
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:55,259
thank you very much
