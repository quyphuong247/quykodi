MATT McGARRITY: The persuasive speech assignment I really like.

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,600
I like all the assignments, and each one of them is

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,580
doing something different.

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,770
But the persuasive speech assignment allows us to dig deep into some really

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,140
helpful stuff on argumentation and argument.

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,480
And let me say at the outset that argumentation is different from

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,820
argumentativeness.

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,000
This speech is about you being an advocate for your topic.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,920
And if you're going to be as successful advocate, you need to be

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,340
someone who can make a strong case with good evidence in an open and

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,270
honest way, and in a way that invites agreement rather than disagreement.

12
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,460
Now, when we think in terms of argumentation, maybe some people think

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,950
in terms of argumentativeness.

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,740
Basically, being a jerk.

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,250
That's not what we're going to be doing.

16
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,320
We want to be far more strategic and successful than that.

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,110
So as we move through this persuasive , speech remember it is a persuasive

18
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:56,730
speech that uses argument, not an argumentative speech that uses being a

19
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,310
jerk as evidence.

20
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,060
That's not what we're going for.

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,200
So when we're engaging in the speech and we're being ethically persuasive,

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,700
what you're going to want to do is be able to raise awareness of your

23
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,490
organization, or that you can take this model and apply it to tons of

24
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,200
stuff that you do outside this class.

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,800
Fundraising is basically what this speech is.

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,670
I could call it the fundraising speech, but it's bigger than that.

27
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,180
I typically in the past have also called this an advocacy speech,

28
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,810
because you're advocating for something.

29
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,760
I could call it the motivational speech, but that

30
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,700
conjures up certain images.

31
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,930
That's not necessarily what we're doing.

32
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,730
But you can take this model and apply it to arguing for policy changes at

33
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,240
work or explaining your position on a political issue.

34
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,540
But this need not be simply political, because the speech assignment is not

35
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,390
about simply spouting off.

36
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:48,560
It is an opportunity to make clear, honest, motivating arguments in ways

37
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,680
that encourage agreement rather than disagreement.

38
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,440
So in this speech, in this persuasive speech assignment, you will need to

39
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,930
raise awareness about your topic, identify a pressing problem, discuss

40
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:04,220
appropriate solutions, and outline specific steps that your audience can

41
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,750
take advance those solutions.

42
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,940
Problem, cause, solution, call to action.

43
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,710
Those are going to be many of the common elements we're going to see in

44
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,510
most of our speeches here.

45
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:19,740
So this model applies to everything from actually doing political

46
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,230
conversations to supporting your local library, because it's about thinking

47
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,980
through how to build a case for what I'm advocating.

48
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,140
So I want to talk a little bit about some goals, the stated goals for this

49
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:33,790
assignment.

50
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,720
And then I want to talk in a bit more depth about some potential topics that

51
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,100
you might choose to pursue.

52
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,670
So to begin with these goals.

53
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,920
So we'll further elaborate on these when we get into the rubric in the

54
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,680
next lecture.

55
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,160
But what are some of these goals?

56
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,310
Well, at the end of this speech, you should be able to effectively explain

57
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,960
problems and provide appropriate solutions.

58
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,030
We're going to be dealing with this sort of argumentative congruency.

59
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,610
The problem in the solution fit together.

60
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,620
You should be able to identify and discuss interesting and realistic

61
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,750
calls to action.

62
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,020
So it's not just enough to have a solution, it's about thinking what

63
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,110
would that look like if that was implemented?

64
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,970
Not only having congruency, but you should be able to highlight the

65
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,730
congruency between the various argumentative elements, so that we can

66
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,950
hear how and why this solution satisfies the root

67
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,820
cause of the problem.

68
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,305
You should be able to a range a complex case in a clear

69
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:25,640
and persuasive manner.

70
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,920
But by the same token, we're not going to lay as heavy on performing the

71
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,080
clarity of our arrangement.

72
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,880
Because if our goal is to motivate action, maybe some of that--

73
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,390
I've got two main points-- might get in the way of that.

74
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,430
You're going to need to be the best judge.

75
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:44,290
One of the things that sets this speech apart is its attention to

76
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,100
writing and delivering stylistically rich language.

77
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,510
I will come back and discuss this many times.

78
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,050
You can always choose not to have some of these stylistic elements or to

79
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,030
minimize them.

80
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,690
But we're really going to get into the realm of speech writing, and really

81
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,980
aiming more at high oratory.

82
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,890
So that really takes this speech to a different place than the informative

83
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,310
speeches was at.

84
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,930
You should be able to design and deliver a speech with appropriate

85
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:13,020
emotional and delivery variations and intensities.

86
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,850
So we're getting more oratory models here.

87
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:20,890
You should be able to have moments of clear intensity, and then maybe some

88
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,430
moments where you back away from them.

89
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,690
You should have a persuasive ethos that motivates others while not

90
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,140
creating unnecessary opposition.

91
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,500
You should be able to distinguish between key ideas

92
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,630
and elaborating detail.

93
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,580
That's very similar to what we've done in the past.

94
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,510
And of course, as always, you should be able to speak confidently with

95
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,850
appropriate rate, projection, movement, and vocal variety.

96
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,180
So we're adding to some of the goals that we've had with us since the

97
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,190
beginning of this course, and we're really taking the speech to the realm

98
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,120
of persuasion and oratory, something that is stylistically rich and

99
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,940
engaging to listen to.

100
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,420
So then what are some of the basics?

101
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:01,280
Well, just like informative speech, it's a 5 to 10-minute speech.

102
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,630
So what should you speak on?

103
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,230
Well, you can be speaking on issue awareness topics.

104
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,230
So you might speak on, again, if you're in the US, something like the

105
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,860
dangers of childhood obesity.

106
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,550
Or other places in terms of talking about making, helping people become

107
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,030
aware of issues around food safety.

108
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:22,400
You can be an advocate for a nonprofit organization.

109
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,620
Maybe more people need to know about this important

110
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,680
work of X Relief Agency.

111
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,670
So you want to make them aware of the problem that this agency is solving,

112
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,150
and why they merit your support.

113
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,050
You can indeed talk to policy change.

114
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,180
And this is very much a policy speech.

115
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,990
So the US should increase or decrease its funding to NASA, or your country

116
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,670
should do one particular policy.

117
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,140
But it doesn't have to be policy change.

118
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,260
It can be behavioral change.

119
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,570
It can be something arguing for the viewer to go out and do something.

120
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:58,080
So you should, as a viewer, support your local food chain.

121
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,020
So the growers and the farmers and the meat producers

122
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,060
in your local community.

123
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,630
And this is something people argue for.

124
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,750
They advocate for.

125
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,080
So these are some of the things that you can speak on.

126
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,890
Ultimately though, you should find a topic that interests you that works in

127
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,570
this problem solution model, because that's what we're going to be working

128
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,310
on, and allows you to be persuasive.

129
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:26,770
So in that sense, I would say avoid, please avoid, purely moral topics.

130
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:31,390
The standard the one to not do, please, is abortion.

131
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,690
You're not going to convince anyone in 10 minutes in a video to change their

132
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,220
perspective wildly on abortion.

133
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,740
That's not going to happen.

134
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,310
Also probably minimize, reduce, eliminate religious conversion.

135
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:50,230
No one's changing sides as a result of a 10 minute speech video that they

136
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,080
happen across in this class.

137
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,250
And so, we've established some community norms around civil behavior.

138
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,200
And I've been very thankful of that.

139
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,340
And I would ask you to maintain those.

140
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:06,460
This speech assign that works on certain persuasive goals.

141
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,710
And given the global nature of this, I want you to be able to tap into those

142
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:15,350
skills of persuasiveness, but also be genuine in your attempt to persuade.

143
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,250
So you're selecting topics that can work for this audience.

144
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,970
And I want to end this lecture by reaffirming the

145
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,430
goals with a quotation.

146
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,220
So there was a rhetorician by the name of Wayne Booth.

147
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,320
And he had a book called The Rhetoric of Rhetoric.

148
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,430
I think they could've maybe gotten "rhetoric" into the title once or

149
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,910
twice more, but they elected not to.

150
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,330
Probably a wise decision.

151
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,430
Anyway, he had this quotation.

152
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:46,800
And when I teach speech classes, as a teacher, we distinguish between

153
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,540
content goals, what you need to know, skill goals, what you should do, and

154
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,960
attitudinal goals.

155
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,240
I'm not really about attitudinal goals.

156
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,860
In this speech assignment and in this course, I don't really care if you

157
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,570
argue for or against a topic.

158
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,730
I don't see that as my professional role.

159
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,740
What I do care about though is that you're making good arguments.

160
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,520
That's my bailiwick.

161
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,020
That's my area.

162
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,480
So this quotation by Wayne Booth states, "The training of everyone to

163
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,950
pursue critically the defensible kinds of rhetoric is one of our best hopes

164
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,220
for saving the world--

165
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,310
or at least this or that corner of it."

166
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,600
And if there is an attitudinal goal in this class, it is

167
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,210
summarized by that quotation.

168
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:35,450
I genuinely, deeply, honestly believe that understanding how to engage in

169
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,830
rhetoric and public speaking as well as being able to analyze it critically

170
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:45,370
and effectively is one of the most essential skills that we can have.

171
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:50,390
And if I'm putting my faith somewhere, it's going to be in the training of
