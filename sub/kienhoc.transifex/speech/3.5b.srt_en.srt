00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,680
MATT MCGARRITY: So now we've talked a little bit about breathing and

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:03,230
projection.

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,260
I want to look at some other oral aspects of delivery.

4
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:11,930
Now, we're going to move through this lecture on pacing and pausing, and

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,370
then the next lecture, we're going to have on movement and gesturing.

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,600
At the end of the next lecture, you're going to be linked to a YouTube

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,130
playlist, and I've got a number of sample clips that I don't own, that's

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,030
why I'm linking to them.

9
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,170
But I've got a number of sample clips there that illustrate the concepts

10
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,110
discussed in this lecture and in the next lecture.

11
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,410
And I just wanted to let you know that's coming.

12
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:35,040
So I do want to talk about pacing and pausing, and when I talk about pacing,

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,400
what I mean here is speech rate.

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,060
So certainly people are often concerned that when they're delivering

15
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,990
their speech, they're speaking too quickly.

16
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,070
They're speaking too fast, and that's probably a reasonable concern.

17
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,730
People usually aren't worried about speaking too slow.

18
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:52,470
And so the question I'm often asked is how fast should I be speaking?

19
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:58,150
Well, I can't tell you that the average speech rate is 125 to 175

20
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:03,340
words per minute in spoken conversational American English.

21
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:03,920
That's fine.

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,040
That's an interesting factoid.

23
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,820
That doesn't necessarily help us out too much with our impromptu speeches,

24
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,460
in general.

25
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,700
Because when we're delivering a speech, it's not so much a question of

26
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,470
raw rate, as it is variable rate.

27
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:21,330
It's not so much a question of how fast or slow you're going overall, but

28
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,390
are you going slow for the lines, for the sentences, for the phrases, that

29
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,050
need more time.

30
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,190
And I don't mean simply more time for you to get it out.

31
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:37,530
I mean more time for your audience to process, Rate, pacing and pausing, can

32
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,080
help for your audience distinguish between high importance and low

33
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,160
importance ideas.

34
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,930
Now, once again, we've talked about flowing.

35
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,390
Flowing is a very useful concept not only in terms of taking notes in a

36
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,270
presentation, but as a guide for your performance.

37
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,800
So while you're doing your impromptu, either for this class, or while you're

38
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,000
doing a presentation at work, or whatever you're doing outside this

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,090
class, imagine that your audience is trying to take notes

40
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,360
on what you're saying.

41
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,080
Are you making it easy for them to take those notes?

42
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,260
Are you making it easy for them to flow?

43
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:16,060
Can they distinguish based on your talk, based on your pacing, and your

44
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,580
pitch, what is a key idea and what's a supporting idea?

45
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,710
And so pacing really helps us in this regard.

46
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:27,560
You are signaling to your audience what to write and by slowing down

47
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,680
through those key phrases, you're giving them the time to write it down.

48
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,600
So I don't know overall, how fast or slow you're going to be going.

49
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,090
I don't know how fast or slow you're going to be going at any one

50
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,650
particular part of your speech, but I can tell you, you should probably be

51
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,820
slowing down for those major points in your speech.

52
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,900
The thesis.

53
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,590
That's your important line, right?

54
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,040
You're going to want to move through that more slowly.

55
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,850
Preview of your main points.

56
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,460
That's something you would want your audience to write down, so signal to

57
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,850
them that you want them to do it and give them the time to do it.

58
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,110
When you hit each main claim, you're probably going slower, and certainly

59
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,320
that last line you're moving through more slowly.

60
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,280
Now, if you're worried about going too fast, in addition to knowing where you

61
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,040
need to go slow, if you're still worried about going too fast, one

62
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,630
thing you could be doing is working with audiences.

63
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,710
I certainly know that audiences help me slow down.

64
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,530
So when I first started recording these lectures, I don't really have an

65
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,980
active audience here, I was racing.

66
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,520
And I watched it and I felt it.

67
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,290
And so I immediately had to make changes.

68
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,330
That audience, when I've got it there, I can slow down.

69
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,260
That really underscores that communication orientation

70
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,700
we've talked about.

71
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,260
If the goal is to converse with that audience, actually sitting there and

72
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,430
talking to them is going to slow you down.

73
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,180
As is the breathing and projection stuff that we just talked about.

74
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,100
If you are really taking in those deep breaths and pushing that air out

75
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,530
forcefully, and you're projecting to be her well past the back of the room,

76
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,120
you are going to speak more slowly.

77
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,190
You just are.

78
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,820
Now, in future speeches, we'll talk about the pharyngeal space in the

79
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,240
throat and opening the mouth wider, which are other aspects that are going

80
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,930
to help you slow down a bit.

81
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,620
So speech rate is variable based on what you want the audience to follow

82
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,520
along with.

83
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,980
Pausing.

84
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:22,460
Again, pausing is based on how we're going to be processing that

85
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,450
information.

86
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,480
So once again, it's not a question of how often you pause or how

87
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,860
infrequently you pause, but where those pauses are, and what those

88
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:36,510
pauses are doing to help us process the verbal information coming at us.

89
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:41,050
10 So imagine, if you will, a phrase as an arc.

90
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,620
So I start a sentence, it's got its middle and it's clearly got it's end.

91
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,260
You can hear the pauses coming between these arcs.

92
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,220
And so that's where you want your pauses to occur.

93
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,405
The problem emerges if I start a phrase and then I--

94
00:04:57,405 --> 00:04:59,740
and then I remembered where I wanted to go, and then I raced past

95
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,410
where the pause was.

96
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,110
There was a period there.

97
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,950
You didn't hear it.

98
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,520
I flew past it.

99
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,040
Now, I stop in the middle when I kind of run out of what I'm going to say.

100
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,030
Then I figure out what I'm going to say, and I move on to the next.

101
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,890
And after I do this for a while, you won't be able to listen to it.

102
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,040
And, in truth, really what's going to happen is you're going to want to go

103
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,670
through your screen and punch me.

104
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,370
And I hate it too, OK?

105
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,650
It is horrible to listen to, and it's awful to do.

106
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,180
So you want to be thinking about how can I give shape to this?

107
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,830
I want to make sure that the pause is coming at the end of the phrase.

108
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,740
From the stance of a listener and a speaker, I'm delivering to you a

109
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,400
phrase in its package.

110
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,070
I'm handing you this idea.

111
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,180
You can take it and process it.

112
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,980
If I put the pause in the middle, I'm breaking that concept, that phrase,

113
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,260
that utterance, in half and I'm ripping it in half and I'm giving you

114
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,000
both halves.

115
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,320
You have to stitch it together in order to process it.

116
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,970
So make life easier for your audience.

117
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,050
Put those pauses at the ends of phrases.

118
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,670
Now, that's easier said than done.

119
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,610
How does this map onto actual performance?

120
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,280
Well, despite what I just said about not worrying too much about going fast

121
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,630
or slow, if you slow down, you're giving yourself a little bit more time

122
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:13,490
to figure out and feel the end of that phrase.

123
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,070
By the same token, sit longer in those pauses.

124
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,250
Give yourself a little bit more time to sense what the shape

125
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,730
of that pause is.

126
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:27,290
So pacing and pausing are not simply a question of presence and absence.

127
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:32,020
Pacing and pausing are matters of how they're working in tandem to clarify

128
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,430
what you're saying for your audience, and how they're working in tandem with

129
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,600
how your audience is going to experience your talk as a group of

130
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,110
listeners trying to process these discrete phrases.

131
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,830
Now, in the next lecture, we're going to start talking about gestures and

132
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,590
movement, so the physical things that you can be doing to help clarity.

133
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,030
And then, at the end of that lecture, we're going to start analyzing some of

134
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,280
the sample YouTube clips.

135
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,381
