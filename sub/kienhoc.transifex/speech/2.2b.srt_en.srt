00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,860
Having spent a little bit of time sort-of big-picturing this assignment,

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,029
I want to go into more depth by talking through the evaluative rubric.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:12,080
So why would I start off by talking about the evaluation rubric?

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,660
Well because I think rubrics allow us to analyze

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,680
specific things in a speech.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,130
So certainly, speeches are more than the sum of their parts.

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,670
But an understanding of these individual parts can make you a

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,220
stronger speaker.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,490
So I just kind of want to walk through this evaluation rubric and in so

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,970
doing-- kind of give you a better sense for what these speeches are

11
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,890
going to be like and what you, as a speaker, are going to get out of this

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,960
experience.

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,240
So to begin with, I'm looking at invention.

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,670
And one of the concerns I have in invention are the main points.

15
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,000
So you can see--

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,790
I'm interested in-- does the speaker support the thesis with appropriate

17
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,860
main points?

18
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,430
Does the speaker explain how the main point supported the thesis clearly and

19
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,380
effectively?

20
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,200
So are the main points good on their own?

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,880
And is the speaker doing their job in explaining the relationship between

22
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,630
the main points and the thesis?

23
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,650
So it's one invention category.

24
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,410
Another invention category would be the support--

25
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,330
included appropriate and effective evidence for both main points and

26
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,400
explained how the evidence supported the main points clearly and

27
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,220
effectively.

28
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,260
So once again-- sort of presence and explanation.

29
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,770
Did you have good evidence?

30
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,090
And did you explain the evidence well?

31
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,330
It gets us to sort of both sides of the coin-- preparation as well as

32
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,570
performance.

33
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,030
Then we get into arrangement.

34
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,740
It's a short speech, but here's where we can really refine some basic

35
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,780
arrangement habits that I hope you'll take to other speaking encounters.

36
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,280
So in arrangement--

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,890
does the speaker preview the speech clearly and effectively?

38
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,390
The speaker transitioned between the speech's main parts clearly and

39
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,980
effectively, provided internal structure clearly and effectively, and

40
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,130
review the speech clearly and effectively, and

41
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,660
provided a sense of closure.

42
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,220
So those arrangements categories are--

43
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,490
do we kind of have a good opening where I know where you're going.

44
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,820
Can I really suss out those two main points?

45
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,000
Within each main point I've kind of got a sense for what you're arguing

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,130
and what the pieces of support are.

47
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,590
And then at the end are you pulling it all together?

48
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,760
So we've got invention, arrangement, and delivery.

49
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:18,250
Now we'll increase the amount of time and critical attention we devote to

50
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,040
delivery in the future speeches.

51
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,310
In this first impromptu speech, I'm concerned with--

52
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,630
does a speaker appear confident?

53
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:29,760
Does the speaker use projection effectively and appropriately?

54
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,130
Does the speaker gesture and move effectively and appropriately for the

55
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,770
speech and for the online setting?

56
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,470
So that's kind of what that rubric aims at.

57
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,340
Now I want you to notice that everything on that rubric is something

58
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,060
we talk about in class.

59
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,470
Now when I teach live classes-- when I'm actually assigning a grade--

60
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,850
and that's not the case here-- but when I'm actually assigning a grade, I

61
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,690
want to make sure I'm never holding a student accountable to something I

62
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,710
didn't talk about as an instructor.

63
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:05,490
So that rubric really is trying to get at those key skills and be very clear

64
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,660
about how I'm going to be evaluating them.

65
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,360
So this allows us to sort of divide our time in the unit.

66
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,080
So you'll notice under main points-- well we spend a lecture talking about

67
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,510
coming up with main points and then talking about how to relate those main

68
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,030
points back to the thesis.

69
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,440
So too with evidence.

70
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,260
So too with all the arrangement things.

71
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,680
So I like thinking through speech instruction through the lens of a

72
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,610
rubric because it allows us to focus on perfecting very specific skills--

73
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,640
while at the same time seeing how those skills all work together in an

74
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,550
excellent impromptu speech.

75
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,520
So from this point on, you can use this rubric as a course guide.

76
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:42,970
Right?

77
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,040
You could basically follow along with that rubric and see how we're picking

78
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,120
up and responding to those various elements in the future lectures.

79
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,730
Certainly I would like you to use that rubric as a performance guide.

80
00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:00,210
So as you're practicing look to those criteria and see how you're matching

81
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,670
up in terms of those gauges--

82
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,390
are you hitting all those points?

83
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:10,520
The payoff of a clear rubric is really evident when it comes to posting

84
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,730
speeches online.

85
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:17,250
So if you post speeches to the online platform, we use that rubric to

86
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,860
improve the quality and the depth of the peer feedback

87
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,580
you give and receive.

88
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,580
And I really do think there's something that can really be gained by

89
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,590
giving good feedback.

90
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,380
You can become a better speaker by having a more

91
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,360
critical approach to speeches.

92
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,420
So that's the basic rationale behind the rubric.

93
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,850
And hopefully that gives you an even better sense of what this impromptu

94
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,310
speech is going to be about.

95
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,624
