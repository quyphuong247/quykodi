00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,420
MATT MCGARRITY: In the last lecture, I asked you to think through an issue

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,080
that you're working on in terms of matters of fact, values and policy.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,440
Remember, we're in this realm of trying to figure out whether or not we

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,720
need to have a counter argument, and if so, what issues

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,700
are our clash points.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,720
And now, we're dealing with, well, once you've figured out those clash

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,000
points, how's a good way to respond in a way that's still going to be

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,100
persuasive.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,930
So as we're working through this, one thing that will come up is you realize

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,600
not all points merit attention.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,840
You have to distinguish between really important and less

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,290
important clash points.

13
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,480
Now, certainly, I don't think that many of your major clash points can be

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,650
ducked or avoided.

15
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:44,000
So here in Seattle, there was an issue that came up a couple of times,

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,540
finally passed, was rescinded, past again.

17
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,120
And it was a ban on plastic bags, recyclable plastic

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,880
bags at grocery stores.

19
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,690
So the issue was, those in favor of the bag ban said, there's so much

20
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,230
recyclable waste being generated by grocery stores in particular.

21
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,780
People go to the grocery store, they buy their groceries, and they're put

22
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,790
in these thin plastic bags.

23
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,640
So an average family of four is bringing home, from a weekly grocery

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,130
store trip, 10 to 15 recyclable bags.

25
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,410
Those in favor of the bill said, well, that's recyclable waste.

26
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,050
That's creating garbage.

27
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,820
It's bad for the environment, and it's something we can easily avoid.

28
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,040
If we ban bags, plastic bags, and people can bring recyclable bags, they

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,240
can bring their canvas bags to the grocery store.

30
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,270
So this was debated a number of times here in Seattle.

31
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,570
Now, opponents of the bag ban said that the bill wouldn't make much of a

32
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,070
difference to recyclable waste.

33
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:44,930
This was striking at the very core of the argument for the bag ban.

34
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,560
And it had sort of seeped into popular talk around the ban.

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,310
So an advocate for the bill, if they were going to be persuasive to those

36
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,800
who disagreed, or if they were going to be persuasive to those who didn't

37
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,860
really know too much about the bag ban, they had to explain how it would

38
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,210
significantly reduce recyclable waste.

39
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,710
This wasn't something that couldn't be ducked.

40
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,110
They couldn't just plug their ears up and hope for the best.

41
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,880
That's something that had to be addressed.

42
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:15,900
So what I want to talk about is four basic ideas for responding to counter

43
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,440
arguments without making things worse.

44
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,030
You want to be persuasive.

45
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,825
You want to entice people to agree with you, not beat them up.

46
00:02:23,825 --> 00:02:25,750
You're not going to punch them in the face, and hope that

47
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,030
they agree with you.

48
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,300
That's not what rhetoric does.

49
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,480
We're not in that realm.

50
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,210
We're trying to convince, persuade, draw them to our side.

51
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,390
You don't get that by saying, the reason you should agree with me is

52
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,500
because you're an idiot, and you would understand that were you not an idiot.

53
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,290
Catch-22.

54
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,280
No one's going to agree with you if you're doing that.

55
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,250
So you want to find a way of being able to address their concerns in a

56
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,750
way that is inviting.

57
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,430
So part of your ethos as a speaker, but it's also part of strategy in

58
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,820
figuring out how you're putting that speech together because you're

59
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,500
distinguishing between what do I have to include in order to be persuasive

60
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,360
for this audience, and what can I avoid this time around?

61
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,930
So the first thing I want to suggest is look for an easy win.

62
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,140
Introduce new evidence that maybe that audience is unfamiliar with or

63
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,280
challenge existing preconceptions.

64
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,630
So a number of years ago, I had someone who was arguing for increased

65
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,400
support for nuclear energy here in the US.

66
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,630
Now, this is before Fukushima, so this speech would have to very much be

67
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,730
different now.

68
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,190
But she was arguing this in front of an American audience.

69
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,950
And the issue was many Americans have this notion, have a fear of nuclear

70
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,290
energy because of the threat of a meltdown.

71
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:40,010
And so what she was doing was trying to bring in new evidence that said,

72
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:45,830
ah, your fear about a meltdown is based on older technology at nuclear

73
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,490
energy plants.

74
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,720
This new pebble technology actually significantly reduces

75
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,920
the threat of a meltdown.

76
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,990
So the audience had a notion about what was bad about nuclear energy, and

77
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,580
she was introducing new evidence to say, ah, that's

78
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,270
actually no longer accurate.

79
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,250
Not calling them foolish, but introducing new evidence and trying to

80
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,095
be persuasive in that way.

81
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:06,710
A second thing you might consider doing as you find these

82
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,790
stasis points in your--

83
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:13,550
clash points in your debates is think about showing the unintended

84
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,660
consequences of the other position.

85
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,360
Remember when we talked about stock issues, we talked about social and

86
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,450
material consequences, so you an sort of tap into that a little bit as a

87
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,090
persuasive strategy.

88
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,600
Again, here in the state of Washington, we had a debate over a

89
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,380
public smoking ban, so the banning of smoking in public places, like bars

90
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,570
and restaurants.

91
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:38,460
So people are for it or against it for various reasons, but one of the

92
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,470
aspects of the bill was there was a 25 foot barrier.

93
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,970
So not only could you not smoke inside of a restaurant, but you couldn't

94
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,870
smoke 25 feet from the entrance of a restaurant.

95
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,500
So one of the compelling arguments at the time said, you should vote against

96
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,070
this bill, and didn't try to say, oh, smoking is not bad for your health,

97
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,610
or, oh, it's totally fine to smoke, not challenging that.

98
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,350
Saying I agree with that, but the reason you should vote against this

99
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:08,440
bill is because this 25-foot rule is not going to work.

100
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,100
Why?

101
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,920
If you're downtown Seattle and you have to go 25 feet from the entrance

102
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,980
of a restaurant to smoke, you're in the middle of the street.

103
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,750
So you're weighing sort of short-term consequences of being hit by a car

104
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,840
against the long-term health consequences of smoking.

105
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,350
And they said, well, also how are you going to enforce this?

106
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,980
Are cops walking around with a 25-foot ruler?

107
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,760
So the argument was saying here's a consequence of this bill, and here's a

108
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,820
reason to vote against the larger bill without taking into--

109
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,800
not trying to debate whether or not smoking was good or bad.

110
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,120
Third thing that you might consider is containing an argument

111
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,800
within a larger concern.

112
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,630
And I'm going to show a clip here.

113
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:54,000
Seattle, like a number of cities in the US, has laws pertaining to wearing

114
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,910
bike helmets.

115
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,660
if you're on a bike, you have to wear a helmet.

116
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,920
And I'm going to show a clip.

117
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,940
This is from our then Seattle mayor, Greg Nickels, and this

118
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,950
is a call-in show.

119
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,680
So he's being asked some questions.

120
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,760
I've edited it so you see the bike messenger basically challenging the

121
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,540
validity of helmet laws, and I want you to listen to how the mayor

122
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,060
responds to that.

123
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,430
So there is a clash point here, but listen to how the mayor tries to be

124
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,000
persuasive, if not to that bike messenger, then certainly to others

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,290
who might question the validity of helmet laws.

126
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,550
So let's go ahead and take a look at that now.

127
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,510
CR DOUGLAS: Back to the streets of Seattle in Westlake Plaza.

128
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,760
We took our cameras there earlier this week to see what was on people's

129
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,740
minds, and here's what we learned.

130
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,430
SPEAKER 1: Why is there a helmet law?

131
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,170
Like, I think it's pretty much my head, and what I do with my own head

132
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,230
is my problem, not the rest of everybody else's.

133
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:48,940
CR DOUGLAS: When the bike messenger who talks about the helmet law, is

134
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,795
that something that should just be his concern or should it

135
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:51,400
be everyone's concern?

136
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,990
GREG NICKELS: That is his head, but if he hurts himself and becomes disabled,

137
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,060
then it becomes all of our responsibility.

138
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,430
He ends up at Harborview for months and months and years, being paid for

139
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,350
by public tax dollars.

140
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,880
So it is kind of a shared responsibility, and the King County

141
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,930
Board of Health appropriately, I believe, has said

142
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,710
that helmets are required.

143
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:21,070
And I'm sorry if it inconveniences him in his profession, but frankly, it

144
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:28,090
would inconvenience him a lot more if he falls and his brain is damaged.

145
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,900
And then it hurts the taxpayers and the rest of us as well.

146
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,560
MATT MCGARRITY: So in that clip, he doesn't challenge the

147
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,020
assertion, it's my head.

148
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,580
He makes a very important concession there.

149
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,340
That is his head. he's not saying, no, that is now common property.

150
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,450
Everybody's head is ours.

151
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,465
But rather he's saying, no, I understand why you

152
00:07:47,465 --> 00:07:48,700
would feel that way.

153
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,560
The bike messenger is making an assertion of private right, of

154
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,530
individual right, and the mayor is responding by saying there are more

155
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,770
things at issue here.

156
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:01,330
And it is a collective concern because we're talking about

157
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,580
potential taxpayer expense.

158
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:08,180
So he's responding to an individual concern with a larger social concern.

159
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,880
All right, so you've got a response there, but it's one that tries to

160
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,510
address an individual one with a larger concern, with some

161
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,820
larger value at play.

162
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,300
We can come back to that later under style, because you hear how he's just

163
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,560
looping in that language, that collective language, taxpayer expense,

164
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,910
social responsibility, so on and so forth.

165
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,820
But it's a way of responding to that argument.

166
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,500
The final thing just to be thinking about in terms of crafting your

167
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,130
counter-responses, your counter-arguments, is just addressing

168
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,809
cost and benefits.

169
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,440
It's real easy to sort through.

170
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,080
If you're in favor of something, the costs are acceptable, and the benefits

171
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,040
are significant.

172
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,250
If you're opposed to something, the costs are substantial, and there are

173
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,550
very few benefits.

174
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:55,450
So you've got this sort of balancing back and forth, and that's something

175
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,660
you can build evidence around.

176
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,680
Say, well, there are some benefits, but they're not as significant as the

177
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,210
other side would have you believe.

178
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:06,500
Or the other side has talked about the cost, but I think the true costs are

179
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,840
much more significant.

180
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,870
So it's just another way of thinking around the issue, thinking of coming

181
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,650
up with a counter-argument that's not necessarily aggressive or hostile.

182
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,950
So ultimately, you have to be the judge as to whether motivating your

183
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,120
audience actually requires you to deal with some counter-arguments.

184
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,990
And this judgment is reach by balancing a persuasive goal against

185
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,290
the target audience that you're dealing with.

186
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,850
And I'd remind you to go back to that chart and think where are

187
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,950
you along that line?

188
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,480
What is your target audience?

189
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,540
Are they immediately going to disagree with you, be sort of neutral, or

190
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,970
strongly agree with you?

191
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,520
And so thinking in that way, do you actually need to address

192
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,680
counter-arguments?

193
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,810
So having spent some time talking about counter-arguments, in the next

194
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,730
lecture, we're going to talk about, well, what do you do to finally

195
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,220
motivate that audience?

196
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,330
So we're going to be talking to calls to action.

197
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,580
