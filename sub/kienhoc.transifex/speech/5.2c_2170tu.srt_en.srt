MATT MCGARRITY: Having discussed some general threads of thought, or coming up with

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,720
very broad ideas, I now want to shift to using arrangement as a way of

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,200
prompting invention.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,970
And invention and arrangements have sort of an interesting relationship.

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,180
Generally, we kind of talk about thinking through arrangement before we

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,240
get to deep in--

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,110
thinking through invention before we get too deep into arrangement.

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,590
As I said last time, I don't want to put the cart before the horse here,

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,040
but I really do think that arrangement can help invention.

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,770
And it can help you think through a subject for an audience and see and

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,160
identify where you need to help the audience maybe a little bit more or

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,520
maybe a little bit less.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,360
And it just gives you a sense of what this would look like.

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,370
What this would look like when test run.

15
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:45,010
And so arrangement allows you to sort of dial in what you want to speak to.

16
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,590
So this kind of bridges the gap between invention and arrangement.

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,670
This is useful for arrangement, but what I'm going to talk about, I think,

18
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,570
is also very useful for helping you figure out what you want to speak on.

19
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,500
So in this lecture, I want to talk about some very general, very broad

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,880
patterns of arrangements.

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:07,030
And then I want to talk to some sort of genre specific ones, because the

22
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,180
more detailed you get, you're finding more models of imitation and you're

23
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,940
expanding your speech repertoire.

24
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,450
And so you're going to be better when it comes to judging which one to use

25
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,780
and which one not to use.

26
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,270
So in terms of general patterns, you pick up any book on public speaking in

27
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,140
the past 100 years and your probably going to find some of these general

28
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,850
patterns of public speaking.

29
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,600
And there are traces of these through time.

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,950
So we can talk about organizing the speech chronologically.

31
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:39,410
So let's say at your work you need to give a project update to the rest of

32
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:44,880
the office, or the division, and basically, it's just I want to talk a

33
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,120
little bit about what our team was assigned to do, some of this stuff we

34
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,810
did, where we are now, where we're going to be going in the next three

35
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:54,970
months, right?

36
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:58,900
So you're organizing the speech chronologically.

37
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,050
What we're getting is the narrative of your product, the

38
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,560
narrative of your teamwork.

39
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,000
You can actually just straight up organize the speech as a narrative.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,140
So if you watch any show that's a travelogue, some of those shows, if

41
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,440
they're filmed, they're going to be spatially organized, and a speech can

42
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,660
be spatially organized.

43
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,260
Here are the key features.

44
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,880
But they're also sometimes organized as narratives.

45
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,850
I landed and then we went to the hotel and had a delightful brunch and the

46
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,200
bread and breakfast was super, and so on and so forth.

47
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,480
So it's going to be the narrative of that author, the

48
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,530
narrative of that speaker.

49
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,520
As I mentioned spatial.

50
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,760
Spatial is another clearly obvious way of organizing information if you're

51
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,440
talking about features that exist in three-dimensional space,

52
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,970
two-dimensional space, as well, I suppose.

53
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:55,250
So let's say you were doing a speech on the geographic features of Mars,

54
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,590
and you're like, if you were standing on the top of Olympus Mons, to your

55
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,920
right, you would see this.

56
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,830
In front of you, you would see this, and then far beyond you on the left,

57
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,710
you would see that.

58
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,920
Where each one of those would be an interesting feature.

59
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,190
So I mean that makes sense that you could organize your

60
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,490
presentation in that way.

61
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:15,600
So chronological, narrative, spatial, these are very broad ways of thinking

62
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,940
about how you might choose to organize that information.

63
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,630
But what I'd like to do is give you a couple of very specific patterns, not

64
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:27,320
because these are only useful for the genres that I'm indicating, but

65
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,570
because understanding how you might make a specific choice is helpful.

66
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,990
So I've mentioned a couple of times, I run a speeching center.

67
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,410
We work on mispronouncing things.

68
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,310
We're at the forefront of our field.

69
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,320
I run a speaking center where people tutor speakers.

70
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,660
So they come in, they provide one-on-one feedback, we record them.

71
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,340
It's a nice sort of consulting service.

72
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,170
Students are doing it for students.

73
00:03:54,170 --> 00:04:00,550
And what the tutors get out of it is so much when it comes to developing

74
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,740
their speech ability.

75
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:06,000
Because they are now seeing all sorts of different types of arrangement

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,880
pattern, all sorts of different types of evidence use.

77
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,940
Much more than they would see if they themselves just did it.

78
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,800
So I want to move through some very specific responses to genre concerns,

79
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,680
so that it might help you figure out what you would want to do.

80
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,650
Or you might get an idea for one and combine it with an idea from another.

81
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,720
All of these are just potential things that you can use in

82
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,900
arranging your speech.

83
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,450
The goal here is clarity and the speech should make sense, but here are

84
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,760
some possible things.

85
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,830
So I know a number of people in the class, and I know in general, people

86
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,440
are concerned with presenting research.

87
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,430
This is a key issue for scientists, and I will spend time working with

88
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,260
scientists.

89
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,860
And one way of organizing that presentation, this would certainly be

90
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,930
the case if you're at a conference, is organizing the presentation almost as

91
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,940
you would organize a scientific research paper.

92
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,640
So you start off with a general orientation, you maybe talk about your

93
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,620
recent work that your lab does, or you do.

94
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,990
Then you would walk us through the procedure, the setup of your study.

95
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,590
Get us into the findings, talk us through some of the discussion points

96
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,630
associated with those findings, walk us through a couple of the

97
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,540
implications, and then wrap up.

98
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,020
OK, that makes sense.

99
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:20,570
That's borrowing the research paper format and replicating

100
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,050
it in a speech form.

101
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,050
You don't want to read the exact same thing, but these are important things

102
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,260
for other scientists to know.

103
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,140
How did you set up your study?

104
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,845
I want to know the findings before I want to hear your discussion.

105
00:05:30,845 --> 00:05:34,230
Now that makes sense for an audience of other experts.

106
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,470
Let's say you're a scientist, or a researcher, and you're presenting your

107
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,570
findings for a lay public, or sometimes, for a

108
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,330
local government, right?

109
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,880
They want to know-- if they're going to make policy decisions, they want to

110
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,000
know about your research and its implications.

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,800
Then you're probably not walking them through the research study, but you

112
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,350
would go through and say, OK, introduction.

113
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:57,260
Here's my area of research, the general field, what I'm working on.

114
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,640
Here's some of the recent discoveries and then here are the implications.

115
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,260
Because if they're making policy, those implications are what they're

116
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:04,880
concerned with.

117
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,760
They want to know how you got there, but those implications are the

118
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,420
deliverable.

119
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,620
That's what they're interested in.

120
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,450
So you would work through the exact same information in two very different

121
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,950
sort of arrangement patterns.

122
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,925
If you are in sales and you are engaging in product description, so

123
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:25,230
you're talking to your client, and you're just giving them an update on

124
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,720
how this product is different from the one that you had two years ago.

125
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,610
So maybe you would talk about, well, here are some of the remaining

126
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,130
functions from the old version, and here's some new features.

127
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,400
Pretty straightforward.

128
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,530
Well, you could even break that second point into two divisions.

129
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,290
If there's a whole bunch of new features, well, you don't want to have

130
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,170
one point that's massively long, has 18 sub points, so be thinking about,

131
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,400
well, how can I break that apart?

132
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,350
Maybe you say, here's some of the remaining features, here are some of

133
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,380
the new hardware features, three, however many.

134
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,250
Here's some of the new software features.

135
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,860
So you took that second point, and you just broke it apart based on division.

136
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,160
It's topical ordering.

137
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,310
Certainly, there are lots of times when you need to explain new policy.

138
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,420
In education, we need to do this a lot.

139
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,230
I do policy here as well, and so I often have to make new policy and then

140
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,860
explain that new policy, and this is not an uncommon workplace event.

141
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,210
So how would you go about doing that?

142
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,970
Well, you could maybe spend a point talking about, well, here's why we

143
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,090
need the policy.

144
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,570
And then go through, well, so here's what's new about the policy.

145
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:31,140
So here's our need, here are the changes that are going to be made,

146
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,920
here's how our new policy solves the problems that we laid out.

147
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,170
We'll come back to this under the issue of argument congruency in the

148
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,560
persuasive speech.

149
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,430
It would be really helpful if you could say, there was a need and our

150
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,870
new policy solves that need and really showing the interrelationship between

151
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,980
need and solution, problem and solution.

152
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,420
So you could say, well, here's a need.

153
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,380
Here's what the new policy is, here's how the new policy solves for that

154
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,840
need, and here's what we need to do next in terms of implementation of

155
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,090
that policy.

156
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,770
And also in those exact same settings, you might find yourself giving a

157
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:05,930
budget update.

158
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,920
So here's what the previous budget was, here were the happy things, here

159
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,530
were these frowny face things, here's our current income, here's our current

160
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,130
expenditures, and here are our existing areas of concern, or things

161
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,080
we need to figure out.

162
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,890
Here are our potential frowny faces.

163
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,700
If you're teaching, you are doing informative speaking

164
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,970
each and every day.

165
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,930
And so often, we'll look at this as saying, OK, what's the chunk that

166
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:28,260
you're doing?

167
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,100
What's the specific issue that you're explaining?

168
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,799
So you want to explain a concept, then maybe show an example of the concept,

169
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,450
and then evaluate something, maybe evaluate the example, in terms of the

170
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,559
concept that you introduced.

171
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,409
That's kind of got a nice coherency, it's a nice chunk.

172
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:45,680
Well, that makes sense as a stand-alone lesson.

173
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,980
If you're teaching an hour long class, usually it's an introduction, three of

174
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,440
those discrete chunks and a conclusion.

175
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,950
Opening, here's what we're talking about today, and

176
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,010
here's why it matters.

177
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:01,140
Concept one, explanation, example, some sort of activity or application.

178
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,110
Concept two, run.

179
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,540
Concept three, wash and repeat as often as necessary, and then you wrap

180
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,370
it up and tie it to the next class.

181
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,250
So that's a way of organizing even an hour, where probably each one of those

182
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,360
points varies in length, but they're going to be somewhere between 10 and

183
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,320
15 minutes, opening and conclusion's going to be less.

184
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,960
So those are just some potential ways of organizing a informative speech, an

185
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,140
informative speech.

186
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,480
These are just guides.

187
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,030
Everything that you come up with is going to need tailoring for your

188
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,910
specific topic, for you as a speaker, and for your audience.

189
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:40,430
And this issue of tailoring, of dialing it in, of getting the fit just

190
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,590
right, is going to be the subject of our next discussion,

191
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,940
our next video lecture.

192
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,460
Remember, this week is about moving from the general idea to

193
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,790
the specific outline.

194
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,650
And so we're kind of getting in the middle of that, and what I would like

195
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,600
you to do now, at the end of this lecture, before you move on to the

196
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,210
next one, I want you to draft up an outline of your key points.

197
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,880
We've been talking about coming up with ideas, and the main points, and

198
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,020
arranging those main points, do that now.

199
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,290
And this can be a presentation that you're going to give at the end of the

200
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,500
week, or next month, or the next presentation that you have to give

201
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,700
that's informative in scope.

202
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,475
What a great opportunity to spend a little time in advance thinking about

203
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:20,890
it, planning it out.

204
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:25,790
This is what this class should be, providing some type of advice for the

205
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,260
very types of speeches you're finding yourself delivering

206
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,390
each and every day.

207
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,630
You could also use this as the opportunity to, if you're going to

208
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,780
upload an informative speech, get to work on that.

209
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,440
Map out that informative speech for this class.

210
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:44,510
But what I want you to do now is, on your computer, on your phone, on a

211
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,770
sheet of paper--

212
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,360
I realized a couple weeks ago all the examples I gave were on the bus.

213
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,200
I assumed everybody in this class was on a bus at the same time.

214
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,020
I'm assuming that's no longer the case anymore, but I just want you to sit

215
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,020
down and draft out, what are my main points?

216
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,360
Maybe even thinking about what are the subpoints?

217
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,730
What are the main chunks of my presentation?

218
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,620
Think back to the goals for this.

219
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,610
Think back to what are the audience concerns?

220
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,060
What don't they understand?

221
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:13,440
And just start mapping out that informative response to the questions

222
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,710
that your audience may have.

223
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,960
