00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:04,080
MATT McGARRITY: Having covered status quo and burden of proof, I want to

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,520
start talking about some ideas for how you can develop your persuasive

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,870
arguments, how you can start thinking through your burden of proof, coming

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,270
up with a good response to that burden of proof.

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:20,910
So if we're talking about altering the status quo, we can identify some

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,890
common argumentative elements.

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,230
And these common argumentative elements are often referred to as the

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,510
stock issues.

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,650
"Stock" here simply means common.

10
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,430
Like in movies we say there's certain stock footage, scenes that appear

11
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,790
again and again in movies.

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,800
We would say stock issues.

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,530
These are issues that pop up again and again in a number of different

14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,140
argumentative encounters.

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,870
So I want you to think about these stock issues as a lens for looking at

16
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,990
your case and inventing arguments.

17
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,180
So what are they?

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,930
Stock issues can be defined various ways, but I like this way.

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,110
I think this is perhaps one of the more useful ones.

20
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,410
Ill, blame, cure, and consequence.

21
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,000
OK, there's a medical metaphor here, right?

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,850
Ill, blame, cure, and consequence.

23
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,200
And how I'm identifying each one of these affects the overall nature of

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,030
the argument.

25
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,860
For example, let's say ill.

26
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,800
There's something wrong.

27
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,400
Ill, I have a headache.

28
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,490
Oh, I've got a headache.

29
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,650
That's an ill.

30
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,840
So if I'm going to remedy that headache, I've got

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,090
to figure out blame.

32
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,200
What's causing that headache?

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,410
Oh, I've got a headache.

34
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,420
Oh it's because I didn't drink enough water.

35
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,640
I'm dehydrated.

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,390
Cure?

37
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,040
Well, that's a pretty easy one.

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,910
Give me a tap.

39
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm thirsty.

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,200
So then I drink the water.

41
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,250
Consequences, what's going to happen as a result of that cure?

42
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,090
I will probably have to go to the bathroom a little bit more, but

43
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,090
acceptable, because my headache's gone.

44
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,180
All right, same thing, ill.

45
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,780
Oh, I have a headache.

46
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,890
Blame, I was wasted last night.

47
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,900
You know, I drank way too much.

48
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,340
Cure?

49
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,830
I should probably have an aspirin.

50
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:02,570
Consequence, I will rethink my future policy for this evening's plans and

51
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,990
how I am to consume.

52
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:05,710
So that's another way.

53
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,870
Or you could say, ill, I have a headache.

54
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,789
Blame, I'm dehydrated.

55
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:12,370
Cure, I will saw my own head off.

56
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,510
That has eliminated the ill.

57
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,180
Consequences, I will be dead.

58
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,550
That's not a consequence I'm willing to bear for the cost of that headache.

59
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,220
OK, so ill, blame, cure, and consequence all work together.

60
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,880
And if you change one element, it changes the chemistry

61
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,190
of the other ones.

62
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,990
So I want to move through each one of these bit by bit.

63
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,540
So let's start with ill.

64
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,840
When we're talking about ill, we're talking about what's the

65
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,700
root problem here.

66
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,300
What's wrong?

67
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,600
If you're arguing for a change to the status quo, there had better be a

68
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,940
reason for a change.

69
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,730
Ill allows us to think very formally about what that reason it.

70
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,340
And we can break it into smaller components.

71
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,090
We can think about significance and harms.

72
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,260
How big is the problem, how bad is the problem?

73
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,560
Quantitatively, looking at ill quantitatively or qualitatively.

74
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,470
And so you want to make sure that if you're making the case in that

75
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,910
specific issue, you're able to talk about both significance and harms.

76
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,430
And this doesn't matter what topic you're on, OK?

77
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,610
So if you're talking out the increase of childhood obesity in the United

78
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,120
States, yeah, you can talk about significance.

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,040
Give me raw figures, statistics about the increase in childhood obesity.

80
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
And give me harms.

81
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,030
What's it doing to us as a nation?

82
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,110
What's it doing to those individual children?

83
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,900
OK, that makes sense.

84
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,500
You're proving ill in that case.

85
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,780
Now let's say it was, I think people should be going to

86
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,100
farmers markets more.

87
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,350
I think we should be going to the Ballard Farmers Market more.

88
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,440
That's my neighborhood in Seattle.

89
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,620
OK, that's a much smaller issue then all of childhood obesity.

90
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,630
But I can still think through it in terms of significance and harms.

91
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,310
Significance?

92
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:53,450
Well, there's been a flattening out of attendance at the

93
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,340
Ballard Farmers Market.

94
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,690
And I don't know if this is the case.

95
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,000
It seems to be still quite active.

96
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,620
But I can talk about it in terms of raw numbers and harms.

97
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,320
Well, what's it doing?

98
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,180
Well, we're losing a lot of support for local growers.

99
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,760
So that's a much smaller issue, but I can still run through it in terms of

100
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,920
significance and harms.

101
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,420
If I'm going to say we need to change something, I've got to prove ill.

102
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,930
I've got to prove that there's a reason that we need to make a change.

103
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,190
Now, you want to make sure you've got both significance and harms if you're

104
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,600
going to prove ill.

105
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,240
So you could say, all right.

106
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,000


107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,080
Globally--

108
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,255
globally--

109
00:04:31,255 --> 00:04:39,290
in this day and age, there are an estimated 50 million people, 50

110
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:44,300
million people, that suffer from the debilitating pain and

111
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,520
anguish of hang nails.

112
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,840
OK, significant?

113
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,380
Yes.

114
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:48,890
Harmful?

115
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,810
Not so much.

116
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,260
You wasted my time with a buildup for hang nails?

117
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,610
Get a pair of clippers.

118
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,310
What the heck is wrong with you?

119
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,830
So you want to have both.

120
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,110
You could have the flip side.

121
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,590
Globally, in this day and age, can you believe it?

122
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,990
It's sad but true.

123
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:13,960
There are up to 10 people annually killed by exploding milk cartons.

124
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,580
Huh?

125
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,490
Globally, 10?

126
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,510
I'll take my chances.

127
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,190
I've got a better chance of that happening.

128
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,360
I can win the lottery more than likely than that, out of

129
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,400
all the people around.

130
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,810
So that's harmful for those 10.

131
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,260
I don't to be one of those 10 who gets killed by an exploding milk carton.

132
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,780
I don't think that happens.

133
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,920
That's a hypothetical.

134
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,330
But you know, I want to make sure I can prove both significance and harms

135
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,120
for my issue if I'm going to demonstrate ill.

136
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,450
So we've got ill.

137
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,670
But that's not enough.

138
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,440
We want to think about blame.

139
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,810
OK, we've got this problem, but then thinking in terms of what's preventing

140
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,240
the status quo from solving that ill?

141
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,760
If the ill is as bad as I just said it was, OK, if this is a legitimate

142
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,660
problem, why has no one else fixed it yet?

143
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,320
We can think through blame in terms of inherency.

144
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,970
What's preventing the solution from taking place?

145
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,860
Well, we could say structural inherency.

146
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,340
There's a formal block.

147
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,650
There's something in the structure that has prevented us from solving

148
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,630
this problem.

149
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,540
Typically, we would talk about this as laws, right?

150
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:22,330
So when people were arguing for same-sex marriage here in the state of

151
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,890
Washington, they were saying, look.

152
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,460
Right now, we've got two different categories of marriage.

153
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,470
We can't get married because of a law.

154
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,630
So it was totally a structural inherency that was

155
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,100
preventing same-sex marriage.

156
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,730
So structural inherency is one potential.

157
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,340
The other one might be attitudinal inherency, an informal block.

158
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,990
Maybe a preconception or

159
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,620
misunderstanding, or lack of knowledge.

160
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,320
Oh, no one's going to the farmers market.

161
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,750
Why not?

162
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,030
They don't know about it.

163
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,380
Oh, well that's the problem then, it seems.

164
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,080
That's an attitudinal inherency.

165
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,200
They're just unaware of it.

166
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,060
Structural inherently, attitudinal inherently.

167
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,110
Or we can talk about a gap inherency.

168
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,750
So lots of times, there's already solutions in place.

169
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,590
But they're not doing enough to solve the ill.

170
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:10,890
OK, so we've already got a law or a practice in place, but it's

171
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,680
insufficient.

172
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,890
So once again, let's go back to that farmers market analogy.

173
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:18,330
Let's say, oh, we don't have enough attendance at farmers market.

174
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:23,380
There is an advertisement campaign in place, but not a very good one.

175
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,810
And so it's not really raising enough awareness about the

176
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,880
Sunday Farmers Market.

177
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,810
So we need to come up with a better one.

178
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,550
So that would be, there's a solution in place, but there's a gap between

179
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:39,710
the solution, between what's the current policy in place and what needs

180
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,510
to be in place.

181
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,330
So that's ill and blame.

182
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,380
So we're halfway through those stock issues.

183
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,690
So I'm going to go ahead and end here.

184
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,220
And in the next lecture, we'll talk about cure and consequence.

185
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,533
