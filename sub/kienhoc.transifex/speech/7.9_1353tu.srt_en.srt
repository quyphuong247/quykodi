MATT MCGARRITY: If you haven't already, make sure you go watch the

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,370
last lecture and listen to that Obama speech in terms of arguing for US

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,840
Darfur policy back in 2006.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,930
What I want to do in this lecture is just kind of move through what's going

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:18,690
on in that speech in terms of stock issues, and then also talk about,

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,960
well, what does this open up in terms of an oppositional case?

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,460
All right.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,420
So if we look at this, you see starts off with a general declaration of ill.

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,090
And he's talking about the genocide getting worse.

10
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:36,400
And you have both a sense of qualitative and quantitative there.

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,950
He loops that in throughout the various points in the speech.

12
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,880
But you've got significance and harms in that ill.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,060
He's just trying to assert that the genocide is getting worse.

14
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:50,370
But honestly, this speech is not about the genocide, right?

15
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,970
The speech is about the US's response to that what was happening.

16
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,360
It's about how the US is going to intervene or change their

17
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,610
intervention policy.

18
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,980
So that ill is sort of his introduction.

19
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:08,830
He's not having to argue much for his audience the very nature of the ill.

20
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:12,220
The ill is sort of his way into the topic.

21
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,970
But it's not really what the speech is about.

22
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,720
Rather, the speech is about blame and cure.

23
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,610
So after that opening just talking about the genocide, he

24
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,840
gets into the blame.

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,990
And he says, well, why is this continuing to happen?

26
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:25,480
All right.

27
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,990
Well, we've got an attitudinal inherency, gap inherency, and a

28
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,410
structural inherency.

29
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,960
So in terms of the attitudinal inherency, he says, look, the US and

30
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,310
other countries aren't taking this seriously enough.

31
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,370
They need to change.

32
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,540
We need to change their attitude in order to get more of a commitment out

33
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,780
of the US and these other countries.

34
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,490
And then he goes through, but on the ground logistically, there's not

35
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,960
enough troops, equipment, mission clarity, so on and so forth.

36
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,070
These are structural inherencies.

37
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,940
The number of troops is a structural inherency.

38
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,550
That is something that we just need more of.

39
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,660
It's not attitude.

40
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,550
That is the raw number of troops.

41
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:09,020
Or mission clarity, that needs to be passed at a different level.

42
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,979
So these are structural inherencies.

43
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,810
So we've got ill as his way into the topic.

44
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,050
Then we get into blame.

45
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,060
And here, he's saying, here's what needs to be fixed.

46
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,350
By the way, that's what the cure does, right?

47
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,410
You see this correlation between blame and cure.

48
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,670
So he moves to the cures.

49
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,550
The UN needs a peacekeeping mission with a protection mandate.

50
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,590
His III-A solves for his II-B.

51
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,790
We need to fund and equip the AU more.

52
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,260
His III-B solves for his II-B. We need to increase our sense of urgency and

53
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,330
pressure other countries to take it more seriously.

54
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:45,340
His III-C solves for his II-A. Whatever he talks about as a blame, he

55
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,660
solves for on the cure side.

56
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,850
By the way, we'll return to this under the argument congruency, he's not

57
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,500
raising a problem in the blame that he doesn't therefore solve for as well.

58
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,490
So he's, by the way, not solving for the ill.

59
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,270
The ill is genocide is getting worse.

60
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,490
His cure is not stop it.

61
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,360
Knock it off.

62
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,650
That's not the cure.

63
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,700
His cure is much more detailed.

64
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,210
Here's what's allowing that genocide to get worse.

65
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,630
And here's how we can stop that blame from continuing on.

66
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,810
So a lot of times people will roll into a speech.

67
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,250
And they'll identify the ill.

68
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,520
And then they'll try to solve for the ill.

69
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,460
And this can be any number of issues.

70
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,320
Here at the University of Washington, a lot of what we saw a while back was

71
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,540
there was a homeless tent city that wanted to be on campus.

72
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,910
And so people would often start talking about the homelessness in

73
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,930
Seattle, and therefore we should host this homeless tent city on campus.

74
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,650
And to some degree that makes sense.

75
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,040
But really what they needed to argue was homelessness is bad.

76
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,130
That's the ill.

77
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:48,070
And so went the argument at the time, the UW isn't doing enough.

78
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,110
Therefore, the UW needs to do more.

79
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,940
So that ill is a way into the blame.

80
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,250
But the ill--

81
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,490
you can't solve for the whole ill.

82
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:01,220
Obama in this one speech in one policy can't solve for genocide.

83
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,280
But he can talk about why and how to solve for this structural and

84
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,640
attitudinal inherencies about this particular military intervention.

85
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,620
So that's kind of one of the big issues here.

86
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,640
That's what stock issues allows you to see, this relationship

87
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,519
between blame and cure.

88
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:19,440
Then he ends with this consequence.

89
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,480
Sort of a for the low, low cost of increased funding and military aid,

90
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,610
you also get reduced disease and terrorism.

91
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,500
Buy now.

92
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,960
Buy two.

93
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,610
So his consequences are sort of value-added reasons for why we would

94
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,000
want to take this policy change anyway.

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,180
So certainly he could just and end on the cures.

96
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,340
But that consequence allows his to be able to say, oh, and if we implement

97
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,580
this, here's actually some additional benefits that

98
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,220
accrue to us as a nation.

99
00:04:54,220 --> 00:05:00,050
And he organizes this as a straight stock issue speech, as a needs case.

100
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,170
Ill, blame, cure, consequences.

101
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,550
Now, next week we'll talk about arrangement.

102
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,290
You might do this.

103
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,580
You might not choose to do this.

104
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,590
It doesn't really matter.

105
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,430
But here it makes sense.

106
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,680
There's a logical flow to this speech.

107
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,940
Now, in looking at these stock issues, you could think about what would

108
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,270
someone who is opposed to increased military intervention-- what might

109
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,870
they argue?

110
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,790
Well, stock issues allows you to think through that opposition.

111
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:30,290
Odds are, they're probably not going to argue against ill.

112
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,350
Genocide, you have limitations.

113
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,250
You can't go, ah, not too bad.

114
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,970
That's not an option.

115
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,700
So probably the opposition's not going to--

116
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,750
at least in the US, is not going to argue against ill.

117
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,060
But they might argue against the blame.

118
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,810
They say, well, we are taking it seriously enough.

119
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,220
That's unfair, what you've said.

120
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,080
Or there's plenty enough mission clarity.

121
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,660
There are other issues, other causes that you missed, other

122
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,060
blames that you missed.

123
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,130
Or you could go after the consequences.

124
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,800
Well, these won't really occur.

125
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,570
Now you can't probably scuttle the argument for policy intervention

126
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,140
merely by attacking consequences.

127
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,620
The nature of this argument is, if you're opposed to it, you're either

128
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,440
going after blames or cures.

129
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,850
And if you're going after cures, what you're probably going after is

130
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,330
workability and solvency.

131
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,180
And so you'd get into some narrow thinking here like, well, we can't

132
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,870
fund and equip the AU more.

133
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:30,250
Or if we do, here are some other negative consequences that emerge.

134
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:36,060
Or our relationship with the UN, we can't pressure too much for a

135
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,210
protection mandate.

136
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:41,860
But you can start to see that there are certain areas where if you wanted

137
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,990
to argue against this, for whatever reason, you can't really go after ill.

138
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:52,000
You need to get into the deep part of his argument and look carefully at

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,790
opposing, rejecting, flipping how he's talking about blame and how he's

140
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,400
talking about cure.

141
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,530
So as you get further and further into your persuasive speech or as you're

142
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,630
using stock issues on persuasive acts that you're doing outside of this

143
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:12,210
class, I want you to see how these various elements are interacting.

144
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:16,990
And this running an idea through stock issues should help you strategize new

145
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:23,110
ideas, think all sorts of options that you might pursue in your speech.

146
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,910
So it should help you in a meeting.

147
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:30,410
Let's say you're at a business meeting and figure out why a proposal is a

148
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,400
great idea or not a great idea.

149
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,770
It should help you kind of come up with reasons for how you would

150
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,310
fundraise or raise awareness about an idea.

151
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:43,080
These stock issues are there as an intellectual tool to help you think

152
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,330
through burden of proof, status quo, and what options you have, be it

153
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,640
arguing for the status quo or arguing against it.

154
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,890
