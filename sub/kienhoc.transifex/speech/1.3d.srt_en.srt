00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,199
so welcome everybody. It's great to have you here

2
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,550
My name's Henry Brady, I'm the dean at Goldman School public policy

3
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:58,679
It's with the really great pleasure that I

4
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:01,929
welcome you here tonight for the third anymore Michael

5
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:05,069
KnottDistinguished Lecture in politics

6
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,219
and public policy it's an annual address

7
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,549
generously supported and funded by the Richard and Rhoda Goldman fund

8
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:16,890
we're fortunate tonight for the opportunity

9
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,019
to hear from Chancellor's professor Robert Reich

10
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:24,799
Bob does so many things well

11
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,978
I don't actually have any idea where he gets the time to do it let me just a

12
00:01:27,978 --> 00:01:29,379
start with thing you might not

13
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:33,629
imagine that somebody evolve his running around and doing all the extra things he

14
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:33,959
does

15
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:37,239
the leaders who are in that is he teaches

16
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:40,589
very well in really is committed to it

17
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,130
and really contributes an extraordinary  amount to this university

18
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:48,280
he doesn't like each in a leadership  class to a master's in public policy

19
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,109
students

20
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:53,829
nobody exemplifies leadership better than Bob Reich this is a great

21
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:57,280
opportunity for our students to find out how a real leader

22
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,599
acts as a leader and he teaches our students how to think that way and I

23
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:04,099
think that's a tremendous contribution to our program

24
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:08,239
because our students by large go on and work we're in the nonprofit sector in

25
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:08,830
government

26
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,680
so learning how to the policy  entrepreneurs like Bob Reich

27
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,129
tough thing to do but Learning Center that at least

28
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:19,359
is extraordinarily important for them living he does his teacher

29
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,920
very large undergraduate class this year

30
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:27,048
I think at one point there were 1000 people signed up to take this course

31
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:30,930
and unfortunately the room they had was only seven hundred and fifty people, one

32
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,469
of the largest rooms on campus

33
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:36,500
so that demand is overflowing for this course

34
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,569
it's a course in wealth and poverty and it's one of the most notable courses

35
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:43,459
here on campus. I'm sure there's some students in the audience to take

36
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:44,180
this course

37
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,420
yet we gotta much good I hope you're having fun

38
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:51,429
who are watching Bob lectures is just  great in the truth is he doesn't let you

39
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,340
actually sorta does it with interaction  with students and so forth

40
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,930
it's quite an extraordinary performance so what does that actually

41
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,709
us but also as you know very well he's been a contributing editor at The New

42

Harvard Business Review the Atlantic  there were times he's contributed to the

44

on its list to the most influential business

59
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,099

00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:09,389
more influence the net on The Wall  Street Journal

61
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:14,659

the left in america right now he is the person

75
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:03,779
who most cogently most clearly puts together the case

76
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:08,549
for what the left was thinking should be thinking it should be doing

77
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,470
and so without further ado living

78
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,650
welcome please join me in welcoming a

79
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:23,649
Bob rush

80
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,360
well i i want to thank Henry Brady, Dean Brady, for that

81
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,699
extraordinary and introduction I and

82
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:33,930
I just wanna say that it's been a privilege to work

83
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,670
Henry with you I talk about leadership I do talk about leadership by

84
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,090
teacher course as Henry said in leadership and

85
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:46,429
this man is an exemplary leader I don't , I can find

86
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,470
I work with a lot of deans before Henry  including

87
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,790
this day in over here Michael notched

88
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,420
and a I don't compare the two a view that would be

89
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,759
invidious but you are truly wonderful

90
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,209
the only part you're better than George  W Bush

91
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:11,209
You're too big night that's really the  only Cup although I i pic with Henry

92
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:17,430
he his his his carbon footprint is too big

93
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,620
you know my eye on the other hand have I think just about the smallest carbon

94
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,660
footprint

95
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,009
and Berkeley I

96
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,939
and as to Michael not and Marjorie not well

97
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:32,860
where to begin I don't I could spend the next

98
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,270
our talking about he Michael just went like this:

99
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:41,159
suggesting that I not but let me do I mean why I one thing that Michael they

100
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,870
do I

101
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,000
I would not be here at berkeley were it not for Michael

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,110
opt telling me or calling me or suggesting to me very strongly that I

103
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,110
came out to visit

104
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,110
out here in 2004 and

105
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,689
I had been I didn't know much about Berkeley I knew about Berkeley a little

106
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:58,680
bit but I and i believe in it here

107
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,889
a personal history I had been I had visited

108
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:05,780
the inverse in California Berkeley for one summer I

109
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:10,698
in the summer of 1968 John you remember

110
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:13,860
and in fact

111
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,229
we won't go into that and I but I do remember I was why I might

112
00:07:19,228 --> 00:07:20,909
introduction Berkeley was coming up

113
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,099
University Avenue and I remember distinctly and my little

114
00:07:24,098 --> 00:07:29,149
brown knows little blue beat up Volkswagen that almost iconic

115
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:32,388
and I was coming up and suddenly I got this

116
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:35,759
aroma up a

117
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,569
eucalyptus and you know mixed with

118
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:42,990
marijuana and and tear gas

119
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,430
and it was

120
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,550
and the whole thing was was so intoxicating

121
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,540
that I just I drifted the whole summer I don't remember anything about

122
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,450
this summer at all

123
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:55,740
I was a teaching assistant for a

124
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,290
professor of architecture that shows you how far

125
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,970
some people come

126
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,200
 but I said I gotta get back I don't remember a thing about the summer

127
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,949
but I'd 9 knew that I had to get back

128
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:11,229
and was Michael Knox who suggested that I that I come back

129
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,640
and i'd I'd I got here a and

130
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,669
well the only other thing I wanna say is that

131
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,990
over those years from 1968

132
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,449
to 2004 or even right now

133
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:28,509
and this is really a message for our dean, he

134
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,509
just accused me, did you hear him, he just accused me of being

135
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:34,569
a mouthpiece the left, did you hear that,

136
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,010
did you hear that? I distinctly heard that. Let me

137
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:41,929
make clear to everybody including our dean

138
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:46,409
that since nineteen, before that, since 1963

139
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:50,069
or '62 I have not changed

140
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,620
my centrist position at all

141
00:08:53,620 --> 00:09:00,620
The rest of the country has moved to the right. No, this is true

142
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:05,910
I have not moved. Beginning in the sixties

143
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:09,469
there was a movement in this country, unfortunately

144
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,560
to the right, leaving me and some of you

145
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:15,979
I assume, some of you, some of the people in  Berkeley

146
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,990
more alone than we were before. Isn't that true?

147
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:27,990


148
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,779


149
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,750
So, I am a mouthpiece of the center

150
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,259
the old center

151
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:41,950
Now I don't know how many have you, show of hands, how many of you saw the

152
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:42,660
debate

153
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:46,199
last night, speaking of which, between,

154
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,300
the Republican debate I'm talking about.  Put your hands

155
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:53,079
proudly

156
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,250
I would say a majority view did not see it

157
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,519
I saw it on and off. I've seen

158
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,019
the Republican debates, and this is not a

159
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,278
partisan forum and I'm, I'm now being, I really am

160
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:10,399
trying to be very objective, I have not found the debates terribly

161
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:17,399
edifying. I

162
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,839
was being completely serious about that

163
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,450
No, just in a sense that I mean, I understand.

164
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:32,660
that a they wanna cut taxes on the wealthy

165
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:36,149
primarily and they want to cut

166
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:40,389
a lot of social programs that benefit the middle class and the poor. I get that

167
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:43,600
and I get the fact that they don't like government, I understand that

168
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,959
but this has been pretty much the  Republican

169
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,778
platform since the 1920s.

170
00:10:50,778 --> 00:10:54,570
So,  when I say not edifying I don't mean that in a denigrating way. I

171
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,120
just mean

172
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,100
I haven't, I'm not learning very much. Now, by contrast, the Democratic debates

173
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,129
have not existed

174
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,708
because we have an incumbent so it's not been, I mean there's not very much

175
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,639
to compare

176
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:11,870
it to. I think the election

177
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,320
if you want me to make a prediction, would you like me to make a prediction

178
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,860
right now the election

179
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,600
I next november is going to be won by

180
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,320
Barack Obama and it's going to be overwhelming. Now

181
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,530
this is a nonpartisan

182
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:31,669
discussion and I'll tell you why I it's going to be one, number one because the

183
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:32,490
economy

184
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:37,000
I is going to do it continue to improve slightly now we're not going to see

185
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,480
a vigorous recovery it's just not in the  cards

186
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,870
because consumers do not have the w herewithal to generate the kind of

187
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,850
demand

188
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,779
necessary for a vigorous recovery and  that's a terrible problem because

189
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:54,589
when you being down show deeply when  you're in such a deep hole

190
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,720
as we have been since nineteen it since  2008

191
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,019
you really do need a big tourist recovery I mean talking about 345

192
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:08,919
six-percent growth per year to get back on the track you are on

193
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:14,169
before in 1934 I mean real 1933 was the Dept the Rev the

194
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:18,279
the bottom up the at the Great Depression 1934 the economy grew about

195
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,449
four or five percent depending upon

196
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,170
whose measurements you believe 1935 it was bad eight-percent

197
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:27,529
1936 the economy grew 14 percent

198
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:32,159
I mean we're talking that well right now the best prediction for this year

199
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,289
is to point eight-percent but again these estimates keep on shrinking

200
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:39,419
I will be surprised if we get better than 2.2 percent

201
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:42,939
that's not enough to bring unemployment way down

202
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,950
we're probably going to have unemployment that is still

203
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,990
very close to eight percent in fact one of the

204
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,320
ironies up this year is at as the labor market improves

205
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,710
slowly more and more people decide that they're going to actually go out and

206
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,590
find a job

207
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,970
people who are on the any of the labor market people who

208
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,700
really do need a job but have been too discouraged even look for work

209
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,600
so they start looking for work and perversely the way we measure

210
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,550
unemployment in this country

211
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:16,309
his number people who are looking for work and so

212
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:20,629
paradoxically and perversely what we're likely to see

213
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:24,088
is unemployment hovering around aid and maybe even

214
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:27,890
increasing the 8.2 8.3 per would 4 percent

215
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:32,980
by election day if things continue to improve thats

216
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,370
one of the ironies and it try to explain that in a ten-second commercial

217
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,950
but nevertheless I think people really

218
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,759
are feeling better and consumer confidence

219
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:48,588
II sensitive going in the right direction for a change

220
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:54,280
getting out of the ditch as Barack Obama used to live has like to use ASM

221
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:57,689
as a metaphor all that is going to be very helpful to him

222
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:01,220
I I think that the housing crisis

223
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,509
is probably going to continue housing prices have just about reached bottom

224
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:09,009
but that's gonna continue to be a problem and nothing the administration

225
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:10,019
has come up with yet

226
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:13,329
is getting us out of that housing problem that's a huge

227
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:18,100
drag on the economy right now gas prices people ask me what's gonna happen to gas

228
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,009
prices well

229
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:22,539
gas prices are probably going

230
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:28,149
pop they're going up because ironically the global economy is recovering

231
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:31,539
the United States is recovering when you have a recovery even a slight

232
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:35,049
recovery even an anemic recovery demand

233
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:39,149
those up even if you didn't have the problems if Iran

234
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:43,299
and the saber-rattling over the street almost

235
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:47,689
you're still going to have increasing demand that means that speculators are

236
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,050
going to be placing bets

237
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:52,240
on crude oil getting more and more expensive

238
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,379
and that's exactly what's going on right now how

239
00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:00,439
are rising gas prices going to affect the election

240
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,100
well it's not going to be pretty consumers

241
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,659
are extremely sensitive to gas prices but here's another prediction

242
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:12,149
just like happened last May we're going to see

243
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:15,569
gas prices spike and then drop almost as

244
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,810
quickly why because it's a speculative bubble

245
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:22,379
it's a speculative bubble that really could turn around marry

246
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,769
easily if wanna ban any number of things happens

247
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:31,629
out one thing that I expect for example is that China's growth is going to slow

248
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:35,350
even more dramatically and if China's growth slows

249
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,350
then oil demand drops

250
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:43,290
dramatic way they did demand for all commodities so

251
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:47,569
add all this up and throwing in the European debt crisis which looks like

252
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,640
it's probably improving

253
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:53,789
I the big problem with europe and the debt crisis was not exports from the

254
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:54,578
united states

255
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:58,250
in terms of the United States economy the big problem with European debt

256
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,000
crisis

257
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,519
was america's financial sector

258
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,299
and how much exposure our banks had two big banks in Europe

259
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,879
that were happily

260
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:15,149
exposed to Greece and two Italy and still are

261
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:18,708
but nevertheless I believe Italy

262
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:22,198
and Greece certainly Italy probably grease

263
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:26,039
going to this company another a bailout another phone arrangement

264
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:30,078
in Europe to hold things of for

265
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,909
a while Europe has a wonderfully way when the way I'm muddling through

266
00:16:34,909 --> 00:16:38,509
and they will just completely will continue to muddle thats another

267
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:41,948
prediction I'm going to make a European model

268
00:16:41,948 --> 00:16:45,549
through 2012 it will not turn into a crisis

269
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:49,139
I don't think Greece is going to be allowed to default

270
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:53,539
so that craters is going to sleep it's not going to go away but it's not going

271
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:54,289
to create

272
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:58,448
huge problems are you with me

273
00:16:58,448 --> 00:17:01,719
so in terms of the economy what we're likely to see

274
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,039
over the next year is another improvement that Obama

275
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,109
can the president can at least at least claim credit for

276
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:14,000
getting us out of the terrible predicament the Great Recession

277
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,799
and point2 in a positive direction

278
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,069
what about politics in terms

279
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:28,019
love campaign finance one big question mark hanging over the selection

280
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:32,009
is the role the super PACs and

281
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,289
what we've seen in the Republican primary so far as something that I've

282
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:36,299
never seen

283
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:40,918
in my lifetime and that is a relative handful the people

284
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,530
I mean the reason that newt Gingrich

285
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:49,819
and Rick Santorum and even Ron Paul

286
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:53,349
are holding on is because I've

287
00:17:53,349 --> 00:17:57,980
five people five individuals

288
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,610
and if you look at Romney's super PAC

289
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:07,699
basically 75 percent have that is from forty individuals

290
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,480
and all of this money is Bay is is is more than the money that the campaign's

291
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,929
officially are spending for campaign

292
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:19,929
for their campaigns and primarily commercials so you got super PACs

293
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:22,630
they're spending more than the campaign's and the superb actor

294
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,000
dominated by

295
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,150
pp I mean your literally this group of people in the front row

296
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,259
in terms of numbers I never before

297
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:35,619
never before have we seen this well we saw something

298
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:38,829
approximately like this in the gilded age

299
00:18:38,829 --> 00:18:42,029
in the last decade of the 19th century

300
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:46,730
and we sought to really prompt major reforms major progressive

301
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:50,690
reforms in this country at Louis Brandeis

302
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:54,029
at the Great jurist I and Supreme Court Justice

303
00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:58,700
one said we can have a democracy in this country

304
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:04,240
or we can have great well concentrated in the hands are very few people

305
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,490
but we cannot have Bo

306
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:10,960
now he said that during the Progressive Era

307
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,380
when a lot americans were becoming very concerned about the great concentration

308
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,580
income and wealth and its effect are on our democracy

309
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:24,460
I do not think that we're going to see anything

310
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,579
like campaign finance reform anytime soon

311
00:19:27,579 --> 00:19:30,599
but I do think that what's happened in the republican primaries

312
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:33,619
and what is likely to happen in the general election

313
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:37,649
and the president as you know has embraced his own reluctantly

314
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:41,610
I think you felt that he had to I wish he hadn't but I think he felt that he

315
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:42,469
had to

316
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,740
and he's surrounded by people who have

317
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,589
much better kinda inside political instincts and I do

318
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:54,189
he has embraced his own pack his own super PAC

319
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,400
and so we're going to have super-rich

320
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,899
handful a relative handful super-rich democrats battling a relative handful if

321
00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:07,069
super rich republicans in terms of funding these elections

322
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:10,189
nevertheless I think again the president is going to do quite well

323
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,570
another thing in his favor is that the republicans

324
00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:17,549
really do not like Mitt Romney

325
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:22,440
yep

326
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,269
I know Mitt Romney

327
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:29,000
heeyy a I wanna my great regrets in life is II

328
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,680
Iran for the Democratic nomination for governor

329
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,450
in 2002 in Massachusetts I

330
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,960
did not win but going into the last two weeks

331
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,440
going in the last two weeks that election I was running neck

332
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,509
and neck with the personal ultimately became the democratic nominee

333
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:51,930
there were chicks a bus I came in second

334
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,769
I I think I tonight do you mind if I get into this--

335
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:59,000
it's a little of no its not really of I

336
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,200
I would have won my campaign manager said if I

337
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,640
simply we ran out of money he said put your house get a second mortgage

338
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:13,640
on your home and I said no now if I it said yes

339
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:18,370
not only does and I campaign manager but a lot of people I respect that I could

340
00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:19,809
have won the democratic nomination

341
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:23,869
now I won the democratic nomination I could have

342
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:27,659
whipped Mitt Romney

343
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:34,660
I mean I really I could've so if he in the unlikely event becomes president

344
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,419
it is because our way

345
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:43,340
was too much was skin plan to put a second mortgage on my up

346
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:49,699
I'm sorry but

347
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,080
here's what

348
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:56,158
really worries me not so much the election coming up

349
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,278
what really worries me is that we've got some very big

350
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:03,419
structural problems in our economy and in our society

351
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:06,840
and this election

352
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:11,168
is not going to see proposals that are large enough

353
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:15,009
to deal with the structural problems

354
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:19,089
out explain why in a moment but just so we're all together

355
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:23,459
what are the biggest structural problems i've alluded to you already

356
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,190
and that is the extraordinary impact

357
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,730
I've concentrated wealth and income on our democracy

358
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:35,240
something we have not seen in this country for over a hundred years

359
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,829
behind that is the fact that

360
00:22:38,829 --> 00:22:42,199
in structural terms we have a larger and larger percentage

361
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,340
a poor population there because globalization and because of

362
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:47,538
technological change

363
00:22:47,538 --> 00:22:50,569
are simply not sharing

364
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:57,569
in the gains from economic growth we again in this country

365
00:22:57,579 --> 00:23:01,869
have not witnessed this kinda acceleration

366
00:23:01,869 --> 00:23:05,699
I've concentrated income and wealth since the nineteen

367
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,028
20 and by some measures since the Gilded Age in the nineteenth century

368
00:23:11,028 --> 00:23:14,509
now is this a problem over and above

369
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:17,528
its affect potentially undermining our democracy

370
00:23:17,528 --> 00:23:21,099
some people would say yes I teach a course

371
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:24,759
in this I try not to impose my own views

372
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:28,679
but it seems to me historically there is a danger

373
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:32,950
that when a country becomes completely

374
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:36,860
unbalanced in terms of the allocation of income wealth in the in this

375
00:23:36,859 --> 00:23:40,099
fundamental structural way then

376
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:43,638
you begin to lose the see news I love

377
00:23:43,638 --> 00:23:47,278
social connection and solidarity the define

378
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:50,548
a society you have a while

379
00:23:50,548 --> 00:23:54,788
very wealthy group that begins to secede from the rest of society

380
00:23:54,788 --> 00:23:58,359
pay less taxes not even see anybody who's not wealthy

381
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:02,009
and you got a lot of other people who because they're not getting ahead

382
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:05,129
grow resentful

383
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:10,889
and angry an insecure and that resentment and that anger and insecurity

384
00:24:10,888 --> 00:24:17,359
festers and becomes the kind of fertile ground in which demagogues

385
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:24,329
take all and take group using the power to blame

386
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:28,148
resentment against immigrants against foreigners

387
00:24:28,148 --> 00:24:31,750
against gays against the poor

388
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:36,028
against people who are different some even against the rich

389
00:24:36,028 --> 00:24:39,079
but the politics resentment

390
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:43,019
begins to dominate political discourse because people are looking for

391
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:43,940
scapegoats

392
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:50,028
and it is very easy for demagogues to find the and we've seen that before

393
00:24:50,028 --> 00:24:53,750
in history and frankly that's what

394
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:59,500
worries me if we see each to become a society in which we all feel we're all

395
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,089
in it together we pay a huge price

396
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:08,970
the proposals that we are hearing from

397
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:12,220
the Republican candidates are not

398
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:17,460
meeting this structural challenge in fact they are going in the opposite

399
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,200
direction they basically

400
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,250
as I said before want to reduce taxes on the rich

401
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,369
reduce tobacco tax on corporations and

402
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:31,908
cut social programs and cut education you have a kind of trickle-down effect

403
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:33,730
but it's not trickle-down economics

404
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:38,378
it's trickle-down from government deficits at the federal level

405
00:25:38,378 --> 00:25:42,648
to ending all kinds a revenue-sharing there is help the state's

406
00:25:42,648 --> 00:25:46,359
meanwhile the state's because in their constitutions forty nine and fifty

407
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:47,000
states

408
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,778
cannot run deficits which means the state's are still

409
00:25:50,778 --> 00:25:55,190
even this year even coming out of recession the state's are still

410
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,440
cutting social programs cutting back education

411
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,500
making it harder and harder for young people

412
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,089
to take full advantage

413
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:09,788
have their native talents and abilities and make something up themselves

414
00:26:09,788 --> 00:26:13,169
the whole idea up equal opportunity

415
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:17,788
is being thrown out the window I wish I could say to you

416
00:26:17,788 --> 00:26:21,700
that the president's proposals meet the challenge

417
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,840
that i've outlined but they were really don't

418
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:28,308
and it's not his fault entirely I will get that to that in a moment

419
00:26:28,308 --> 00:26:31,480
but the president is essentially saying in his new budget and what

420
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,700
that these budget documents are not

421
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,058
anything but frameworks they are not real

422
00:26:38,058 --> 00:26:41,368
they're not really political documents because everybody knows these budgets

423
00:26:41,368 --> 00:26:42,128
are not going to be

424
00:26:42,128 --> 00:26:45,589
enacted in an election year they are simply

425
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:48,849
statements there take articulations hover

426
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:51,980
and frameworks for understanding what did he is

427
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,669
a particular candidate for president wants to do

428
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:59,250
and what the president is doing is the right thing in terms of the direction is

429
00:26:59,250 --> 00:26:59,769
going on

430
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:03,200
he does 12 end the Bush tax cuts

431
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,500
are for the wealthy that's exactly right he should do that

432
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,278
he's talking about a so-called Buffett Rule which is kinda Bay

433
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:13,368
an alternative minimum tax for people who are very wealthy

434
00:27:13,368 --> 00:27:16,388
but he's been very big about what that means but thats

435
00:27:16,388 --> 00:27:20,028
a step in the right direction he is talking about

436
00:27:20,028 --> 00:27:23,490
more investment in education and in job skills

437
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:27,460
and an infrastructure and also in basic research and development that's all

438
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,319
good but it's not nearly

439
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:35,079
in terms of the budget he is proposing it's not nearly

440
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:38,949
under scale that is commensurate

441
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:42,610
with the degree up structural challenge

442
00:27:42,609 --> 00:27:46,138
we are facing in this country

443
00:27:46,138 --> 00:27:49,459
I wish for example that he had said

444
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:54,000
why don't we simply go back to the tax structure and the tax rates we had

445
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,419
in this country between 1945 and

446
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:01,520
1980

447
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:05,940
where the top 1 percent for example was paying at a seventy percent marginal tax

448
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,710
rate

449
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:12,028
I mean under dwight D eisenhower the top one percent was paying

450
00:28:12,028 --> 00:28:15,839
a 91 percent marginal tax

451
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:19,230
I'm not saying go back there

452
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:23,048
but it is not radical to say just go back to the

453
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:27,028
first three decades after the second world war when in fact

454
00:28:27,028 --> 00:28:31,339
yearly growth in the american economy was faster than the yearly growth we've

455
00:28:31,339 --> 00:28:32,788
had over the last thirty years

456
00:28:32,788 --> 00:28:36,450
since the reagan tax cuts the idea

457
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:40,788
somehow that hi marginal tax rates and let me emphasize

458
00:28:40,788 --> 00:28:44,490
these are marginal tax is we're not talking about seventy percent memories

459
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,759
income we're talking about

460
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,519
over a certain threshold seventy percent over that threshold

461
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,099
we ought to have more tax brackets at the very top

462
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:56,949
we still are are stuck in a kind of industrial age tax system

463
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:03,950
where the top bracket is what about 370,000 380,000

464
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:09,619
and make the capital gains tax equal to the income tax

465
00:29:09,618 --> 00:29:13,349
so we don't have this giant loophole which were paying an enormous

466
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:17,378
amounts of money to people who are accountants and

467
00:29:17,378 --> 00:29:22,648
tax consultants were trying to make income look like its capital gains

468
00:29:22,648 --> 00:29:29,000
so it fits into the 15-percent bracket

469
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,269
and remake public education look at the I mean how can we be

470
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:37,179
in California

471
00:29:37,179 --> 00:29:40,860
having the leading edge companies in industries

472
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:43,859
in the world

473
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:50,859
Apple and Facebook and Hewlett Packard

474
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:54,440
and basically Google and and

475
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,538
all these other companies that american companies world companies want to be

476
00:29:58,538 --> 00:30:01,038
here in California

477
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:04,690
now we've got the most advanced venture capital industry

478
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:08,730
in the world here in California

479
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:12,028
and we've got the entertainment industry the sender the global entertainment

480
00:30:12,028 --> 00:30:12,868
industry

481
00:30:12,868 --> 00:30:15,918
here in California and yet we have gone in California

482
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,210
from having the best educational public education system in

483
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:23,230
America thirty-five years ago to now forty-ninth

484
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:29,808
in america how can that possibly be

485
00:30:29,808 --> 00:30:35,089
America about california is a microcosm for what is going wrong in this country

486
00:30:35,089 --> 00:30:39,368
equal opportunity is

487
00:30:39,368 --> 00:30:43,668
a joke a bad joke when you have the forty-ninth

488
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:48,009
worst or 5.8 backed

489
00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:51,298
almost second-worst educate public educational system

490
00:30:51,298 --> 00:30:54,940
in the country and when you take your best

491
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,970
system a public higher education in this

492
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:03,839
entire country what what and you subjected to the kind of budget cuts

493
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:10,269
the California have subjected the University of California to

494
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:13,339
to the kind of structural changes we're talking about or

495
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:16,678
major investments in education

496
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:20,519
with yes in the classroom do ask for accountability

497
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:23,888
do demand the teachers show

498
00:31:23,888 --> 00:31:27,418
performance not in some rigid limited

499
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:30,879
way according to some rigidly minutes into formulas

500
00:31:30,878 --> 00:31:33,740
but at least show that students are getting something in getting something

501
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,339
back

502
00:31:36,339 --> 00:31:40,418
have early childhood education which up all the investments

503
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:43,970
that our public early childhood education has shown

504
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:47,069
unambiguously to have the biggest punch

505
00:31:47,069 --> 00:31:50,689
the biggest result

506
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:55,048
and I could go on and on reinstitute glass steagle

507
00:31:55,048 --> 00:31:58,598
make sure that the bank's the biggest banks

508
00:31:58,598 --> 00:32:02,628
are broken up so that there are have a limited size so that they cannot repeat

509
00:32:02,628 --> 00:32:05,648
what they are and have been doing you know I had a

510
00:32:05,648 --> 00:32:10,449
a conversation with somebody I served in the administration

511
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:15,710
with whose name I shall not passed my lips because I don't want to blame him

512
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:22,710
a he was secretary the Treasury

513
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:31,279
and use the same first name as I do but

514
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:37,000
I am star asked him i said well what why did we have

515
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,319
why did wall street explode why did we have all of this

516
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:44,439
but terrible kind over what you know and I'll

517
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,809
chaos in in in 2007-2008

518
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:51,690
that led to the bailout and and what why did that happen and he said to me well

519
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,970
it was a perfect storm

520
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:56,650
it was just a perfect storm just a a collection of things that would never

521
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:00,040
you would never expect in any one of them to happen but they just

522
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:03,069
it they all came together a perfect storm and that

523
00:33:03,069 --> 00:33:06,569
perfect storm mentality it's still there on wall street

524
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:10,589
they don't believe that there's something in the way

525
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:14,179
Wall Street actually was organized and behaved

526
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,310
in terms the risks the Wall Street was taking on

527
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:21,519
and how those risks were rewarded

528
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,829
they don't believe to this day that there's something intrinsic

529
00:33:26,829 --> 00:33:29,879
about the way finance was

530
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:34,200
run that created the problem and they are still

531
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,690
fighting dodd-frank Barney Frank is somewhere on this campus tonight talking

532
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,480
about something other than dodd-frank

533
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,490
but I can tell you Wall Street

534
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:47,700
is determines to leave this arrayed

535
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:52,049
the dodd-frank financial regulation bill so in terms of structural changes

536
00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:55,500
one thing that the president should be calling for is even stronger

537
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,579
financial

538
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:02,589
regulations such as i've outlined but

539
00:34:02,589 --> 00:34:06,129
why is he not doing this

540
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:10,179
my final point tonight and then we'll turn it over to your questions

541
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:13,820
I think one of the major

542
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:20,019
reasons why Barack Obama just like bill clinton

543
00:34:20,019 --> 00:34:23,519
did not go further

544
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:29,418
in terms of structural changes that are desperately needed in this country I

545
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:31,690
haven't even mentioned the environment that's another

546
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:35,230
issue that we have to deal with in terms of structural fundamental structural

547
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,480
changes necessary

548
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,820
to the survival up this society if not this planet

549
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:43,070
one of the major reasons is there was not

550
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:47,950
on up there were not another us

551
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:54,949
pushing hard and now by that I mean

552
00:34:55,648 --> 00:34:59,199
that nothing good happens in washington

553
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:02,469
and I can tell you this because I was there

554
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:05,659
nothing good happens in Washington regardless

555
00:35:05,659 --> 00:35:09,259
up who is there who's elected their nothing good happens in Washington

556
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:13,010
and less people outside Washington are mobilized

557
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:19,190
and energized an organized sufficiently to make sure it happens

558
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:24,079
in 1936

559
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,860
when he was running for reelection Franklin D Roosevelt

560
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:32,930
confronted a II I think it was in chicago some woman said %um

561
00:35:32,929 --> 00:35:36,690
mister president if you are reelected and I hope you are but I'm going to vote

562
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:40,289
for you only if you promise me to do this and this and this and this and this

563
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:43,980
and he outlined a bunch of things that she wanted him to do

564
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:48,210
in a second term and Franklin D Roosevelt earned her

565
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:52,280
and said ma'am I would like to do every one of those things

566
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,560
but you

567
00:35:55,559 --> 00:36:02,170
must make me what did he mean you must make me

568
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:05,700
what he meant is that she

569
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:09,079
and everyone around her and everybody she knows and millions of other

570
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:09,710
Americans

571
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:13,019
had to be sufficiently organized

572
00:36:13,019 --> 00:36:17,360
an energized and mobilised around that agenda

573
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,150
to make it possible for Franklin D Roosevelt to cut through

574
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:25,030
all the entrenched interests even during the

575
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:29,269
Great Depression to get done what had to be done

576
00:36:29,269 --> 00:36:33,780
because the entrenched interests will

577
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,950
lock politics in a way

578
00:36:36,949 --> 00:36:41,829
that it is now being locked down and less people outside

579
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:47,219
are mobilised

580
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:51,299
and so when I talk to people around the country and people come up to me and say

581
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,070
oh I'm so upset the No Obama didn't do this and

582
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:58,780
and nothing is happening I ask what are you doing about it

583
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:02,450
what are you doing about it are you getting out of your bubble

584
00:37:02,449 --> 00:37:09,449
how many people me republicans have you talked to today

585
00:37:12,068 --> 00:37:14,639
Marjorie chill

586
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:21,639
you talking to republicans today good for you how many people from Oklahoma or

587
00:37:22,219 --> 00:37:23,048
Nebraska

588
00:37:23,048 --> 00:37:27,559
or South Dakota or Texas

589
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:34,559
have you talked to in the last week 0

590
00:37:40,389 --> 00:37:44,279
you see what I'm getting at we've got to get out of our bubble and we've got to

591
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,250
really

592
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:49,469
not only organize and mobilize but we've also got to talk to people

593
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:53,039
who disagree with us and we've got to convince them

594
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:56,070
a lot of them have their minds made up but they're not of a lot of people out

595
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,640
there who are independents and others

596
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:00,809
who don't really understand the issues terribly well

597
00:38:00,809 --> 00:38:07,809
we've got to make sure that we understand the issues too if we want

598
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:13,119
Barack Obama who i think is going to get a second term

599
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,589
to be able to do the kinds of things that must be done to take

600
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:23,210
our democracy back and also make an economy that is working for everyone

601
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:27,490
it requires a level the mobilization

602
00:38:27,489 --> 00:38:34,489
that we have not yet seen I have not yet seen I think he's a very

603
00:38:35,469 --> 00:38:38,919
very talented and extraordinarily

604
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,769
able present but he needs us

605
00:38:43,769 --> 00:38:47,980
in a way we have not yet

606
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:54,980
served thank you very much thanks Bob that was great

607
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:02,530
the let me start by asking you about a budget

608
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:06,120
things that are going on in America right now let me start with the Occupy

609
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:08,690
movement but also ask you about the Tea Party movement

610
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:11,940
what do these movements tell us about american politics

611
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,619
and what are their promise and what are their dangers

612
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:20,079
Henry I think that what the Tea Party movement and also the occupiers

613
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,079
a have shown is a degree

614
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:26,929
love anger and frustration a out there

615
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:31,190
in the country generally and and there many for every tea partier

616
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:34,550
and for every occupier there are presumably

617
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:37,660
legions are people who are not out there actually

618
00:39:37,659 --> 00:39:41,389
organizing demonstrating but there's a degree above anger and frustration out

619
00:39:41,389 --> 00:39:42,069
there that

620
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:49,000
up is really did I believe indifferent slightly different ways but related to

621
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,710
this broad sense that the game is rigged that

622
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:57,690
kids cannot nearly do as well as their parents that somehow

623
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:02,179
our democracy in our economy are not working as they should work

624
00:40:02,179 --> 00:40:05,919
up one little anecdote I was one this ABC show

625
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,250
call this week debating Paul Ryan

626
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:13,789
in December and we were talking about the question

627
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:17,480
love for the Tea Partiers and the occupiers

628
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,150
up and his point

629
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:24,710
was that the Tea Partiers and he

630
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:29,750
believe the government should shrink primarily and I kinda pushed him on this

631
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,000
and he actually said it

632
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,889
mainly because he did not believe that government was capable

633
00:40:35,889 --> 00:40:40,139
governing without being tools from special interests

634
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:44,969
like for example wall street and corporations and I said to him

635
00:40:44,969 --> 00:40:48,329
at the time well wait a minute if you get rid of government

636
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:52,409
because you're afraid that government is going to be necessarily

637
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:55,739
the tools Wall Street in corporations and other special interests well then

638
00:40:55,739 --> 00:41:00,729
all you're left with is wall street and corporations special-interest

639
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:04,030
I'm is that really better for the people then

640
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:07,680
having some sort of government that at least has the potential for

641
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:10,829
reflecting what could be the public interest

642
00:41:10,829 --> 00:41:15,289
and i won that debate good now I don't know

643
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:19,070
but I but I think it's I A it its be it interesting to me that

644
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:22,120
the Tea Partiers have that view because it's not that far

645
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:26,069
removed from the same skepticism and cynicism that many people

646
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:29,550
who call themselves occupiers your the the Tea Party People

647
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:33,730
dislike Wall Street almost as much as the occupiers which is very interesting

648
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:38,119
up what role can unions play in all this is their role left for unions as they've

649
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:39,539
gotten smaller smaller

650
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:42,619
your secretary labor presumably thought a lot about unions

651
00:41:42,619 --> 00:41:46,960
well at the unions now in the private sector

652
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,490
are fewer than 7 percent

653
00:41:50,489 --> 00:41:55,269
the private-sector workforce by contrast in the nineteen fifties

654
00:41:55,269 --> 00:41:59,670
unions represented about 30 32 35 percent

655
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:03,909
a private sector workers so you don't have very much power

656
00:42:03,909 --> 00:42:08,420
a in the Union so-called union movement you don't have enough

657
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,710
it's not even a movement in men in many respects the UAW

658
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:17,300
Henry agreed a not too long ago that new workers coming into the big three

659
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,460
would get half the wages you

660
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,699
fourteen dollars an hour up new workers a

661
00:42:23,699 --> 00:42:27,239
new entrants into the big three five years ago

662
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:31,309
well the fourteen dollars an hour is not all that different from what service

663
00:42:31,309 --> 00:42:32,049
workers get

664
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:36,060
in this country and its it you it's not

665
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:39,139
the UAW is still a a

666
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:42,829
a worker that I a union that represents the workers but the UAW had to do that

667
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:43,829
because I've

668
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:48,400
the competition coming not from Japan but from nonunion plants in the United

669
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,059
States

670
00:42:49,059 --> 00:42:52,699
I guess my only point is that in economic terms

671
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:56,659
unions are not strong enough to do much certainly manufactured

672
00:42:56,659 --> 00:43:01,819
I think their biggest future is in the personal service sector in the economy

673
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:06,070
retail restaurant hotel hospital surface transportation

674
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:09,160
some the construction trades child-care

675
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:14,199
particular particularly with regard to the big companies to change the hospital

676
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:15,199
chains

677
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:18,329
the retail chains some other big office chains

678
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:22,049
thats where unions could make a difference

679
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:25,440
and the workers are not competing against

680
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,800
the foreign workers and they're not competing against

681
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,840
even technology because the essence a most to those personal services

682
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,620
his personal attention you mention manufacturing

683
00:43:36,619 --> 00:43:39,779
you recently said that manufacturing will not return

684
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:43,330
at the same time places like Germany do have something in the manufacturing

685
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,069
sector

686
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:47,700
and certainly that's a place where they can be somewhat reasonable jobs

687
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:52,089
I'll what can we do is it really the case the men's version I can return is

688
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:53,980
there some role that can be played here

689
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:57,059
what about green energy jobs in manufacturing

690
00:43:57,059 --> 00:44:00,759
a green kinds of technology and so forth when when people talk about

691
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,890
manufacturing

692
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:06,210
most to the time they're talking about with thinking about the assembly line

693
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:10,699
that labor-intensive relatively lower skill

694
00:44:10,699 --> 00:44:14,069
assembly line that did not demand a four-year college degree and did not

695
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,130
command

696
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:19,789
very high-tech skills that's not coming back

697
00:44:19,789 --> 00:44:24,250
if you look in a modern factory today in the United States and there are some

698
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:28,090
most to them our robotics and numerically controlled machine tools

699
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:32,610
and you have a a few technicians sitting behind computer consoles

700
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:37,519
controlling all these people up in germany you do have her barry

701
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:42,050
highly precision manufacturing manufacturing that

702
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:46,510
demands extremely high skilled workers and the German educational system is

703
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:47,340
geared

704
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:51,590
toward a a technical education if you're not going on to it did not seem a

705
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:52,660
four-year college

706
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:56,679
at and we don't have anything like that should we have something I think we

707
00:44:56,679 --> 00:44:57,419
should I

708
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:01,150
it's difficult to quit to generate that a it's difficult to do without a book

709
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:01,550
law

710
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:06,200
I mean it's not in our tradition we don't like the idea of segregating

711
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:09,419
students at the age of 11 to 13 and single you're going to be

712
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,050
a precision technician and you're going to be

713
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:16,830
somebody who's a knowledge worker going to a four year college

714
00:45:16,829 --> 00:45:20,449
it were runs against my grain and I think for good reason be there are

715
00:45:20,449 --> 00:45:24,069
their thing the people called late bloomers but nevertheless

716
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:28,019
Germany does do that right and because it does it and because it has very

717
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:29,059
strong unions

718
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:32,219
and those unions are

719
00:45:32,219 --> 00:45:35,568
tied in with government in various ways and with corporations

720
00:45:35,568 --> 00:45:40,250
it turns out that germany has not succumb to the same inequality

721
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:43,519
we have german wages continue to rise very healthy rate

722
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:47,219
unemployment is fairly low and has been low

723
00:45:47,219 --> 00:45:51,828
even through the Great Recession and the top one percent in Germany

724
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:56,359
unlike in the United States with the top one percent is taking about 20 percent

725
00:45:56,358 --> 00:46:00,338
have total income in Germany the top one per standard still taking all but eleven

726
00:46:00,338 --> 00:46:01,039
percent

727
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:04,400
which is what they were taking home in the nineteen

728
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,838
seventies in nineteen eighties sorry change this

729
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:11,369
a have we seen for example recently with the

730
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:15,088
recession a change in the natural unemployment rate is it going to be the

731
00:46:15,088 --> 00:46:18,078
case that no longer is it 45 percent It's going to be a

732
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,480
78 percent because we simply don't have a workforce that can really get the jobs

733
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,559
and then I I know that there's one person here who said

734
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:28,790
the what do you tell students right now about the future

735
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:33,349
jobs in america well look at we're going to have jobs jobs will come back the

736
00:46:33,349 --> 00:46:36,818
problem is that many of those jobs if not most to them

737
00:46:36,818 --> 00:46:40,829
are going to be in the personal service sector and they can be very low-paid

738
00:46:40,829 --> 00:46:41,490
jobs

739
00:46:41,489 --> 00:46:45,199
there many people now who in order to keep their jobs

740
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:49,578
or settling for lower wages and/or lower benefits

741
00:46:49,579 --> 00:46:54,109
there many people who have been love lost their jobs and are now in the

742
00:46:54,108 --> 00:46:55,529
contingent work sector

743
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:58,640
they are making money but they're not making nearly as much as they were

744
00:46:58,639 --> 00:46:59,489
making before

745
00:46:59,489 --> 00:47:03,108
so the trans and the worrisome trend is not so much

746
00:47:03,108 --> 00:47:07,869
job loss its wage loss it's that you got this large and growing sector the

747
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:08,680
population

748
00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:13,838
who in terms of their wages and even if you include benefits they're going

749
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:14,440
nowhere

750
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,630
in fact they are arguably because a

751
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:20,829
if you want adjust for inflation there with their

752
00:47:20,829 --> 00:47:24,559
their compensations actually heading downward what do I say to college

753
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:25,309
graduates

754
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:30,200
well berkeley students who are fair or seniors or even juniors

755
00:47:30,199 --> 00:47:34,358
are going to face a hard job market to its gonna be harder

756
00:47:34,358 --> 00:47:37,869
and for them to find the job they want they're gonna have to search longer

757
00:47:37,869 --> 00:47:41,530
but they're not gonna problem they are being trained

758
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:45,119
to be knowledge workers they're being trained to identify

759
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,838
and solve problems that they will be in demand

760
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:53,078
a and they will get good wages and good job but will we go back to something

761
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:54,900
like the old humphrey hawkins goal

762
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,950
4 percent unemployment is that even something anybody should

763
00:47:57,949 --> 00:48:01,199
think about I think we can go back

764
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:04,699
to what's not just a humphrey hawkins I mean we we'd

765
00:48:04,699 --> 00:48:09,039
had three and a half percent unemployment mean much of the country

766
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:14,858
a be in the late 1990s 22 million net new jobs

767
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:18,730
mainly because I was labor secretary I'm

768
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:22,750
know is mainly because alan greenspan

769
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:26,500
decided that he was not going to worry about inflation

770
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:30,400
he understood that globalization and technological change

771
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,389
were basically a guard against inflation

772
00:48:34,389 --> 00:48:37,818
there was not going to be wage price inflation unions where were much too

773
00:48:37,818 --> 00:48:39,519
weak for wage price inflation

774
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:42,530
and so angry inch. greenspan did something that was very important he

775
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:43,339
decided

776
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:47,099
to let the economy though as fast as I possibly could

777
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:49,990
and he got unemployment down to three and a half percent would actually raise

778
00:48:49,989 --> 00:48:51,959
the wages a people at the bottom

779
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,449
if you look at what happened would help the long-term

780
00:48:55,449 --> 00:48:59,519
to wages in the bottom 20 percent there's been no improvement except the

781
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,239
late 90's when you got down

782
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:05,639
that low I think we can do that again I don't think that's out of the question

783
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:09,368
the problem is what's the baseline from which you begin that in my concern

784
00:49:09,369 --> 00:49:12,818
is that so many people will have drops so are

785
00:49:12,818 --> 00:49:17,019
in terms of their wages not to mention jobs but just

786
00:49:17,019 --> 00:49:20,400
in terms of just keeping their their job or getting a job they will have to

787
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,730
settle for such low wages

788
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:24,849
at that even though you may get a wage increase

789
00:49:24,849 --> 00:49:28,640
because the labor market gets very tight eventually it's still not going to

790
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:30,159
compensate for those losses

791
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:35,358
you you mention gas prices do you worry what might happen in the Middle East

792
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:38,980
Iran or something like that could that be a surprise that could hurt

793
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:41,980
Barack Obama's reelection chances it could

794
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,369
and I'm sure the people in the white house are looking at that very carefully

795
00:49:45,369 --> 00:49:49,369
again it's if you look at supply and demand it's not so much

796
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:54,900
that Iran the he is a is a major contributor to global

797
00:49:54,900 --> 00:50:00,130
oil prices in fact the the demand for gas actually lowered now

798
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:03,210
than it was a two or three years ago

799
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:06,429
that the the problem is that you've got

800
00:50:06,429 --> 00:50:11,059
the I don't wanna I'm using I'm going to use the word speculator advisedly

801
00:50:11,059 --> 00:50:15,019
because these this is the futures market this is the way the market is organized

802
00:50:15,019 --> 00:50:15,548
there's nothing

803
00:50:15,548 --> 00:50:19,030
people not doing anything bad but given

804
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:23,960
that show many bets are being made on higher crude oil prices

805
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,960
but European crude and the US crude up

806
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,670
its it's having a negative affect on on gas prices

807
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:35,568
and and that could again as I said before that could and

808
00:50:35,568 --> 00:50:38,809
immediately I think what Obama may have to do

809
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:44,029
to prick that bubble is to threatened to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve

810
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:48,798
not now I wouldn't advise it now but if it looks like gas prices are getting

811
00:50:48,798 --> 00:50:53,318
out of control and speculative pressures are building the only way to Lance that

812
00:50:53,318 --> 00:50:57,440
is to is to threaten to use the trees Strategic Petroleum Reserve

813
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,619
so let's step back from all this the republicans would say

814
00:51:00,619 --> 00:51:04,700
the answer is more laissez-faire let that get get government out of all this

815
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:08,169
we certainly hear this from Ron Paul in the extreme but we also hear it from

816
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:11,480
Paul Ryan who you were debating and also Mitt Romney

817
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,309
I'll you would argue the government has a role to play

818
00:51:15,309 --> 00:51:19,259
but Ryan would come back and say cash the trouble is that government is in

819
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,190
control of all the special interests

820
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:24,630
and then even tonight he said you're worried about citizens united which is

821
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:29,420
why in fact the way the government gets to be in thrall to special interests

822
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,349
is there a way and then you said this is the United is not going to be a return

823
00:51:32,349 --> 00:51:33,710
anytime soon

824
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:37,150
is Paul Ryan maybe right at least for a while put together this

825
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:42,440
I think that we've got to a do several things with regard to

826
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:46,909
campaign finance reform I consistent with citizens united we can still

827
00:51:46,909 --> 00:51:49,989
have so far legally I mean the Supreme Court

828
00:51:49,989 --> 00:51:53,608
has not decided this one we can still have

829
00:51:53,608 --> 00:51:58,259
campaign finance public financing of campaigns

830
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:02,109
we can still have full disclosure I mean congress did not pass the Disclosure Act

831
00:52:02,108 --> 00:52:05,630
but we can still require full disclosure of who's contributing

832
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:09,240
to all of these even even the a

833
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:12,750
the for once the 501 C ford's that Karl Rove

834
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:15,780
and others running not the not just the super PACs

835
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:19,890
we can the also hope

836
00:52:19,889 --> 00:52:23,879
that the president appoints Supreme Court justices

837
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:29,390
only needs is one who will amendment services in United was 54

838
00:52:29,389 --> 00:52:32,519
I mean all we're talking about is one supreme court justice that

839
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:35,909
that moves to the other side and

840
00:52:35,909 --> 00:52:40,000
I don't know that those five Republican justices are all going to stay

841
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,289
there for ever a lot I'm a pretty young yes

842
00:52:43,289 --> 00:52:46,619
Clarence Thomas Kelly Roberts Valley 02

843
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:49,690
Alito the Hui Leonardi

844
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:53,088
Kennedy yes kennedy might be the only one who would retire but he's

845
00:52:53,088 --> 00:52:56,309
any could make a difference was okay and Kennedy is a swing vote

846
00:52:56,309 --> 00:52:59,969
II you know Kennedy is not nearly as rigidly ideological was the other

847
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:03,259
right I'm is more like the democrats are going to leave the Supreme Court I think

848
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:04,560
given the age structure

849
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:08,519
ginsburg for example or something you're just a beloved lab I'm sorry any

850
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:11,798
hey you're the guy who was saying all this stuff about well I think

851
00:53:11,798 --> 00:53:15,019
look and I think sitting down in the queue problem I just want to make a

852
00:53:15,019 --> 00:53:16,329
point I think their ways

853
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:20,769
that there are other things that can be done but the the general point

854
00:53:20,769 --> 00:53:24,750
that I wanna make about all of this is that it's not so much the size

855
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:28,019
have the government that is the issue it who government is for

856
00:53:28,019 --> 00:53:32,059
government is is actually working for and we talk about even the budget

857
00:53:32,059 --> 00:53:32,980
deficit

858
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:37,980
up why do we have a big budget deficit in the out years we we had mostly

859
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:41,929
a combination oven aging baby boomer cohort

860
00:53:41,929 --> 00:53:45,480
combined with health care costs they're going through the roof

861
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:49,528
why can't we do anything about health care costs partly because

862
00:53:49,528 --> 00:53:54,500
we've got a Big Pharma with industry a pharmaceutical industry that

863
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:58,659
absolutely refuses to allow medicare to use as bargaining leverage

864
00:53:58,659 --> 00:54:02,989
to get down drug prices refuses to allow us to get drugs from Canada

865
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:06,059
we got a hospital system and an insurance system

866
00:54:06,059 --> 00:54:10,449
that refused to allow us to have a public option or Medicare for All

867
00:54:10,449 --> 00:54:13,548
which would be much cheaper than having this all

868
00:54:13,548 --> 00:54:16,980
run by a private insurance system as it is right now

869
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:21,079
up so one of the reasons why

870
00:54:21,079 --> 00:54:24,710
one of the reasons why we are we are faced with huge budget deficits

871
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:28,420
is the same special interest dominance as we have been so much

872
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:32,338
I so much else in the country up or a more government

873
00:54:32,338 --> 00:54:35,358
the in other words instead up

874
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:38,929
talking about this as a big-government Perseus more government issue

875
00:54:38,929 --> 00:54:42,899
we should be talking about this his as it has a question of Government

876
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,170
Accountability

877
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:47,450
to democracy and and that's what

878
00:54:47,449 --> 00:54:51,189
really is at stake here also let's return to the mica politics how is

879
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:54,250
Barack Obama gonna run his campaign in the fall and you think there's a chance

880
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:55,298
he could make an

881
00:54:55,298 --> 00:54:58,829
argument that will allow him to get

882
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:02,339
some kind of support for the kinds of policies you're talking about

883
00:55:02,338 --> 00:55:05,719
where he competed he did read again if you haven't

884
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:09,659
that that speech that December 6 Beach

885
00:55:09,659 --> 00:55:13,170
Suwanee I so want to me in Kansas because it

886
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:16,710
it it was not only in my view is best speech but it did

887
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:20,940
outline a world view that he is to my way of thinking very accurate

888
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:25,500
about what is wrong with our democracy and what is wrong with our economy

889
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,940
the question is how

890
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:32,088
how willing and able he feels he can be

891
00:55:32,088 --> 00:55:38,199
to push those teams into concrete political objectives and programs during

892
00:55:38,199 --> 00:55:39,750
the course of the campaign

893
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:43,500
if Mitt Romney is his opponent he may be more

894
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,579
able or may feel more able and willing to do that then

895
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:49,589
if his opponent is say Rick Santorum

896
00:55:49,588 --> 00:55:52,679
Mitt Romney is the epitome

897
00:55:52,679 --> 00:55:56,358
love the the above the plutocratic

898
00:55:56,358 --> 00:55:59,739
in america and the pen to me for everything that

899
00:55:59,739 --> 00:56:03,219
not only citizens united foreshock foresaw

900
00:56:03,219 --> 00:56:07,028
but what has gone wrong with

901
00:56:07,028 --> 00:56:10,298
with the abuse wealth and power in this country let me let me and with this

902
00:56:10,298 --> 00:56:12,619
question because I've heard you speak eloquently about

903
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:17,318
doubt this is that summer what we see these days is definitely the politics of

904
00:56:17,318 --> 00:56:17,989
resentment

905
00:56:17,989 --> 00:56:21,338
in it it's worrisome it seems when we hear it but I hear

906
00:56:21,338 --> 00:56:24,219
I've heard you speak about the importance of solidarity and how that's

907
00:56:24,219 --> 00:56:25,858
really a fundamental value

908
00:56:25,858 --> 00:56:30,659
that has to underlie politics a is it really possible for us to do have more

909
00:56:30,659 --> 00:56:32,389
solidarity in this country to

910
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:36,338
have a sense that it's important for the rich to pay their

911
00:56:36,338 --> 00:56:41,298
fair share of taxes for all of us to help those who are downtrodden

912
00:56:41,298 --> 00:56:46,088
for all of us to feel a sense a commitment to the country that involves

913
00:56:46,088 --> 00:56:47,250
helping one another

914
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:51,199
is that possible the court said possible Afghan fact it is

915
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:56,118
it is it is necessary but I think it is the product usually

916
00:56:56,119 --> 00:56:59,210
have the country going through some sort have

917
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:02,710
stressful period together a we sought

918
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:06,039
in the in you know the Great Depression and World War two

919
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:09,949
we sought in the cold war up we could have seen it it seems to me

920
00:57:09,949 --> 00:57:13,338
after a right after 9/11

921
00:57:13,338 --> 00:57:16,778
because each in those and why didn't we well we

922
00:57:16,778 --> 00:57:19,759
we didn't because in in my humble opinion we didn't have the kind of

923
00:57:19,759 --> 00:57:20,429
leadership

924
00:57:20,429 --> 00:57:24,500
that asked us to do anything other than go shopping but

925
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,699
but but but we have in this country I think

926
00:57:27,699 --> 00:57:30,919
aid to kindsa patriotism

927
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:33,990
if you were one is a kind of negative patriotism

928
00:57:33,989 --> 00:57:38,559
in which where the best it's a it's a very zero-sum

929
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,139
kinda view of the world it to raising a phobic

930
00:57:42,139 --> 00:57:45,509
it's kind of nice it very nationalistic and

931
00:57:45,509 --> 00:57:50,000
its it brings out sums as some very negative aspect where

932
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,699
national character but there's also a positive aspect to patriotism

933
00:57:53,699 --> 00:57:57,759
in which we feel that we have mutual obligations to one another

934
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:02,000
as citizens are the same society and we have felt that before

935
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,730
with the right leaders and under the right circumstances and we we can feel

936
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:07,199
it again

937
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:12,480
and we much if we're going to actually embrace and take on the challenges

938
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,480
a future we have to

939
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:22,480
thank you rob a rush
