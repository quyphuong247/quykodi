MATT MCGARRITY: So this week, we have tried to-- as we did with your informative

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,330
speech a while back--

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,720
move you from your idea to completed outline.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,090
We started this week by talking about if you wanted to use counter

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,660
arguments, how you would do that.

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,240
Then we moved through some strategies for counter arguments.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,930
We talked a little bit about arrangement and congruency.

8
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,840
And now, we've ended with fallacies.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,820
So by the end of this week, what I want you to be able to have is some

10
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,420
tools for thinking through creating persuasive cases and arranging them

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,700
well, and then also some tools for identifying and avoiding fallacies in

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,230
your persuasive arguments.

13
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,880
My hope is, if you're working on a persuasive speech now, either for this

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,440
class or somewhere else, that at this point, you've got something, you've

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,320
got an outline, you've got your key components, because what we're going

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,890
to do next week is we're going to take that skeleton, that skeletal frame,

17
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,420
and start putting some flesh on it.

18
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,040
And that flesh is going to be style and rich language.

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,560
But in order to get there, we're got to make sure that that evidence, that

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,440
argument is in its place.

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,180
And then we can really turn it into some interesting, some moving oratory.

22
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,567
