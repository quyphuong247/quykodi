MATT MCGARRITY: Hi, and welcome to week two.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,930
At the very beginning of this week's material what I would like to do is

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,640
just lay out what we're going to be doing.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,320
So we're starting in on the impromptu speech.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,980
And last week was about general orientation.

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,000
And this week we're going to get to work on these assignments.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,070
So we're going to begin this week's material with

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,520
some assignment overview.

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,210
So I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page in terms of what

10
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,170
we're doing in this assignment, why we're doing it, and how it's going to

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,230
help you as a speaker.

12
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,360
So once we've got that orientation material out of the way we're going to

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,420
shift into talking about a model of argument, something that is going to

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,340
be very important for the impromptu speeches that we're working on.

15
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,630
From there we're going to work on coming up with the main points.

16
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,510
And I'm going to ask you to come up with a lot of main points.

17
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,970
After we're done with the main points we'll move on to coming up with

18
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,260
evidence and talking about your evidence.

19
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,420
So my goal is that by the end of this week's material you have a model for

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,440
quickly coming up with basic presentations that you

21
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,730
can use almost anywhere.

22
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:02,980
