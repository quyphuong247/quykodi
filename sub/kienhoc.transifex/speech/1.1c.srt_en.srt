00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:04,500
MATT MCGARRITY:I would like to spend a little bit of time talking about what

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,700
we're doing and why we're doing it in this class.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,790
Kind of give you a sense for how we've laid out these 10 weeks.

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,770
You may remember in the last lecture, we talked about the big skill goals,

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,620
sort of the meta goals for this course.

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,790
Designing clear presentations and delivering them in an engaging way.

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,940
I want to go through these and talk about how we sort of broken these down

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,120
to smaller goals, and then how we've organized a class time

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,420
around these goals.

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,820
So in terms of more specific course objectives, by the end of our time

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,620
together, you should be able to design, and deliver basic

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,540
presentations concisely.

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,270
We'll see this in the impromptu speech.

14
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,190
You should be able to design and deliver informative presentations

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,650
clearly, design and deliver complex arguments persuasively.

16
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,670
Beyond that, sort of a general goal that we'll advance to all the

17
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:53,280
assignments are working on the ability to speak confidently with appropriate

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,460
rate, projection, movement, and vocal variety.

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,900
And then finally and just as importantly, being able to evaluate

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,120
and critique speeches insightful.

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,390
The great thing about that is once you really sort of start getting better at

22
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,800
speech criticism, then all the speeches that you watch become

23
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,600
resources that you can use for your own improvement.

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,870
So I've organized a class around the assignments.

25
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,310
And that's because I look at these assignments as buckets for skills.

26
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,260
I'm interested in very specific skills and the way I can bring those together

27
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,100
and talk about then as a coherent whole is through the assignments.

28
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,690
So I want to spend a little bit of time talking about each one of the

29
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,330
assignments.

30
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,420
So we're going to start off next week with the impromptu speech.

31
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,930
The impromptu speech is a short three to six minute two point speech.

32
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,840
The goal here is to get you to the point where you can quickly organize a

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,200
speech that sounds good.

34
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,050
In working on this assignment, we're really going to be trying to master

35
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,665
some of the basics of good speaking.

36
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:55,430
Yo know, can you arrange something quickly, talk about the evidence well,

37
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,890
and make it easy for an audience to follow along with?

38
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,040
So that's the impromptu speech.

39
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,100
Once we've got that taken care of, we'll move on to

40
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,450
the informative speech.

41
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,720
Now, the informative speech is a little bit longer.

42
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,810
It's a 5 to 10 minute speech that educates an audience on a topic.

43
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,740
So here, one of the challenges is being able to explain complex details,

44
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,600
complex evidence in a way that is accessible for an audience.

45
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,080
So you might think of these informative speeches in terms of TED

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,740
talks or ignite talks.

47
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,130
And these can range from you telling us something about your hometown to

48
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,500
explaining a scientific theory.

49
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,170
So just really being able to explain data to an audience of listeners.

50
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,330
And then finally, we'll end on the persuasive speech.

51
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:41,120
Again, this is a 5 to 10 minute speech that attempts to shift audience

52
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,200
opinion or raise audience awareness on a topic.

53
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,170
So here, we want to be able to motivate the audience

54
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,600
through clear arguments.

55
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,230
We're really trying to pull together claims and evidence in a way that is

56
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,120
persuasive.

57
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,800
Now, these assignments structure our time.

58
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,770
So if you take a look at the 10 weeks that we've got together, this first

59
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,670
week is devoted to course overview and key terms.

60
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,530
We're in that process right now.

61
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,410
Then on week two, we start off with preparing impromptu speeches and then

62
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,480
delivering impromptu speeches.

63
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,160
Then we move on to basics of informative speaking, preparing an

64
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,690
informative speech, delivering an informative speech.

65
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,550
So to again with the persuasive.

66
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:24,190
And then we have a final week where we reflect on all of this.

67
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,570
You'll notice each one of these we kind of move through a

68
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,710
very similar pattern.

69
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,550
So we'll start of by developing the speeches core idea.

70
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,710
Then we'll think about sort of arrangement, phrasing of those ideas

71
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,980
in a way that's going to work.

72
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,110
Then we'll spend a fair bit of time talking about delivery in general,

73
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,770
specifically on that type of speech.

74
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,170
And then we'll move on with that but that assignment.

75
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:48,730
Now, for each one of these assignments you can record and post a version of

76
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,760
this speech online to receive peer feedback.

77
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,610
That is totally up to you, I'll talk more to that at the end of this week.

78
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,560
You can record a video of that and receive peer feedback.

79
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,920
You don't have too, and in fact, I tried to create these assignments so

80
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,500
that even if you didn't post a video, you could use those three weeks

81
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,720
devoted to the informative speech to prepare your next business

82
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,220
presentation.

83
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,650
That's the idea, you can take all of that, use it to prepare that business

84
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,500
presentation.

85
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,140
And then, do that business presentation much better than you

86
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,770
would have without that background, without that opportunity to reflect.

87
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,380
So I do want you to record and post speeches online, if it works for your

88
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,560
goals for this course.

89
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,030
If you're going to be doing presentations outside of this course

90
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,670
and that's where you want to put your time and attention, I think that's

91
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,180
just great.

92
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,890
I want this course to be available to bend in that way.

93
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,020
This should be resource.

94
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,470
But once again, so if we look at these three assignments; the impromptu, the

95
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,960
informative, and the persuasive, that's a deliberate order.

96
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:55,090
Because we're moving from more simple to more complex.

97
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,690
We scale up with each speech.

98
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,550
So we'll start off with the impromptu speech.

99
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,230
Great usable model and you use this almost anywhere.

100
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,300
But it has fewer moving pieces.

101
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,190
So we'll really work on the impromptu speech.

102
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,950
And then once we've got that taken care of, we'll move on to the

103
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,510
informative speech, which taps a lot of those skills that we worked on in

104
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,410
the impromptu.

105
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,390
But has more moving pieces, it's a little bit more complex.

106
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,610
And then we'll take that and we'll move it on into the persuasive speech.

107
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,480
We're using a lot of those informative skills, but persuasive speech is more

108
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,530
complex, doing different things.

109
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,840
And in educational theory, we might call this scaffolding.

110
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,350
We're building up to a point and then you're performing something, we build

111
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,130
up to the next point.

112
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,410
So with this sort of orientation completely, we've talked about

113
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,210
speaking situations, we've talked about general goals for the course,

114
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,890
and we've talked about specific goals for the course, and the assignments.

115
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,730
So that's sort of the orientation portion of this week.

116
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,750
In the next lecture, I want to start talking about some key ideas, some key

117
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,410
definitions.

118
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,460
And we're going to start with the much maligned an often

119
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,960
understood key term rhetoric.

120
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,367
