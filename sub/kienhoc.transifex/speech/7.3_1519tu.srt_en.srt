MATT McGARRITY: Now that we've overviewed the assignment in general,

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,710
I want move through, bit by bit, what the rubric is all about.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,580
Once again, this is just a way of providing us with a common set of

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,470
definitions.

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,570
Also, it will structure our time for the next couple of weeks.

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,490
So as it has been in the past, I'm looking in terms of invention,

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,440
arrangement, style, memory, and delivery.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,730
So, under invention.

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,580
In the past, I've broken this into two categories.

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,500
Here it's just one, and we've broken delivery into two categories.

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,950
So under invention, we're looking for, does the speaker discuss the ill and

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,890
blame and consequences, if applicable, effectively and appropriately?

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,100
As we'll see at the end of this week, these are part of the stock issues.

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,490
And I think these are exceptionally useful to you in advocating your case.

15
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:50,450
So are you discussing ill effectively and appropriately?

16
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,120
Did you discuss a cure effectively and appropriately?

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,630
Ill is problem and cure is solution.

18
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,510
So did you discuss both sides of the coin effectively and appropriately,

19
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,030
and then call to action?

20
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,090
Do you have these recommendations?

21
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,220
Do you end with something that we, as audience members, can do?

22
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,650
Beyond that, do you have congruent argument elements?

23
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,930
Meaning they all fit together.

24
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,780
So it's almost a call and response.

25
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,950
You've identified a problem and you've solved for that

26
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,340
problem in the same speech.

27
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:23,240
So you're thinking through how these argument bits fit together.

28
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,190
And then of course, you're using evidence effectively and

29
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,120
appropriately, where you need it in order to make that case

30
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,260
a compelling one.

31
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,900
In terms of arrangement, I would say my concerns are less with overt

32
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,330
arrangement in this speech.

33
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,720
Certainly in the impromptu, it was almost primarily about the

34
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,670
arrangement, right?

35
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,070
It was being able to have that two point speech.

36
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,760
In the informative speech, in order to be clear, the goal was clarity.

37
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,430
And so arrangement played a pretty important role.

38
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,460
You wanted to walk us through how you had organized that information,

39
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,085
because that was part of helping us understand that information.

40
00:02:01,085 --> 00:02:04,670
In the persuasive speech, the goal is to make your case and

41
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,240
motivate us to action.

42
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,280
So in that sense, arrangement needs to be oriented towards that

43
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,190
motivational end.

44
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,440
Maybe that has you saying, I've got three issues I want

45
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,280
to talk, maybe not.

46
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,910
So I'm more concerned with the effect of the arrangement then with the overt

47
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,560
nature of the arrangement.

48
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,570
So under arrangement we would say, the speaker oriented the audience to the

49
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,700
topic in the introduction appropriately and effectively, however

50
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:36,750
you do that, so long as it's the right fit for that topic.

51
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,940
Arrange the speech in a clear and compelling manner.

52
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,850
So I don't mean that your speech would be confusing.

53
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,860
Just because we're getting rid of sign post words doesn't mean all of a

54
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,340
sudden we're getting rid of any concern with arrangement.

55
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,000
But arrangements here means how you're structuring the speech

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,620
for a specific end.

57
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,270
If the goal is to motivate us to action, arrange the speech in that

58
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,580
way, right?

59
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,830
So you've organize a speech in a way that works for your goal, for that

60
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,660
motivational endpoint.

61
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,100
And then, of course, you conclude the speech in an effective

62
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,300
and appropriate way.

63
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,530
So we're thinking more broadly in terms of arrangement rather than nuts

64
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,460
and bolts of arrangement.

65
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,950
How is arrangement helping you achieve your goal in that speech?

66
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,785
Then we get into style.

67
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:25,755
And style's really where we're moving away from what we've done previously,

68
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:27,040
in a good way.

69
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,070
So the impromptu speech was very plain-spoken style, right?

70
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,870
It was stuff that you quickly pulled together.

71
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,710
It was very conversational.

72
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,350
In terms of preparation and note card use, pretty minimal outline.

73
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,950
Informative speech, well, you had to make some very

74
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,610
specific language choices.

75
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,240
You wanted to avoid jargon.

76
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,060
You wanted to define certain terms.

77
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,780
And you wanted to use analogies and examples and illustrations as a way of

78
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,060
achieving your end in that speech clarity.

79
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,430
Now we get into the persuasive speech, this advocacy speech.

80
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,600
And so here, we're dealing much more in that high form of oratory.

81
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,530
Certainly when people think about speeches that they love and remember,

82
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:10,220
they have this stylistic attention to them, this richness, this

83
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,950
motivational capacity.

84
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,570
And now we're getting into that.

85
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:18,320
So does the speaker in the speech use stylistic and strategic language

86
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,640
appropriately and effectively?

87
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,670
Does the speaker demonstrate a persuasive ethos, which is similar to

88
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,370
but different in some ways from the informative ethos you

89
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,130
had in the last speech?

90
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:34,910
Then I went ahead and I broke delivery and memory into two categories here.

91
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,460
And I had trouble naming them.

92
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,730
I have something after a colon on each one of these.

93
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,670
So I was trying to think, well, what's going on here?

94
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:44,160
And as I stepped back, I thought, well, what I'm talking about in this

95
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,060
first delivery component are really kind of advanced delivery issues.

96
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,610
I don't want to minimize the importance of those

97
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,030
basic delivery elements.

98
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,410
But I do want to suggest that now, at the end of this course, we've done a

99
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,610
lot with delivery.

100
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,910
And now we can start getting our hands deeper and deeper into what's really

101
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,250
making a speech engaging, compelling.

102
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:11,670
What's making the speaker stand out as having gravitas, as arete, in their

103
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,990
speaking encounters?

104
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,290
So we get into this first category of delivery-- which, I would say,

105
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,780
delivery is sort of advanced categories.

106
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,600
So in style, you've got these stylistic and strategic language

107
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,900
devices in your speech.

108
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,390
You've written them in well.

109
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,700
That's in and of itself insufficient.

110
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:33,100
You have to be able to deliver that stylistic device in a way that sounds

111
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,360
good, that so I say that you've captured the rhythm of the stylistic

112
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,500
devices used.

113
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,870
Because something that's well-written but flatly delivered misses out on the

114
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:47,210
unique opportunities of spoken language.

115
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,540
And so really, being able to think about the other side of this.

116
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,920
Remember in the delivery exercises for the informative speeches, I was having

117
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:00,160
you read some poetry, I was having you read some famous speeched.

118
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,880
Here's where we're trying to do more of that.

119
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,880
We're trying to get at the delivery devices used.

120
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,140
Also, another sort of advanced delivery category, included a variety

121
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,170
of effective and appropriate levels and tones.

122
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:20,150
By this I mean there are different feelings and movements

123
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,610
in the speech itself.

124
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,560
So if you're talking about an issue that we want to solve, if there's a

125
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,010
problem and there's a solution, you shouldn't sound angry

126
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,330
on both sides, right?

127
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,320
You can be angry at the problem, maybe explanatory.

128
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,430
It sounds explanatory, feels explanatory in the cause.

129
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,040
And then on the solution and the call to action, you should probably be more

130
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,800
motivational.

131
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,440
If you're angry throughout the whole thing, that's a pretty

132
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,120
flat speech, OK?

133
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,810
You may not be monotone, but you're mono-emotional.

134
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,020
I don't know if that's a thing.

135
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,500
But we want to be able to see that there's movement and change and a

136
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,670
feeling of difference throughout the speech.

137
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,040
OK, so this is another one of these sort of advanced delivery issues.

138
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,320
And then finally under this advanced delivery stuff, we're carrying

139
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,810
something over for the informative, which is you're helping us distinguish

140
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,250
between key ideas and elaborating detail.

141
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,050
So you're still going to have evidence in this speech.

142
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,050
Once again, we want to make sure that evidence stays in its appropriate

143
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,390
place, driving those claims, driving those key ideas.

144
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,770
Then we return to that delivery category that's a bit more basic,

145
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,890
which we've seen a lot in the past.

146
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:30,500
OK, this has held true largely from the impromptu speech to now.

147
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,360
Are you using projection and notes appropriately and effectively?

148
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,660
Are you using vocal variety and movement and gestures appropriately

149
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,580
and effectively?

150
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,880
That hadn't changed.

151
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,670
But now, we're taking those core ideas and we're adding in these other

152
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:48,080
aspects of style and delivery and emotional tones and movement

153
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,940
throughout the entire speech.

154
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,560
So that's the rubric for this assignment, the feedback form for this

155
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,310
assignment.

156
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:59,510
And as always, you should think about this form as a way of organizing your

157
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,950
thoughts on this speech, as a way of organizing your thoughts on the very

158
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,760
issue of persuasive speaking.

159
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,170
It certainly is going to structure our time.

160
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,140
We're going to take up stock issues at the end of this week and then move

161
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,320
through the various other elements of that rubric.

162
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,260
But in using these rubrics, what I want you to be able to do is increase

163
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:24,520
your critical acumen as a listener, both in general when you're doing

164
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,280
stuff outside of this class, and most certainly if you choose to upload a

165
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,580
speech and go through the peer review system.

166
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,470
I want to make sure that you are providing quality speech feedback.

167
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:38,970
It makes you better as a speaker, and it helps others as well.

168
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,320
So with that, we'll end our discussion of the rubric.

169
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,850
And in the next lecture, we'll take a look at a sample speech and examine it

170
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,100
through the rubric.

171
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,710
