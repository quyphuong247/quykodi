MATT MCGARRITY: Having looked at the rubric, let's go ahead and put the

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,860
rubric into practice.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,500
What we're going to do is, as we did with the impromptu, now that we've

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,460
gone through the rubric.

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,250
We're going to go and take a look at a sample informative speech.

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,940
What I would like you did do is go ahead and have a copy of the rubric in

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,740
front of you.

8
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,150
If that's something that you're in a space where you can do that.

9
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,180
There's certainly a link to a downloadable form of the rubric.

10
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,700
If nothing else, just revisit what those categories are.

11
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,210
But I want you to watch this following speech with the rubric in mind.

12
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,700
And then at the end of the speech I'll come back with a few light comments.

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,090
And then push you to my written feedback on that same said speech.

14
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,380
So let's go ahead and take a look at the sample speech now.

15
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,080
SPEAKER 1: Tooth enamel is the hardest substance in the human body.

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,800
Each tooth is innovated and incredibly sensitive.

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,710
But despite teeth being the living stone of our bodies, cavities are a

18
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,200
common phenomenon.

19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,750
Many people get them from poor hygiene, but others get them for

20
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,710
several reasons as well.

21
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,970
In fact, there are the most common chronic disease in children and teens.

22
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,770
And according to the CDC, nine out of ten adults have some

23
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,320
form of tooth decay.

24
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,830
Now, this doesn't always mean cavities.

25
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:14,050
But it can mean demineralization that can weaken the enamel and drastically

26
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:18,850
increase the chances of getting cavities as age increases.

27
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:22,400
And so today we'll go through several aspects of dental cavities.

28
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,580
Including how they form, why people get cavities, how cavities are

29
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,990
treated, and finally, how they are prevented.

30
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:35,890
So firstly, a cavity forms in several steps in varying levels of severity.

31
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,220
This can occur anywhere on a tooth, but the most common areas of tooth

32
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,930
decay are in between the teeth, as well on the occlusal biting surface.

33
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:48,380
And so the first initiating step of a cavity formation is bacteria.

34
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,570
A common bacteria that can cause cavities is Streptococcus mutans.

35
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,150
Now what this bacteria does, is it consumes the sugar that we consume and

36
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,310
will release acid.

37
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,660
Now this acid will demineralize the tooth by stripping

38
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,780
away the calcium phosphate.

39
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,580
And so as this erosion continues we get penetration into the enamel and

40
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,520
this causes a cavity.

41
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,880
And if this isn't treated promptly then the bacteria and acid will

42
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,120
continue to penetrate deeper into the tooth, into the soft dentin.

43
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,860
Now the problem with this is that dentin doesn't have that hard barrier

44
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,720
that enamel does.

45
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,900
And so once a cavity reaches this level, it proceeds quite quickly.

46
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,300
And the last step of the cavity is infection of the pulp.

47
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,490
And this is the inner nerves of the two can be quite painful.

48
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,560
But so now that we know a little bit more about the steps of a cavity, I'd

49
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,860
like to talk a little bit about how each cavity is treated.

50
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,370
Now, treatment of cavities will vary depending on what stage of

51
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,830
demineralization or decay a tooth is at.

52
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,350
And so at the smallest level, a sealant is something that treats

53
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,600
demineralization.

54
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,570
And a sealant is essentially a small filling that covers the

55
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,020
surface of the tooth.

56
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,040
And the good thing about this is the only requires a little roughening of

57
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,280
the surface to allow the sealant to bind.

58
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,700
And it doesn't require any anesthetic.

59
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,540
But perhaps something that we are more familiar with are fillings.

60
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,270
Now fillings treat cavities that have penetrated into the enamel as well

61
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,650
into the dentin.

62
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,840
And so there are two types of fillings that are commonly used today.

63
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,160
The first one is composite filling.

64
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,940
Composite is a resin based material that matches tooth color quite well.

65
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,260
But the best thing about it is that only last five to ten years.

66
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,130
However composite filling is quite flexible.

67
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,960
And by flexible I mean that it can bend with the different

68
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,530
pressures of the tooth.

69
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,520
On the flip side, amalgam is the second type of filling that isn't

70
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,890
quite as commonly used today anymore.

71
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,670
An amalgam is essentially a metal alloy.

72
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,690
And then last several years, but it's incredibly unappealing.

73
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,830
It's that silver filling that appears on some teeth.

74
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,470
And because this metal alloy is so hard, it doesn't allow for flexibility

75
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:03,980
in the tooth.

76
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,410
And what can happen is, after several years of having an amalgam filling,

77
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,280
cracks in the teeth can form due to this hard inflexible

78
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,130
material inside the tooth.

79
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:20,000
Finally, after filling at the very deepest stage of the cavity, when the

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,900
bacteria have infected the pulp, a cavity won't treat the problem.

81
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,400
And so what happens is a root canal or extraction might be necessary to

82
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,180
prevent further infection.

83
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,630
So we can see that treatment of cavities is quite variable.

84
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,000
But additionally, there are several reasons why people get cavities, and

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,080
these are quite diverse as well.

86
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,380
This can be due to both oral hygiene, as well as genetic influences.

87
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,990
So I'd like to talk a little bit more about oral hygiene.

88
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,110
Well, most of us know that brushing and flossing are incredibly important

89
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,840
in maintaining oral health.

90
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,720
And this is due to plaque.

91
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,840
And so if we don't brush and floss multiple times then what can happen is

92
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,130
plaque starts to form and tartar builds up from this plaque.

93
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,820
And this can cause inflammation of the gums or gingivitis.

94
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,990
Now if this isn't treated, then the gums will begin to recede and expose

95
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,460
the root of the tooth.

96
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,950
Now the root of the tooth doesn't have this hard first layer of enamel

97
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,660
protecting it.

98
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:23,390
And so, what will happen is bacteria will tend to form cavities on the roof

99
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,390
surface of the tooth.

100
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,560
Now another component to oral hygiene is what foods we eat.

101
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,730
So for people who eat a lot of acidic foods they're actually aiding in the

102
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,460
direct erosion of their enamel.

103
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,580
And likewise people who eat a lot of sugary foods or foods with a lot of

104
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,250
carbohydrates will aid in providing food for the bacteria that will in

105
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,440
turn produce the acid.

106
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,260
And so, for people who eat a lot of acidic and sugary foods they are quite

107
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,260
prone to cavities.

108
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,760
Now, besides from oral hygiene, there's also a

109
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,510
genetic factor to cavities.

110
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:01,570
And so the biggest component to genetics is how conducive our mouths

111
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,570
are to different bacterial strains.

112
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,520
So some people may not have a conducive environment in their mouth

113
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,210
for a bacteria like Streptococcus mutans.

114
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,690
And so for these people they can be as much sugar as they want, as many

115
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,860
carbohydrates as they want, but they won't have the bacteria that will

116
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,020
consume that and release that acid.

117
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,470
And so they won't be quite as prone to cavities.

118
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,380
The second component to genetics is salivary production.

119
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,730
So saliva acts as a great buffer.

120
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,980
And what this means is that when we consume foods that are low in pH, so

121
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,560
very acidic, or high pH, which are very basic, then saliva acts as a

122
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,660
buffer to neutralize these foods and keep our mouths very neutral.

123
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,350
Now for people who don't produce a lot of saliva they can neutralize these

124
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,190
acids as well.

125
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,790
And so, therefore, they'll have more erosion from the acid and be more

126
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,660
prone to cavities.

127
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,360
So because there's so many reasons why people get cavities, there are also

128
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,850
several methods of prevention that have proven quite effective outside of

129
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,890
just oral hygiene and biannual cleanings.

130
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,240
The first one of these methods is fluoridation.

131
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,300
Fluoride is a great substance that will protect the enamel by making it

132
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,560
harder for bacteria--

133
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,860
the acid-- to strip away the calcium phosphate.

134
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,420
And so many cities have actually mandated that all their water supplies

135
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,470
be fluoridated.

136
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,650
And this has drastically decreased the amount of cavities seen in

137
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,760
children and teens.

138
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,740
In a similar manner, people who are quite prone to cavities are often

139
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,830
prescribed prescription toothpaste, which has higher levels of fluoride

140
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:41,200
and so can directly aid in preventing the stripping away enamel as well.

141
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,890
Second method of prevention is simply limiting the carbohydrates in acidic

142
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:51,940
foods that we intake, to both directly and indirectly prevent the erosion.

143
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:58,650
When we can't limit our carbohydrate and acid intake, brushing and drinking

144
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,070
water right after eating these foods can help in neutralizing

145
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,500
the pH in our mouths.

146
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,700
Now to talk about genetics, well, it's more difficult

147
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,570
to treat these problems.

148
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,870
But a great product that has been released are Biotene products.

149
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:18,860
Now, Biotene products are a series of products that will actually increase

150
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,000
salivary flow.

151
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,640
And so it's been quite helpful for people with dry mouth in increasing

152
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,190
their salivary production to increase the buffering

153
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,470
capacities of their mouths.

154
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:34,710
So today we talked about how cavities form, how they're treated, why people

155
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,390
get cavities, and finally, how cavities are prevented.

156
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,900
Now we can see that the mouth is an extraordinarily complex organ, and

157
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,710
every tooth is equally complex as well.

158
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:48,120
So while the process of cavitation, and the treatment, are fairly

159
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,480
consistent, the causes of decay can vary tremendously, and as a result

160
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,130
preventive measures very as well.

161
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,740
MATT MCGARRITY: Having just taken a look at that informative speech, go

162
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,710
ahead and make sure that you've written some commentary on this.

163
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:06,070
Or at least you've thought about that speech in reference to the grading

164
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,850
rubric, the feedback form.

165
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,270
And now go ahead and take a look at what my written comments are.

166
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:15,790
Just as a way of starting the process of taking that feedback form as a

167
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:20,050
general ideas, a set of key ideas and starting to put some flesh on them.

168
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,280
Being able to sort of come to some sort of communal meaning about what

169
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,500
those terms mean and how they might feed into evaluation of

170
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,490
