00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,370
MATT MCGARRITY: This also raises the larger issue of vocal variety.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,300
So vocal variety is all encompassing term meaning that there's just some--

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,920
there's a whole bunch of difference going on.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,400
In many ways, as we would have when we are engaged in

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,910
conversational speaking.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,110
So in the informative speech, one thing I'm asking you to try out is

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:24,750
trying to convey a sense of enthusiasm or excitement about your topic matter.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,910
And in order to do that, we probably need a variety of speeds,

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,430
pitches, and tones.

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,640
So I want to spend a little bit more time talking to this sort of vocal

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,970
variety in terms of tone.

12
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,400
So we don't to be monotone, right?

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,020
That's one of the absolutes--

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,020
the things we want to avoid.

15
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,660
Monotone is going to-- it rarely happens in conversational speech--

16
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,230
right?

17
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,900
When we're engaging in normal everyday talk with one another, we don't

18
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,620
necessarily fall on to a monotone.

19
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,880
We play around with pitch.

20
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,570
Now, the danger is when we stand up to speak-- either because we're so

21
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,530
focused on our notes or worried about how the concept is going to sound-- we

22
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,310
might fall into that monotone.

23
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,290
And we certainly want to avoid that.

24
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,050
So how do you avoid monotone?

25
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,680
This is one of the persistent challenges in speech coaching.

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,690
And the answer is, well, you can't really plan your way too much around

27
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,820
avoiding monotone without having it sound weird, right?

28
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,500
And so [HIGH PITCHED]

29
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:18,855
today--

30
00:01:18,855 --> 00:01:19,210
[NORMAL SPEECH]

31
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:19,750
you know--

32
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:19,920
[LOW PITCHED]

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,142
I would like to [HIGH PITCHED]

34
00:01:21,142 --> 00:01:21,540
look at.

35
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,850
You know, it would be very odd if you were really planning out too much of

36
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,340
your tonal shifts.

37
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,510
But there's one thing that we can do.

38
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,710
And that is we can practice with tonal changes.

39
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,230
So I've got a couple of exercises that you might try as a way expanding your

40
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,460
vocal variety range.

41
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,430
Now, you can do these in general just as general exercises to get better

42
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,360
with playing with tone and pitch and rate.

43
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,770
But also, they're very good warm ups.

44
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,200
So if you're going to deliver a speech, maybe one of the things that

45
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,830
you do before you do that speech is warm up.

46
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,460
All right-- your voice as an instrument.

47
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,310
You know, if you're playing a game or if you're playing an instrument, you'd

48
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,630
want to warm up ahead of time.

49
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,530
So too with your voice.

50
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,610
So you want to sort of prime the mental pump.

51
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,570
You want to get the muscles moving.

52
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,970
So these are some exercises that you can do.

53
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,720
One-- to help increase your vocal variety overall.

54
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,580
But also, you can be doing these as a way of warming up just prior to

55
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,880
delivering a speech.

56
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,720
So one of these ways of increasing your vocal variety.

57
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,330
Take a single line.

58
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,210
And read the same line through with a variety of different tonal changes and

59
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,070
a variety of different emotional hints.

60
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:37,400
So you could take a very blase line like, "The store ran out of bread."

61
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,940
And you deliver that 100 different ways.

62
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,510
"The store ran out of bread."

63
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,320
"The STORE ran out of bread." [INQUIRING]

64
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,940
"The store ran out of bread?" [ANGRILY]

65
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,915
"The store RAN OUT of BREAD." Of what?

66
00:02:47,915 --> 00:02:48,090
[YELLS]

67
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,680
Of bread.

68
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,460
This store's terrible, and I would never shop there again.

69
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,620
Because, apparently--

70
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,010
it's a bakery.

71
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,080
But so you can take a line-- and although it's silly, it's a good way

72
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,140
of trying out a bunch of different tones.

73
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,570
And reminding yourself of how important tone is just prior to

74
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,650
delivering a speech.

75
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,490
So you take a line and run it through various ways.

76
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,150
Another thing you could be doing--

77
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,130
in the privacy of your home or just before you do a speech performance--

78
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,700
is practicing reading aloud other stuff.

79
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,070
So you can read aloud poetry or you can read aloud famous speeches.

80
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:27,610
So if I would read some poetry, one thing to practice

81
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,950
with is rhyming poetry.

82
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,550
Because again--

83
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:34,690
the thing with rhyming poetry is obviously, you want to

84
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,950
acknowledge the rhyme.

85
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,460
But you don't want it to become too singsongy at the risk undermining the

86
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,660
true meaning of that passage.

87
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,200
So it just sounds more like a song than it does attending us to the

88
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,920
particulars of that writing.

89
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,950
So this is Robert Service, a good anthology of rhyming poetry.

90
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,250
"And so in the strife of the battle of life, it's easy to

91
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,690
fight when you're winning.

92
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,910
It's easy to slave and starve and be brave when the dawn

93
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,856
of success is beginning.

94
00:04:02,856 --> 00:04:06,630
But a man who can meet despair and defeat with cheer is a

95
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,370
man of God's choosing.

96
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,490
The man who can fight to heaven's own height is a man who can fight when

97
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,820
he's losing."

98
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,830
So I mean, you can play around with that.

99
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,779
That's a good way of trying out different tones.

100
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:25,560
You can maybe do some TS Eliot, where rhyme scheme is not as apparent--

101
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,200
not apparent at all.

102
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,520
This is from-- what am I my reading from-- "The Hollow Men."

103
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,020
"This is the dead land.

104
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,740
This is the cactus land.

105
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,660
Here, the stony images are raised.

106
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,820
Here, they receive the supplication of the dead man's hand under the twinkle

107
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,420
of the fading star."

108
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,434
So both of those are kind of serious.

109
00:04:46,434 --> 00:04:50,240
You can also-- and I think this is very useful-- get an anthology of

110
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,650
famous speeches.

111
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,340
A great way to practice various things.

112
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,760
And so if you're going to be speaking, you might as well

113
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,230
practice with speeches.

114
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,040
So this is the final paragraph--

115
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,140
beginning of the final paragraph from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.

116
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:10,580
"But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot concentrate, we

117
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,810
cannot hallow this ground.

118
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,830
The brave men, living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far

119
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,850
above our poor power to add or detract.

120
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:24,320
The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can

121
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,900
never forget what they did here."

122
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,280
So the thing is, I really recommend if you want to improve your vocal

123
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,540
variety, if you want to improve your performance, if you want to improve

124
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,740
your delivery--

125
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,480
not only looking at models of imitation in terms of well, how does

126
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,300
this person sort of convey their enthusiasm.

127
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,970
We've been doing that in terms of studies of ethos.

128
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:52,540
But also, throwing yourself into the works and words of others.

129
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,240
So I used to coach competitive speech back when I was in high school.

130
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,890
And I engaged in competitive speech.

131
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,360
And it's sort of a very--

132
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,380
there are speech competitions, debate competitions, globally.

133
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,510
But as it emerged in the US, there are certain tracks.

134
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:13,560
So in competitive forensics, we typically have interpretive events,

135
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,770
limited prep events, and platform speeches.

136
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,620
Interpretive events are interpretations of literature.

137
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,610
So reading literature, and performing it in a way that conveys the richness

138
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,980
of that literature.

139
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,340
Limited prep events--

140
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,230
you did one of these, the impromptu speech.

141
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,980
And there's also a very similar one, the extemporaneous speech.

142
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,890
And then, the platform speeches--

143
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,980
informative speech--

144
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,420
you're doing one of those now.

145
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,220
And then also, a persuasive speech-- one that we'll get

146
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,040
to in the next unit.

147
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,450
So in coaching these and in doing these, people tend to fall into their

148
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,520
specific range.

149
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,490
So they only do interp or they only do limited prep.

150
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,980
And that's always sad to see.

151
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,580
Because all these events are really necessary for developing a well

152
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,790
rounded speaker.

153
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,430
So someone who just did persuasive speaking and didn't attend to

154
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,670
interpretive events was missing out on so much.

155
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:13,130
Having to read other's words and find and illustrate the emotionality or the

156
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:17,950
intensity of that passage stretches you as a speaker.

157
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:21,040
And in doing interpretive events and reading other people's words, I'm not

158
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,950
asking you to become an actor.

159
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,800
That's not really what's going on here.

160
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,360
But really, finding how to deliver a line in the way that you want.

161
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,450
Finding how you want the audience to hear and understand

162
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,910
and feel that line.

163
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,010
You can do this through a study of others, but you can also do this

164
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:44,430
through increasing your own ability to work in their realm, to

165
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,760
work in their words.

166
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,620
So I would strongly encourage you to pick up an antholgy, a speech

167
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,130
anthology or poetry anthology.

168
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,490
And certainly, you find these free online.

169
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:58,170
They are great writing resources and practice resources.

170
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,550
From antiquity forward--

171
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,090
Isocrates, Quintillion Cicero, and others-- would acknowledge that having

172
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:10,150
a deep sense of literary models, of speech models, was a good way to

173
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,270
achieve eloquent speech.

174
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:17,470
So in our more practical vein, I think you should be working with anthologies

175
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:21,730
