MATT MCGARRITY: This week has us deep in the informative.

1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,210
So last week we began the assignment.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,750
And now we're getting into the nitty gritty details of mastering your

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,270
informative content.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:16,180
So we're going to look at how you can identify key points in your content.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,110
What are the key things that have to be addressed in talking us through

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,690
this new idea?

7
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,690
Then we're going to shift and look at how you can rearrange this content

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,100
clearly and effectively.

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,300
And then finally, we're going to turn to this key skill of explanation.

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,190
Being able to help an audience understand a new concept through

11
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,480
examples and elaboration.

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,280
So that's what we're going to be working on this week.

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,530
