MATT MCGARRITY: I would like to start our discussion of public speaking with

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,060
a scenario.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,690
And it's a very common scenario.

4
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:11,970
It's one that's probably happening right now in multiple places all

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,640
around the globe, and that's the weekly office meeting.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,180
OK, so here's a scenario.

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,720
Let's say you need to provide an update on your project.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,430
And your project's OK, but it's kind of late.

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,360
It's a little over budget.

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,860
But you still want to look good, and you want to maintain your respect that

11
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,430
you have in the office.

12
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,000
And so on preparing your talk, you're operating within some broad genre

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,070
constraints.

14
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,010
Yeah, you should probably keep it under five minutes.

15
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,300
You need to address some of the key office concerns.

16
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,710
Now let's say your specific office has developed a couple of unique

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,820
expectations.

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,590
So in doing these, it turns out most of the people stand at the podium,

19
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,390
rather than walk around the room.

20
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,950
The room, itself, probably shaped some of the opportunities.

21
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,490
Let's say the lighting's really bad on one side, or one corner for some

22
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,390
reason smells and has an odd strain.

23
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,630
But the takeaway is the presentation exists within a matrix of expectations

24
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,910
and opportunities.

25
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,500
And some of these are big and small influences.

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,840
Some of these you can influence, and some of these are beyond your control.

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,750
But all of them affect the speech and your audience's expectations.

28
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,640
So let's say you send an email around the night before with your notes for

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,730
the presentation.

30
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,510
So then maybe you don't have to use a PowerPoint because you've done

31
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,860
something that affected the actual situation itself.

32
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,980
Some of these constraints maybe you reject altogether.

33
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,180
You don't want to speak at the podium.

34
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,280
You want to walk around the room.

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,330
And that may not negatively impact your presentation.

36
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,880
But, of course, a lot of these expectations change over time.

37
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,260
So let's say at this hypothetical office, presentations are very

38
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,370
different now than they were five years ago or 10 years ago.

39
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,690
And these expectations are even made more complicated by how they exist in

40
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,610
different places.

41
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:59,390
So these standard weekly office meetings are very different in Tokyo

42
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,070
than they are in Riyadh or in Caracas.

43
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:07,080
So what we're talking about here is how a speaker exists within a

44
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,930
relationship of a number of socio-cultural factors.

45
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,840
And an old way of looking at this in rhetorical studies is

46
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,640
the rhetorical situation.

47
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,290
So we talk about what are some of those constraints on the speaker and

48
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,100
on the speech.

49
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,230
Well, certainly there is the topic, right?

50
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,750
What can be said or should be said about that particular topic, that

51
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,720
speech topic?

52
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,950
The specific audience.

53
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,860
What are their expectations for that type of presentation?

54
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,200
The occasion, itself.

55
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,050
That very norm of a business office meeting.

56
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:37,980
The setting.

57
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,620
What's the room set up like?

58
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,940
The speaker's credibility.

59
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:46,080
So let's say, for example, you kind of got caught in a exaggeration

60
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,300
last time you spoke.

61
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,400
And so now you kind of got to negotiate that.

62
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
People are expecting that.

63
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,910
So that's an expectation about you that you need to

64
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,990
work with, or against.

65
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,050
And all of these factors, topic, setting, audience, all of these are

66
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,550
shifting and flexible.

67
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:05,140
Some you can bend, some you can break, some you simply must adapt to.

68
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,390
So why go into all of this?

69
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,390
For this very simple reason, and it's something I expect you already know,

70
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,890
but it bears repeating.

71
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:19,130
There is no single form of successful speaking.

72
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,250
There is no single form of successful speaking.

73
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,110
There's no Esperanto of public speaking, something that holds across

74
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,050
all cultures.

75
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,990
It doesn't exist.

76
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:33,080
So in the design of this class, this Introduction of Public Speaking class,

77
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,920
we have to make decisions about what to focus on.

78
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,550
So we can't simply--

79
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:42,960
I can't simply teach to the one form of speech that works across all genres

80
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,580
for all speakers in all cultures across all time.

81
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,320
It doesn't exist.

82
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,660
That's a dream, [? ran. ?]

83
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,990
That's not out there.

84
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,050
It doesn't exist.

85
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:56,080
And on the other side of the coin, we can't look at each and every type of

86
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,550
speech that has been successful in all genres, and each successful speaker,

87
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,760
and all the different modes of cultural speaking across all time.

88
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,650
That would take a bajillion years.

89
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,220
It's impossible.

90
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,950
So what we're going to be doing in this class-- and the reason I start

91
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,040
with this is to get us all on the same page--

92
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,630
is we're going to be looking at skills, rather than genres.

93
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,760
We're going to be looking at skills that you can adapt to the speaking

94
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,700
situations that you find yourself in because I don't know what sort of

95
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,750
speaking situation you're going to be in tomorrow or next week.

96
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,300
And quite honestly, you probably don't either.

97
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,650
But we can work on a core set of skills, and in that way, the goal of

98
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,940
this class isn't for you to just do a good speech.

99
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,450
It is for you to become a good speaker.

100
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,980
And that may sound like a minor difference, but it is

101
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,840
a pretty big one.

102
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,040
And I think maybe one way of looking at this is through a sports analogy.

103
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,950
So growing up, my sport was skiing, downhill skiing, although you can

104
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,860
apply this to a number of different sports.

105
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,030
So in skiing, you had to have a set of core skills.

106
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,030
You had to have muscle memory, you had to have strengthen in your legs, you

107
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:11,140
had to have experience with navigating these two sticks on snow.

108
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,240
But you also had to be able to take that knowledge and apply it to the

109
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,730
unique constraints, the unique setting, that you were on.

110
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,870
That given run on that given day required that you deployed those

111
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,610
skills in a particular way.

112
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,990
Maybe it's extra cold, maybe you're a little bit sick.

113
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,920
You had to pick your line on the run.

114
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,020
Let's say it's snowing really heavy, so you've got limited visibility.

115
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,550
It's about bringing those skills to adaptation in that specific space.

116
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,960
We could look at this in soccer or football, right?

117
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,420
So the good players, not simply someone who can dribble

118
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,850
the ball well, right?

119
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,750
They have to be able to respond dynamically to all the things that are

120
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:52,340
going on around them, making good judgments, performing good plays.

121
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,780
They don't just march down the field, dribbling the ball.

122
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,890
They'd get it take it away and they'll look foolish.

123
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,680
But so it's really about being able to take that core scale and adapt to

124
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,620
these situations.

125
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,660
And that's what we're going to be doing with public speaking, looking at

126
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,140
a couple of key skills, but then say, you need to develop the capacity, the

127
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,590
judgment, to adapt the skills to the speech situation that you're in.

128
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,420
So what, then, are these core skills?

129
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,660
Well, very briefly, and we'll go into these in depth in the next lecture.

130
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:24,070
But very briefly, these key skills are designing clear presentations and

131
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,800
delivering them in an engaging way.

132
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,350
So where would these core skills be useful?

133
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,550
Well, I would say probably most places, most speeches.

134
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,500
These are certainly going to be useful skills in business presentations or

135
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,780
class presentations or briefings or fundraising speeches or awareness

136
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,790
campaigns, where you have to be clear about either information or

137
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,940
persuasion, where you have to be on point, you have to be concise.

138
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,310
Now, these core skills may not be as useful in eulogies, right?

139
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,920
That's a different thing.

140
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,300
That's a different--

141
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,420
you know, clarity is not perhaps the most important thing there.

142
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,830
It's recognizing the emotionality of the space.

143
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,660
And if you even think about it, eulogies are so

144
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,260
culturally specific, right?

145
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,160
They're embedded in the context of the region and the religion

146
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,600
and all these issues.

147
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,220
So, you know, eulogies are a separate genre.

148
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,610
But these core skills are very usable in a number of different settings.

149
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,010
So we're going to look at these skills.

150
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,760
And I'll speak more to this, this week, but I'm emerging to this from a

151
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,110
specific Western rhetorical tradition.

152
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,720
And the idea is these skills, you take what is useful so that you might

153
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,510
succeed in that next speaking situation because there are no hard

154
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,540
and fast rules about public speaking, apart from be

155
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,140
honest and do what works.

156
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,770
So I want our discussion of these key skills to blossom into a global

157
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,350
exchange about what works in different cultures in our online discussion

158
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,670
forums and other online spaces.

159
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,740
So that's kind of this overview in the speaking situations.

160
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,880
In the next lecture, we'll talk about what speeches and which speech

161
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,380
assignments and speech skills you'll be working on

162
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,970
specifically in this class.

163
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,221
