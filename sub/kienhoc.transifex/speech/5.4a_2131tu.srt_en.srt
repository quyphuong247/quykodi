00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,260
MATT MCGARRITY: In the last lecture, I asked you to start revising your

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:10,150
outline in reference to these principles of arrangement--

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,900
simplicity, balance, and order.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,760
And what we're going to be doing here is thinking more specifically about

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,200
developing your support--

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,390
developing the details.

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,510
So you've kind of framework now that you're working with.

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,750
So the question is, what's going on in those sub-points, on

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,580
those levels of meaning?

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,340
And typically I want to be able to anchor at each point with

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,010
some type of detail.

12
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,530
Now that might be a piece of evidence.

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,080
That might not be a piece of evidence.

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,410
But some nitty-gritty aspect of the concept, where I'm getting to the

15
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,820
finest-grained analysis of whatever I'm talking about.

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,200
So again, I kind of like this idea-- and we'll talk about this next time--

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,470
as sort of moving from the general concept into the specific details, and

18
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,410
then telescoping back out again.

19
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,370
So in the next lecture, we're going to be talking about performing those

20
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,440
levels of meaning--

21
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,180
your main idea, your sub-idea, your level of detail.

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:06,480
And one thing I hadn't thought about up until this point, but I think might

23
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,800
be a useful way of thinking about how the impromptu structure relates to the

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,450
informative structure.

25
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,710
I used to sort of think that in talking about it, the difference

26
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,500
between the informative and the impromptu was we added a

27
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,150
layer to the impromptu.

28
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,290
And that's actually not accurate, the more I think about it.

29
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:29,490
What's happening in the informant is you're running basically three short

30
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,180
impromptus, all on a same theme.

31
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,050
So those sub-points were kind of what you were doing in your impromptu

32
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:39,490
speech, because you've got that claim and evidence.

33
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,690
Now we're taking multiple little impromptus, and putting them together,

34
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,210
and saying this is a main idea.

35
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,760
Here are two more little impromptus.

36
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,860
This is a main idea.

37
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,900
Here's another couple of them.

38
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,140
This is a main idea.

39
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,340
So we're doing a lot of what we're developing, what we've been doing, in

40
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,160
that impromptu speech.

41
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,630
So let's talk to a little bit more deliberately what some of these

42
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,330
details are that are going to anchor your sub-points, that are going to be

43
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,630
that finest level of analysis that you're doing in

44
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,320
your informative speech.

45
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:14,490
So in this video lecture, I kind of want to talk to types of evidence,

46
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:20,550
what type of evidence to include, and then a last note on making sure that

47
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,390
you're keeping the evidence in a supporting role.

48
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,690
So let's begin by talking about the different types of

49
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,600
detail or types of evidence.

50
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,280
Well, certainly we can distinguish between facts and statistics,

51
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,600
testimony, and examples and narratives.

52
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,970
So facts and statistics, these are the things of information.

53
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:48,430
If I crack open an encyclopedia, if I had an encyclopedia anymore, this

54
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:53,250
would be what I'd be able to find in there-- just the largely agreed-upon

55
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,570
fact, around orchids or whatever.

56
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,110
The thing that is agreed upon.

57
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,370
So if I was doing a speech on childhood obesity--

58
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,330
an informative speech on childhood obesity in the United States--

59
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:10,250
a fact for that might be the American Heart Association has reported that an

60
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,880
average adult should consume between--

61
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,570
maximum, they don't have to consume--

62
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,380
consume between six to nine teaspoons of sugar a day.

63
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,840
That's the recommended amount.

64
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,700
Don't go over that.

65
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,490
Most Americans are having at least twice of that.

66
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:30,540
They're having about 22 teaspoons a day of sugar.

67
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:37,050
And American teenagers are coming in at a whopping 34 teaspoons a day.

68
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,030
So that's a fact, right?

69
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,180
I Can deploy that in however I need to.

70
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,410
If I want to say, oh, this is a growing problem.

71
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,330
And it's specifically affecting America's youth.

72
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,310
Well, that's a wonderful piece of evidence that illustrates that

73
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,190
particular idea.

74
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,900
But it's a fact.

75
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,890
It's just the result of a study.

76
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,550
I can have a statistic that is basically a numerical

77
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,210
representation of fact.

78
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,810
So if I'm doing the speech and I'm doing it in front of a Washington

79
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:11,400
audience, maybe I want to go at it and provide a greater sense of locality.

80
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,500
So the Washington State Board of Health reports that over 60% of

81
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,200
Washington adults are either overweight or obese.

82
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,130
That's a statistic.

83
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,160
That's a numerical representation in fact.

84
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,230
It gives people a sense of where obesity sits within the larger whole

85
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,620
of this particular state.

86
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,610
Now testimony is really good in an informative speech.

87
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,210
Because what you're able to do with testimony is basically borrow the

88
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,780
credibility of somebody else.

89
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,860
So once again, if I'm talking about obesity I would say, well in 2003, the

90
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:52,570
then Surgeon General Richard Carmona stated to Congress that the US has an

91
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,130
epidemic of childhood obesity.

92
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,970
So I'm asking--

93
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,210
the audience can hear that and go, oh, that's not just Matt saying that we've

94
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,110
got an epidemic of childhood obesity.

95
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,880
It's someone who knows significantly more than him--

96
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,050
the Attorney General--

97
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,840
maybe he thinks that too-- the Surgeon General.

98
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,360
So I'm able to sort of borrow somebody else's credibility on this issue.

99
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,520
I'm sort of saying to you, here's what experts have reported on this issue.

100
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,920
And then finally, examples and narratives.

101
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,460
And in the obesity one, I would be able to provide stories, or

102
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,070
narratives, or some of the challenges that people face with severe obesity.

103
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:34,710
So those examples and narratives are really providing a human face or a way

104
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:39,420
of understanding that issue in a much more tangible way.

105
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,670
We'll return to the power of narrative and story when we get into the

106
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:48,070
persuasive speech, because that's really where those stories can have a

107
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,680
significant impact.

108
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,360
So if those are the types of details and evidence, which

109
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,830
one should you include?

110
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,350
Well, one key thing to think about is aim for diversity.

111
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:03,500
If you just have statistics in your informative speech, that might be

112
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,490
pretty dry.

113
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:08,980
If it's nothing but narratives and examples, well then the question is,

114
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,940
how generalizable is the knowledge that you're talking about?

115
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,330
Is this merely anecdotal?

116
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,110
Is as merely your experience.

117
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,840
Some cases that might be fine.

118
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,130
Other cases, it might be inappropriate.

119
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,140
So you want to be able to have a nice diversity of evidence

120
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,850
type, of detail type.

121
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:30,800
And narratives and examples are so good at helping us understand and

122
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,290
identify with the topic.

123
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:36,510
So at the end of this video lecture when you're on that course page-- so

124
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,410
this is what we're in-- we're in week five?

125
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:39,940
Thank you.

126
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,150
Some of the guys behind the camera is like, aw.

127
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,530
I don't know if he's asking for a high five.

128
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,480
I'm not going to do it now, but later.

129
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,470
Help me remember.

130
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,860
So we've got, if we're on week five, at the end of this video, there'll be

131
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,070
an embedded clip.

132
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:59,480
And I think Hans Rosling is a really good example of this.

133
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,250
He's someone who deals with statistics.

134
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,430
But the one that I really like as an illustration of this idea is he's

135
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,220
talking about energy use and water consumption.

136
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,810
But he'll talk to the statistics, and then he jumps right over to an

137
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,610
example-- sometimes hypothetical, sometimes real.

138
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:20,680
But there's this real good blend of here's some statistics, but here's

139
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,860
what those statistics on a global scale look like for the individual.

140
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,200
And boy, being able to have that type of diversity is a really good for an

141
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,730
informative speech.

142
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,080
So that's the type of evidence there is and what you should be aiming for

143
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,510
in terms of diversity.

144
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,500
But you want to make sure you're keeping the details in

145
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,020
their proper place.

146
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,180
Remember in the impromptu, we wanted to make sure that support didn't

147
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,590
overtake the claim.

148
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,690
So too here.

149
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,980
We want to make sure that the details don't get away from what they're

150
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,390
supposed to be doing.

151
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:58,110
We want the audience to remember our ideas, our meaning, our clarification.

152
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:03,780
So don't wander off in a discussion of the detail at the expense of the idea.

153
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,370
Because the idea is what it's there for.

154
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,800
The detail's there to help us better understand the idea.

155
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,130
So keep the emphasis on that.

156
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,540
Once again, I think this is the benefit of an outline structure.

157
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,110
As I'm kind of remembering here's the key theme I want people to understand,

158
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,750
here's the detail that gets me there.

159
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,860
But I want to make sure that I'm staying focused on that key theme.

160
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:28,330
So as it comes to that, summarize those details to get at the core idea.

161
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:33,710
Really go through them with an eye to reinforcing that

162
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,320
core idea, that claim.

163
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,380
And at this point in the writing process, the composing process of your

164
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,420
speech, it's really good to go back and look at maybe you threw some

165
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,140
detail in under a point and it made sense at the time.

166
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,660
But go back and make sure that those details, make sure that that evidence,

167
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,860
is doing what you say it's doing.

168
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,900
So I want to show you an example here.

169
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:03,080
This is from an old student speech that I adapted for this purpose.

170
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,760
But this is the sort of stuff I'll see a lot of the time.

171
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,450
People find evidence.

172
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,670
They sort of put it somewhere in their outline.

173
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,370
They kind of forget about why they put it there.

174
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,140
And then they write the speech around it.

175
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,310
And it ends up being that the key idea and the detail actually don't have a

176
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,130
lot in common.

177
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,600
So we'll go ahead and take a look at this.

178
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,830
So in discussing differential tuition, a number of universities in the United

179
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,810
States have toyed with the idea of differential tuition.

180
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:36,470
So majoring in some areas will cost more than other areas.

181
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,910
So the sciences are money hogs.

182
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,210
Man, It costs a lot to educate an engineer.

183
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,090
An English major, they're cheap to educate.

184
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:50,320
They need books and a space, but they don't need a lab.

185
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,580
So there's been some discussion.

186
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,500
There's some universities that look at charging different rates

187
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,960
for different majors.

188
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:01,530
So in a discussion about differential tuition, this was what I come across.

189
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,060
So this person is saying, if differential tuition is implemented,

190
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,240
students may tend to choose other universities.

191
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,290
So we got a consequential claim here.

192
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:15,860
If X then Y. And so there's what he has for the detail and the evidence.

193
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,650
Competing programs at other institutions could

194
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,030
obtain a price advantage.

195
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,000
Last year--

196
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,540
this is the detail part--

197
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,610
last year the legislature recommended that all four-year public higher

198
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:32,420
education institutions increase resident undergraduate tuition by 16%.

199
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,720
But the UW chose to increase it by 20%.

200
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,500
And cites a source there.

201
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,540
If the UW has adopted this policy, the tuition would be much higher than

202
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,150
other public universities.

203
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,700
Students may tend to choose other public universities, therefore leading

204
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,300
to negative impacts on school rankings.

205
00:10:52,300 --> 00:11:00,010
That evidence, that detail, just says that all the detail proves,

206
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:08,870
demonstrates, is that the UW raised the tuition four percentage points

207
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,020
more than was recommended.

208
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,720
That is all that evidence proves.

209
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,240
That's all that evidence illustrates.

210
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,860
It does not-- that piece of detail--

211
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,480
does not demonstrate that if differential tuition is implemented,

212
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,560
students may tend to choose other universities.

213
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,090
It doesn't do that.

214
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:30,330
At some point in the drafting of this, that evidence was slotted in there.

215
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,000
It was kind of forgotten about.

216
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,855
And then they ended up writing a point around a piece of evidence that

217
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:38,280
doesn't really do what they say it's doing.

218
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,770
So now is the time to really go back and look at that outline that you

219
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:48,270
have, and make sure that what you say that evidence is doing, is actually

220
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,260
what you're doing.

221
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,520
Now in performing the speech iteratively by standing up there

222
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,710
talking through it, you should be listening for it.

223
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,300
And make sure that there is that relationship.

224
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,610
So this lecture was sort of about getting all the

225
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,070
final details in place.

226
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:07,020
Once again, where we are in the week, we came up with ideas.

227
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,310
We moved into arrangement.

228
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,860
We revised our arrangement.

229
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,430
We started thinking more about the details used to really illustrate

230
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,910
those ideas.

231
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:20,430
And so now, what I want you to do is go back and check on your details.

232
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,970
Could you add more diversity in terms of the types of evidence and details

233
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:24,970
that you're presenting?

234
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,410
If you can, put in some more examples probably.

235
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,410
But also, you're looking at these changes.

236
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,780
You're looking to make sure that everything's kind of on the same page

237
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,420
when it's on the same page--

238
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:42,120
that detail does in fact relate to the next level up that it's supposedly

239
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,520
illustrating.

240
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,260
Now in the next lecture, we're going to talk about tying all of this week's

241
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,570
material together--

242
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:53,540
how you're getting into elaborating detail and relating it back to claim.

243
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,790
