MATT MCGARRITY: So now that we've started into the impromptu, I want to talk

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,220
through this model of argument we're going to use to organize

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,610
our impromptu speeches.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,670
And this model's useful in a whole range of speeches.

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,170
But it's certainly key to the ideas and work we're going to be doing here

6
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,750
in this impromptu speech.

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,760
And the model I'm taking comes from the work of Stephen Toulman, who was a

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,690
British philosopher and writer on argumentation.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,630
And originally it was sort of more of a way of describing

10
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,820
and analyzing arguments.

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,150
But it really has some good uses in terms of thinking about how we might

12
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,110
build strong arguments.

13
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,700
And these can be arguments about policy.

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,410
Policy arguments are what we should do as a collective or individuals.

15
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,430
Or they can be claims and argument about fact--

16
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,730
the earth is X years old, whatever.

17
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,320
So what then are these key elements of an argument?

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,450
Well there are three key terms here--

19
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,940
claim, support, and warrant.

20
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,790
And I'll talk to each one of these.

21
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,560
So to begin with, a claim.

22
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,150
A claim is an assertion you want the audience to take as valid.

23
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:06,010
Once again, we're in the realm of argumentation, not truth necessarily.

24
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:11,450
So we want something to be taken as valid, reasonable, believable.

25
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,760
That's what we're dealing with when we're dealing with claims.

26
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,190
So in the impromptu, you have two claims--

27
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,430
your two main points.

28
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:23,540
Those are claims in advance of another really big claim--

29
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,900
your thesis statement.

30
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,860
So you've got one big claim, supported by two smaller claims.

31
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,690
But each one of those claims needs--

32
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,180
it can't just be a random assertion of validity.

33
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,160
Rather you need support.

34
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,620
And support is the evidence and information that you use to validate

35
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,780
that claim.

36
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,570
So here and when you get into the support, you're demonstrating that the

37
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,220
claim has some basis in rationality or fact.

38
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,170
It's not just you kind of making stuff up.

39
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,680
You can point to examples, or statistics, or testimony, or various

40
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:02,730
things to show that this claim has some basis in reasonability.

41
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:07,190
But of course, support by itself doesn't validate the claim.

42
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,789
And actually this is something we'll get to in the informative speech, but

43
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:14,480
one of the problems sometimes people have with speaking is they just put

44
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,460
that support out there.

45
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,440
They tell you the evidence.

46
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,460
But they don't explain the evidence.

47
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,570
So we don't want to do that.

48
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:24,140
And impromptu allows us to learn how not to do that.

49
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,140
Support doesn't just validate the claim.

50
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:32,590
You as a speaker need to explain how and why that support relates to the

51
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,360
claim-- that support validates the claim.

52
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,530
And that's the realm of this warrant.

53
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,590
The warrant is the link that ties your support to the claim.

54
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,430
And so this model is really a way of thinking about the various components

55
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,240
of a speech--

56
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,250
and especially the various components of an impromptu speech.

57
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,480
And so we can take a look at a couple of outlines here.

58
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,010
And you can see how this maps onto what you're doing in

59
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,320
the impromptu speech.

60
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,630
So this first one is a sample impromptu outline I had a

61
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,040
student speak on.

62
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,030
But this is the basic argument.

63
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,690
So the thesis here is Microsoft and Apple should give their operating

64
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,360
systems to any student enrolled in college free of charge.

65
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,030
So that's the master claim--

66
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,840
not going to happen, but again debatable point-- allows us to work on

67
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,070
argumentation.

68
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,870
But that claim is supported by two main points, also claims.

69
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,610
Such a move benefits students.

70
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,790
Such a move benefits companies.

71
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:29,030
So the speaker would want the audience to see those as reasonable assertions,

72
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,440
reasonable claims.

73
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:35,050
There's no reason to support that thesis if these two claims don't work.

74
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,340
So we've got two claims.

75
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,350
Each one of those claims is supported by evidence-- by

76
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,570
an idea, by an example.

77
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,320
It eliminates mandatory cost.

78
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,430
It creates academic equity.

79
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,340
These are on the outline it's pretty embryonic.

80
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,780
But as you would discuss this in depth, you would be explaining what

81
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,640
that support is, and how it relates to the claim.

82
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,280
Here's another example, different thesis--

83
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,940
one I personally believe.

84
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,460
Public speaking should be a requirement at every level of a

85
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,980
primary education.

86
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,350
Well, why would this be?

87
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,430
I've got two claims--

88
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,320
public speaking skills take a long time to nurture and public speaking

89
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,760
skills are essential at every age.

90
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,360
Under that first one, I've got a piece of support, Quintilian.

91
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,700
Quintilian was a Roman rhetorician, wrote this book basically laying out a

92
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,100
cradle-to-grave model for speech education.

93
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,270
So I could talk about that support and relate it to the claim--

94
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,670
provide flesh on that claim that public speaking skills take a long

95
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,040
time to nurture.

96
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,480
So in any case, whatever the thesis is, I want the audience to hear those

97
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,490
claims as reasonable.

98
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,010
So each point is supported with two pieces of evidence.

99
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:49,070
But in the performance of that point, that's really where we need to

100
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,300
practice impromptus.

101
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,490
In the performance of that point, I'm trying to bridge the gap between the

102
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,640
claim and the support through a discussion of their relationship.

103
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,740
And that's the warrant.

104
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,850
That's the discussion of the warrant.

105
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,070
So I wanted to define these terms because they're going to be used

106
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,810
throughout the course.

107
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,280
And understanding this model I think is very useful, because it helps you

108
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,930
place the emphasis in your speech in many cases on the claim.

109
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,090
So you can move from thinking about a point as a chunk of talk.

110
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,860
Like there are many times maybe you think like, oh, I've got this point I

111
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,500
want to talk about that's five minutes.

112
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,110
I don't know what I'm going to do in those five minutes.

113
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,280
I'm going to talk, and hopefully it works.

114
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,450
But instead, if you're thinking in terms of what is the argument and what

115
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,110
are the various components, you can understand the relationship.

116
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,930
And remember that you really want people to remember that claim.

117
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,000
That support's invaluable, but it's there to drive the claim.

118
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,130
It's there to support the claim.

119
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,120
By the same token, the support isn't going to validate the

120
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,900
claim on its own.

121
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,750
So you have to explain how and why that support relates to the claim.

122
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,680
You've got to provide the warrant and make it evident for that audience.

123
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,850
So claim, support, and warrant help us move through each point or chunk of

124
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,630
the speech with a greater sense of purpose.

125
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,210
And this sense of purpose is important, because it can sharpen your

126
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,360
focus in any part of the speech.

127
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,450
It can improve the quality of the entire speech.

128
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,320
And perhaps most importantly, it can make the speech

129
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,880
clearer for your audience.

130
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,480
So in the next lecture, we're going to take up how you can start coming up

131
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,900
with these main points for your impromptu speech--

132
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,680
how you can start coming up with your claims.

133
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,434
