MATT MCGARRITY: Welcome to week four.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,240
This week, we're going to start working on the informative speech.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,189
And we're going to begin by reviewing the assignment and skills that are

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,550
going to occupy us for the next couple of weeks.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,890
Then we're going to turn to a process for preparing speeches that can

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,800
improve your speech writing and delivery skills.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,150
And then finally, we're going to address speech goals.

8
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,950
And here, we're thinking strategically about what you want your audience to

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,310
take away from your presentation.

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,980
So that's what we're going to be doing this week.
