00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:03,060
MATT MCGARRITY: Now that we've talked a little bit about some of the

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,370
differences between speaking and writing, I want to take a look at how

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,900
that often manifests in actual speeches.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,840
So I have some students here from my lecture here at the University of

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,340
Washington.

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,280
So my class just ended about 30 minutes ago, and they were quite kind

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,940
to volunteer their time, come in.

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,640
Today, by the way, is a Friday afternoon, so it's doubly impressive

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,590
that they've come in to do this.

10
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,660
But I've asked them to come in, and some of them are going to read a

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,620
manuscript that I wrote about choosing the University of Washington, just so

12
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,960
I can have some type of copy.

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,790
They're going to read this thing that I wrote about choosing the University

14
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,590
of Washington.

15
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,560
And then others are going to talk about why they chose the University of

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,270
Washington.

17
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,980
So as you watch these, I want you to look for and listen for what the

18
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,170
differences are between these performances.

19
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,930
One is somebody reading a manuscript, one is somebody just

20
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,440
explaining their story.

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,010
So let's go ahead and take a listen to those now.

22
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,270


23
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,740
SPEAKER 1: Hi, I'm [INAUDIBLE].

24
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,180
When looking into colleges, I, like most students, was concerned with

25
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,920
picking the college that was good fit for me as a student and a college that

26
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,090
would allow me to learn the most for a post-college career.

27
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,250
I applied to a number of different colleges using

28
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,660
the same basic criteria.

29
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,990
Affordability, academic reputation, and the location of the country.

30
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,890
I ended up choosing the University of Washington because of its solid

31
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,750
academic reputation, which was recently reflected in a number of

32
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,330
national surveys.

33
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,870
The fact that it was in Seattle didn't hurt.

34
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,820
I'm happy with my choice.

35
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,530
I look forward to a challenging and rewarding period as a full-time

36
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,330
student and a scholar.

37
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:41,600
CONNOR: Hi.

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,830
My name's Connor.

39
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,020
When looking into colleges, I, like most students, was concerned with

40
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,030
picking the college that was a good fit for me as a student, and the

41
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,500
college that would allow me to learn the most for a post-college career.

42
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,780
I applied to a number of different colleges using

43
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,590
the same basic criteria.

44
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,130
Affordability, academic reputation, and location of the country.

45
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,040
I ended up choosing the University of Washington because of its solid

46
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,930
academic reputation, which is recently reflected in a

47
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,800
number of national surveys.

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,550
The fact that it was in Seattle didn't hurt.

49
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,050
I am happy with my choice.

50
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,780
I look forward to a challenging and rewarding period is a full-time

51
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,030
student and scholar.

52
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,650


53
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,000
JOHN: Hi.

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,810
My name is John.

55
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,890
And the reason why I chose the University of Washington is because

56
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,980
when I moved up here from California, my dad had the dream of one day seeing

57
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,980
me as a U-Dub Husky.

58
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,490
Since throughout my middle school career and my high school career, my

59
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,470
main goal was to get to University of Washington.

60
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,540
And the day I got accepted to the university was an achievement that I

61
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,240
will never forget.

62
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,730
CONNOR: Hi, I'm Connor.

63
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,920
I chose the University of Washington because of a couple of reasons.

64
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,550
My family has a deep and abiding connection to the university.

65
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,840
My parents met here and ended up getting married because of that.

66
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,980
My family lives in the area, and this is my state.

67
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,630
I grew up in Seattle.

68
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,040
I want to stay here.

69
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,420
And the University of Washington offers not only a stellar academic

70
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,930
reputation, but the opportunity for me to meet other people who are going to

71
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,980
be in the same area and really grow as an individual in this community.

72
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,080
I'm really excited to be here, and I can't wait to continue doing that.

73
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,960


74
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,620
MATT MCGARRITY: So again, I want to thank them for doing that.

75
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,550
It's important to be able to run that type of experiment.

76
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,290
And what I hope you're seeing there is a difference between writing performed

77
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,260
orally and naturally occurring speech.

78
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,430
And if we go back and listen to those, we can hear differences in vocabulary

79
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,370
and clause construction and vocal variety.

80
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,230
So in terms of vocabulary, a lot of the studies indicate that when we

81
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,620
speak, sort of naturally occurring colloquial conversational speech,

82
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,390
we're usually a different stock of words, right?

83
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,700
In literary, writing, I can have a much bigger vocabulary, because I'm

84
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,950
being very deliberate about my word choice.

85
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:57,040
If I'm standing up and speaking, I'm operating with more of a colloquial

86
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,740
vocabulary.

87
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,720
Sort of my working vocabulary.

88
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,980
Odds are we're going to hear more hedging devices and more intensifiers.

89
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,160
In naturally occurring conversational speech, hedging devices, sort of, kind

90
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,120
of, more intensifiers , varied, really, so on and so forth.

91
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,010
In terms of clause construction, the text is usually bound.

92
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:20,500
So that manuscript is bound by some formal grammatical rules that reduce

93
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,060
it into these things that we call sentences.

94
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,670
And when we speak, we might not actually speak in sentences.

95
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:29,540
We might speak in fragments are in intonation units.

96
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,480
Pause length plays such an important role in speech, but writing only has

97
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,690
three ways of capturing this very dynamic process.

98
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,670
The comma, the semicolon, and the period.

99
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:43,230
Those are the ways in which we do pausing in writing.

100
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,800
But in speech, oh, we can have pauses or short pauses.

101
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,150
But writing and speaking don't really get on the same page there.

102
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,670
Horrible pun intended.

103
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,920
So what else do we see in terms of vocal variety and pausing.

104
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,910
Well, odds are, and we'll talk about this in the next lecture, if you're

105
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,600
reading a manuscript, it's probably going to be more monotoned.

106
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,590
Or at the very least, the vocal variety not going to be you're

107
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,110
naturally occurring vocal variety.

108
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,880
And we can see this.

109
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,580
If you look at the text.

110
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,040
If you look at the text here, you can see that there's so many visual

111
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,580
signifiers that help the reader gauge visually the writer's intent.

112
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,330
But when we speak, all those features are gone, right?

113
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,200
So you look on here.

114
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,300
I've got paragraph breaks.

115
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,710
We've got italic and boldface and commas and semicolons colons, and all

116
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,050
this sort of stuff.

117
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,400
All those visual elements are gone when I stand up to speak, right?

118
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,590
I can't speak in an italic.

119
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,150
I can stand sideways, but no one would really get what I was doing.

120
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,580
And that wouldn't work at all, and it'd be weird.

121
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,090
So all those are gone.

122
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:53,550
But in speech we have an army of phonetic cues that operate in sound to

123
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,520
help the listener get our meaning.

124
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,160
And that doesn't even get into all the visual markers that we have through

125
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,290
gesture and movement and facial features and all that sort of stuff.

126
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,610
So why go into all of this?

127
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:09,600
Well, as speakers, we want to work in the realm of spoken language.

128
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,870
And when you think about these two things, writing and

129
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,550
speaking are very different.

130
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,130
I want to take a lot from writing.

131
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,430
I think writing can be very useful in the preparation of speeches.

132
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:22,410
But at some level, the written document is different from the spoken

133
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,760
performance.

134
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,670
You know, you think in terms of how the audience interacts with the very

135
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,040
active communication.

136
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,345
So if I've got a reader interacting with the text, and they get confused

137
00:06:32,345 --> 00:06:35,500
or they get bored, or they lose their place.

138
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,210
They control that communique.

139
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,330
They can move forward in the book, backward in the book, highlight, write

140
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,110
on their own.

141
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,250
They control it.

142
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,290
They don't have that control when they're listening to a speaker.

143
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:49,790
The speaker has to make decisions, because so much is being dictated by

144
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,250
the speaker's choices.

145
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,430
So I want to take a lot from writing, but I want to recognize the

146
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:54,720
differences.

147
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,680
So in the next lesson, what we're going to do is, we're going to talk

148
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,610
about how we can translate this understanding between the differences

149
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,540
between literacy and orality into better, and by the way, into less

150
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,470
stressful speaking for you.

151
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,720
