MATT MCGARRITY: In the last lecture we talked about some ideas for practicing

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,710
and refining your speech skills, continuing your work of becoming a

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:09,610
good speaker.

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:14,110
I want to talk now a little bit about increasing your ready stock of words,

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,900
being able to have a number of words right there at your mental disposal so

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,710
that you can use them in a speaking situation.

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,640
This is a matter of verbal dexterity.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,080
In the Middle Ages there were these handbooks of letter writing, ars

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,210
dictaminis.

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,770
And they would model multiple, multiple ways of writing the same

11
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,490
letter, plainly or richly, to a variety of audiences.

12
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,320
And the Renaissance humanist Desiderius Erasmus was particularly

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,790
concerned with this in terms of copiousness.

14
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:47,260
So he filled pages upon pages with variations of phrases, one of them

15
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,720
being "your letter pleased me greatly," hundreds of variations on

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,700
that phrase.

17
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,680
Now, you don't have to do that.

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,020
But you should have multiple ways of approaching a phrase.

19
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,390
So one exercise you can do is just one day you sit down and just draft out a

20
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,320
sample sentence, or this is something you can pull from a newspaper.

21
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,300
You just grab a sentence.

22
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,370
And mine, since I'm having you do a big quiz this week, it could be "some

23
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,760
students argue that quizzes are punitive." So that's my sentence.

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,760
What I want to do now to increase my copiousness is just try coming up with

25
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,730
as many variations of that phrase as possible while still capturing

26
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,770
its key core idea.

27
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,660
So first off, I'd start by coming up with synonyms for

28
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,230
the subject, students.

29
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,920
So I could say learners, classmates, people, the educated, collaborators,

30
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,730
the literati.

31
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:42,450
I could go through and come up with synonyms for the verb, which in this

32
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,210
case is argue.

33
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:48,990
So assert, challenge, question, claim, propose, postulate, indicate.

34
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,440
Then go through and think about synonyms for the direct object, so in

35
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,420
this case, quizzes.

36
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:59,270
So quizzes, short exams, educational checkups, tests, response questions.

37
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,500
And then go through and find synonyms for remaining adjectives or adverbs,

38
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,770
in this case punitive.

39
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,880
So punitive, damaging, hurtful, mean, unnecessary, punishing, penalizing.

40
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,790
And once I've got all these sort of various synonyms, I can start running

41
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,420
various iterations of that sentence.

42
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,880
So maybe I first want to start by just running the sentence through a

43
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,110
different verb.

44
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,620
So students claim that quizzes are hurtful.

45
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,470
Students challenge the merit of damaging quizzes.

46
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,760
Quizzes are an unnecessary attack on their grades, some students propose.

47
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,950
And, of course, we must recognize that learners often question

48
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,290
the value of quizzes.

49
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,900
So if I've got that, if I run it through different verbs, maybe I want

50
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,190
to run it through a passive construction.

51
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:50,480
To some students, quizzes can be unfair and unnecessary.

52
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,230
Maybe I want to try to phrase it sort of in a negative phrasing.

53
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,970
Damaging quizzes are disliked by many classmates in no small measure.

54
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,670
Nothing is more frustrating to students than a questionable quiz.

55
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,180
Maybe I want to take it and run it through a metaphor.

56
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,620
Those in pursuit of knowledge feel quizzes as bludgeons.

57
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,540
All of these ways of coming up with permutations on that one sentence are

58
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:22,220
there to help you increase your stock of words, increase your copiousness.

59
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,930
And ultimately, that's useful.

60
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,150
But you need to hammer out your skills against the anvil of experience.

61
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,450
We know this.

62
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,510
This has been, I hope, a beneficial class for you to get some ideas and to

63
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,580
get some practice.

64
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:43,120
That practice must be taken out and run up against a live audience if it's

65
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,170
going to truly help you.

66
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,550
So don't shy away from these speaking opportunities.

67
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,870
You must seize them, because the goal isn't simply to craft

68
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,730
a single good speech.

69
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:59,500
The goal, I would say, is for you to become a good speaker, for you to

70
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,720
develop the abilities, the skills, and the judgment that allow you as a

71
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,120
person to become a good speaker who therefore does good speeches.

72
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,810
So we'll end our next thoughts here, things that you can be doing after the

73
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,890
end of this class.

74
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:18,370
And I'll simply say in the final lecture, we'll just tidy up the last

75
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,480
comments of the course.

76
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,730
And then we'll be done.

77
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,579
