00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,890
MATT MCGARRITY: Let's talk a little bit about counter arguments.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,840
Now, you may not need to include these in your cases for the speech that

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,270
you're working on or in other speeches that you give.

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:14,210
But I want to spend a little bit of time thinking about when should you

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,710
build in a counter argument into your persuasive speech?

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,070
Well, like in most things, it depends on the topic and the target audience.

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,930
So in this segment, we're going to think about the audience and whether

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:28,290
or not a counter argument is necessary or would be beneficial to your speech.

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,410
So we can take a look at this chart.

10
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,440
And when thinking about your topic and thinking about your audience, you want

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,830
to identify, well, where are they?

12
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,740
How close are they to your opinion?

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,990
Because a lot of your decisions are going to be hinging upon that.

14
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:46,740
If your audience is very supportive of your position, that's going to change

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,800
your strategy.

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,520
If the audience is neutral, that's going to change your strategy.

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,330
If they're strongly opposed to your position, you've got to rethink what

18
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,370
you're going to do.

19
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,690
So I kind of want to walk through each one of these very broad types of

20
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,420
audience in terms of whether or not a counter argument is necessary.

21
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,720
So what are some of the potential audiences for

22
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,790
your persuasive speeches?

23
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,850
Well, there are people who agree with you.

24
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,780
So if you're speaking in front of a very friendly audience and you're just

25
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,810
trying to motivate them to take action, well, there's probably--

26
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,090
there's no real need for counter arguments.

27
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,860
Now, you could very easily use counter arguments as a way of rallying

28
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,160
support, of building energy by saying, well, here's why they

29
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,890
are opposed to us.

30
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,390
But here's our response to that.

31
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,770
But in terms of persuading that friendly audience, you probably don't

32
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,880
need counter arguments.

33
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,360
They're not essential to your persuasive goal.

34
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,910
Strategically, stylistically they might be useful.

35
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,110
But they're probably not essential.

36
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,670
Then we get to maybe people who don't know about your topic.

37
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,870
Well, are counter arguments necessary here?

38
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,520
Possibly.

39
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,170
It depends on the topic.

40
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,470
If the ill is pretty clear, you probably don't need counter arguments

41
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,840
there as a way of being successful in your persuasive case.

42
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,310
So for example, no one's really confused about whether or not they

43
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,270
should be in favor of ending child hunger or opposed to sex slavery.

44
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,180
No one's sitting there going, child hunger.

45
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,050
Before I render a judgment, I would like to hear the principal defense.

46
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,180
No one's doing that.

47
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,330
So if it's a really clear ill, you probably don't need those counter

48
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,010
arguments as part of the persuasive package.

49
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:23,850
Now, if the ill is a little bit not as easily understood, then maybe yeah.

50
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,060
Maybe here you do need that counter argument.

51
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,820
So let's say you're advocating for some little-known issue and you can in

52
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,880
your mind's eye picture that target audience immediately questioning of

53
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,100
your proposal.

54
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,740
Then yeah, you had better build in as part of the persuasive package the

55
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,900
counter argument.

56
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,690
So here's a specific example of this.

57
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,970
I mentioned a couple of times not too long ago here in Washington State we

58
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,710
legalized marijuana.

59
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:53,450
And there were people who were opposed to the legalization of marijuana that

60
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,220
were in favor of marijuana.

61
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,080
So medical marijuana, there was a small group of medical marijuana

62
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,990
people who were opposed to general legalization of marijuana in

63
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,970
Washington State.

64
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,920
So when they were speaking to their constituency, when they were speaking

65
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,750
to their supporters, they had to immediately provide counter arguments

66
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,390
as to why legalizing pot, why this particular bill for

67
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,620
legalizing pot, was bad.

68
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,870
So they knew that their audience, which knew something about the topic,

69
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:25,180
but maybe didn't know it deeply, would immediately here the case and begin to

70
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,250
ask questions.

71
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,120
So these people who are in favor of marijuana but opposed to this bill had

72
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,340
to develop an argument for those in favor of marijuana that immediately

73
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,180
addressed their counter arguments or their counter concerns.

74
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,460
So then we shift over to maybe people who disagree with you.

75
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,210
Well, without a doubt you're probably going to want to use

76
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,500
counter arguments here.

77
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,980
And we'll return to this later next week in terms of how you're performing

78
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,510
your ethos in this speech.

79
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,080
But the counter argument here is trying to win support.

80
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,030
So you can't simply be a jerk.

81
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:00,780
You can't spend 10 to 15 minutes talking about why everybody who

82
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,090
disagrees with you is totally wrong and a little stupid and hope that

83
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,190
they're going to be persuaded by that, right?

84
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,910
No one wants to listen to that sort of beating up on their position.

85
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,250
So then we finally get to the far end here, and people who probably will

86
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,694
never agree with you.

87
00:04:16,694 --> 00:04:19,060
Do you need to include counter arguments there?

88
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,720
Well, I don't know, but probably.

89
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,290
I can think of many cases where you would.

90
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,130
And you're not really hoping for persuasion here, right?

91
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,750
You're just hoping to demonstrate that your position is valid.

92
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,120
Even if it's not persuasive to them, it's at least a valid position that

93
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,280
someone might hold.

94
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,910
So you're doing some persuasive work.

95
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,350
But you're not aiming at total conversion.

96
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,510
So if we return to this chart and we're thinking about, well, what can

97
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,720
you hope to accomplish for that audience, if you're softening

98
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,270
opposition, yeah, you're probably going to want to include counter

99
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,860
arguments, because they don't agree with you initially, so you want to

100
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,140
address their concerns.

101
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,210
Generally, we want to meet the audience where they are with the

102
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,650
arguments that we have.

103
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,110
If you're strengthening support, well, maybe.

104
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,600
It depends on the topic.

105
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,490
If you're motivating action, again maybe or maybe not.

106
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,620
It depends on strategically what those counter arguments will do for you with

107
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,710
that audience.

108
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,710
And I do wish I could be more definitive here.

109
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,240
But as with most speech subjects, it totally depends.

110
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,250
And you need to render a judgment.

111
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,220
So keep in mind if we look at that chart or if we think on that chart,

112
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,300
true persuasion is exceptionally complex and situational.

113
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,160
And you need to think carefully about what you can accomplish in the time

114
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,320
that you have for the audience that you have and therefore what you should

115
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,770
attempt to do.

116
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:39,840
So many years ago, I was teaching the persuasive speech here at the

117
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,250
University of Washington.

118
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,000
And I had this student come up afterwards.

119
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,950
And he was thinking about topics and what he should try to do and whether

120
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,760
or not he should have counter arguments.

121
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,750
And I said, well, what are you speaking on?

122
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,480
And he said, well, you know, what I'd like to do--

123
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:58,790
and I should point out this student had no shortage of self-confidence.

124
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,490
One time this particular student came into class drunk

125
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,210
wearing a gigantic sombrero.

126
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,180
That was a joy.

127
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,400
That was a joy for me and for everyone involved.

128
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,350
Nevertheless, so this student came in.

129
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,230
And I said, well, what do you want to work on?

130
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,520
He says, well, what I'd like to do is I'd like to argue that all religions

131
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,940
in the world should be banned.

132
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,060
I was like, well, let's see where this one's running.

133
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,560
Do tell, why?

134
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,670
And he said, well, the fact of matter is I'm pretty good at persuasion.

135
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:29,330
And I worry that if I'm not setting a high bar, the speech is going to be

136
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,810
boring for me.

137
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,950
All I could think was, wow, you've persuaded me that you're an ass.

138
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,060
Congratulations.

139
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,750
But so what he was hoping to do is total conversion in

140
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,160
the span of 10 minutes.

141
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,540
That's probably not going to happen.

142
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,330
Most persuasion is incremental.

143
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,290
So if you're meeting an audience that's opposed to it, you're probably

144
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,880
hoping to move them slightly along that slider.

145
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,230
Get them a little less opposed to you.

146
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:57,550
Odds are somebody's not hearing the speech dead-set opposed to you and at

147
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,500
the end of five minutes, hallelujah, the scales have fallen from my eyes

148
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,290
and you are speaking the true word.

149
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,390
That's probably not happening in this time frame on these types of speeches.

150
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,580
So in the next lecture, we'll look at tracking down these areas that you

151
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,170
want to speak to with counter arguments.

152
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:16,310
This lecture was more about thinking through whether or not you should have

153
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,210
counter arguments.

154
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,040
In the next lecture, we'll look at, well, if you need those counter

155
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,490
arguments, where should you be speaking to them?

156
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,630
What are the counter arguments?

157
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,440
What are the issues that you need to address?

158
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,690
