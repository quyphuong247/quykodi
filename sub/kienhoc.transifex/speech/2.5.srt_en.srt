MATT MCGARRITY: If you'll remember back to the model of argument discussed

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,109
earlier this week, we had those three essentials of an argument, claim,

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:09,840
support, and warrant.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,130
And we've talked about claims.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,520
Those are your main points in this impromptu speech.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,290
Now, let's go ahead and turn our attention to support.

7
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,590
And, in fact, next week, we're going to be talking about how you build that

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,330
bridge from the support to the claim.

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,860
We'll be talking about that warrant.

10
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,700
So what is the role of support?

11
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,480
Well, remember, that support, that evidence, is there to

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,150
validate the claim.

13
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,710
And it's important to remember the job of support, because this focus on the

14
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:40,060
role of support, is that it helps you come up with better evidence and

15
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,140
discuss that evidence in a more targeted way.

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,130
So the nice thing about this is you can start identifying more when and

17
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,860
how you, or others, start kind of going off topic in

18
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,510
discussion of a point.

19
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,680
So given that, how do you go about dialing in on the necessary support

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,920
that you need for your claims?

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,820
Well, as you did when you were coming up with main points, I think a

22
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,180
question prompt is useful here.

23
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,980
So as you look at your claims that you've prepped there.

24
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,710
You look at each one and you say, well, what knowledge or experience am

25
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,820
I basing my belief on here?

26
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,560
And in responding to that question, we're keeping two things in mind.

27
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,300
First, does the evidence relate to the main point it's supporting?

28
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,160
And second, is that evidence concrete?

29
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,200
Now, clearly the evidence should relate to the main point it's

30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,700
supporting.

31
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,340
Your job is explaining that relevance.

32
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,810
But indeed, your life is a lot easier, your job as a lot easier, if that

33
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,450
evidence is clearly relevant to the claim that it's advancing.

34
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,060
But beyond that, it should be concrete, and by this, I mean, you've

35
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,050
got details.

36
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,140
There are examples, specific things that you can talk

37
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,300
about in that support.

38
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,480
Because without that, you're going to run into problems.

39
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,430
The more detail that there is in your support, the more you can do to relate

40
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,660
it to the claim.

41
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,700
If your support is overly vague, you really won't have that

42
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,970
much to talk about.

43
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,479
You'll kind of run through that point pretty quickly.

44
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,650
I'm going to ask you to prep and run an impromptu at the end of this video.

45
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,460
Usually, what we see is when people first start doing these impromptus,

46
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,840
they're coming up pretty short.

47
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,620
So they're running about two minutes instead of five or six minutes.

48
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:27,600
And 9 times out of 10, it is because, that evidence, that support, that

49
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,030
you're using in the impromptu is too vague.

50
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,500
There's not enough detail or concreteness in that point.

51
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,670
So you really want to be thinking about, can I populate the support with

52
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:43,130
examples that I can explain and describe and relate to that claim?

53
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,540
You can use hypothetical examples, right?

54
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,350
In many cases, that might be the best evidence that you've got at hand, but

55
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,775
those hypothetical examples had better be plausible examples, because they

56
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:57,780
are there to validate the claim that you're making.

57
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,490
So what I'd like to do as a way of sort of demonstrating and talking

58
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,940
about evidence in an impromptu speech, is I'm just going to go ahead and

59
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,950
compose and deliver a single point from an impromptu.

60
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,450
I'll actually do another full impromptu next week.

61
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,940
But for this demonstration, I've chosen this as a thesis statement.

62
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,650
MOOC providers, providers like Coursera, EdX, so on and so forth,

63
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,760
should not pressure universities to award credit for MOOC classes.

64
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,080
And the reason I'm going with this example, is I want to use an

65
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,460
accessible example for this class.

66
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,850
You may not have a deep investment in this topic, and that's fine.

67
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,140
At the end of this lecture, I'm going to ask you to argue the counter case,

68
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,930
and I'll probably argue the counter case next week.

69
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,270
But I just want to make sure that we've all got something that kind of

70
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,040
makes sense to this particular online audience.

71
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,750
But for this thesis, I would have these main points.

72
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,380
Such pressure would restrict the diversity of MOOCs and such pressure

73
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,940
wouldn't really work.

74
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,930
And you can see here my two pieces of support for each claim.

75
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,000
First, it limits the range of classes, and second, it limits the range of

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,030
universities.

77
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,130
And then, the faculty who make these decisions are generally immune from

78
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:10,630
MOOC pressure, and such pressure would only increase faculty ill will.

79
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,100
So I'm just going to perform from the introduction all the way through the

80
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,329
first main point.

81
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:20,440
And I want you to pay particular attention to the relevance of the

82
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,990
evidence, as well as the concreteness that I use in discussing the evidence.

83
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,030
So let me go ahead and do this short impromptu on that thesis statement.

84
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,180


85
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,040
I'm pretty invested now in the discussion around MOOCs.

86
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,810
I've taught a MOOC.

87
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,630
I've taken MOOCs.

88
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,220
I've written on MOOCs.

89
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,580
I've spend a lot of time around MOOCs.

90
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,870
Now, I certainly understand why people, MOOC providers, students,

91
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,010
would want to award credit for MOOCs.

92
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:53,350
Nevertheless, I argue that MOOC providers, like Coursera and EdX,

93
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,990
should not pressure universities to award university

94
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,350
credit for MOOC classes.

95
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,830
And I think there's a lot of reasons for this.

96
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,450
Two particularly stand out to me.

97
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:08,360
One is that such pressure would restrict the diversity of MOOCs, and

98
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,610
that's a bad thing.

99
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,030
But beyond that, I don't actually think this pressure would work.

100
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,870
And so it's kind of unnecessary to do it even in the first place.

101
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,640
Now, let me turn to this idea that pressuring for credit would restrict

102
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,060
the diversity of MOOCs.

103
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,650
I don't think this is where we want to be moving.

104
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,610
I think it would restrict the diversity of MOOCs because it would

105
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,900
limit the range of classes that are available online, and it would

106
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,770
probably limit the range of universities that are willing to

107
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,640
participate in MOOCs.

108
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,850
So how would it restrict the diversity of classes?

109
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:46,300
Well, there are a lot of classes that I can think of that don't operate on a

110
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,960
credit basis, so the public speaking class, the public speaking MOOC, does

111
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,160
not operate on a credit basis.

112
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,870
And so that would be out of the running, if there was this real

113
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,220
emphasis on credit.

114
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,160
And the public speaking class is not alone.

115
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,540
There are a lot of humanities classes, where it's going to be skill

116
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:09,900
development or music classes and those classes would not be welcome if there

117
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,740
was such a heavy emphasis on credit.

118
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,600
And that would restrict their diversity,

119
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,460
diversity of online offerings.

120
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,680
I don't think that's good.

121
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,850
But beyond that it would also limit the range of universities that are

122
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,250
willing to participate.

123
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:27,670
So right now, a lot of universities opt out of doing MOOCs anyway, but if

124
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,910
we started seeing a demand for credit that opting out would only increase.

125
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,950
So for example, Duke University.

126
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:37,240
Duke University runs some MOOCs, but they've been very clear that they're

127
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,020
not going to offer any credit, and any attempts to offer credit are met with

128
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:46,890
a strong response from their faculty senate.

129
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,530
So overall, I think we'd see a decrease in the diversity of classes,

130
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,640
and the diversity of universities participating in MOOCs, and that's

131
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,730
kind of opposite direction of where MOOCs should head in, if they're truly

132
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,470
about educational access.

133
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,100
And then, I would move on to point two.

134
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,020
So there you've got kind of the introduction and

135
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,420
that first main point.

136
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,830
So we go back and look at that evidence.

137
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:11,940
So in my 1a, my first piece of evidence for my first claim, it limits

138
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,200
the diversity of classes.

139
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,090
Well, does that relate to the claim?

140
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,160
Sure.

141
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,610
My job is to show this, but limiting the range of classes and limiting the

142
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,750
diversity of MOOCs, that kind of makes sense.

143
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,490
Those are very similar.

144
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,560
Is it concrete?

145
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,020
Yeah.

146
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,830
I got examples.

147
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,940
I've got this class, but I've also got other humanities classes that

148
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,930
illustrate this point.

149
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,790
Then you look at the 1b, it limits the diversity of universities.

150
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,470
Well, certainly, there I can talk through that Duke case.

151
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,510
So that's kind of what I want that evidence to do, what you want that

152
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,290
evidence to do.

153
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,280
So now, let's have you do it.

154
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,210
So I want you to craft up evidence for a claim, and we're going to argue the

155
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,670
opposite case.

156
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,360
Here's the thesis, and I'll even give you the main points.

157
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,720
So the thesis is MOOC providers should pressure universities to award credit

158
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,600
for MOOC classes, and here's why.

159
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,160
Here are the claims I want you to come up with, that I want you to work with.

160
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,890
A focus on credit improves the MOOC's quality and universities can always

161
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,390
opt out of credit.

162
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,650
So, in essence, this point is saying, pressure is not the

163
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,610
same thing as demand.

164
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:21,450
So I want you to draft up evidence for these claims and try running through

165
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,370
the speech.

166
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:27,130
Now, in point one, you're probably going to want evidence, cases, where

167
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:31,400
credit equals quality, and in point two, you probably want examples where

168
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,919
pressure isn't the same thing as demanding.

169
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,210
So that's what I want you to do.

170
