00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,770
MATT MCGARRITY: So I'd like to spend a little bit of time talking about

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,370
strategic language use.

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,480
And perhaps the best way to get into this--

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,890
and there's a fair bit of research on this-- is through framing language.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,570
And framing here is a metaphor.

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,860
So you can imagine sort of a picture and it's surrounded by a frame.

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,720
Now how you interpret the picture is affected by the frame

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,490
that surrounds it.

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:27,380
So if it's a very plain frame, you might have a different interpretation

10
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,690
then if it's a very ornate and elaborate frame.

11
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,660
So framing affects how you see the picture.

12
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,180
Now the picture itself doesn't change, just the way in which you're invited

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,760
to see the subject matter itself.

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,860
And in talking about framing language, strategic language, I'm not talking

15
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,520
about lying or misrepresenting any ideas.

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,280
I'm talking about deliberately choosing your words.

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,570
So this is not some sort of Orwellian night is day, black is white, we've

18
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,210
always been at war with East Asia sort of thing, but rather I'm talking about

19
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,840
finding and highlighting credible commonalities.

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,250
And so you might think about this as sort of the counterpoint to stasis.

21
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,180
Wherein stasis points you are finding points of clash, now we're looking to

22
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,990
find points of commonality.

23
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,410
So you can't ignore-- as we talked about last week-- you can't ignore

24
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,460
those really big stasis points.

25
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,460
But, nor should you ignore those points of commonality.

26
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,580
That seems a really rich area for language development as a way of

27
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,570
encouraging agreement with your position.

28
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,940
So I would like to think through finding and highlighting credible

29
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,310
commonalities by looking for these areas of overlap between topic,

30
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,640
speaker, and audience.

31
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,600
And the rhetorical theorist Kenneth Burke might call this identification

32
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,790
or consubstantiality.

33
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,710
And so he's really clearly borrowing from the theological sense of

34
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,210
consubstantiality there.

35
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:54,020
But he's talking about where we share a common substance.

36
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,890
And finding these possible commonalities might be easy.

37
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:02,060
The real challenge for you and for that target audience is finding ones

38
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,260
that audience will actually find as credible.

39
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,930
And that's [? sort ?]

40
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:06,500
[? of ?] key.

41
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,470
So let me give you an example of this.

42
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,850
So back when I was in graduate school--

43
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,650
I got my master's and my PhD at Indiana University.

44
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,710
I'm not from Indiana, but that's where I went to grad school.

45
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:24,000
And as someone who had speech and debate background the student

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,450
elections would run debates.

47
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,780
And so I was one of the moderators for those student elections.

48
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,020
Now, if you're familiar with elections in general, much less student

49
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:38,100
elections, student elections and student campaign tickets tend to

50
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,310
promise a lot more than they actually do.

51
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:45,580
So as a moderator I typically want to hear hard answers to the real

52
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,800
questions, not just, do you like puppies, or stuff like that.

53
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,900
So the question I asked when it came to my turn was, "What can--

54
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,370
here at Indiana University-- what can student government not do?"

55
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,630
I mean this is a question to suss out where they are practical.

56
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,660
All right, student government can't do a lot of things.

57
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,470
I mean they can't make faculty decisions.

58
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,000
They control a budget and they can make recommendations to the

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,700
university, but there are some strengths and limitations to student

60
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,250
government.

61
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,820
So I asked this question and the different presidential candidates from

62
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,120
each ticket would come up.

63
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,350
And they would answer the question.

64
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,480
The first person gets up there and says, well, you know, we don't have

65
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,520
tuition setting authority, so we probably shouldn't be promising

66
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,590
anything about that.

67
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,470
Second ticket comes up and does pretty much the same spiel.

68
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,350
They're talking about what the real reach of student government is.

69
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,780
Well, the final presidential ticket guy gets up there.

70
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,990
And you can tell this is going to be something different.

71
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,130
He's winding up.

72
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,630
He's ready.

73
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,310
He's going third.

74
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,650
He's ready to knock this one out of the park.

75
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,110
And he says, well.

76
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,540
when I was a boy--

77
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,850
your sensor should go up when you hear that.

78
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,560
But, he says, well, when I was a boy, I had just finished playing a baseball

79
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,830
game in Little League, and we were driving back home.

80
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,430
It was me and my dad in our truck.

81
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,310
And my dad looked over at me, and I was very disappointed that day because

82
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,190
we had lost.

83
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,920
And he said, son, this is America.

84
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,830
And in America, you can do whatever you want and be whatever you want.

85
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,589
So then he brings it back and he says, so when I hear your question, what can

86
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:21,180
student government not do, my answer is nothing.

87
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,590
We can do anything that we so choose.

88
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,240
The people who supported him loved it.

89
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,170
Everybody else was like, what in the heck did this guy just say?

90
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:34,000
I mean it was clear he had heard a lot of political speeches and said, this

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,460
is going to be what people love.

92
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,190
I'm surprised it wasn't, we were driving in our American-made truck on

93
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,670
the way through the cornfields.

94
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,240
We were actually eating apple pie as we sat in the cab.

95
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,540
We passed mom and she threw ice cream at us.

96
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,903
I'm surprised that it didn't have all that sort of--

97
00:04:50,903 --> 00:04:53,650
and then an eagle swooped down, and it kissed us with a

98
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,300
gun, and said, freedom.

99
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,130
You know, so there are all sorts of limitations.

100
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,410
But what was happening there, at least for his target audience of people who

101
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:07,100
had yet to decide to vote for him was, those were commonalities, ostensibly,

102
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,620
but they were not credible.

103
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,280
They had nothing to do with the question.

104
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,400
They were jammed in and they felt phony.

105
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,840
So the issue is not just finding a potential area of commonality, but is

106
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,500
it a credible commonality for this audience on this topic.

107
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,030
And that's where this sort of speech writing and strategic language use is

108
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,430
fun, but it's also ethical.

109
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,720
Because you're looking for what are genuinely the

110
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,130
commonalities that exist.

111
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,250
So I want to talk first to speaker-audience commonalities, and in

112
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,490
the next lecture we'll talk about audience-topic commonalities.

113
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,860
So first let's talk to what are some of these potential speaker-audience

114
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,520
commonalities, where you and that audience have some sort of common

115
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,370
substance, have some sort of shared identity.

116
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,200
And in doing this, you really want to highlight where you and your audience

117
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,670
are on the same side.

118
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,490
And we did some of this back in the informative speech when we're talking

119
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,110
about eunoia, demonstrating that goodwill.

120
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:06,420
But, you want to be able to find and build on existing areas of agreement.

121
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,720
And a lot of this actually comes from--

122
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,330
there's a whole literature on negotiation.

123
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,170
So business schools do a lot of this.

124
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,170
And there's a well-known book--

125
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:20,400
Roger Fisher and William Ury's Getting To Yes--

126
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,090
and in that book, one thing they mentioned in terms of negotiation is,

127
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,000
be hard on the problem, but soft on people.

128
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,040
Meaning, you and that audience-- even if they disagree with you about some

129
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,350
ideas about the implementation--

130
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,940
they may agree that it's a problem.

131
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,940
So you can really rail on the problem because it's something that doesn't

132
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,410
fight back.

133
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,430
So you can say on, whatever, funding schools.

134
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,730
We have to fund these schools better.

135
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,360
This is an issue that simply must be addressed.

136
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,550
Now, you and I might actually disagree on specifically what needs to be done,

137
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,000
but we can certainly agree that this is something

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,650
that demands our attention.

139
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,550
Now, we can quibble over the details, but-- so you get the idea.

140
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,500
You can minimize the disagreements that you have if you're highlighting

141
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,930
the agreements that you have in addressing the ill.

142
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,220
Now that really works if the ill is a shared, recognized problem.

143
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,030
But still, you're understanding that you can be hard on the problem, but

144
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,510
soft on those who disagree with you.

145
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:22,480
So doing this allows you to show and to at least make evident--

146
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,810
because maybe the audience knows in the back of their mind that you have

147
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:25,950
some commonalities--

148
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,900
but you're bringing it to the fore.

149
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,890
So it really demonstrates what you and your audience share,

150
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,570
what you have in common.

151
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:37,640
So I want to show you a very brief clip a presidential candidate doing

152
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,290
this, because presidential candidates really do want to show a lot of those

153
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,190
areas of common interest.

154
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,720
And this is a clip from when Barack Obama was running for president for

155
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,830
the first time.

156
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,120
And in this speech he goes through-- this segment of this speech--

157
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,920
he goes through and actively talks about potential areas of disagreement

158
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,620
as being actual areas of commonality.

159
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,430
And I think it's also particularly good for this week, because he's doing

160
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,970
so through stylistic writing.

161
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:03,340
OK.

162
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,770
So we'll go ahead and take a listen to this and just come back shortly

163
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:11,530
afterwards and talk about what is he doing to highlight the commonalities

164
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,060
that exist between him and his audience.

165
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,280
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

166
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,750
-Yes, we can argue and debate our positions passionately, but all of us

167
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:25,530
must summon the strength and grace to bridge our differences, and unite in

168
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:31,600
common effort, black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American, Democrat,

169
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:38,429
Republican, young, old, rich, poor, gay, straight, disabled, or not.

170
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:40,390
All of us have to come together.

171
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:54,215
[APPLAUSE]

172
00:08:54,215 --> 00:08:59,380
-Ohio, in this election we cannot afford the same political games and

173
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,990
tactics that are being used to pit us against one another, to make us afraid

174
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,490
of one another.

175
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:10,665
The stakes are to high to divide us by class, and region, and background, by

176
00:09:10,665 --> 00:09:13,590
who we are or what we believe.

177
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:17,780
Because despite what our opponents may claim, there are no real or fake parts

178
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,670
of this country.

179
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:25,800
There is no city or town that's more pro-America than anywhere else.

180
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,300
We're one nation.

181
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,790
All of us proud.

182
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,840
All of us patriots.

183
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,450
[APPLAUSE]

184
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,050
-There are patriots who supported this war in Iraq, and

185
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,130
patriots who opposed it.

186
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:42,370
Patriots who believe in Democratic policies, and those who believe in

187
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,320
Republican policies.

188
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,580
The men and women who serve in our battlefields, some may be Democrats,

189
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,880
some may be Republicans, others independents, but they fought together

190
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,120
and they bled together.

191
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,600
And some died together under the same proud flag.

192
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,170
They have not served a red America or a blue America.

193
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,018
They serve the United States of America.

194
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:05,886
[APPLAUSE]

195
00:10:05,886 --> 00:10:06,850
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

196
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,930
MATT MCGARRITY: So in that clip-- that brief clip--

197
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:13,930
rarely do you find such a clear laying out of, here are areas that might be

198
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,970
considered divisions, but in truth they are actually areas of

199
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,390
commonality.

200
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,890
He's almost going through a demographic checklist.

201
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,550
The other thing-- and we'll get to this more under delivery--

202
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:27,450
is, listen to how he sort of rides the audience response.

203
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,520
He builds up that audience response as they're getting louder, they're

204
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,220
applauding.

205
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,740
Then he stops, lets that audience continue to applause, and then as the

206
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,720
applause is starting to go down, he doesn't let them get totally silent.

207
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,450
They get right around here and he starts on the next line, and starts

208
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,650
building them up again.

209
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,550
So he's kind of really playing back and forth with that audience in terms

210
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:49,420
of not letting them go totally silent, but not trying to talk over them at

211
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,140
their loudest point of applause.

212
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:57,230
So I just want to draw this video to a close by asking you to think about a

213
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,070
speech that you're working on right now.

214
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:05,330
And going through and identifying just nouns or phrases that could unite you

215
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,240
and your audience as a commonality.

216
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,590
So if you are doing something on persuasive speech for this audience,

217
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,690
for this MOOC audience.

218
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,330
You could talk about us as global citizens, as advocates for education,

219
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,720
as MOOCers, which actually doesn't sound all that good.

220
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,980
That sounds actually kind of bad.

221
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,900
But I want you to just think about a speech that you're working on, either

222
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:29,480
for this class or for outside of this class, and identify nouns that provide

223
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,930
a common identity to you and your target audience.

224
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:36,550
So go ahead and do that now, or think about that now, and then we'll talk

225
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:40,140
more about topic-audience commonalities in

226
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,390
the next video lecture.

227
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,240
