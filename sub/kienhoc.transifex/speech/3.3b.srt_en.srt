MATT MCGARRITY: I would like now to talk a little bit about introductions,

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,500
specifically introductions for the impromptu speech.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,670
And sort of the obvious question is, do you even need an introduction for

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,210
such a short speech?

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,880
And the answer is, well maybe, maybe not.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,430
But really what I want to work on here is helping you develop a type of

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:24,270
muscle memory, a type of an automatic response to always give orientations

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,010
to those audiences as a way of being clear for that audience.

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,670
So if your default is to preview and provide a road map for your audience,

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,360
that's a good habit to have, or at least it's good to have the option to

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,350
choose not to have that clarity.

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,810
But I'd rather the default to be clarity.

13
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,630
But as we think about introductions and conclusions, I don't think

14
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,670
necessarily about what the content is of the introduction or the conclusion.

15
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,940
I typically think more in terms of function.

16
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,950
So what is an introduction need to accomplish?

17
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,060
Well it should let the audience know that you've started.

18
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,370
I mean, that's pretty important.

19
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,360
But it also should provide a type of orientation, letting the audience know

20
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,650
what you're going to be talking about during the time that

21
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,040
you have with them.

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,840
So you could think of the introduction of your speech as sort of the curtain

23
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,820
coming up on that presentation, on that performance.

24
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,080
So you want to make sure that you've got a good opening, that that curtain

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,950
is coming up seamlessly, nicely.

26
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,310
So one thing to imagine is don't immediately begin.

27
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,100
Take some time before you start the speech.

28
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,760
Allow for pregnant pause, maybe, to draw attention.

29
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,210
You do kind of want to be able to have an opening, as opposed to some sort of

30
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,570
seamless transition from the last person who was talking.

31
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:42,460
I used to coach with someone, and he had been a Presbyterian minister.

32
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,840
And when he really did good talks, he would, at the beginning, he would

33
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,240
start off and then he would begin.

34
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,200
But that warm up, that was doing something.

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,010
It was drawing attention.

36
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:01,470
But he had this routine, one that, by the way, I've totally stolen.

37
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,190
I'm happy to plagiarize gestures.

38
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,860
He would do this, and now I don't quite get into it as much as he does,

39
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,130
but at the beginning of a class or speech, I usually will kind of have

40
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,750
some type of pregnant pause there at the beginning to draw attention.

41
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,970
But once we've sort of started those words, I want the audience to know

42
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,970
where we're going.

43
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,080
So I want to have a clear opening, but then I want to move from that opening

44
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,630
to orientation, helping the audience know how we're going to be

45
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,950
spending our time.

46
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,790
So for the impromptus, I think, in this orientation, two things are

47
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,150
particularly important.

48
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,260
First off, state the thesis.

49
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,030
That is ostensibly the most important line in your speech, so it deserves

50
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,250
some attention.

51
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,290
In terms of how you're performing it, you'd probably put a brief pause

52
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:49,040
before that thesis sentence and after that thesis sentence, really trying to

53
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,950
set it apart from the rest of what you're saying.

54
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,720
After you've stated that thesis statement, I think the other sort of

55
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,720
key thing that's happening in that orientation is you're previewing your

56
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,900
main points.

57
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,990
We'll return to this throughout the other speeches, but giving the

58
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,930
audience a road map is beneficial, quite beneficial.

59
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,080
And that's because, especially in these speeches, we're focusing on

60
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,580
clarity, letting the audience know how many points I'm going to be

61
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,030
discussing, what the nature of those points are.

62
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,790
It helps clarify what we're going to be doing in that speech.

63
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:24,370
So I've worked up a sample impromptu here, and I just want to deliver the

64
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,560
introduction from it and kind of give you a sense for what

65
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,590
this would sound like.

66
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,200
So my speech is arguing the thesis that MOOCs can

67
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,170
teach performance skills.

68
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,540
And you see here, my two main points are MOOCs allow for the efficient

69
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,860
instruction of performance skills, and MOOCs allow for

70
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,720
productive student practice.

71
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,260
So in this, you should be able to hear sort of an opening and an orientation,

72
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,250
where I'm stating the thesis and previewing the main points.

73
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,500
All right?

74
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,060


75
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,430
I'm now pretty invested in the conversation around MOOCs.

76
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,220
I've taken MOOCs.

77
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,340
I've taught MOOCs.

78
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,700
And I have to admit, initially I was a bit skeptical whether, or not, a

79
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,340
performance skill like public speaking could be taught in a MOOC environment.

80
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,560
Obviously, now I'm a pretty strong believer in this, otherwise I wouldn't

81
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,230
be doing it.

82
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,760
But I understand why people would be skeptical that the MOOCs cannot teach

83
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,730
performance skills.

84
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,140
That said, I would argue the exact opposite.

85
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,370
MOOCs can teach performance skills.

86
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,680
And I think there's a lot of ways that we could talk through this.

87
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,750
There are two things that I really want to focus on.

88
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,220
First, I think MOOCs allow for efficient instruction

89
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,680
of performance skills.

90
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,410
And that's pretty important.

91
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:40,465
But beyond that, MOOCs are allowing for productive student practice.

92
00:04:40,465 --> 00:04:43,680
And so from there, I would transition into my first main point.

93
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,640
But that's it.

94
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,060
That was the whole introduction.

95
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,890
You kind of knew that I had started, and you knew what I was arguing and

96
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,390
how I would argue it.

97
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:55,020
When we get into other speeches where introductions are maybe more elaborate

98
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,750
affairs, we'll tend to that.

99
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,610
Before the impromptu, I really want to strip down that introduction to its

100
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,770
key functions, opening and orientation.

101
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,390
So now what I'd like you to do is go ahead and you try.

102
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,270
Take that prepped speech, if you have one, and just wherever you are right

103
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,860
now, perform a very short introduction for your impromptu speech.

104
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,480
Now in the next lecture, we'll take up transitions and conclusions.

105
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,510
But go ahead and practice that introduction now.

106
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,834
