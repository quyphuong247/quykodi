MATT MCGARRITY: So this week we've talked about the mortar that

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,200
binds the speech together.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,860
So what I'd like to do now is just actually perform a speech and show you

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:14,460
where I am in each stage, each small aspect of that speech.

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,480
So I want you to listen for the major structure--

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,630
where I am in terms of introduction, main point one, main point two, and

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:20,500
the conclusion.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,890
But also listen for-- and I'll highlight this-- the internal

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,890
structure, right?

10
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,510
Where I am within that point.

11
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,740
Am I talking about the evidence?

12
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,100
Am I stating the claims?

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,040
and so forth.

14
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,370
And don't get too wrapped up in all this, right?

15
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,830
You'll see me going through the speech and where I am at each stage.

16
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,700
Take it for what it's meant to be, which is a way of thinking about what

17
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,880
the audience needs to hear at a given point.

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,350
So it's not necessarily what I want to say in terms of,

19
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,500
I've got this content.

20
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,570
I wrote this point.

21
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,490
But thinking in terms of, what does the audience need to hear or

22
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,130
understand at that specific point in the speech?

23
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,140
And so this model's trying to get you to think about how your guiding that

24
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,040
audience through the argument and highlighting that argument's

25
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,200
congruency, it's coherency.

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,030
And I would say the benefit of this model is it shifts us from thinking

27
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,290
about a speech as a series of bits of talk to a number of

28
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,110
small thresholds, right?

29
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,870
If I'm in that main point, have I talked enough about the claim so that

30
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,670
I can move on to getting into the evidence?

31
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,390
Once I'm in the evidence, have I talked about the evidence enough so

32
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,060
that I've addressed its concreteness?

33
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,690
Now I need to start relating it back to the claim.

34
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:33,250
So I'm thinking in terms of, what does this specific piece of the speech need

35
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,330
to do for the rest of the speech in order to make sense,

36
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,840
in order to be clear?

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,950
So I'm going to go ahead and do the impromptu speech, and you'll see where

38
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,010
I feel I am at each one of these points in time.

39
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,210
And I'm pretty good at this.

40
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,770
I've done this-- well, I shouldn't say that.

41
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,230
I've done this a lot, anyway.

42
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,740
And I'm pretty good at being able to land a speech at pretty close to a

43
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,640
second mark.

44
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,010
So I'm going to aim for this to be pretty much seven minutes on the nose

45
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,690
plus or minus a second or two.

46
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,340
You'll see a counter down here.

47
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:12,340
And you follow along with where I am in the speech.

48
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,810
So I'm now pretty invested in this conversation around MOOCs.

49
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,580
I've taught a MOOC.

50
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,880
I've taken MOOCs.

51
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,240
And, initially, I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical whether or not MOOCs

52
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,770
would be available to actually teach a performance

53
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,250
skill like public speaking.

54
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,390
And I know there are many out there, many academics, who would

55
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,350
feel the same way.

56
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,740
That MOOCs are not a good place or a good platform for teaching.

57
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,950
Performance skills like singing or music or dance or public speaking.

58
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,970
I'm now very much a convert.

59
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,910
I clearly believe in their capacity.

60
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,320
So what I'd like to argue is that, yes, MOOCs can

61
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,200
teach performance skills.

62
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,990
And there's actually a lot that I think could be said under this, but

63
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,700
there are two things I want to focus our attention on.

64
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:05,290
First, MOOCs can allow for efficient instruction of performance skills.

65
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,970
But beyond that, MOOCs can allow for productive student practice.

66
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,500
So let me tackle this instruction portion first.

67
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,590
So MOOCs allow for the effective instruction of performance skills.

68
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,390
So this is pretty important.

69
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,570
If you're taking any type of skills class, you want to have good-quality

70
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,320
instruction that can help you move from being a novice

71
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,480
over to being an expert.

72
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,900
But I think of a couple of ways in which this would actually shake out.

73
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,990
Well, MOOCs are very good at providing lecture content.

74
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:41,130
They're actually very good at providing modeling, helping someone

75
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,790
see and follow along with an expert.

76
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,590
So, under lectures, well, MOOCs are video platforms.

77
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,570
And so there's all this video lecture content available.

78
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:57,620
And I can think of a specific MOOC, a MOOC on math,

79
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,910
teaching math, math education.

80
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,730
Teaching math is difficult anyway, and it's especially difficult if you're

81
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,340
trying to get a number of young people interested and involved in math.

82
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,770
But there's a MOOC on math education.

83
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:14,620
And those videos are instructing the viewer, giving the viewer, all sorts

84
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,820
of ideas about activities to run or ways of talking about

85
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,000
mathematical concepts.

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,080
That instruction, that video instruction, is giving that teacher

87
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,450
stuff that they can then take and use in a classroom environment to refine

88
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,020
their own math education skills.

89
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,990
So those video lectures are very efficient at conveying that content.

90
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,070
There's certainly no significant difference between a video conveying

91
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,980
that content and a lecture hall means for conveying that content.

92
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,710
So lectures are pretty useful in a MOOC format for teaching skills.

93
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,920
But beyond that, MOOCs are also pretty good for modeling performance skills.

94
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,780
So, as we've talked about in this class, and is true in general with

95
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,510
performance skills, you want to be able to study with someone who's not

96
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,000
only giving you information but giving you some model to follow.

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,120
You analyze what they're doing.

98
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,780
So there's currently a MOOC on jazz improvisation.

99
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,960
I can't imagine more of a performance skill than improvisation, musical

100
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,870
improvisation.

101
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,400
But what's so great about that MOOC is those videos--

102
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,860
you can not only learn from the professor but watch the professor, see

103
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:25,270
how the professor's making decisions about musical variation.

104
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:29,190
So that modeling allows someone to study that performance skill.

105
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:34,010
And in fact, having it in a videos model actually might work even better

106
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,740
because you really get in there, back it up two seconds, go forward two

107
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,590
seconds, and do a close analysis of that performance skill.

108
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:46,720
So, by relying so heavily on video content, MOOCs really do allow for

109
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,510
efficient instruction.

110
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:54,970
Now beyond that, I think MOOCs are really good at allowing for productive

111
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,540
student practice.

112
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,460
Now that's tremendously important.

113
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,490
Instruction is great.

114
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,460
It's important to have good instruction.

115
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,020
But getting better at a skill is getting better at a skill.

116
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,780
And helping students refine their judgment, their abilities, moving them

117
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,670
from a novice to an expert.

118
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,520
So how can MOOCs go about doing this?

119
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,520
Well, I think MOOCs can help with practice, both through assignments and

120
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,010
by structuring private student practice.

121
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:27,450
So first under assignments, well, any skills class that you would take,

122
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:32,750
either in person, online, or in a massive open online format, are going

123
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,920
to have assignments that you build to.

124
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,630
So a skills class has you working on specific, itemizeable things, building

125
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,860
up to a capstone experience or capstone performance, like a piano

126
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,960
recital, and then you refine your skill in that assignment.

127
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,960
Well that's happening right now in many types of skills MOOCs.

128
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,470
There's a MOOC on guitar playing from the Berklee School of Music.

129
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,400
What happens there?

130
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,780
Same thing that would happen in many other types of guitar classes.

131
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,820
You watch the videos.

132
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,080
You learn these things.

133
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,420
You're getting better and better, but there are capstone assignments where

134
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,860
you have to play a guitar piece.

135
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,810
You record it and you post it online.

136
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,960
So the mechanisms are different, but the structure of that assignment, the

137
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,090
structure of that performance skill, is very much the same.

138
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:24,560
So the assignments are tapping into that same basic performance ability.

139
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,970
But beyond that, I think MOOCs are pretty good at structuring private

140
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,050
student practice.

141
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:36,770
And what I mean by this is, as someone who teaches skills, I know that

142
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,350
students are going to spend far more time away from me practicing the skill

143
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,150
than they ever will with me.

144
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:46,980
So I want to provide structure and shape to that practice.

145
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:51,770
Here at the University of Washington, we offer a free online dance class

146
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,450
where you can analyze dance, learn about the history of dance, and

147
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,770
practice movement.

148
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,290
Well, that's a way of structuring that practice.

149
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,210
So you can practice dance at home.

150
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,840
And in fact, this might be a real benefit.

151
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,300
Certainly, in a case like public speaking, there are probably a lot of

152
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,510
people who are so apprehensive, they'll never sign up for a live,

153
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,630
in-person class.

154
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,410
But they might watch the video, practice at home, get better, and

155
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,130
improve their own confidence.

156
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,530
So, again, both through formal assignments and informal practice,

157
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:27,810
MOOCs are really helping students develop these skills at practicing,

158
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,590
helping them do that.

159
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:35,070
So I certainly understand, by my own history, why someone would be

160
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,090
skeptical about MOOCs teaching performance skills.

161
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,202
But I would say, they can.

162
00:08:41,202 --> 00:08:46,500
They can provide efficient instruction and productive student practice.

163
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,930
I recognize, though, that it's not the same.

164
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:53,910
You don't get the one-on-one coaching or the immediacy of feedback that you

165
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,630
would in a live class.

166
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,710
But by the same token, you don't get the global reach or providing an

167
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,990
educational good for free in a university setting.

168
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,810
So they are different, but simply because they're different, doesn't

169
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,790
mean that MOOCs can't teach performance skills.

170
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,040
They can.

171
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,960


172
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,540
That's all.

173
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,120
Thank you.

174
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,470
Good night.

175
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,620
No, so, what I hope you got out of that is seeing where I am in each one.

176
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,770
And that was exactly seven minutes.

177
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,600
Kudos to me for a neat little parlor trick.

178
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,450
So that's kind of how I feel myself moving through each

179
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,840
component of the speech.

180
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,090
And it's not so much a sense of the content that I need to get out, but

181
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:40,410
all these inter-related goals that I have for audience understanding.

182
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:44,280
And I think it's far easier to think in my head, right?

183
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,040
Oh, I got to talk about my evidence now.

184
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,370
And, oh, I need to explain how that evidence relates to the claim.

185
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,720
That's a lot easier, mentally, for me, and it's more tied to where that

186
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,190
audience is than trying to think, oh, I'm in line five a paragraph three.

187
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,440
So I think this is really one of the benefits of running the impromptu.

188
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,080
It gives you a model for organizing your thoughts.

189
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,620
So run it a lot.

190
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,920
And I think you'll find that all of your talks will

191
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,770
probably start improving.

192
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,830
So with this discussion of arrangement now out of the way, I kind of want to

193
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,470
shift our attention to delivery.

194
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,460
And we're going to start in the next lecture with meeting the enemy.

195
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,010
Why do we have a fear public speaking?

196
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,260
