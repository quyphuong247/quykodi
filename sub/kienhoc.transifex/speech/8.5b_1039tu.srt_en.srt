Well, that&#39;s about it. That&#39;s what we have and that&#39;s what we owe. It isn&#39;t very much

1
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:18,080
but Pat and I have the satisfaction that every dime that we&#39;ve got is honestly ours. I should

2
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:26,699
say this—that Pat doesn&#39;t have a mink coat. But she does have a respectable Republican

3
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:33,000
cloth coat. And I always tell her that she&#39;d look good in anything.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,309
One other thing I probably should tell you because if we don&#39;t they&#39;ll probably be saying

5
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:44,309
this about me too, we did get something-a gift-after the election. A man down in Texas

6
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:52,949
heard Pat on the radio mention the fact that our two youngsters would like to have a dog.

7
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,969
And, believe it or not, the day before we left on this campaign trip we got a message

8
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:03,609
from Union Station in Baltimore saying they had a package for us. We went down to get

9
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:06,430
it. You know what it was.

10
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:12,570
It was a little cocker spaniel dog in a crate that he&#39;d sent all the way from Texas. Black

11
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:19,270
and white spotted. And our little girl-Tricia, the 6-year old-named it Checkers. And you

12
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:24,860
know, the kids, like all kids, love the dog and I just want to say this right now, that

13
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:31,860
regardless of what they say about it, we&#39;re gonna keep it.

14
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:39,780
It isn&#39;t easy to come before a nation-wide audience and air your life as I&#39;ve done. But

15
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,380
I want to say some things before I conclude.

16
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,360
In spite of the mears, the misunderstandings, the necessity for a man to come up here and

17
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,820
bare his soul as I have? Why is it necessary for me to continue this fight?

18
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:01,820
And I want to tell you why. Because, you see, I love my country. And I think my country

19
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,080
is in danger. And I think that the only man that can save America at this time is the

20
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,640
man that&#39;s runing for President on my ticket  — Dwight Eisenhower.

21
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,140
You say, &quot;Why do I think it&#39;s in danger?&quot; and I say look at the record. Seven years

22
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,980
of the Truman-Acheson Administration and that&#39;s happened? Six hundred million people lost

23
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:30,980
to the Communists, and a war in Korea in which we have lost 117,000 American casualties.

24
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,010
And I say to all of you that a policy that results in a loss of six hundred million people

25
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:42,580
to the Communists and a war which costs us 117,000 American casualties isn&#39;t good enough

26
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,640
for America.

27
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:49,010
And I say that those in the State Department that made the mistakes which caused that war

28
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,490
and which resulted in those losses should be kicked out of the State Department just

29
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,410
as fast as we can get &#39;em out of there.

30
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:01,640
And let me say that I know Mr. Stevenson won&#39;t do that. Because he defends the Truman policy

31
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,880
and I know that Dwight Eisenhower will do that, and that he will give America the leadership

32
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,209
that it needs.

33
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:13,370
Take the problem of corruption. You&#39;ve read about the mess in Washington. Mr. Stevenson

34
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:18,760
can&#39;t clean it up because he was picked by the man, Truman, under whose Administration

35
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,980
the mess was made. You wouldn&#39;t trust a man who made the mess to clean it up— that&#39;s

36
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,209
Truman. And by the same token you can&#39;t trust the man who was picked by the man that made

37
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:30,040
the mess to clean it up—and that&#39;s Stevenson.

38
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,120
And so I say, Eisenhower, who owes nothing to Truman, nothing to the big city bosses,

39
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,250
he is the man that can clean up the mess in Washington.

40
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,720
Take Communism. I say that as far as that subject is concerned, the danger is great

41
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,209
to America. In the Hiss case they got the secrets which enabled them to break the American

42
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:53,930
secret State Department code. They got secrets in the atomic bomb case which enabled them

43
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,260
to get the secret of the atomic bomb, five years before they would have gotten it by

44
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,239
their own devices.

45
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,099
And I say that any man who called the Alger Hiss case a &quot;red herring&quot; isn&#39;t fit to be

46
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:09,790
President of the United States. I say that a man who like Mr. Stevenson has pooh-poohed

47
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,780
and ridiculed the Communist threat in the United States—he said that they are phantoms

48
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,269
among ourselves; he&#39;s accused us that have attempted to expose the Communists of looking

49
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:25,199
for Communists in the Bureau of Fisheries and Wildlife—I say that a man who says that

50
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,169
isn&#39;t qualified to be President of the United States.

51
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:33,710
And I say that the only man who can lead us in this fight to rid the Government of both

52
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:39,710
those who are Communists and those who have corrupted this Government is Eisenhower, because

53
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:46,460
Eisenhower, you can be sure, recognizes the problem and he knows how to deal with it.

54
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:52,740
And, now, finally, I know that you wonder whether or not I am going to stay on the Republican

55
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,879
ticket or resign.

56
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:01,879
Let me say this: I don&#39;t believe that I ought to quit because I&#39;m not a quitter. And, incidentally,

57
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:06,939
Pat&#39;s not a quitter. After all, her name was Patricia Ryan and she was born on St. Patrick&#39;s

58
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,539
Day, and you know the Irish never quit.

59
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:16,069
But the decision, my friends, is not mine. I would do nothing that would harm the possibilities

60
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:22,150
of Dwight Eisenhower to become President of the United States. And for that reason I am

61
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:28,879
submitting to the Republican National Committee tonight through this television broadcast

62
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,259
the decision which it is theirs to make.

63
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:37,069
Let them decide whether my position on the ticket will help or hurt. And I am going to

64
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:41,960
ask you to help them decide. Wire and write the Republican National Committee whether

65
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:48,639
you think I should stay on or whether I should get off. And whatever their decision is, I

66
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,419
will abide by it.

67
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:55,879
But just let me say this last word. Regardless of what happens I&#39;m going to continue this

68
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:00,569
fight. I&#39;m going to campaign up and down America until we drive the crooks and the Communists

69
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:07,180
and those that defend them out of Washington. And remember, folks, Eisenhower is a great

70
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:14,180
man. Believe me. He&#39;s a great man. And a vote for Eisenhower is a vote for what&#39;s good for

71
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:15,520
America.
