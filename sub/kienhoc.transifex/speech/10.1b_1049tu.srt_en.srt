1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,130
SPEAKER: I want to spend a little bit of time talking about

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,760
your growth as a speaker.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,650
This has been an introduction to public speaking.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,530
But even in the span of an introductory course, I want you to

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,620
think about the growth that you've had, the strides that you've made over

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,160
these 10 weeks.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,390
So take a pause and reflect a little bit about your growth.

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,870
How have you grown as a speaker?

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,070
What skills have you improved upon?

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,320
Also on the other side, what are-- and I think you should really take a hard

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,490
look at this-- what are your current areas of strength and

12
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,940
weakness as a speaker?

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,790
And I would say, don't ignore your weaknesses, or they will always remain

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:39,640
your weaknesses.

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,050
But in identifying your speaking strengths, there's a

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:43,880
lot of benefit there.

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,640
Because once you know those strengths, when you go into a speaking situation,

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,660
you can begin to bend that speaking situation to your strengths.

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,010
So for example, I will occasionally find myself in situations where people

20
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,740
will give me talking points.

21
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,150
And I'll go over these talking points.

22
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,070
And more often than not, they're way too long and too [? writerly ?]

23
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,660
for how I am in front of a live audience.

24
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,740
So I tend to rewrite everything if I've got time and

25
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,280
edit it for my style.

26
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,830
Because whoever wrote that doesn't really know my style.

27
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:13,700
I know my style.

28
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,900
And I know what's going to work for me.

29
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,790
And this is true certainly at award, our scholarship, our academic

30
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,860
ceremonies.

31
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,670
I usually end up with large bios--

32
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,510
so people who I'm going to introduce with these large chunks of text.

33
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,060
And I know they're too long.

34
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,370
And so I've worked at getting better at rephrasing and re-editing--

35
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,550
not to the point where I'm doing damage to that content.

36
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,740
I want to be true to that content and to the person who it reflects or

37
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,510
whatever that content is reflecting.

38
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:46,080
But I want to make sure that it works for me in that speaking situation.

39
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,630
So I want to maintain truth to that text, but I also know when and how to

40
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,400
go off of that script.

41
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,170
I would say one of my strengths as a speaker-- and of course, actually,

42
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,860
ironically, one of the strengths that has not been on display, because I've

43
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,890
got two cameras staring at me-- is one of my strengths is

44
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,320
playing with an audience--

45
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,780
is really having those moments where I can joke around with the audience.

46
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,720
Or I can ask the audience questions.

47
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,130
Or I can really play with that audience reaction and be very

48
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,500
impromptu and extemporaneous and work in that venue.

49
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,830
But I know now when to do that, when to move from that script.

50
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,530
I would say as a younger speaker, I didn't know when to do that.

51
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,430
More often than not, I let the situation almost entirely determine my

52
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,220
performance.

53
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,260
And so I found myself putting myself into situations where I would not be

54
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,440
as successful.

55
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,570
So now I really aim for more of a middle ground.

56
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,600
I don't want to violate audience expectations or-- if it's something

57
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,840
I'm getting paid for--

58
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,330
employer expectations.

59
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,930
But I want to make sure that my strengths are on display.

60
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,740
So I want to know my strengths, so I can try to bend those situations to

61
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,180
highlight my strengths, or at least create a space so I can put my

62
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,660
strengths on display.

63
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,100
But of course, playing to your strengths means you

64
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,160
know what they are.

65
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,260
And this requires--

66
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,710
one, a lot of speaking--

67
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:04,530
but beyond that, a lot of self analysis.

68
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:09,390
So one thing I would recommend that you do is get in the habit of writing

69
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,700
up notes after your speeches.

70
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,380
After you're done, you go back to your office, or you go back home, and you

71
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,600
just sit down and you talk about what went well, what didn't--

72
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,030
maybe what you're going to change for next time.

73
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,640
And as difficult as it may be, I would really encourage you to do this

74
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,810
immediately, while the memory is still fresh.

75
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,850
So as soon as you're done, go back and say, boy, this really worked well.

76
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,950
This didn't work well.

77
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,370
Here's how I would change this speech or similar speeches

78
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,810
for the next go around.

79
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,510
So that's one thing in terms of your self reflection, your personal

80
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,660
reflection in this course.

81
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,460
But also I'd like to carve out a little bit of time for you to think

82
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,970
about perhaps what was the most fascinating aspect of this online

83
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,280
class for public speaking, which was its cross-cultural comparison.

84
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,830
So as you have watched, not only me, who may not be from your cultural

85
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,800
background, but you've watched other speakers and sample speakers, and

86
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,620
participated in discussions, perhaps online where the cultural nature of

87
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,620
speaking was on display.

88
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,980
Take some time and think--

89
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:17,440
what worked in your culture, but may not work in other cultures?

90
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,459
Or on the flip side, what works in other cultures for speaking, but may

91
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,870
not work in yours?

92
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,140
So what's working where?

93
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,770
And then were there some things that you saw that seem

94
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,240
to work across cultures?

95
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,830
Now of course, once again, the answer isn't to search out the one thing that

96
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,450
works across all cultures.

97
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,490
It would be so vague as to be meaningless.

98
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,770
What does it take to be good at public speaking?

99
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,980
Speaking well.

100
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,830
That's the level of specificity that probably comes at that global

101
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,250
recommendation.

102
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:52,620
But like in all good cross-cultural study, finding these points of overlap

103
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,710
or finding these points of difference should sensitize you to your practices

104
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,950
as a speaker--

105
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,280
and of course, give you an inventional resources.

106
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,980
What sounded good that you can borrow from, that you can imitate, that you

107
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:09,730
can study and really take something useful away from it for you?

108
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,530
So now that we've reviewed the course--

109
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,920
we've done a little bit of a self inventory in terms of how you've grown

110
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,570
and what you've learned in this cross-cultural environment--

111
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:23,090
I now want to turn to the final chunk of the course, and just start thinking

112
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,490
about what are your next steps as a speaker at the end of this course?

113
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,050
What are you going to be doing next?

114
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,300
