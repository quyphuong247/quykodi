00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,180
MATT MCGARRITY: What I'd like to do now is just talk very generally about how you

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,860
might come up with some ideas for your informative speech.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,350
Because, I mean, your informative speech needs ideas.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:10,950
That's what it's about.

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,280
That's what you're conveying to us.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,860
This new thing that we may not be familiar with, or an old thing that we

7
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,640
may have misapprehensions about.

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,320
So you're clarifying this issue for us, but it needs ideas.

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,000
Now, in you're informative speech, these ideas might be claims, as they

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,920
were in the impromptu, or they might just be sort of general areas that you

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,080
need to talk through.

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,510
But you have to figure out what this is.

13
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:35,840
Now, in some cases, you don't need to sort of ruminate on invention.

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,750
The ideas just pop in your head.

15
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,770
Let's say you wanted to speak on the Mars Rover and immediately you go, ah,

16
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,040
I know what I want to talk about.

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,900
I want to talk about how we built the Mars Rover, how we got the Mars Rover

18
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,220
to Mars, and the data that's coming back from the Mars Rover about Mars.

19
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,485
Maybe you know, those are the three big things I want to talk about, in

20
00:00:55,485 --> 00:00:58,460
which case, great, but in many other cases you need to think

21
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,140
a little bit more.

22
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,850
Prime that mental pump to figure out what exactly you need to talk through.

23
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,130
And so I kind of want to go back to that Aristotelian definition, one of

24
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,690
the Aristotelian definitions, of rhetoric, which is an ability in each

25
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:15,200
case to see the available means of persuasion.

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,580
So in that definition, it's about being able to see all possible routes,

27
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,890
or at least many of the possible routes, that you might pursue in

28
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,530
designing a speech, and I think that's very useful.

29
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,420
Even if, when you're talking about the Mars Rover, you immediately know what

30
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,520
you want to speak on.

31
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,870
You still should probably spend some time thinking about other

32
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:39,940
possibilities, because the goal would be to be able to generate more content

33
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,210
than you could use so that you can then judge.

34
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,890
Because, again, the informative speech is about you making an assessment in

35
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,170
terms of what's going to be good for the speech.

36
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,040
Does the topic require a discussion of this point?

37
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,730
Does the audience require a discussion of this point?

38
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:58,790
You want to have more options out there so you can render judgment and

39
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,300
design the best possible speech.

40
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,770
So invention is very useful, even if you think you know what you're going

41
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:04,540
to speak on.

42
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,940
Because odds are, that will probably change over time.

43
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,039
So there are a lot of ways to study invention, and in this video, what

44
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,890
we're going to do is I'm going to talk sort of about the very broad lines of

45
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,670
argument, or lines of speech.

46
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,870
Just some questions that you might ask yourself to come up with ideas for the

47
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,820
informative speech.

48
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,670
In the next video, we're actually going to go ahead and look at

49
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,810
arrangement a little bit and see how can arrangement give us some ideas

50
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,670
about what we might want to include?

51
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,640
So in this video, I want to kind of about some very general prompts, some

52
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,330
of them from antiquity.

53
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,470
Then I want to talk a little bit about audience prompts, and how the audience

54
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,920
can help us figure out what needs to be addressed.

55
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,730
Then, I just want to conclude by talking about some ideas for your

56
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,320
informative speech assignment in this class.

57
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,870
Now, that said, even if you never do post a video for this class, all that

58
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,590
I'm talking about should be applicable to informative presentations that you

59
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,510
give outside this class.

60
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,230
And I'm going to come back to this a couple of times, and that is, even if

61
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,680
you're not working up a speak for this class, I really think that you should

62
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,190
be mapping something out, thinking about the next type of informative

63
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:15,040
presentation you need to give, and using this class as a workspace, using

64
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,000
that next assignment as a way of sharpening your

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,660
understanding of this material.

66
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:25,430
Because these videos are great as sort of general pieces of advice, but, you

67
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,720
know, speech is a skill, and you need to refine that skill through practice.

68
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,140
And so being able to work up informative presentations, that's

69
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,170
what's going to get you better at it.

70
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,550
So I would strongly urge you to actually start putting together a

71
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,200
number of informative presentations, even if you don't do them for class.

72
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,660
So like I said, I'd like to start with some just sort of broad, general,

73
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,780
inventional topics.

74
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,410
From the Greek tradition, we would call these topoi.

75
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,410
Aristotle wrote a lot about topoi and possible realms for

76
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,790
coming up with ideas.

77
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,780
In the Roman tradition, we'd probably call these loci.

78
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,690
Common places, places where we figure out what we might want to argue, or

79
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,660
what we might want to talk about.

80
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,670
But they remain very general, useful, inventional guides.

81
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,260
And, in fact, we actually talked about some in the impromptu.

82
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,300
I didn't tell you that.

83
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,870
I'm devious that way, but I'm saying it now.

84
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,839
So we talked about these in that impromptu speech.

85
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,640
So one of them would be division.

86
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,990
What are the key components of your speech?

87
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:25,120
So that Mars Rover example I gave would probably be just thinking

88
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,280
through, what are the key parts of the topic?

89
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,930
So that's sort of almost the life cycle of the Mars Rover.

90
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,220
Where it came from, how it got there, what it's giving us back.

91
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,530
Also division just is a way of thinking through where I want to

92
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,190
cleave, where the break is, and thinking in terms of, how do I break

93
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,340
this into its constituent parts?

94
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,150
Another one that we get out of the classical tradition is definition.

95
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,950
And that's a very useful way of figuring out what you

96
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,090
need to speak on.

97
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,720
Especially useful in an informative speech, where maybe that audience

98
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,830
doesn't know the key terminology.

99
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,690
So trying to figure out what are the key definitions that they need to

100
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,730
understand?

101
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,500
So a couple years ago, I was working with someone on a speech.

102
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,760
Here in Seattle the city council was considering a ban on aggressive

103
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,880
panhandling.

104
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,850
And some people were for it, some people were against it, but I had

105
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,000
someone who was trying to provide some information about it.

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,930
And a lot of that speech came down to defining what aggressive panhandling

107
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,670
meant, because it was not what most people thought it meant.

108
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,600
And so that was a very specific legal definition, and that gave him a lot of

109
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,580
information that was very useful for that audience to be

110
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,040
able to speak through.

111
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,720
But he got to that by thinking, what is the definition here?

112
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,060
And I want to make sure everybody understands it.

113
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,990
Certainly, we can look to similarity, or difference, or comparison.

114
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,840
So a good example of this might be, how are modern democracies similar or

115
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,460
different from models of democracy from antiquity?

116
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,350
So just thinking through all the ways in which they're similar or different,

117
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,080
you start generating a number of potential points that you can then

118
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,890
address, if it works for the speech.

119
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,490
Now, in more modern versions, we can think of this, although actually

120
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,910
there's an indication that we can get this partially from the classic

121
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,700
tradition, but certainly, in a more modern iteration, we talk about the

122
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:13,050
five Ws and an H. Who, what, when, why, where, and how.

123
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,200
So those are just ways of approaching your topic and asking multiple

124
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,940
questions of your topic to figure out, what would somebody need to know?

125
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,930
So again, here in Washington state, we recently legalized marijuana, not just

126
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,000
medicinal marijuana.

127
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,110
We legalized pot, us and Colorado, hooray us.

128
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:35,080
And there's so many jokes, but I will pass on them now, because we've only

129
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,980
got so much time.

130
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,810
So we just passed this marijuana legalization.

131
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:44,410
So if you're trying to, as the police here in our state are as well as the

132
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:50,160
legislature is and the individual legislators are, trying to explain to

133
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,660
the citizens of Washington, well, what does this mean?

134
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,670
Well, this gives you a lot of potential areas for

135
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,970
explaining that content.

136
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,750
Who can possess marijuana?

137
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,040
How much can they possess?

138
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,170
What are the penalties for having too much?

139
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:07,680
How are they going to do roadside sobriety checks when it comes to

140
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,610
marijuana use?

141
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,790
What are the penalties for selling to a minor?

142
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,610
So all these, how are they going to process these?

143
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,100
Where they going to sell it?

144
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,930
You could spend a lot of time throwing those five Ws and an H at this topic

145
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:26,140
and generate a ton of potential areas for discussion.

146
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:30,490
Then, you can sort through all those potential areas and say, for my topic,

147
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:34,140
for my audience, these are really important, these less so.

148
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,490
So you're able to render a critical judgment about

149
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,570
inclusion and exclusion.

150
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,990
A little bit about arrangement pattern.

151
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,700
So those are sort of the topoi.

152
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,930
Arrangement patterns, we'll take up primarily in the next lecture.

153
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,080
But I'm not trying to put the cart before the horse there, but

154
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,640
arrangement, thinking about how we might arrange it, can also kind of

155
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,820
help us figure out what areas we haven't included enough

156
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,010
of, or too much of.

157
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,210
But we'll pick up arrangement as an inventional

158
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,800
resource in the next lecture.

159
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,840
One of your chief inventional resources, especially in the

160
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,840
informative speech, is your audience, thinking through your speech from

161
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,370
their perspective.

162
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,640
What don't they currently understand?

163
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,870
Your job is to inform that audience, so you should probably figure out what

164
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,790
they don't understand at the moment, and then remedy that.

165
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:24,010
And think back to those communication goals.

166
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,000
So in those goals you were saying, here's what I want

167
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,550
that audience to achieve.

168
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,630
Look at those goals and say, well, what's preventing the audience from

169
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,680
achieving that goal?

170
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,110
Maybe that's the blockage.

171
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,380
Maybe that's what you need to explain away so that they can better

172
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,400
understand it.

173
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,580
So you need to be thinking through what sort of misunderstandings does a

174
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,409
novice with this material normally make?

175
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:46,860
And so you're trying to think as much as possible from the perspective of a

176
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,990
listener, and a listener who doesn't know as much about the

177
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,640
topic as you do.

178
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,570
So what would some of their potential questions be?

179
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,820
Depending on what the subject is it would be, how does this work?

180
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,780
What is an unexpected finding or a surprising thing about this topic that

181
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,030
I wouldn't have known ahead of time?

182
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:07,570
What's an example of this thing in practice?

183
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,820
Because your job is to help that audience understand your topic.

184
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,470
That's what you're doing as an informative speaker.

185
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,680
So what's currently preventing them from understanding it?

186
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,560
Is it a lack of information?

187
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,950
Or maybe it's an abundance of bad information.

188
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:26,560
And your tactics would change based on whether or not you've got to provide

189
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,300
information that they've never heard of, or you've got to counter bad

190
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:31,870
information.

191
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,660
You may think this is the case, but let me show you why it's not, and let

192
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,790
me explain what is, in fact, the truth.

193
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,060
So this is all these sort of generating ideas.

194
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,690
These are very broad themes.

195
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,300
Definition, that's pretty big.

196
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,900
And at this level, we're just trying to throw some pretty big questions at

197
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,260
your subject matter to help you generate all

198
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,860
possible lines of argument.

199
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,560
Helping you figure out what are those possible means of persuasion, as

200
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,880
Aristotle would have you do.

201
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,480
Because we want to be in the realm of judgment, and knowing what you know,

202
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,360
as a semi-expert on this topic, what are the key points that need to be

203
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,930
addressed for this topic and for your audience?

204
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:17,340
So ideally, you would know your topic and your audience.

205
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,730
Without a deep knowledge of your audience, you need to be in the

206
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,850
position of making reasonable assumptions, trying to figure out what

207
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,580
they may or may not know.

208
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,440
And actually, this is one of the benefits of a live performance, is you

209
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,220
can read that audience, right?

210
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:36,090
If you're speaking, and they've got quizzical faces, you probably know

211
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:40,040
that you need to slow down and pause for questions, or sort of take the

212
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,010
temperature of the room.

213
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:45,800
And you can always stop and ask them if this is a point that you need to

214
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,980
cover or if not?

215
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:52,270
So having a live audience allows you to engage in this type of judgment

216
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,790
much more dynamically.

217
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,880
Now, we don't have that in many cases, and we certainly don't

218
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,270
have it in this class.

219
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:04,530
So if you're trying to get a read on your audience for the assignment for

220
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,730
this class, I think going to the discussion forums

221
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,130
would be a good place.

222
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:14,380
That's not everybody in the class, but that is a public space where we have

223
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,780
our public discourse.

224
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,340
So you kind of see what's going on there and get a sense for who is in

225
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,140
this class.

226
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:24,140
But generally, I think you can assume that it is an educated audience.

227
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,710
Certainly, the survey data that we've seen coming back has indicated that,

228
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,500
and they're interested in learning.

229
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,220
So I think a general topic would work well.

230
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,840
Especially if--

231
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,180
my southern came out there.

232
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,090
I think we all heard that.

233
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,140
I'm not going to re-record it.

234
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,280
I'm going to embrace the whale.

235
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,110
My grandma would be proud.

236
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,260
But I think a general topic would work well.

237
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,400
And in that topic, you would be stating all the tools that we need for

238
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,490
understanding.

239
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:53,180
So like in that Cairo speech, I'm assuming no one knows what that is.

240
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:58,730
And so I can bring them up to speed on that topic, but it's going to involve

241
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,410
definitions.

242
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,050
Starting from sort of a point zero.

243
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,490
You don't know what this term is.

244
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,680
Here's how it's defined.

245
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,200
Here's how it's operationalized.

246
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,450
Here's an example of it.

247
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,400
So I'm sort of bringing them along.

248
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,880
And so I think that might work specifically for this type of

249
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,410
platform, where we don't have a live audience right there.

250
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,050
And we may not know too much about the people on the

251
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,330
other side of the screen.

252
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,380
So that's some general threads of thought.

253
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,490
We're going to pick up much more specific threads of thought,

254
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,220
inventional prompts, in the next lecture, where we're looking at

255
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,140
arrangements as a way of generating ideas.

256
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,390
