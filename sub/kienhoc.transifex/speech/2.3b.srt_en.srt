00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,259
angry black me toss a normal be good honey I'm not because I am

5
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:41,308
but I am angry and the last time I looked

6
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:46,879
on

7
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,540
this is this is why I'm excited but I'm angry

8
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:54,469
this year they're gonna be millions

9
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:57,969
Obama children that we're gonna needlessly

10
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:01,479
loops just ate that we could right now

11
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:07,340
we could save them all you saw the quality of the educators who were here

12
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,439
tonight

13
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:13,159
Helmi they could not reach those kids and save them I know they called

14
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:18,189
it is absolutely possible why haven't we fix this

15
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:23,140
told of us in education have held onto a business plan

16
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,118
that we don't care how many millions of young people fail

17
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,430
we're going to continue to do the same thing that didn't work

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,410
and nobody nobody is giving crazy about it

19
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:39,429
ride another to say enough is enough is a business plan

20
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,890
that simply does not make any sense you know II

21
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,189
I grew up I Indiana city and

22
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,450
there were kids who were failing

23
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:56,090
in schools fifty-six years ago when I first went to school

24
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,450
and all schools are still lousy today

25
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:05,280
fifty-six years later and you know something about a lousy school

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,520
it's not like Obama love why right

27
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,120
where you say like 87 was like a good gr rights

28
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,150
I just think on me every single hiya

29
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,819
it's still the same approach right one-size-fits-all

30
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:24,509
if you get it behind and if you don't tough lock

31
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:28,449
just awful ok why haven't we allow

32
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:32,189
innovation happy do not tell me we can do better than this

33
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:35,289
look you go into a place s failed kids

34
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:40,848
for fifty years and you say so what's the plan and they say what we're gonna

35
00:02:40,848 --> 00:02:41,530
do

36
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:47,098
what we did last year this year welcome to business model is not

37
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:50,159
banks you stop open

38
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,370
operate between 10 and three

39
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,650
that were $10.3 they

40
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,750
they will cole slaw much how ok

41
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,000
hope you bank what we intend to wake the unemployed

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,150
Sony banks got no money in the press

43
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,670
fool created that business model want

44
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:15,009
and it went on for decades you know why because they don't care

45
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:18,569
so in about the customers it's all about it was about

46
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:22,289
thank goodness they created something that works for them

47
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:25,629
how could you go to the bank when you are at work

48
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:30,019
didn't let up then they don't care whether or not jeff is upset he can go

49
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,810
to the bank

50
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,879
go find another bank they all operate the same way

51
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:37,259
right now one day

52
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,560
some crazy bank I had an idea maybe we should keep the bank open when people

53
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,800
come over to work

54
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,360
might like that what about a Saturday

55
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,390
what about introducing technology now look i'm a i'm a technology fan but I

56
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:52,929
have to admit to you on a little

57
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,900
among the old social slow and I did not trust technology

58
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,099
and when they first came out with those new contraptions

59
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:04,530
these tellows that you put in a call in a give you money

60
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,390
I was like is no way that machine is gonna count that money whites

61
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:11,469
I'm never using that writes soul

62
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:14,770
soul technology has changed

63
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,870
things have changed yet man education

64
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:23,288
why why is it that when we head rotary phones

65
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:28,009
when we will having folks being crippled by polio

66
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:33,879
I that we would teach in the same way that we're doing right now

67
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:37,959
and if you come up with a a plan to change things

68
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:42,728
people consider you radical they will say the worst things about you

69
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:46,538
I said one day, well look if the science says--

70
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:50,279
this is science not me--that our poorest children

71
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:55,679
lose ground in the summertime, right? You see where they are in  June, they're here, and you

72
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,680
look at them in September and they are going down. Woo.

73
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,478
So I heard about that and in '75 when I was at the Ed school at Harvard. It was

74
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,649
an important study because it suggests

75
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:14,948
we should do something.

76
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:19,360
Every 10 years they reproduce the same study that says exactly the same thing.

77
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,080
Poor kids lose ground in the summertime. The system

78
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:26,418
decides you canâ€™t run schools in the summer.

79
00:05:26,418 --> 00:05:29,560
Now, I wonder who makes up those rules.

80
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,699
For years I went to the Harvard Ed school

81
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:34,250
and I thought I knew something

82
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,220
the agrarian calendar and people and let me tell you why that doesn't make sense

83
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,449
I never got that I never got that because anyone who knows about a farm knows

84
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:48,790
you don't plant crops in July and August you plant them in the spring

85
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,889
so came up with this idea who owns it and

86
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:57,250
why did we ever do it well it just turns out making forties we did have

87
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,709
schools were open all year what will you because a lot of folks

88
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:05,060
who had to work all day they have any place with the kids the gold a perfect

89
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,339
place to have schools

90
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:09,929
so this is not something that is on Dane from

91
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,689
the education gobs so why don't we

92
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:18,279
while because our business has refused

93
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,709
to use science science

94
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:24,750
yeah Bill Gates come out and say look this works

95
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,610
right we can do this how many places in America are going to change

96
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,830
non mom

97
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:36,168
okay got it all are my yes they'll be someplace

98
00:06:36,168 --> 00:06:39,659
got some folks to do to do the right thing are

99
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,660
as a profession we have to stop this the science is clear

100
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,020
here's what we know: we know

101
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:50,668
that the problem begins immediately

102
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:55,219
might this this idea 023

103
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,520
my wife Yvonne and I we have four kids

104
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:01,609
three grown ones and a 15-year-old

105
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,689
so long the story with our first kid

106
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:09,939
we did not know the science about brain development

107
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:13,329
we did know how critical first three years work we didn't know what was

108
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:17,399
happening in those young brains within normal role that language

109
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:22,709
a stimulus in response call and response how important that was in developing all

110
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:23,149
strip

111
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:27,348
we know that now we doing about not

112
00:07:27,348 --> 00:07:31,968
wealthy people no educated people know

113
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:35,348
and their kids have an advantage four people don't know

114
00:07:35,348 --> 00:07:38,500
and we're not doing anything to help at all

115
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,500
we noticed is critical now you take

116
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,269
pre-kindergarten we know what's important for kids

117
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:49,959
poor kids need that experience nope

118
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:53,019
lotsa places doesn't exist

119
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:56,759
we know health services matter people

120
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,500
know we provide health services that people always fussing at me about

121
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,209
you know because I'm all into you know our accountability and dade having all

122
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:06,538
that good stuff but

123
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:10,180
we'll do health services I have to raise a lot of money people you see

124
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,129
this come find us jeff Wyler leave while you provide these health services I said

125
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:15,199
make stuff up

126
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,598
right I said you know a child I'll

127
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,959
who has cavities is not going to

128
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:26,759
are be able to study as well and I had to go I had to raise the money

129
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,839
right but now on hold up and you know what I tell Mom the wild provide kids

130
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,629
with those health

131
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:35,769
benefits in the sports and recreation arts

132
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:42,769
cause I actually like it's lights actually my kids one is really good for

133
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,720
shoes people really get pushy

134
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,290
I do because you do it for your kit and you've never read a study from

135
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:56,469
MIT that said given your kid dance instruction

136
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,779
right is going to help them do algebra bed of

137
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:03,169
but you will get that kid dance instructor and you will be too well

138
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:06,588
that kid wants to dance instructor and it'll make your day

139
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:10,380
and why shouldn't poor kids have the same opportunity

140
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:13,778
it's the it's tough mall from still

141
00:09:13,778 --> 00:09:19,458
Sol sold the other thing

142
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,609
well I'm a tester got I believe you need a deal

143
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,820
needed to make you couldn't you work at something you think it's working

144
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,990
and you find us not working my I mean educators you were kissing you think you

145
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,339
got to do great no you find that they didn't get

146
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:37,970
up with his diploma testing the testing that we do

147
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,589
we'll have our test in New York next week run

148
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:47,199
is in April you know what to get the results that maybe in July

149
00:09:47,198 --> 00:09:51,799
me you and then so in the end the results have great detail

150
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,799
they'll tell you Rahim really struggled

151
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,149
couldn't do two digit multiplication it so great a dull

152
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:03,110
but you get my bad school saw and saw what doesn't kill

153
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:10,110
you caucasian to come back from vacation I got all this test date up

154
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:15,740
from last yup you to look at

155
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,829
I just got it wanna go into shape

156
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:26,088
so how much money did we just spend on all billions and billions of dollars

157
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:29,200
for data that it's too late to use it

158
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,899
I need that data in September I need a data in November

159
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:36,519
I need to know you're struggling and I need to know whether or not what I did

160
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,539
corrected that

161
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:40,659
I need to know that this week I don't even know that at the

162
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:43,899
end of the year when is too late because

163
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:47,159
in my all the years I've become somewhat of a clairvoyant

164
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:50,819
I can I can predict schools course

165
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,149
you take me to any school I'm really gonna in a city schools

166
00:10:55,149 --> 00:11:00,289
that is struggling and you tell me last year 48 percent adults kids

167
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:05,360
were on grade level and that's okay what's the plan what we do for matches

168
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,009
issues they were doing the same thing

169
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:13,600
I'm a make a prediction this year somewhere between forty for

170
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,860
and 52 with animals kids will be on grade level and I will be right every

171
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,570
single time right

172
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:23,089
so with spending all this money when getting

173
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:26,910
what teaches me real information right now

174
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:30,909
about what's happening to the kids the high-stakes is today

175
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:34,828
because you can do something about it soul

176
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:39,739
is the other issue that I just think we've got to be

177
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,600
are concerned about we can't stifle

178
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,810
innovation and now this we have to innovate

179
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:50,809
and people how did this get made about innovation to get angry if you do

180
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:52,989
something different if you try something new

181
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,870
people without you always charter school on Stardust rising star plus

182
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:02,799
this does not work for 55 years let's try something different and he is the

183
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:03,289
love

184
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:07,360
someone that's not gonna work the of people tell me a little start school I

185
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,159
will not work

186
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,309
I won't go they should be closed

187
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:15,549
I we believe they should be closed but we can't confuse

188
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:19,338
figuring out the science and things not working

189
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:23,050
with we shouldn't therefore do anything my

190
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:26,458
because that's not the way the world works you think about technology unless

191
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,009
engine

192
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:30,129
if that's how we go about technology every time something didn't work we just

193
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:31,740
do what I want said let's forget it

194
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,220
right may convince me I'm sure someone you would like me

195
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,310
the latest and greatest thing the Palm Pilot

196
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:44,289
they told me jump you get the Palm Pilot you'll never need another big

197
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:48,500
acting lasted all of three weeks it was all law

198
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,350
outlets I'll discuss tonight spend my money on this day

199
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:57,100
d anybody stop invented not a purse

200
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,940
not a soul the full swing out there they kept in the

201
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,579
the fact that you have failed nope that shouldn't stop you from

202
00:13:04,578 --> 00:13:08,059
from pushing the science forward are our

203
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:11,259
job is educated this some stuff we know that we can do

204
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:15,379
and we've got to do better the evaluation we have to start with kids

205
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:18,778
are we have to make sure that we provide to support to young people

206
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:22,750
we've got to give them all of these opportunities so that we have to do

207
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,980
but this innovation issue this idea that we've gotta keep

208
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,170
innovating until we veal email this science now

209
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:35,219
is something that is absolutely critical and this is something by the way

210
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,800
other i think is going to be a challenge for our entire field

211
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,039
americore cannot wait

212
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:45,838
another 50 years to get this right we have one

213
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,120
out of tough I don't know about a fiscal cliff when I'm known as an educational

214
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,500
clip that we are walking

215
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,419
over white this very second and if we allow for ok

216
00:13:55,419 --> 00:14:00,578
to continue this foolishness about say we can't afford this

217
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:05,009
so Bill Gates is gonna cost $5 billion dollar what is five billion dollars to

218
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:05,649
you non stick

219
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:09,259
what did we spend in Afghanistan this year how much

220
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:12,708
comedy trillion when

221
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:17,129
when the country cares about something will spend a trillion dollars

222
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:21,740
without blinking an eye when the safety of america is threatened

223
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:27,778
we will spend any amount of money the real safety of our nation

224
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:31,289
is preparing its next-generation so that they can take

225
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:34,519
our place I N be the leaders

226
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:37,990
of the world when it comes to

227
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,919
thinking and technology in democracy in all that stuff we care about

228
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,169
idea say it's a pittance

229
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:48,370
it's a pittance all what it with

230
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,929
require for us to really begin the SOL somebody's problems

231
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:57,729
are so I what we do that I'm no longer be a friendly

232
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,949
soul of you guys

233
00:15:00,948 --> 00:15:07,948
right contradictory thank you all very much

234
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,820
so what is the high school dropout rate Harlem Children's Zone

235
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,230
well you know i John a hundred us about kids graduate high school last year in

236
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,930
my school

237
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:28,250
under the Sun and went to college are this year's seniors allow hundreds and

238
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,710
graduating high school

239
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,830
last I heard we had 93 percent accepted the college

240
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,860
we better get that other seven percent all 44

241
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:42,379
go after saddam

242
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:44,100
so how do you stick with them after they

243
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,600
they leave high school you know that wanted a bad our problems we have in

244
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,820
this country these kids the same kids the same vulnerable kids

245
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,200
when you get in the school they dropped out in record numbers and so we figured

246
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,460
out that you gotta

247
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,009
really design a network of support for these kids that

248
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:02,289
in many ways mimics what a good parent does

249
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:06,879
they harass you right they call you they say I want to see a great how you do on

250
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:07,990
that last test

251
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,870
well what are you talking about that you know you want to leave school are you

252
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,799
not coming back you

253
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:15,959
so much mike is no you can't come to Harlem good job looking for you and i

254
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,280
got really care come not

255
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,669
know we gotta stay in school but but you know I'm not kidding about someone this

256
00:16:21,669 --> 00:16:24,799
I think it's a little bit to the great issue when kids know

257
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:29,579
that you refuse to let them fail fight it puts a different pressure on them

258
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,440
and they don't give up is easy TomTom times they don't have it inside

259
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,850
and then like you know I don't wanna do is gone all

260
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:41,500
Ahmad mothers gonna be mailed all that matters the kids and help get them

261
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:41,899
through

262
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:45,220
we try to create a set of strategies that gets them

263
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,790
tutoring in helping support what also a set of

264
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:52,189
encouragements to say to them you can do it is going to be hard

265
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:56,660
we with feels to let you fail well thank you doctor Canada please give it up on

266
00:16:56,659 --> 00:17:03,659
one more time

267
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:04,599
of
