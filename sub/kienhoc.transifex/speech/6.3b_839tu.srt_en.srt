SPEAKER 1: We have a question right here.

1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:02,860
SPEAKER 2: Yes.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:07,880
How has the national debt personally affected each of your lives.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,950
And if it hasn't, how can you honestly find a cure for the economic problems

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:19,445
of the common people if you had no experience in what's ailing them?

5
00:00:19,445 --> 00:00:23,720
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH: Well, I think the national debt affects everybody.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,150
Obviously.

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,950
It has a lot to do with the interest rates.

8
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:27,360
It has--

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,670
SPEAKER 1: She's saying you personally.

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,830
SPEAKER 2: You on a personal basis, how has that affected you?

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,435
SPEAKER 1: Has it affected you personally.

12
00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:34,810
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSCH: Well I'm sure it has.

13
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,630
I love my grandchildren.

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,150
I want to think--

15
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:37,810
SPEAKER 2: How?

16
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,950
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH: I want to think that they're going to be able to

17
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,660
afford an education.

18
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,380
I think that that's an important part of being a parent.

19
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,520
If the question, if you're--

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,500
maybe I will get it wrong.

21
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,490
Are you suggesting that if somebody has means that the national debt

22
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,110
doesn't affect them?

23
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,910
SPEAKER 2: Well what I'm saying --

24
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:53,600
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH: I'm not sure I get it.

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,480
Help me with the question and I'll try to answer it.

26
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,110
SPEAKER 2: I've had friends that have been laid off from jobs.

27
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,130
I know people who cannot afford to pay the mortgage on their

28
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,640
homes, their car payment.

29
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,210
I have personal problems with the national debt.

30
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,030
But how has it affected you?

31
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,590
And if you have no experience in it, how can you help us?

32
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,690
If you don't know what we're feeling?

33
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,460
SPEAKER 1: I think she means more the recession.

34
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,180
The economic problems today the country faces rather than the deficit.

35
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,470
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH: Well listen, you ought to, you ought to be in the

36
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,860
White House for a day and hear what I hear and see what I see, and read the

37
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,700
mail I read, and touch the people that I touch from time to time.

38
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,690
I was in the Lomax AME Church.

39
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,470
It's a black church just outside of Washington, DC.

40
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:44,610
And I read in the bulletin about teenage pregnancies, about the

41
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,030
difficulty that families are having to meet ends, make ends meet.

42
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,670
I talked to parents.

43
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,560
I mean you've got to care.

44
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,130
Everybody cares if people aren't doing well.

45
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,340
But I don't think it, I don't think it's fair to say you haven't had

46
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,700
cancer, therefore, you don't know what it's like.

47
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,450
I don't think it's fair to say, you know, whatever it is, that if you

48
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,340
haven't been hit by it personally.

49
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,910
But everybody's affected by the debt.

50
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,840
Because of the tremendous interest that goes into paying on that debt,

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,580
everything's more expensive.

52
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,560
Everything comes out of your pocket and my pocket.

53
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,500
So it's that.

54
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,860
But I think in terms of the recession, of course, you feel it when you're

55
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,135
President of the United States.

56
00:02:22,135 --> 00:02:25,310
And that's why I'm trying to do something about it by stimulating the

57
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,880
export, investing more, better education systems.

58
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,330
Thank you, I'm glad to clarify.

59
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:30,640
SPEAKER 2: President Clinton?

60
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,518
PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON: Tell me how it's affected you again?

61
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:37,570
You know people who have lost their jobs and lost their homes.

62
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:41,150
Well I've been governor of a small state for 12 years.

63
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,290
I'll tell you how it's affected me.

64
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:49,310
Every year, Congress and the president sign laws that make us do more things

65
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,360
and gives us less money to do it with.

66
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,620
I see people in my state, middle class people, they're taxes have gone up in

67
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,260
Washington and their services have gone down while the wealthy have

68
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,560
gotten tax cuts.

69
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,170
I have seen what's happened in this last four years when, in my state,

70
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,260
when people lose their jobs there's a good chance I'll know

71
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,350
them by their names.

72
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,190
When a factory closes, I know the people who ran it.

73
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,590
When the businesses go bankrupt, I know them.

74
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,140
And then out here for 13 months meeting in meetings just like this

75
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,910
ever since October.

76
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,340
With people like you all over America.

77
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,020
People that have lost their jobs, lost their livelihood, lost

78
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,170
their health insurance.

79
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,620
What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the

80
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,200
only cause of that.

81
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,330
It is because America has not invested in its people.

82
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,240
It is because we have not grown.

83
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,560
It is because we've had 12 years of trickle-down economics.

84
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,300
We've gone from first to 12th in the world in wages.

85
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,520
We had four years where we produced no private sector jobs.

86
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,670
Most people are working harder for less money than they were

87
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,170
making 10 years ago.

88
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,620
It is because we are in the grip of a failed economic theory.

89
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,950
And this decision you're about to make better be about what kind of economic

90
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,080
theory you want.

91
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,350
Not just people saying I want to go fix it, but what are we going to do.

92
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,050
What I think we have to do is invest in American jobs, American education,

93
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,450
control American health care costs, and bring the American

94
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,700
people together again.

95
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,590
