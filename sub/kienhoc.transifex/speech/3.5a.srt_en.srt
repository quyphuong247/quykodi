MATT MCGARRITY: So in the last lecture, we talked about public

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,200
seeking apprehension.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,120
And you saw the video.

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,920
By the way, that the video, I have students years later come back and

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,510
say, oh, that video, with the guy, and he almost?

6
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,240
I'm like, yeah, I know.

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,170
So that video illustrates so much of what's going on with public speaking

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,120
apprehension.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,940
But the other thing that really is useful in that clip is what's going

10
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,550
on-- or what's not going on with his breathing.

11
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,180
At one point, he grabs his chest and he steps back.

12
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:37,050
And what he says, and you might not have been able to hear it was, I can

13
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:37,900
get my breath.

14
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:45,420
Now, you can't tell in that clip, maybe, but he's an athletic guy.

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,140
He's plenty healthy.

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,310
The fact that he runs out of breath is a problem.

17
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,230
But what's happening there?

18
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,660
You can go back and listen.

19
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:59,370
Is he stands up, he takes a breath in, and he takes another breath in.

20
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,185
And he continues to talk, and he continues to talk, and finally, he

21
00:01:03,185 --> 00:01:06,760
steps away from the microphone, because he can't get a breath.

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,070
He's out of breath because his lungs are full of air.

23
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,590
He never exhales.

24
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,050
He's only inhaling.

25
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,500
If he was sucking in helium, dude would have flown up to

26
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,560
the ceiling, man.

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,350
So he's only taking in his breath, and he has to step away.

28
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,230
So one of the things, and this starts transitioning to our

29
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,700
other lectures on delivery.

30
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,250
But one of the things I want to hammer home here, because it speaks to one

31
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,040
way you can deal with apprehensiveness, and also, it's just

32
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,610
perfectly illustrated in that clip, is when you stand up to speak, you should

33
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,270
be speaking from your diaphragm, breathing from your diaphragm.

34
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,600
Now, you've probably heard this in the past.

35
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,730
In essence, you don't actually breathe from your diaphragm.

36
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,150
So the diaphragm is this muscle right at your lungs.

37
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:56,540
And as you expand, it allows more air to fill in your lungs.

38
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:02,090
So right now, wherever you are, put your hand on your stomach, and I want

39
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,750
you to, with me--

40
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,280
camera guys are putting their hands on the stomache, thanks for that.

41
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,720
That gives me some sense of audience here.

42
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,290
So there was nothing about that that demanded that you do that.

43
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,570
So put your hand on your stomach.

44
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,300
Yeah, go ahead.

45
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm locked into it now.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,800
And what I want you to do is, with me, take a steady breath in, and I'm going

47
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,890
to count to five, hold for five, out for five.

48
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,820
And I want your hand to go out, but I don't want your shoulders

49
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,750
to move up and down.

50
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,430
You're not going to be taking shallow breaths, like if you're running or

51
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,870
you're out of breath.

52
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,290
There your shoulders are moving up and down.

53
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,750
So you want your hand here, and I want you to do in for a count of fibe, hold

54
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,850
for a count of five, out for a count of five.

55
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:44,350
And you should feel your entire trunk expand and then contract as you're

56
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,360
pushing that air out.

57
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,150
So with me, and hold.

58
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,780
Should be totally comfortable, and out.

59
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,510


60
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,570
I'm going to have you do it again.

61
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,960
The other thing on pushing out is, it should be a steady stream of air.

62
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,930
So imagine if you will, you have a candle, and you're blowing it so that

63
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,280
the flame stayed at a constant angle and didn't jump around, or if you had

64
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,300
a tiny kite, and you're blowing so it stayed perfectly in the air and didn't

65
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,420
zip around.

66
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,140
So again, hand on your stomach.

67
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,385
In for a count of five and whole.

68
00:03:25,385 --> 00:03:29,070


69
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,440
And out for a count of five.

70
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,590


71
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,162
OK, good.

72
00:03:36,162 --> 00:03:42,030
Now, that's just expanding your trunk and pushing the air out deliberately.

73
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,750
Now, you're not going to do that in your speech, right?

74
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,965
So it's not like, I think MOOCs should carry credit for two main reasons.

75
00:03:46,965 --> 00:03:50,390


76
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,820
Now, that might be great for maybe if you were teaching a yoga class.

77
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,280
It might be good for everybody there, but you're not doing that.

78
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,690
But that physical sensation is what you should be feeling when you stand

79
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,570
up to speak.

80
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:05,880
You're expanding, you're taking a full volume of air into your lungs, and

81
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,630
when you're speaking, you're pushing out that air with steady force.

82
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,540
That air is passing over those vocal folds with steady force.

83
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,740
Now, what this is going to do for you is not only make it better in terms

84
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,940
of-- you're not going to run out of breath, but good breathing and good

85
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,290
projection, I would say, are the Rosetta Stone's of good delivery.

86
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,270
If you've got breathing and projection down, you're probably not

87
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,940
going to go too fast.

88
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,740
You don't have to worry about being heard.

89
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,110
So many things emerge from this.

90
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,360
So that's why we're talking about it here.

91
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,400
Breathing and projection.

92
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,580
So we need that volume of air because we want to project.

93
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,890
And by that, I mean I want to speak so I can easily be heard by everybody in

94
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,780
the room, and not just to reach the back of the room, but imagine there

95
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,010
were 10 rows past the back of that room.

96
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,900
Could they still easily hear me?

97
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:02,660
And I want this because I don't want to lose out to environmental sound.

98
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,540
As a speaker, you know what's going on, or you can hear what's going on

99
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,150
around you, but you may not be able to hear what's going on in

100
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,230
the back of the room.

101
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,360
There may be ambient sound back there that you don't know about.

102
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,230
There could be someone hard of hearing in your audience that

103
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,890
you don't know about.

104
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,700
So you don't want to lose out to that.

105
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,380
So you want to project so you can easily be heard.

106
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:29,280
So the other thing is, and this would probably be the case in most settings,

107
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,560
and I do this if I'm in a large lecture hall or a small room, I want

108
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,090
to hear a little bit of an echo.

109
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,420
So I want to project enough so that my voice is sort of bouncing off the back

110
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,730
wall and coming back to me.

111
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:45,180
That tells me that I'm sort of filling the space with sound.

112
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,030
But I've got to have good breathing to get there.

113
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,350
Now, as it relates to the clip that we just watched, good breathing and good

114
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,540
projection wouldn't save the fact that he hadn't really prepare that as a

115
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,380
speech, but it would save a lot of the delivery problems there.

116
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,910
Good breathing and projection can knock out the wavy voice.

117
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,330
The wavy voice is when you know it's very soft and

118
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,580
there's not enough breathing.

119
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,100
So it's the voice that sounds like you're about to cry.

120
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,970
But that doesn't happen with projection.

121
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,610
So you can knock that right out by just having some good projection and

122
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,640
good breath control.

123
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,580
I want to make sure you've got this down so that we can talk about other

124
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,640
delivery issues.

125
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,790
But breathing and projection are key to good delivery.

126
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,050
Now, I know not everybody watching this video has a habit of standing up

127
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,860
in front of an audience and speaking at full volume, but you have the

128
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,970
capacity, insofar as you have lungs and a mouth.

129
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,780
You can be doing this.

130
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,300
And it changes the very nature of the performance.

131
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,140
So even now, I'm mic up and everything, so I mean, I don't have an

132
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:46,970
audience here.

133
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,640
But even now, if I just wanted to easily be heard in this scenario, in

134
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,240
this setting, I could probably drop to about here.

135
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,980
So I could do my entire time here and say, well, gosh, that guy, he had a

136
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,410
lot of problems when he did that speech, and he seemed pretty nervous.

137
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:06,890
I can't do this for very long, and it drives me crazy because it's not the

138
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,240
speaking persona that I've developed.

139
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,850
So I speak at volume, and I speak at volume because it regulates a lot of

140
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,520
things going on in delivery.

141
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,840
And it makes sure that I'm not going to run out of breath.

142
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,450
It knocks out any wavy voice, and I know I can be heard and clearly

143
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,620
understood.

144
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,020
So we're going to start moving into more delivery issues, but before we

145
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,580
do, the main thing is thinking about apprehension and good breathing and

146
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,270
breath control and projection.

147
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,060
Public speaking apprehension is natural.

148
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,540
It happens, and it happens as a result of multiple factors.

149
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,050
You may have more of a propensity for public speaking apprehension or not.

150
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,330
You may experience it in some situations where it's really manifest

151
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,710
and others where it's not as evidence.

152
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,080
There are prevention techniques.

153
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,790
Getting used to public speaking scenarios, changing your thinking

154
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,530
about public speaking and getting better at it.

155
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,750
These are the pathways to reducing that apprehension.

156
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,950
And the other thing that's going to transition us into good delivery is

157
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,070
breathe well and project.

158
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,920
Don't be ashamed of your role as a speaker, but make

159
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,280
sure you can be heard.

160
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,350
We'll talk more about this when we get into more stuff on delivery.

161
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,600
