MATT MCGARRITY: As a final note here on the informative speech, I wanted to

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,560
spend a little bit more time thinking about gestures and movement.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,710
Now certainly we talked about that in the impromptu speech.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,860
But now, we've got an opportunity to circle back on gestures and movement

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,800
and reflect a little bit more.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,710
So as always, I think you should be doing what's natural.

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:23,390
But if you want to devote more time and attention to the actual movement

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,190
and gestures in your informative speech, I think it's probably best to

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,240
think of controlled actions.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,920
How you're controlling that physical performance.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,720
So hopefully you just watched on the course web page that

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,390
clip of Phil Davidson.

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,620
Now one of the reasons that went viral, one of the reasons people know

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,140
that clip, the reason I know that clip, is because he looks unhinged.

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,570
And a lot of it comes down to delivery.

16
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,830
He's walking around.

17
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,130
He's crazy eyed.

18
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,120
You hear his voice break.

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,590
If there's one way to describe that physical performance, it's not

20
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,210
controlled.

21
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,980
I don't know exactly what it is-- caged beast.

22
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,570
But not controlled.

23
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,630
So if you're thinking about gestures and movement, you want to be thinking

24
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,850
maybe in terms of how to sort of control this performance.

25
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,380
How to demonstrate that your movements, your gestures are

26
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,250
purposeful and deliberate.

27
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,640
One way to begin is, of course, with good posture.

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,880
Right, if you're delivering a speech you want to be able to

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,850
stand with good posture.

30
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:22,300
Not only is this going to help to have your carriage up, so that you can take

31
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,940
in a deeper breath of air and push it out deliberately, but also it affects

32
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,400
your ethos, right?

33
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,080
There's something very different about someone coming in and delivering a

34
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,120
speech like this as opposed to like this, right?

35
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,980
I'm here today to talk to you about an exciting new scientific breakthrough.

36
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,970
It is awesome.

37
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,870
So you want to make sure that you're standing up, head's up.

38
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:46,190
Really this is going to allow you to project a little bit easier.

39
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,650
If you have two functioning legs and you're standing, make sure you're

40
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,370
standing up on two feet.

41
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:55,270
There are certainly plenty of times when standing at an event is

42
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,490
inappropriate.

43
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,970
Typically I would prefer to stand when delivering a speech

44
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,120
than sit at the table.

45
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,220
But as always, do the fitting response.

46
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,870
But if you're standing on two feet, if you're going to move on a point--

47
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,740
and we've talked about that speaker's triangle.

48
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,440
If it works for you, that's great.

49
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,110
But if you're going to move, typically I want to walk with my lead leg.

50
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,970
So I'll walk over to this side.

51
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,330
And then I'll walk back this way, so on and so forth.

52
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,820
What I would want to avoid is less controlled look or a more sort of

53
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,930
distracting look.

54
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,010
Where I've taken a side step, and I'm kind of crossing my legs.

55
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,970
Or I'm doing stuff--

56
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,090
that was awful.

57
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,080
So if you're going to be walking, make it look as controlled as you can.

58
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,180
On that, also in terms of gestures, think in terms of how you're going to

59
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,830
control those gestures.

60
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,800
So one thing I typically want to at least think about is having sort of a

61
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,540
more controlled looking gesture.

62
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,660
Trying to avoid loose fingers and jazz hands.

63
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,000
So today, we're going to be talking about [INAUDIBLE].

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,030
Rather, I want to be able to have something a little bit more

65
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,630
controlled.

66
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:03,150
One thing you could think about, certainly a piece of advice I've come

67
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,520
across, is imagine you're going to shake someone's hand.

68
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,100
Maybe that's the shape of your gesture for the most part.

69
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,160
So I've got it like this.

70
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,770
I can open it up.

71
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,350
But I'm not doing this.

72
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,640
Also, and this would totally depend on the audience that you're speaking in

73
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,360
front and the nature of you as a speaker, but I've certainly gotten

74
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,120
feedback in this course on pointing.

75
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,040
So I've never had a problem with it.

76
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,320
And I don't have a problem with it as an audience because to

77
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,850
me this does something.

78
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:38,610
Now, very true that audiences might react poorly to that-- certainly some

79
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,870
audiences will.

80
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,400
So instead of having something like this, you can do the same thing but

81
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,680
just Clintonize it.

82
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,640
You know instead of having a short finger out, you've got

83
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,590
something like this.

84
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,600
But it's a deliberate choice of just making sure that you can still

85
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,990
emphasize a point.

86
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:58,160
But do so in a way that looks controlled and deliberate.

87
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,890
Also in terms of sort of control, think in terms of

88
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,180
where you're speaking.

89
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,620
If you're speaking outside, and you have long hair, you might want to pull

90
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,550
it back, right?

91
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,210
You don't want to be reading your notes, and having your

92
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,980
hair with all around.

93
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,640
I used to have long hair.

94
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,480
Glorious locks that cascaded down below my shoulders.

95
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,930
And then, I had a Mohawk.

96
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,890
And it was purple.

97
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,279
And then, now it's gone.

98
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,400
So don't abuse your hair because it will leave you.

99
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,490
But when I did have hair, and I would speak, I would often pull it back.

100
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,860
So you want to be thinking about these various smaller elements, and how you

101
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,760
can control them.

102
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,000
Another key component of that is what you're wearing.

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,940
This is going to affect your ethos.

104
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,540
I'm not suggesting that you always need to dress up for speech.

105
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,750
There many times in which dressing up would be the inappropriate response.

106
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,920
But be aware of what you're wearing, and how it affects your ethos and your

107
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,010
performance.

108
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,320
So you see me here in my professor uniform--

109
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,660
pants and a shirt.

110
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:01,400
As opposed to a thong and a tank top, which is not my professor uniform.

111
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,480
That's my just kicking it around the house uniform.

112
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,330
So this is kind of what I wear to teach.

113
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,850
Maybe a sweater, maybe a tie.

114
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:12,120
But I kind of know this, and I know what sort of ethos it conveys.

115
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,160
But there are lots of times when I have to deliver a more formal speech.

116
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,000
And I know that wearing a coat or a jacket affects my performance and

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,460
affects how I stand.

118
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,950
So the main thing is you want to think about those choices, those decisions,

119
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,730
and the impact that they have on you.

120
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,020
So certainly wearing a suit, I think, makes a difference.

121
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,740

122
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,960
So I think a suit makes a fairly large difference in terms of how I

123
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,210
present what I do.

124
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,060
I know for one, I typically put my hand in my pocket a lot more, and I

125
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,740
gesture with just one hand.

126
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,510
Now I'm not saying you should do that.

127
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,480
I'm just saying I'm aware of what it does to me when I wear different types

128
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,320
of clothes in different types of speaking encounters.

129
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,410
As a side note, that little trick that we just did here--

130
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,370
I don't want to tell you how many times we re-shot that

131
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,440
to get it just right.

132
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,580
And I hope it was totally worth it and funny.

133
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,680
Because there was a lot of time devoted to such a

134
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,630
simple editing trick.

135
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:11,200
Nevertheless, I do think that if you're uncertain about what the

136
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,570
speaking encounter is going to look like, it's better to error on the side

137
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,860
of looking nicer than not.

138
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,600
And let me give you an anecdote here.

139
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,170
So a couple years ago, I've got a standard boilerplate speech that I do

140
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,770
on presidential debate.

141
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:30,440
And so I've been asked in, and I had two speaking encounters back to back.

142
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,370
So I had one night, and one the next.

143
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,750
The first one was at a retirement home-- big retirement community.

144
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,920
And I go in, and it's very relaxed.

145
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,990
And I dressed in my standard teacher uniform.

146
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,470
And I got there, and everybody was very casual--

147
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,600
great audience.

148
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,880
The very next night, I had the same speech in a different place.

149
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,740
And this was not a retirement home.

150
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,030
This was a sort of a prestigious club.

151
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,830
I didn't know exactly how prestigious until I got there.

152
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,910
So I dressed in basically the same thing I wore the night before.

153
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:05,840
And the elderly, august woman that was hosting that evening meets me.

154
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,180
And she says, we're so happy to have you here this evening.

155
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,920
This should be a wonderful event.

156
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,740
Is there anyway I could get you a coat.

157
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,510
Our club requires it.

158
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:18,560
And so that evening, they grab me a coat out of their closet.

159
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,190
And I look like an eight-year-old in his dad's outfit.

160
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,220
It was ridiculous.

161
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:30,670
And so it's far easier to take off your coat, and to take off your tie,

162
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:35,360
or to take off some of those dressy elements that you have on, than to

163
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,610
make them materialize out of nowhere.

164
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,450
Because that could be bad.

165
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:44,580
So whatever you're going to wear, just be aware of how it affects you.

166
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,450
And so in that way, let's go ahead and draw to a close our information on the

167
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,540
informative speech.

168
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,680
This week, we've talked about introductions and conclusions.

169
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,030
And we spent a fair bit of time on ethos and delivery.

170
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,620
Take all of this into your next informative speech.

171
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,230
Now that very well may be recording and posting a speech for this class.

172
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,000
And it may very well not be.

173
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,210
Regardless, when you stand up to speak and do an informative

174
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,310
speech, educate others.

175
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,840
What you're doing is you're performing your best self.

176
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,290
And that's what I would like you to take away from our

177
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,110
discussion of ethos.

178
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,190
You're performing your best self.

179
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,090
So upload a speech if you wish.

180
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,350
Take this information regardless.

181
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:29,150
And I hope that this informative unit has been useful to you.

182
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,520
In the next unit, we're going to take up the final speech--

183
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,770
the persuasive speech.

184
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,943
