MATT MCGARRITY: Now, when we talked through the impromptu speech, we spent

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,150
some time talking about introductions and conclusions for

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,290
the impromptu speech.

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,380
But those were pretty simple affairs, right?

5
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,640
It was a two-point speech.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,870
You just kind of wanted to get into the body of the argument very quickly.

7
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,000
Now on your informative speech, that introduction is probably going to be

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,250
doing more work for you.

9
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,530
It's going to be setting up more.

10
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,110
It's going to be performing more of a role for your audience.

11
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,620
So I wanted to spend a little bit of time talking about some additional

12
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,610
ideas you might have for informative introductions and conclusions.

13
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,130
This doesn't eliminate what you were doing in the impromptu.

14
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,050
But if you have the opportunity or if there's the need, these are other

15
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,890
things you can be thinking about to include in your informative speeches.

16
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,300
Now I just to want very briefly talk about some ideas for the introduction

17
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,220
and some ideas for the conclusion.

18
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,360
So in an informative speech, an introduction is very important, right?

19
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,630
Because it's setting the stage for what you're going to be doing.

20
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,070
In that impromptu, it was so short you'd be halfway through the speech by

21
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,260
the time someone figured out they didn't want to listen.

22
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,260
But in this informative speech, you probably have more time.

23
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,000
And so you want to spend a little bit more attention, devote more attention,

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,020
to setting us up for what's about to happen.

25
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,040
So we want to let the audience know in the introduction first

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,200
off that we've started.

27
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,920
But we also want to grab their attention and then take that attention

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,320
and turn it into interest, interest in our topic matter, as well as letting

29
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,230
them know how we're going to proceed.

30
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,540
So here are some things you might want to think about for

31
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,850
your informative speech.

32
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,220
Having sort of an opening device, having a statement of relevance or

33
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,660
some tie to the audience, and then finally, providing that audience with

34
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,570
some type of orientation as to how the speech is going to be followed.

35
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,400
So I want to talk through each one of these.

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,520
So I don't want to suggest that each and every speech has to do these three

37
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,050
things and only these three things.

38
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,970
But there are some useful ideas in helping you figure out what you're

39
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,150
going to do for your in formative speech.

40
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:58,710
So in terms of opening devices, well, this is just those opening lines, that

41
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,420
first thing that you're saying, your hook, how you're getting the audience

42
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,320
into your speech.

43
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,760
And there are lots of things you can be doing if you've got the time to

44
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,620
plan it out more deliberately.

45
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,670
Well, you can certainly start off with a story or an example, right?

46
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,360
That's a great way of helping us understand that topic very quickly.

47
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,650
You may remember from last week there was a sample speech by Hans Rosling on

48
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,700
the website.

49
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,400
And I sort of talked through it and used it as an illustration of how he

50
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,690
was using examples.

51
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,540
Well, that example, he was talking about washing machines.

52
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,090
Go back and watch it if you haven't.

53
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,390
It's wonderful.

54
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,160
But that was a great way of starting that speech, because

55
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,030
it was just so very--

56
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:45,260
it provided a personal route into his topic, just talking about his mother

57
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,650
and his grandmother and their first washing machine.

58
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,550
So that was a great way of just opening that speech.

59
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,970
Now, he didn't sit there and the entire time reflect

60
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,660
upon his family life.

61
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,130
It was a means to an end.

62
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,930
That example got us into his topic.

63
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,480
Many years ago-- and this is the exact opposite of fun, but I was helping

64
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,140
someone working on a speech on licensing at-home daycare centers.

65
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,860
So daycare centers all over the country, some of them are licensed.

66
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,990
They go through a formal review.

67
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,360
Others are at-home daycare, so if someone runs a daycare out of their

68
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,940
home, and sometimes these will be unlicensed, under the radar.

69
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,060
And so one of the problems that we wanted to discuss or one of the issues

70
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,510
that we wanted to make people aware of is that sometimes this

71
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,200
under-regulation can cause problems.

72
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,600
So we started a story, started the speech with a story of an at-home

73
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,300
daycare center.

74
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,790
And there's a woman who was working.

75
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,670
It was her home.

76
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,550
She was tending to two kids fighting in the living room.

77
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,140
And there was a child in a high chair in the kitchen.

78
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,440
And it slipped in the high chair and it caught its head and it

79
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,490
strangled to death.

80
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,630
It was awful, terrible story.

81
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,000
But a true story.

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,150
And one that quickly reaffirmed the importance of that topic.

83
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,930
And it upped the stakes.

84
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,120
It says what I'm going to talk about may sound boring, but there are real

85
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,340
consequences to it.

86
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,250
So opening that speech with an example can do a lot for you.

87
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,050
It might be more interesting for that audience.

88
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:13,090
But it can also clearly and effectively illustrate the topic that

89
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,340
you're discussing.

90
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,540
Now, if you've got an example, that's great.

91
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,690
Sometimes you maybe want to start with a quotation.

92
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,840
If there's a really good quotation that you think is a nice bridge to

93
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,580
your topic.

94
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,080
Or maybe you start off with a surprising fact or statistic.

95
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,630
Whatever you choose, the idea is to grab that audience's attention,

96
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,630
quickly get them into your topic.

97
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,650
But I do think, especially for informative speeches, that you don't

98
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,070
want the subject matter to be a mystery.

99
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:47,270
I want to very quickly within my introduction for an informative speech

100
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,770
let the audience know what I'm talking about.

101
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,680
If someone was taking notes on my presentation, they would know what to

102
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,040
write at the top of the page.

103
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,450
Oh, he's talking about whatever.

104
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:03,150
So I want to signal what the topic title is so that people know what I'm

105
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,270
going to be discussing.

106
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,070
Now that opening device is just there to grab attention.

107
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,100
Attention in and of itself might fade.

108
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,850
We want to take that attention once we have it and convert it to interest.

109
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:20,700
So we're moving from that opening device to a statement of relevance.

110
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,980
So basically I want to-- after I've got somebody's attention, I want to

111
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,240
provide a quick explanation of why they should pay attention, why they

112
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,870
should continue to devote their mental energies towards what I'm saying.

113
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,790
So I want to think through at least making explicit what that audience can

114
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,840
get out of this presentation.

115
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,570
So you might be thinking about formally providing an answer to the

116
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,680
question, why should I pay attention?

117
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,050
What am I going to get out of this?

118
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,540
Is it a matter of personal impact?

119
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,660
Is this an influential issue?

120
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,980
Is it going to affect the audience's daily life?

121
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,350
Or is there maybe sort of more of a general impact?

122
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,620
It's a common issue.

123
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,780
It affects many people even if it doesn't affect you.

124
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,110
Maybe this issue is going to affect how we think about other things

125
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,550
outside of your topic realm.

126
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,250
Or maybe it's just fascinating in and of itself.

127
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,060
But I think you want to have a sentence or two basically providing

128
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,810
the rationale for why an audience member should pay attention.

129
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,880
So for business presentations, you would sort of open up the presentation

130
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,960
and then probably talk about how your subject matter affects the

131
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,910
organization or perhaps some other divisions here at this company.

132
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:40,150
For research presentations, you might say, well, this is how this issue,

133
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,160
what I'm going to be presenting on, affects our collective understanding

134
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,310
of another research idea or of future research possibilities.

135
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,550
So I want to grab the audience's attention, opening device.

136
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,830
I want to convert that attention into interest through sort of explaining

137
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,700
why someone would want to pay attention.

138
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,780
And then I want to just orient the audience to how we're going to be

139
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,380
spending our time together.

140
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,610
So we've done this in the impromptu speech through a formal preview of

141
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,610
your main points.

142
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,700
I think you still want to do that here.

143
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,190
It doesn't have to be overly formal.

144
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:17,460
And different settings are going to call for different types of previews.

145
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,550
But I just think you want to be able to say to the audience, I'm going to

146
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,580
carve up our time into three general domains.

147
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:28,800
One thing you might also consider doing in this orientation phase of the

148
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,590
introduction is sort of laying out what your goals are for the

149
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,310
presentation.

150
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:38,760
You may also remember from last week we looked at a TED talk on urban

151
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,220
beekeeping.

152
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,710
That was one of the last things that we looked at last week when we

153
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,500
evaluated it through the rubric.

154
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,780
Well, one of the things that urban beekeeper does at the beginning of his

155
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,780
speech is he says, very clearly, my goal for this presentation is to

156
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,790
change how you think about bees and beekeeping.

157
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,650
He states just flat out what he wants the audience to do.

158
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,150
He states his goal there.

159
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:07,370
And that's kind of helpful to me as a listener knowing how and why the

160
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,520
speaker's designed their presentation in that way.

161
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,650
Now, of course, always a danger of stating your goal is, if at the end

162
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,470
you haven't achieved it, well, we all know that you failed.

163
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,530
You know that you failed.

164
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,870
We know that you failed.

165
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,110
And how glorious for all of us.

166
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,250
But in that case, I mean, he's not going to fail.

167
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,660
I mean, it's not like it's a huge threshold that he set up there.

168
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,810
But I do think you want to have a formal part of that introduction where

169
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,360
you're just sort of very briefly laying out here's what

170
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,240
we're going to be doing.

171
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,820
Here's why I'm doing it.

172
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,250
So that's kind of what I want you to be thinking about for your informative

173
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,870
introductions, an opening device, a statement of relevance, and an

174
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,830
orientation to the speech itself so we know how you're going to

175
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,530
navigate your time.

176
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,240
All right.

177
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,930
Introductions.

178
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,870
Let's talk a little bit about conclusions.

179
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:57,340
Conclusions typically are shorter, because this is coming after we've

180
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,920
heard all that information.

181
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,360
So if the introduction is setting us up for it, the conclusion is just sort

182
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,770
of reaffirming it and giving us a nice thought to go out on.

183
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:10,580
So in terms of your review, well, I think that--

184
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,690
so again in your conclusion you should probably review your key points and

185
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,450
then end on a concluding device.

186
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,010
So in that review, once again you're just hitting those key ideas.

187
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:23,530
Whatever you said your preview, you're probably saying again in your review.

188
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,140
You're not redoing the whole speech.

189
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,140
That's gone.

190
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,200
You're just hitting the key themes, reaffirming what

191
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,550
those key themes were.

192
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,180
If somebody left your speech and somebody said, well, what was the

193
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,060
speech about?

194
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,040
Oh, it was about three things.

195
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,800
You told us what those three things were at the preview.

196
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,950
And you reminded what those three things were in the review.

197
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,400
So it's just a way of reinforcing those key ideas.

198
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,720
And it also provides a strategic function, because it's starting to

199
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,310
signal to your audience that you're about to be done.

200
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,270
You're not done yet.

201
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,470
But you're about to finish.

202
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,480
And that's also good.

203
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,290
It's sort of helping us adjust our expectations.

204
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,050
And then you get into sort of that final line or those

205
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,440
final couple of lines.

206
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,390
Well, in an informative speech, you can certainly plan these out more

207
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:09,970
deliberately.

208
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,280
And that's a good thing.

209
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,870
So after you've reminded us of the topic's importance, you've got these

210
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:20,260
couple of lines that you can just use to sort of put the final capper on

211
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,240
your speech.

212
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,890
One thing that can help, or one thing that's kind of nice to do, is whatever

213
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,010
you started out with at the beginning of the speech, maybe now you pick up

214
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,740
again in the concluding device.

215
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,160
So you started off with a discussion of washing machines, end with a

216
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,690
discussion of washing machines.

217
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,010
In that speech I mentioned, where we started with that story of the child

218
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,695
who died, well, we certainly ended with that.

219
00:10:42,695 --> 00:10:47,690
That was a real solid concluding note that reaffirmed the topic's importance

220
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,990
but also tied back to the conclusion.

221
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,890
So we got a real nice alpha, omega thing going on with our speech here.

222
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,750
It shows sort of deliberate attention to its arrangement.

223
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,310
And it sounds like you're done.

224
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:04,470
So as you're working through your informative speech, by now you should

225
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,280
have a fully functional draft.

226
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,960
That's really where my concern is, making sure you've got your key ideas

227
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,110
in their proper order and you're knowing how you're working through it.

228
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,140
Introductions and conclusions should come last, because it's trying to

229
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,590
figure out, as novices to this information, how we need to be walked

230
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,930
into this material and then how we can leave this material.

231
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,100
That's what introductions and conclusions do.

232
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,480
They're strategic in their design, certainly for informative speeches.

233
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,970
When we get into eulogies or something like that, introductions and

234
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,890
conclusions are performing different roles.

235
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:40,590
But here, they're helping us navigate our time with the speaker

236
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,660
and with the audience.

237
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,470
So those introductions should quickly grab our attention, get us interested

238
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,940
in the topic, orient us to how you're going to spend your time.

239
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,930
We hear your speech.

240
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,040
And then at the end, we're reminded of what those key ideas are.

241
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,530
And you send us off with a nice concluding note.

242
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:01,860
So with that, we'll end our discussion of introductions and conclusions.

243
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,640
And next, we'll take up this key issue of ethos.

244
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,890
