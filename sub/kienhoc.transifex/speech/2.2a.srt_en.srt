MATT MCGARRITY: What I would like to do now is just give a very broad overview of

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,780
what the impromptu speech is and why we're doing it.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,610
So I want to spend our time in this video lecture talking about why we're

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,630
doing the impromptu speech, how we're going to be doing the impromptu

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,610
speech, and what you're going to be speaking on in the impromptu speech.

6
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,130
So to begin with, why do this assignment?

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,750
Well, I really love the impromptu speech.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,350
I think this is a hugely useful model.

9
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,400
It's a quick two-point argument.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,910
And you can take this basic model and use it in a wide range of settings.

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,460
So this assignment is virtually the same as when I teach the class live

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,010
here at the University of Washington.

13
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,450
And when I offer this section of the class, usually, within a week or two,

14
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,800
I'll get students coming in, giving success stories about how they ran an

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,320
impromptu in some given situation.

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,710
I've run this online.

17
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,960
And I get emails from people saying how they did an impromptu and how it

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,850
really helped them.

19
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:00,100
So I've had emails people saying they got a promotion because they went in

20
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:00,600
for their boss.

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,000
And they did a quick impromptu.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,550
Or they got a job because it works really well in interviews.

23
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,700
And it makes sense because this is a quick way of organizing your thoughts,

24
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,200
discussing ideas in depth, but still staying on topic.

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,620
So it really works well in job interviews or in meetings or in group

26
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,250
discussions.

27
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,220
It's a very flexible model.

28
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,140
So that's kind of why I like this model in general.

29
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,650
I also really like starting the class with this model, because it is an

30
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,620
elemental framework.

31
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,770
It allows us to master a couple of basic ideas.

32
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,670
And then we can take those and move them in other directions when we move

33
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,090
into the informative speech or the persuasive speech in this class.

34
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:42,170
So it's a really good way of also performing arrangement, really getting

35
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,670
a sense for being able to signal to the audience when you're in one

36
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,580
portion of the speech or when you're in another portion of the speech.

37
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:53,070
So the engine of the impromptu speech is very, because it has

38
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,620
fewer moving parts.

39
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:59,330
And those fewer moving parts work well in other speeches.

40
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,850
I'm really hoping to stay with the mechanical metaphor

41
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,530
I had set up there.

42
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,900
But it totally ran out of steam.

43
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,800
Or did it?

44
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,780
That's an extension of the metaphor.

45
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,730
But anyway, so that's what the assignment is.

46
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,160
Now how are we going to be doing this?

47
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,010
What are the mechanics?

48
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,940
What are the mechanics?

49
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,320
I'm just at this point entertaining myself with us.

50
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,620
But that works for me, maybe for you.

51
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,650
So how are we going to be doing it?

52
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,240
In this speech, what you're going to do is pick a prompt.

53
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,370
These are just sample thesis statements.

54
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,610
And it's merely input.

55
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,050
So I want you to pick a prompt.

56
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,850
And then I want you to be able to prepare an outline on that topic in

57
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,000
five minutes.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,470
Now, this is an online course.

59
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,380
No one's looking over your shoulder.

60
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,070
But I do think as you practice this you're going to want to get to the

61
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,090
point where you can do this in five minutes or less.

62
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,480
That's the benefit of this.

63
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,840
I want you to build this into your muscle memory to be able to put these

64
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,350
speeches together quickly.

65
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,500
So the goal is for you to put these together in five minutes and then

66
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,850
deliver a three to six-minute speech on that topic.

67
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,430
Actually, I'm going to pause you right there.

68
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,110
I know I just said three to six minutes.

69
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,420
And the fact of the matter is I've been running these.

70
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,470
And really what it seems like it is four to seven is better.

71
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,990
So I think if you're doing all that I'm asking you to in this speech,

72
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,000
you're probably going to be coming in somewhere around

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,300
that five-minute mark.

74
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,000
But anyway, so we're going to run this as a four to seven-minute speech.

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,450
You handsome devil, I still like what he said about the other stuff.

76
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,505
But it's going to be a four to seven-minute long speech.

77
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,360
That's pretty bald from back here.

78
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,540
I need to take care of that.

79
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,440
Continue on.

80
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,380
So in essence, most of these speeches are going to look

81
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,620
pretty much the same.

82
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,660
And this is the model that I'm teaching to, this

83
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,410
basic two-point argument.

84
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,650
So if you'll look here, what you'll see is pretty much most of the

85
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,340
speeches are going to have a basic introduction, two main points.

86
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,170
Each main point has two pieces of support underneath it in advance of

87
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:52,900
that main point and then a general conclusion to the entire speech.

88
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,190
Now, I'm going with this model not because I love crushing creativity and

89
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,510
individuality.

90
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,490
That's merely a perk.

91
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:05,920
I'm doing that primarily because this model is so useful in various

92
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,090
situations.

93
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,240
As you're running it, when you do it in that interview or in some outside

94
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,200
setting, you can add additional points.

95
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:18,370
But this allows us to get down to some key elements of speech delivery, being

96
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,810
able to craft claims and discuss them well through specific examples.

97
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,430
That's what this model gets us.

98
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,100
Now, in advance of this, I'm going to give you the prompts.

99
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,070
So I'm going to give you the thesis statements you can use to prepare your

100
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,520
impromptu speech.

101
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,310
Now, I need these prompts, because I have to have input.

102
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,090
You have to speak on something.

103
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:45,220
And I want to be able to focus on the mechanics of the speech, coming up

104
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,700
with the main points, talking through that evidence.

105
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,380
So in this way, I want to remove topic from your mental docket.

106
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,400
I don't want that to be something you have to burn up a bunch

107
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,510
of brain cells on.

108
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,890
So I'll provide you with these topics.

109
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,000
Now, if in going through those topics and practicing an impromptu and

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,660
reporting an impromptu for this class, posting it online, you're not bound by

111
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,030
those topics if they're not useful.

112
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,930
I want this assignment to set you up for success outside of this class.

113
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,670
I know how to write these impromptu prompts.

114
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,860
But as you're going through this and you want to practice something m

115
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,330
that's fine too, because in the design of these, I stuck

116
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,430
with two basic themes.

117
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:30,790
So right now, I know virtually nothing about the people on the other side of

118
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,180
this screen.

119
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,220
I know a little something about the camera guys.

120
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,340
But that's about it.

121
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,450
I don't know much beyond the other side of the screen save two things.

122
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,370
There are two things I know fairly reliably about anyone

123
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,980
watching this video.

124
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,650
One, you're interested in public speaking.

125
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,480
You have some sort of interest in public speaking.

126
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,820
Or you're a fan of me, in which case that explains my mom--

127
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,920
hi, mom-- but not anyone else.

128
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,200
So I know that you're pretty much interested in public speaking.

129
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,920
And the second thing I know is that at some basic level, you're functionally

130
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,460
aware of what a MOOC is-- a massive open online course.

131
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,480
That's what this is.

132
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,400
That's what you're involved in right now.

133
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,880
So I know public speaking.

134
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,980
And I know MOOCs.

135
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:19,180
So I tried to craft topics that spoke to those two areas.

136
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,180
And that's because I want to make sure that all the examples I'm using are

137
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,140
mutually intelligible to anyone who would watch this.

138
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,320
And as you record speeches and post them online, they would be

139
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,350
intelligible to anyone who was engaging in watching one of the

140
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,870
speeches for peer review.

141
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,480
So what might some of these look like?

142
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,500
Well, under speech, these might be stuff like delivery is more important

143
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,610
than invention in public speaking or something like the prevalence of the

144
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,790
television soundbite has significantly hurt the quality of public speaking.

145
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,450
Or if we shift over to that MOOC topic, it might be online education

146
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,850
will never replace traditional universities.

147
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:00,790
Or MOOCs should charge a small fee for classes in order to pay for staffing

148
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,410
and website development.

149
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:07,220
So those are the level of claims that we're dealing with, merely because

150
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,500
that allows us to get to the speech.

151
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,530
We've got the topic.

152
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,820
It's set you up for an argument.

153
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,860
But we can get to that speech.

154
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,330
So in any one of these topics, I really don't care what you argue.

155
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,940
I don't have a dog in any one of these fights.

156
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,650
That's not why the prompt is there.

157
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,390
I'm not saying you should argue this.

158
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,650
I don't care what the argument is.

159
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,540
But I care that the arguments are good.

160
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,860
That's where my concern is.

161
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,460
So this lecture was really just to give you a broad sense of what this

162
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,790
assignment is about.

163
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,930
Now, in the next lecture, we're going to move through the specific

164
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,830
assignment learning goals and its attendant evaluative rubric.

165
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,334
