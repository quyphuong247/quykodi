00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,700
MATT McGARRITY: So you may remember the week three meltdown guy.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,090
The guy talking about the smoking ban, dry mouth, we heard each and every one

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,330
of it, nearly has a heart attack in front of us.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:15,280
That guy, well, I think one of the contributing factors to that

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,870
apprehension moment was certainly his fear about public speaking in general,

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,530
but also his preparation.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,230
So he had prepared all this information, but he hadn't prepared it

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,030
as a speech and he hadn't prepared his notes.

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,000
So notes are part of the performance.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,580
So you just want to make sure that you've got notes that allow you to

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,680
deliver your material well.

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,390
So I want to talk about three of the typical ways you might

13
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,225
organize your notes.

14
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:47,080
Note cards, printing out an outline of your speech, or if you need to-- and

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,090
there are plenty of times when this would be necessary--

16
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,380
a full-on manuscript.

17
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,390
We typically don't spend too much time talking about fully manuscripted

18
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,180
speeches in this class, but sometimes the occasion calls for it.

19
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,030
And we might as well have good notes for it.

20
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,890
So note cards, outlines, and manuscripts.

21
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,365
So let's start with note cards.

22
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:03,220
A couple of do's and don'ts.

23
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,940
Don't put too much on a card.

24
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,380
OK, so if I've got note cards, they're not very big.

25
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,580
OK, that's a whole purpose, right?

26
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,730
Is they don't get in the way, they're not too much of a visual distraction

27
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:13,940
between me and my audience.

28
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,090
So they're not that big.

29
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,070
Don't put too much on a card.

30
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:23,060
Better to have more cards then having text that you have to read like this.

31
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,440
A good note card should be able to be read from arm's length, right?

32
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,810
You're just referencing and not waving it around when you're not using it.

33
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,330
So don't put too much on a note card.

34
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,260
As part of that, you really probably don't need to

35
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,170
write out full sentences.

36
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,545
If it's a reminder of where you want to go, they're just notes to help aid

37
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:43,050
your extemporaneous speech, you probably don't need to be writing out

38
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,000
full sentences.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,050
Certainly don't write too small, right?

40
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,440
I should be able to read it, access it visually from about this distance.

41
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,210
Don't make double-sided cards, unless you are just

42
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,750
absolutely, desperately broke.

43
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,170
Splurge.

44
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,150
Have ten cards instead of five.

45
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,770
The gumball budget for that week will take a hit.

46
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,980
But it will be worth it.

47
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,060
OK, so don't make double-sided cards.

48
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,789
The other side of this would be--

49
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,690
the other side of this point, though not the other side of this card--

50
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,710
would be some do's.

51
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,310
If you've got main points and sub-points, put a single

52
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,540
sub-point on a card.

53
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,370
Because then you've got a nice transition point, right?

54
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,710
So let's say you're in your 1A.

55
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,090
You've got that on a card.

56
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:33,230
Then as your transitioning to your 1B, you've got a visual marker of that

57
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,770
break as well as an auditory one.

58
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,070
It's a nice way of keeping things easy to follow.

59
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,460
If they're short points, put a full point on there.

60
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,610
But really, what you're trying to do is think about when you're going to

61
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,730
take a break in the presentation.

62
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,920
That's maybe when you're going to want to have a card shift.

63
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,320
Shorten words and phrases.

64
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,810
No one should be seeing your cards but you, and so just put enough on there

65
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,930
to remind you of what you wanted to say.

66
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,160
And I think it is a good point, a strategic point, to

67
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,910
number your cards, right?

68
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,420
So one, two, three, four, so on and so forth.

69
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,220
Why?

70
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,760
Let's say you're delivering a speech in a hurricane, because that's a neat

71
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,440
place to deliver a speech.

72
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,690
And you're speaking and you're talking.

73
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,960
And as you go to transition that point, psh!

74
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,090
It's gone.

75
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,010
And so then, you're in the position of having to it just reach down and

76
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:26,910
collect them.

77
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:32,150
And then you've got your note cards, and oh, I, where was I?

78
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,440
Ha ha, this was--

79
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,990
no, that's-- that's not even my note card.

80
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,920
So number your cards, OK?

81
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,200
It could save you some time, some heartache, some stress later on if

82
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,040
something happens.

83
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,230
Helps keep you on track.

84
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,900
So in making your note cards, let's say you're making are note cards from

85
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,820
your outline.

86
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,860
So hypothetically, let's say this is your outline text right here.

87
00:03:53,860 --> 00:04:01,590
Now if this is your text, really a bad note card would be simply taking that

88
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,020
outline and just cutting and pasting it on your note card.

89
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,650
This has lots more information than you actually need on your note card.

90
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,180
And since it's so much of your text, you're probably more prime to just

91
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,050
flat out read it.

92
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,490
So if that's a bad note card, I would say this would be a

93
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,329
better note card, right?

94
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:21,709
I'm reducing some of the information on the card.

95
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:24,090
The phrasing is a little bit better.

96
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,150
I've got a single sub-point on a single card.

97
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,180
So this is a little bit more usable.

98
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,850
I would say this is a better note card.

99
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,090
If I perform my speech enough, I know what these evidence sources are.

100
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:42,870
So I just am indicating this is for a speech, an old speech, about here in

101
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,230
Seattle, we live on top of an earthquake fault.

102
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:52,320
And it's a very poor place for a city, but we've got elevated highway, the

103
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,590
Alaskan Way Viaduct.

104
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,860
And there was an argument a while back about whether or not to rebuild the

105
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,830
viaduct, build under the viaduct, or retrofit it.

106
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,920
So this was an argument for a retrofit.

107
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,760
And so in this note card you see here, I've got it numbered.

108
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,570
I've got short phrases here.

109
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,350
And I've just got a reminder of what the evidence is.

110
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,420
That note card, I can look at, reminds where I'm going,

111
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,880
and deliver the point.

112
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,950
So I would say this is a better note card if you're using note cards.

113
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,560
Now let's go ahead and transition and say, well, let's say you're not using

114
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:22,960
note cards.

115
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,460
Sometimes note cards might be just out of place.

116
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,510
OK sometimes in corporate settings if you stand with a stack of note cards,

117
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,480
that feels very different.

118
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,460
Than feels at odds with that particular culture.

119
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,110
So sometimes, you're going to want written notes.

120
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,670
Let's say you want to work with your outline.

121
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,650
I think that's great.

122
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,970
That's how I often speak, is with an outline.

123
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,290
But what you want to do is make sure that outline is something that will

124
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,450
actually aid you in that speech performance.

125
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,440
So you're walking a delicate line here.

126
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,150
Too much text and you won't be able to quickly find your

127
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,530
place on that outline.

128
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,060
Too little text, and the notes aren't all that helpful.

129
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:06,800
So here's a sample outline that I used in a recent presentation.

130
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,630
Right, I've got my three key ideas.

131
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,460
I've got my main points under each.

132
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,700
And I've got enough here that I bring in this single sheet with me.

133
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,940
This is probably, I don't know, about 15 minutes or so, more than that with

134
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,890
Q and A. And so I've got something here that I can easily

135
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,250
find my place on.

136
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,580
I know the main breaks, so if I know what point I'm in, I can quickly

137
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,030
reference what I'm doing next.

138
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,670
It's got enough information that's reminding me if what information I

139
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,400
wanted to make sure I talked about, what examples, who I talk to,

140
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,830
expertise, and so forth.

141
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:42,680
It's got enough information, but not so much that it's visually cluttering.

142
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,570
So let's say finally, note cards aren't going to do it.

143
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,910
The outline's insufficient.

144
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,910
And you actually need to deliver a manuscript speech.

145
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,550
That's going to happen on occasion, for whatever reason you have to do it.

146
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,300
Again, make sure the script works for you.

147
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,670
And how you wrote it in your word processing program, or how it might

148
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:06,780
appear if you were going to hand it out to someone in paragraph form is

149
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,670
probably not how you want to make that manuscript for oral performance.

150
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,070
So you're probably going to be using a bigger font.

151
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,900
There's probably going to be more spacing.

152
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,300
Just like with the note cards, I want to put in a card turn where there's a

153
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,440
natural break in the presentation.

154
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,500
I want to make sure that my paragraph breaks or my pause breaks are coming

155
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,030
when I'm going to be turning a page.

156
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,150
I don't want to write it so I'm turning a page mid-sentence.

157
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,860
That's just bad planning.

158
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,140
So I just want to make sure that I'm using this in a way where the page

159
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:42,240
turn I have to do any way is going to fall in a place that I want to be

160
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,360
putting a pause.

161
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,560
And then as I'm formatting that document, I probably want to focus on

162
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,020
phrasing groups.

163
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,190
So what do I want to say as a phrase rather than on paragraphs?

164
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,930
I probably wrote it in paragraphs.

165
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:59,330
But then I go through, and I'm breaking out those paragraphs based on

166
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,810
what are the phrases I want to deliver.

167
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,570
So what you end up with is something that doesn't look like a series of

168
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,560
paragraphs.

169
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,210
You can see here.

170
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,960
This is a manuscript speech I did not too long ago.

171
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,150
So you see I've got lines that are really aimed at that's what I'm going

172
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:21,500
to perform, that chunk of talk, that sentence or two sentences

173
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,810
is a chunk of talk.

174
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,510
And I want to deliver it as a chunk.

175
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:28,730
The big breaks, the drop downs, are between these phrase groups.

176
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,650
I want to put in lots of those so I can find my place on the page quickly

177
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,640
and easily.

178
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:41,140
So however you plan on using notes, you want to make sure that they're

179
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,960
going to help you in that performance, be it note cards, outlines, or a

180
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,470
manuscript.

181
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,680
Make sure you've chosen the right one for the occasion.

182
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,510
If it's an extemporaneous setting, reading a manuscript

183
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,980
isn't going to work.

184
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,010
So you want to make sure you've chosen the appropriate mechanism.

185
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:02,470
For these informative speeches, for this class, I'd recommend either note

186
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:07,900
cards or that outline model, certainly not manuscripts for these speeches.

187
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,240
Whatever you choose, practice with it.

188
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,050
I am shocked how many times I see people practicing their speech,

189
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,320
working on their speech, and then making their notes five minutes before

190
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,900
they go deliver the speech.

191
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,580
Man, that's a recipe for failure.

192
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:27,270
Because those note cards are going to be your lifeboat the second you stand

193
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,230
up to speak.

194
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,640
You wouldn't quickly patch together a--

195
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,580
that metaphor doesn't work.

196
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,930
If the ship were sinking, you would patch together a lifeboat as quickly

197
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:35,960
as you could.

198
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,710
In performance of a speech, you want to spend some time thinking about, how

199
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,020
is this actually going to shape your performance?

200
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,100
No one ever needs to see your notes but you.

201
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,740
So make them useful.

202
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,110
And the way you're going to make them useful is by practicing with them,

203
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,930
figuring out if it's awkward to use in your notes.

204
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:56,400
Make sure that they're accessible and easy to use.

205
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,390
And let me just conclude with one final point.

206
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:06,620
Be it note cards, or a manuscript, be kind to your notes.

207
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,680
Often, you'll see people delivering their speech, and they're nervous.

208
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,820
And so their mangling their notes.

209
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,020
The notes didn't do you no harm.

210
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,490
Be kind to those notes.

211
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,070
And so too with your manuscript.

212
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,840
If you've got a manuscript and a podium, great.

213
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,090
Keep it there.

214
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,040
Reference it, but keep your hands free.

215
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,290
You know, you're not in the point of getting ready to swat a fly with it.

216
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,220
Don't be mean to your notes.

217
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:32,980
They're there to help you.

218
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,260
They're your friend.

219
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,920
Don't beat them up and be mean to them.

220
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,730
So practice with those notes.

221
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,120
Plan those notes.

222
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,330
And with that, improve your performance.

223
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:45,890
And don't be that guy from week three, who only at the moment of speaking

224
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:49,680
learned that his notes we're preparing him only for disaster.

225
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,986
