00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,180
MATT MCGARRITY: Stock issues is a very useful concept.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,990
And I think it takes on more usefulness the more you can actually

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,260
see it being operationalized.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,220
So what I've got here is I've got an audio clip.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,740
And we're going to listen to it.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,500
It's an audio clip from when Barack Obama was a senator.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,450
So this is back in 2006.

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,720
So this is before his presidential run.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,460
And it's certainly not the most stirring oratory that you will hear

10
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,780
from President Obama.

11
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:32,380
But it is a really good demonstration of how you would organize a speech

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,410
thinking through stock issues.

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,440
So the speech that we're going to listen to argued that the current

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,560
policy in Sudan, specifically in terms of military aid to Darfur, was

15
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,080
insufficient.

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,540
And so in essence what he's arguing here is gap inherency.

17
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,530
We had something in place, but it's not enough.

18
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,120
And so he's arguing against the status quo.

19
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,860
We need to change what we have.

20
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,130
So the burden of proof is his.

21
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:59,220
And you'll see how he tries to do that, how he tries to satisfy that

22
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,330
burden of proof.

23
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,290
So I want you to listen to this.

24
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,830
And you'll see my flow of it, a very sort of minimalistic flow, but

25
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:12,090
directing you to how I hear the stock issues operationalized in this speech.

26
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,480
As always, as we were doing in former lessons, please analyze this as a

27
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,200
speech, rather than a political text, especially because now we're well past

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,270
2006, although certainly not well past the issues embedded there.

29
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,730
But nevertheless, I want you to analyze and engage this not in terms

30
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,830
of what you think about Obama, but how this speech is working,

31
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,320
its internal logic.

32
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,750
Is it satisfying its own conditions?

33
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,220
Is it working through burden of proof of the status quo well,

34
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,100
so on and so forth.

35
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,680
So why don't you go ahead and take a listen to that now.

36
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,320
BARACK OBAMA: Hello.

37
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,340
This is Senator Barack Obama.

38
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:53,180
And today is Wednesday, February 15, 2006.

39
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:59,300
For more than two years now, we have been watching a rolling genocide take

40
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:04,730
place in Darfur, Western Sudan.

41
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,620
Many of you, I'm sure, are aware of the tragedy that's

42
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,310
been unfolding there.

43
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:14,720
For those of you who are not, essentially what we have seen is a

44
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,030
systematic targeting on the part of the Khartoum government and the

45
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:26,940
Janjaweed Arab militia that have systematically uprooted, killed,

46
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:34,760
murdered, pillaged, raped Africans, driven them from their homes into

47
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,810
enormous displaced person camps, refugee camps within Sudan.

48
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,640
It's estimated that at least 300,000 people have been killed.

49
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,850
It's known that at least two million people have been displaced.

50
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:56,700
The administration early on in this tragedy acknowledged that this was

51
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,030
genocide that was taking place.

52
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,730
I think there has been broad recognition in the international

53
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,350
community that the behavior of the Sudanese government has been

54
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,830
scandalous.

55
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,930
The rationale that has been provided from the Sudanese government for

56
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:19,010
what's taking place is that there is a battle going on between the Sudanese

57
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,900
government and rebels who operate within the area.

58
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,350
But the real victims have not been rebel sympathizers or the rebels

59
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,180
themselves.

60
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,170
They've been innocent men, women, and children.

61
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,880
For more than a year now I've been working with other senators to see

62
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,990
what we can do to really push the administration to take this as

63
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,760
seriously as it warrants.

64
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,080
To the administration's credit, the United States government has probably

65
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,180
paid more attention to this issue than some of our European allies.

66
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,070
We have been a major contributor of aid to the region.

67
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:03,950
We have helped to finance the African Union to provide peacekeeping forces

68
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,220
in the Darfur area.

69
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,580
So in a lot of ways, the United States government has been much more on top

70
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:15,970
of this than Europeans, Canadians, and others who oftentimes accuse the

71
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,870
United States of being indifferent to the problems of the Third World.

72
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,570
On the other hand, what has been done is not enough.

73
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:31,900
The few thousand African Union troops who have been placed in Darfur are

74
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,680
primarily providing witness to some of the atrocities that are

75
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,120
taking place there.

76
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,930
But they don't have clear rules of engagement.

77
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,510
And they're under-armed, under-trained.

78
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:47,140
They don't really provide the sort of protective force that would be needed

79
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:52,490
to not only ensure that existing villages aren't ravaged by the

80
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:58,300
Janjaweeds, but more importantly that the two million displaced people could

81
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,240
actually safely start returning home.

82
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:09,020
Recent reports indicate that in the past few weeks alone more than 20,000

83
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,130
people have been displaced.

84
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,080
There are also indications that the Janjaweed, recognizing that the AU

85
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,570
forces, the African Union forces, are not particularly effective, have

86
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,160
started targeting them.

87
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,890
So there's a sense of deterioration in Darfur.

88
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,880
The situation may be getting worse rather than better.

89
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,740
And what's most disturbing is that the United States government seems to be

90
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,910
backing off a little bit the commitment that it made to deal with

91
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:37,530
the problem.

92
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:42,530
There was a quote from the undersecretary for African affairs,

93
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:46,470
Secretary Frazer, in which she indicated that maybe this was not a

94
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,100
genocide after all.

95
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,440
And if that ends up being the United States' attitude, then we could see

96
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,410
continuing problems of a scale that might eventually reach the same scale

97
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,220
as what happened in Rwanda.

98
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,160
So here are a couple of things that we think need to happen.

99
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,000
Number one, we need a UN peacekeeping mission in Darfur.

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,930
There have been conversations.

101
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:16,060
The UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, the AU forces, and the Bush

102
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,450
administration have all acknowledged this.

103
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,500
There's got to be a sense of urgency in which the US diplomatic efforts are

104
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,970
focused on getting this peacekeeping force up to about 20,000 troops and

105
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:34,010
placing them in Darfur as quickly as possible with a strong protection

106
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,330
mandate, rather than a monitoring one.

107
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,170
In the meantime--

108
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,290
it's going to take about a year at best to get a UN

109
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,020
peacekeeping force in place--

110
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,412
we're going to have to supply and rally bridging money and forces for

111
00:06:46,412 --> 00:06:51,210
the AU throughout this year, because since it's sort of been lame duck

112
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:55,840
status, the Janjaweed recognize that AU forces are not

113
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,760
particularly effective.

114
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,950
They may become more and more of a target.

115
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:04,600
We're going to have to provide this successor UN force with our own lift

116
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,380
and logistic assets.

117
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:11,500
We're going to have to provide our military hardware, like transport and

118
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,590
attack helicopters and so forth.

119
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,120
And we're going to have to really force other countries, like Canada,

120
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,470
Australia, some of the European countries that are not engaged in

121
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:27,030
peacekeeping in other places, or at least are not immediately involved in

122
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:32,950
major activity in places like Iraq and Afghanistan as we are, to deliver the

123
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,890
troops that are needed.

124
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:39,590
So it's absolutely critical that we start focusing on this now.

125
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,110
The situation, as bad as it is, could deteriorate further.

126
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:48,490
This is something that is of interest I think to all of us not just for

127
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,850
humanitarian reasons.

128
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:54,240
Although when you read the accounts of women being raped when they're out

129
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,830
collecting firewood, when you read just horrendous accounts of entire

130
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:06,350
villages being decimated and children being murdered, it

131
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,320
just breaks your heart.

132
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,380
And humanitarian concerns should be sufficient.

133
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,960
But we also have a strong national security interest.

134
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,110
If you start seeing more and more failed states, more and more displaced

135
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,340
persons, more and more refugees, all that becomes a breeding ground for

136
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,880
terrorist activity.

137
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,010
It becomes a breeding ground for disease.

138
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:34,530
It creates refugees that put further pressure on our own borders.

139
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,780
In an interconnected world, we can't insulate

140
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,539
ourselves from these tragedies.

141
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:45,510
So we're going to have to over time develop some strategy as the world's

142
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,450
remaining superpower to address these issues.

143
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,880
And Darfur is an important test case.

144
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,410
We've already failed one test and in Rwanda.

145
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,710
We shouldn't fail another.

146
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,770
Anyway, if you are interested in the issues related to Darfur, you can

147
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:03,400
always contact my office or get on the website.

148
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,650
Your voice is obviously critical in this issue.

149
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,500
I appreciate you, as always, listening in.

150
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,680
Thanks for downloading.

151
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,536
And I will talk to you next week.

152
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:14,520
Bye bye.

153
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,000
MATT MCGARRITY: Having listened to that Obama speech--

154
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,320
it was a podcast, right?

155
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,830
But having listened to how he weighed in on current US policy, and you've

156
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,490
seen my flow in terms of how it matches up with stock issues, I want

157
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:32,060
to in the next lecture move through the analysis of that speech, talking

158
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,280
about how this helps us understand stock issues, and also how someone

159
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:41,070
might argue the opposite case, what stock issues allows you to see if

160
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,330
you're arguing the oppositional case.

161
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,360
So we'll go ahead and take that up in the next lecture.

162
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,610
