00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,790
MATT MCGARRITY: We've now seen the differences

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:03,980
between writing and speaking.

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,200
So let's move it closer into the performance of actual speeches.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,860
So merely performing literacy as orality can make the speech more

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,560
nerve-racking, and in many cases harder to understand.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,360
And I want to look at this through the lens of performance and communication

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,590
orientation.

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,650
In this class, we're going to adopt a communication orientation.

9
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,560
I'm going to unpack these terms here in a moment.

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,860
In general, I take my understanding of these terms from

11
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,820
Michael Motley's work.

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,640
He's got a slim volume on public speaking, apprehension, fear of public

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,250
speaking, where he really fleshes these out.

14
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,480
But at the broadest level, I want to draw--

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,660
I want to think of performance in communication

16
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,010
orientation as a continuum.

17
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,860
We sort of identify certain performances

18
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,240
somewhere along this line.

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,580
Speech is somewhere along this line between a performance orientation and

20
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,120
a communication orientation.

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,420
And in fact, this performance is a metaphor, right?

22
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,940
Is it like a stage performance or is it more like a conversation, a

23
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,010
communication conversation?

24
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:07,860
So on the performance side, well, we tend to see these as being more

25
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,420
literary, OK?

26
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,150
Being more akin to the written word.

27
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,990
In terms of speech preparation, often these are going to be full

28
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,110
manuscripts, written out speeches word for word.

29
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,810
On the other end, we're going to-- on the communication orientation, we're

30
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,360
going to see more outlining.

31
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,540
Minimal outline so that the speaker can move off of that preparation and

32
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,290
actually engage the audience.

33
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,990
So it's not mapping out each and every word, which may have been, once again,

34
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,060
written for the eye rather than for the ear, but working

35
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,790
off a minimal outline.

36
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,150
Performance orientation, well, because it's written out it's probably going

37
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,350
to be either read at the audience or completely memorized.

38
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,010
So once again, the stage metaphor is appropriate.

39
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:57,800
It's like if you went to go see a play of Hamlet, a staging of Hamlet.

40
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,650
And if you're going to see Hamlet, you're going to hear the words.

41
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,025
The actor is not going to just wing it to do Hamlet.

42
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:07,730
You know what the words are and you're going to hear those specific words.

43
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:12,640
The actor doesn't start off the famous soliloquy with "to be are not to be.

44
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:12,850
Hm.

45
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:13,850
That's a question.

46
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,450
I--

47
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,290
let me think on that.

48
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,230
Audience, any ideas?"

49
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,610
You're not going to see that.

50
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,510
That's not what that space is about.

51
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,970
So here where if we're dealing with a full manuscript, we're probably

52
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,410
dealing with read speeches or memorized speeches.

53
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,220
Now on the other side, if we're dealing with more of a minimal outline

54
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,460
it needs to be practiced.

55
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,980
You need to know where you're going in that presentation.

56
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,860
But it can be interactive.

57
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,440
Why?

58
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,370
Because you're tapping more into conversational speech.

59
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:47,160
Right now, I kind of know where I'm going in this presentation.

60
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,590
I have no idea what word is going to come out of my mouth

61
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,310
in one hundred words.

62
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,060
I hope it's "chocolate," because chocolate's delicious.

63
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,630
But I don't think it will be.

64
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,180
But I don't know what's happening.

65
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,310
So in the sense that I know where the presentation is going, but the words

66
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,340
are being generated spontaneously as we do in conversation.

67
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,640
So here, if it's not memorized, it's much more interactive.

68
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,370
I can work with that audience.

69
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:19,800
On the other hand, here, if it's a manuscript and it's read, then it's

70
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,390
going to be speaking at the audience, right?

71
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,380
The focus is going to be from the speaker's eyes to that manuscript.

72
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,540
The audience is not going to be much of an active factor in that

73
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,210
communication act.

74
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,790
And that's a shame because speech should be more about that active

75
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,790
communication.

76
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,800
So that's going to be much more speaking at the audience.

77
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,820
Here, we're working off a minimal outline.

78
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,470
I'm interacting with the audience.

79
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,080
I can actually engage them.

80
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,510
I'm speaking with the audience.

81
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,140
Now, they're not talking as much as I am in delivering a presentation.

82
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:56,410
But I'm trying to recreate that sense of a conversation, that sense of a

83
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,830
give and take between interlocutors, OK?

84
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:05,490
Last thing I'll say, and this is often counter-intuitive to many people.

85
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:09,410
Writing out that speech, reading it at the audience is often more

86
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:14,480
nerve-racking, is often more nerve-racking than on a communication

87
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,040
side, if I practice, I plan the speech, I practice it, but I'm working

88
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,890
off a minimal outline so I can engage the audience.

89
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,250
That's probably going to be less nerve-racking.

90
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,540
Why is this more nerve-racking?

91
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,410
Well, there's lots of theories on this, or some theories on this.

92
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,160
But in many ways, it comes down to the threshold for failure is pretty low.

93
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,780
If the word is the thing, if I get a paragraph wrong, it's wrong.

94
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,250
If I get a sentence wrong, if I get a word in the wrong place, it's

95
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,640
gone off the rails.

96
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,660
As opposed to, in conversation, I might start and restop a sentence, but

97
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,370
that's not a horrible thing.

98
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,390
We're able to adapt because that's how flexible and dynamic

99
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,980
spoken language is.

100
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,750
So, in this class we're going to be doing communication orientation rather

101
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,710
than performance orientation.

102
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,930
Now, there are lots of exceptions to this basic dynamic.

103
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,940
So, the State of the Union Address here in the United States, the

104
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,470
President gets up and addresses the nation, right?

105
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,160
He's not winging it.

106
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,310
He's not making it up as he goes.

107
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,650
It's not "my fellow Americans, the State of the Union is

108
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,820
strongish, I suppose.

109
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,820
How y'all doing?

110
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,580
It's hot out tonight." You know, he's not doing that.

111
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,690
Is very deliberately mapped out.

112
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,460
It is a manuscripted speech.

113
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:29,600
But writing for the ear, writing something that sounds like it can be

114
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,560
delivered naturally, or is able to be processed by listeners as naturally

115
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,640
occurring speech, or as a logical speech, takes practice.

116
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,870
In this class we'll get there.

117
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,720
By the time we get to that persuasive speech we're going to be doing a lot

118
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,480
more writing for the ear.

119
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,060
But right now I want to make sure that we're at least understanding and

120
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,190
working within and getting the full benefits of this communication

121
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,710
orientation.

122
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:58,060
So what I'd like you to do now at the end of this video is, you'll notice on

123
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:04,000
the course web page I've got a link to some clips on YouTube.

124
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,510
And what I want you to do is go watch those clips.

125
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,950
I've got sample clips.

126
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,850
But I want you to locate each one of those individual speakers on the

127
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,310
performance communication continuum.

128
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,720
Where do they sit?

129
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,760
Are they more on one side or the other?

130
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,680
Are they in the middle?

131
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,130
Why?

132
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,590
What are they doing in terms of performance or communication

133
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,510
orientation that you think is effective or ineffective?

134
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,880
Are they reading?

135
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,300
Do they seem, or do they sound natural?

136
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,450
Is a speaker more compelling than another one?

137
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,450
So these are American examples.

138
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:40,810
And just because they're some convenient ones I've used in the past.

139
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,220
But they're also famous examples.

140
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,640
And I want to do that because I want to make sure I'm using people who are

141
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,680
aware that they're being watched as opposed to some poor guy on YouTube

142
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,780
that I grab his clip.

143
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,030
And then all of us watch it and make fun of him.

144
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,660
We'd never do that.

145
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,130
So that explains these clips.

146
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,700
But what I want you to do is watch these clips, think through these

147
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,960
issues, and then talk about this.

148
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,560
Think about this on your own, but then also post in the discussion forums.

149
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,940
See how others are responding to these very issues.

150
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,580
So with that, I'll end here so that you can go take a look at

151
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,830
those sample clips.

152
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,778
