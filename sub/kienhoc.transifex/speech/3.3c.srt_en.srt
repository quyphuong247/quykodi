MATT MCGARRITY: We've now talked about your introduction for

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,230
your impromptu speech.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,480
And in that introduction, you're basically giving your audience a road

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,230
map, an orientation.

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,320
So now, I want to shift and talk a little bit about transitions, and then

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,490
conclusions.

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,450
So after that introduction, you've given your audiences roadmap, saying,

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,730
here's the nature of our journey over the next couple of minutes.

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,690
Transitions are going to help the audience follow along, identify

10
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,480
markers, where they are in the speech.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,050
And this is good in a short speech, but it's tremendously important in

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,220
much longer speeches.

13
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,500
45 minute speech, you say you're going to talk about five things, reminding

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,940
people where you are kind of helps them place what you're talking about

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,450
but also gives them a sense for how close you are to the end.

16
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,340
So it's doing a lot for you in terms of clarity but also in terms of

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,100
helping the audience dial in their expectations, how much longer are you

18
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,500
going to be speaking for.

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,600
So what are the functions of a transition?

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,570
Remember, for the introduction, we're not thinking necessarily in terms of

21
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,190
raw content.

22
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:05,510
But what does that introduction need to deliver on?

23
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,790
So too with the transition.

24
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,760
What does it need to do for that audience?

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,580
Well, transitions should be able to demonstrate the distinctness of each

26
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,320
point, basically saying, I'm done with that point, and I'm now going to be

27
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,790
talking about this point.

28
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,000
And so as part of that, demonstrating the distinctness of each point, and

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,790
then also helping the audience know where you are.

30
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,260
So if you say you're going to talk about two points, you finish talking

31
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,380
about one, we know you're about to talk about the next one.

32
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,280
If you're talking about 10 points--

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,010
I don't know why you would-- but if you're talking about 10 points, you

34
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,830
say, I'm done with point seven, now I'm moving on to point eight, that

35
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,530
kind of helps me know where we are in that road map that you gave me in the

36
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,760
introduction.

37
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,910
So there are lots of ways that you can do this.

38
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,520
Transitions shouldn't be overly elaborate affairs, but they are just

39
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,990
helping the audience understand, we're done with that point, we're moving on

40
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,810
to the next point.

41
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,970
So there's a lot of things you can be doing to help with this understanding.

42
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,495
You can use physical movement to help the audience perceive the transition

43
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,700
that you're making.

44
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,330
So it doesn't have to be a huge step, but you can actually walk on your

45
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:10,160
transitions, just some sort of physical or auditory break between the

46
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,300
major chunks of your presentation.

47
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,610
And this can be dialed up or dialed down based on your physical mobility

48
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,520
and unique space considerations.

49
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,840
But it's just a way of thinking about how you can use your entire instrument

50
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,640
in conveying the information to your audience.

51
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,890
You could do your introduction here.

52
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,940
Sometimes we'll talk about a speaker's triangle.

53
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,270
I'm starting here and moving there and there.

54
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:38,430
So maybe, let's say, in my impromptu speech, I do the introduction here,

55
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,940
and then on the first point, I transition over to here.

56
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,100
I talk for a little bit.

57
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,470
I'm talking about that first main point, and I take a step or two over

58
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,170
here, talk about this, and then make my way back to the conclusion on that

59
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,200
transition point.

60
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,620
If I've got a really large audience, maybe then I'm using that as an

61
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,330
opportunity to really walk to different parts of the room or

62
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,350
different parts of the stage.

63
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,210
But transitions are pretty straightforward.

64
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,460
They're functional, they should help your audience figure

65
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,280
out where you are.

66
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,720
So let's talk about conclusions.

67
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,800
What are the functions of a conclusion?

68
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,200
Well, if the opening was the curtain rising, then the conclusion is that

69
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,490
curtain coming down again.

70
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,130
So your conclusion should review the main points and restate the thesis,

71
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,640
basically remind the audience of that key argumentative information.

72
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,740
But it should also provide a sense of closure to the speech itself, so we

73
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,840
know that you're done.

74
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,020
Just like we wanted to make sure that the audience knew that we started, we

75
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,910
want them to know that we're done.

76
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:42,680
And without a doubt, your audience in this short impromptu speech may not

77
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,340
need a review of the key points.

78
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,670
But you can do this review quickly and easily, just re-addressing that road

79
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,690
map that you gave us in the introduction.

80
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:57,080
But then we get to this last line, and the final line should, quite honestly,

81
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,230
sound and feel like a final line of a speech.

82
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,390
So it's perfectly acceptable to say thank you at the end of the speech.

83
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,830
It's polite even.

84
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,920
You are done raised up right.

85
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,500
That's good.

86
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,149
But I don't think you should have to say thank you in order for the

87
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,320
audience to know that you are done.

88
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,240
You should be able to convey, you should be able to telegraph, through

89
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,910
pacing and tone, that a final line is the last line of your speech.

90
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,280
You don't want to get to the end of your speech, finish that last line,

91
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,040
and have silence, only to say thank you was a way of killing that awful,

92
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,260
awkward tension in the room.

93
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,290
You don't want to be like, and so these are the reasons why I think

94
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:47,050
MOOCs are perfectly fine to teach performance skills.

95
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,500
That's all I have.

96
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,270
You don't want the, wake up, dummies done.

97
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,840
So you want it to sound like you're building to that last line.

98
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,990
Now, this is obviously going to vary based on language.

99
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,970
But what does that final line usually sound like in spoken English?

100
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,290
Well, it's probably slower, with more pauses between the words, more

101
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:11,380
deliberate tone, and probably noticeably drops off there at the end

102
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,840
of the sentence.

103
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,350
I worked up that sample impromptu.

104
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,760
Let me just go ahead do the conclusions from that, one version of

105
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,020
a conclusion from that.

106
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,530
So let's say I walk over on point one, I'm over here on point two.

107
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,110
So here I am.

108
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,040
I'll transition into my conclusion and do my conclusion.

109
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,120
So I certainly understand why some would be skeptical.

110
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,350
But I do strongly believe that MOOCs can teach performance skills.

111
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,860
And they can do this because they could provide efficient instruction,

112
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,200
and they can actually produce some good student practice.

113
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,170
Now, clearly it's not the same thing.

114
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:52,800
You don't get one on one coaching or the immediacy of feedback that you

115
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,910
would in a university setting.

116
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:00,320
But you also get the opportunity to reach a much larger audience that just

117
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,150
can't happen when you're locked away in a specific classroom.

118
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,520
So these two things are different, but just because they're different doesn't

119
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,220
mean they can't accomplish the same thing.

120
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,100
They in fact often can.

121
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:19,230
MOOCs are very good spaces for learning modeling and practicing

122
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,990
performance skills.

123
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,920
So hopefully that last line you can hear slows down more deliberate and

124
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,540
drops off at the end.

125
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,230
So at the end of that last line, I would hope for applause at the end of

126
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,200
that last line.

127
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,020
I generally hope for applause after most lines.

128
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,550
But especially at the end of the last line, I want people to be able to know

129
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,760
that I'm done and start applauding.

130
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,770
So what I'd like to do now is, I asked you to prepare an

131
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,080
impromptu a while back.

132
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,870
So what I'd like you to do is just run your conclusion as a way of practicing

133
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,640
conclusions.

134
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:58,270
And pay special attention to the sound and the feel of that last line.

135
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,170
So in the next lecture, what I'm going to go ahead and do is just run an

136
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:05,340
entire impromptu speech, trying to highlight all the various elements

137
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,270
that are going on.

138
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,960
But go ahead and practice that conclusion now.

139
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,589
