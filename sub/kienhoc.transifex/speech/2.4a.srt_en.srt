MATT MCGARRITY: The impromptu speech is a good opportunity to develop some

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:10,630
quick thinking skills, and being able to pull your ideas together quickly

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,690
and then present a speech that is articulate and very much on point.

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,390
And that's what today is about.

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,300
That's what this particular lecture is about, is about identifying and

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,310
developing main points for your impromptu speech.

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:27,180
And we're working within the realm of this artifact, this artificial

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,140
situation, of the impromptu speech.

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,760
And you've got topics.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,900
I've given you topics to speak on, and that's because I want to remove topic

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,520
from your mental docket.

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:42,750
But this form, this genre, this skill set, is so useful in so many different

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,570
types of professional settings.

14
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,000
So if you would, imagine like a Q&A session.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,780
So let's say you've done a presentation at your work, and then

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,040
afterwards, they've got a question.

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,710
Well, how does this apply to the project that we're doing over in this

18
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,050
other section of the business?

19
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,480
Take a moment, think.

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,060
I can see sort of three impacts, and let me talk through each one of those.

21
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,840
All right, so that's taking your time and quickly composing some main

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,510
points, some key ideas.

23
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,990
And that's what we're going to be working on, and this is something that

24
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,540
you're going to do throughout your speaking career.

25
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,240
And that's what that impromptu's is about, is about being able to come up

26
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,630
with main points quickly in those impromptu type settings.

27
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,220
And I've said it in the past, and I'll continue to talk about it more in

28
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,770
these lectures, but this is hugely beneficial in job interviews, or in

29
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,780
informational interviews, or in client meetings, just where you're engaging

30
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,610
in conversation, but you need to take a moment and really craft what that

31
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,530
message is.

32
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,280
That's what we're going to be thinking about today.

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,590
So what I want to talk through is just the basic procedure for coming up with

34
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:50,280
main points for this impromptu speech assignment, talk through some

35
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,630
potential prompts that you might use to help prime the mental pump and help

36
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,830
you come up with main point ideas for your impromptu speech, and then I'm

37
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,190
going to ask you at the end of this video to prep an impromptu speech.

38
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,800
So let's go ahead and begin with the process of invention.

39
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,080
When you decide on one of those impromptu prompts to select, you

40
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,620
should look at it and decide on your position.

41
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,790
Once again, I don't really care whether you argue for or against any

42
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,200
one of those topics.

43
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,200
They are written in a way that allows you to run in either direction.

44
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,480
But they do, more often than not, ask you to make a decision, argue one side

45
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,300
or the other.

46
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,860
But so take a look at that and decide on your position, which way do you

47
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,330
want to argue.

48
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,830
As you practice these, I would strongly encourage you to argue, to

49
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,210
develop a speech arguing one side, and then flip and then

50
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,890
run the counter thesis.

51
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:45,130
That's a good skill to have, dissoi logoi, countervailing arguments, being

52
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,300
able to argue both sides of the issue.

53
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,710
But then once you've decided on your position, take a moment and then ask

54
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,950
yourself, why is your thesis true.

55
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,390
Why is it valid?

56
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,150
And in doing this, I would like you to mumble to yourself.

57
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,320
Not mumbling to yourself because that would be fun to make you look weird in

58
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,120
public settings, but mumbling to yourself so that you can get through a

59
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,510
whole bunch of topic, or main point ideas, in a short span of time.

60
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,520
One of the issues I run into when people are trying to come up with

61
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,300
impromptu speeches is they immediately start writing.

62
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:22,450
The problem is they might get locked into a bad main point, and since it's

63
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,900
on paper, they stick with it.

64
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,240
So just sort of talk to yourself, run through probably 10 potential issues,

65
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,800
or 10 potential main points, responses to the question, why

66
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,590
is my thesis true?

67
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:38,720
And in doing so, your main points should be claims, not topics.

68
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,250
OK, so remember what we just talked about in terms of what a claim is.

69
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,800
It is a reason that you want your audience to take as valid.

70
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,970
And so we're asking--

71
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,480
I'm asking you to be coming up with main points that are

72
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,540
claims and not topics.

73
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,540
So let me show you what I mean by that.

74
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,520
So one of the prompts is, public speaking should be a requirement at

75
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,960
every level of a K through 12 education.

76
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,260
Once again, you decide which way you want to run with that, and then you

77
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,110
would ask why that's true, mumble a few reasons to yourself, but what you

78
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,650
don't want to have is main points that are fifth grade and high school

79
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,630
English class.

80
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,450
Now, that may make sense to you, that may be evidence you want to get to in

81
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,720
support of your claim, but those aren't claims, right?

82
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,649
If said as a sentence, they don't make sense.

83
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:24,340
Well, you know I do believe that public speaking should be a

84
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,080
requirement at every level of a K-12 education.

85
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,810
I agree.

86
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,480
Oh, really.

87
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,570
Do tell me, why is that?

88
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,780
Because fifth grade and high school English class.

89
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,040
That makes no sense as a sentence, and I'm not going to talk to you anymore.

90
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,740
So what is happening there is, you don't have a set of reasons.

91
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,320
In this speech, what I really want you to work on is driving your thesis

92
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,920
forward with discrete claims.

93
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,500
So in response to this thesis, we could argue public speaking skills

94
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,540
take a long time to nurture.

95
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,580
And public speaking skills are important at every grade level.

96
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,620
Those are reasons for supporting that thesis.

97
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,330
At a very basic level, they're sentences, right?

98
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:07,960
They have a subject and a verb, but they're speaking to more discreet

99
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,220
reasons for why that thesis is true.

100
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,750
In the next lecture, we're going to be talking about principles for

101
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,610
arrangement, and making sure that those claims relate back to that

102
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,800
thesis statement.

103
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,230
But right now, I just want to think about, how do you come

104
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,800
up with these claims?

105
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,680
So if this is one example, we can take a look at another one.

106
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,240
Maybe let's say you're at a city council meeting, or you're at a civic

107
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,910
meeting where you're discussing a smoking ban, or anything that your

108
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,880
city would move to do.

109
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,750
So in the US, there are a number of cities that have citywide smoking

110
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,340
bans, so you can't smoke in public places.

111
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,500
So if the thesis was, my city should ban smoking in public places, and your

112
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,790
two reasons were workers and children, those are topic areas.

113
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,440
Those are probably good pieces of evidence that you want to use.

114
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,100
But they're not really the claim that's going to drive

115
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,330
that these as forward.

116
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:01,450
Something better might be a public smoking ban can improve public health,

117
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,940
and other cities have implemented such bans.

118
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,400
So we're talking to sort of why it's a good idea, and why

119
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,940
it's a feasible idea.

120
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,370
But so you want to be thinking in terms of, what are claims?

121
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,710
What are reasons for supporting that thesis?

122
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,846
Now, how do you come up with these?

123
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:19,350
That's a key question here.

124
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,670
Well, I would say there's a couple of questions, or basic ideas, that you

125
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:27,330
can run through to help prime your mental pump.

126
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,130
Here's some of these prompts.

127
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,830
You could think in terms of division.

128
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:35,640
What are the key parts, or topics, embedded in that thesis statement?

129
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,600
Now, this we don't know before we get to your specific thesis statement, but

130
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,870
I'll show you some examples here in a moment of how you could identify what

131
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,290
are the key components in the topic.

132
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,780
Or you could think in terms of short term and long term.

133
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,140
What's going to happen right now?

134
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,640
And then what's going to happen in 10 years in relationship to the thesis?

135
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,620
Past, future.

136
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,500
What happened in the past in relation to this thesis, or

137
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,340
this type of thesis?

138
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,780
What's going to happen in the future?

139
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,780
Is there going to be an increase or a decrease?

140
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,290
So you're trying to just think in terms of very broad categories.

141
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,930
In classical rhetoric, these would be some of the topoi that

142
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:08,990
we would talk about.

143
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:14,160
So to just general areas, lines of argument, to help us figure out what

144
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,630
we might want to argue.

145
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,620
Cause, effect is another sort of good topoi that's been with us since

146
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,310
antiquity, and relates directly just to sort of stuff we

147
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,900
would argue even today.

148
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,770
So let me walk through each one of these with an example.

149
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,820
So all of these are for the same thesis statement.

150
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,450
So there's not one right set of claims for each thesis statement.

151
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,480
It's whatever you can argue particularly well.

152
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,660
Now, your burden, as a speaker, is to make sense and come up with reasons

153
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,690
that work for your thesis and are clear for your audience.

154
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,500
It's not the audience's job to figure out what you mean.

155
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,950
It's your job to be clear for that audience.

156
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,770
So if we just took the same thesis statement, online education will never

157
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,910
replace traditional universities, and let's say we're

158
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,290
arguing in favor of that.

159
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:02,100
So if I looked at division, I could say online education is good at

160
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,150
broadcasting information, but traditional universities are good at

161
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,040
cultivating learning environments.

162
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,670
Well, those are sort of different topics.

163
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,730
Those are just two different things.

164
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,900
Broadcasting information, cultivating learning environments.

165
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:19,680
This allows me to talk about here's what online education can do, and

166
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,150
here's what it can't do, and here's why they'll never

167
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,970
replace online education.

168
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,450
Short term, long term.

169
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:29,390
Online education will initially challenge traditional universities,

170
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:34,250
but these two things will eventually split into different entities.

171
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,780
So I could argue that as a perfectly reasonable set of claims in

172
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,220
relationship to that thesis.

173
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,419
Past, future.

174
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:43,500
Extension education found its relationship with traditional

175
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,190
universities, so like mail order classes and older versions of online

176
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:53,620
classes, and online education, will in the future, find a relationship with

177
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,090
traditional universities.

178
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:58,360
So again, those are two claims that makes sense for the thesis.

179
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,260
I've got to still come up with the evidence, but they work.

180
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,830
It's just a way of coming up with a whole range of possible argument lines

181
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,930
for that thesis statement.

182
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,620
Increase, decrease.

183
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,380
There will be an increase in online-- initially, there will be an increase

184
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,660
in online courses, but we probably won't see a significant decrease in

185
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,860
traditional university courses.

186
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,090
You need evidence to show that but those are perfectly

187
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,740
reasonable claims to make.

188
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,350
And finally, cause, effect.

189
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:27,970
Online education emerged because of a need for adult learning, post

190
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,350
undergraduate learning.

191
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,140
And that adult learning will impact traditional universities in a very

192
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,410
minimal way.

193
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,400
So we're looking at--

194
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,850
stepping back and looking at the root cause for online education, and how

195
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:45,360
that root cause doesn't necessarily hit traditional learning, traditional

196
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,290
universities.

197
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,330
So these are just some of the options that you could use.

198
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:53,490
But ultimately, it comes down to, decide on your position,

199
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,710
and mumble to yourself.

200
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,870
Get some of these topics out, get some of these claims out.

201
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,670
And as you're coming up with these claims make sure that they are claims.

202
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,960
They are reasons for supporting that thesis statement, and they're not

203
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,310
merely topics that don't make sense when put together as a sentence.

204
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:13,150
So what I want you to do right now is go to that list of impromptu topics,

205
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:17,390
select one of those prompts, decide on your stance, decide whether or not if

206
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,010
your for or against this, and then draft up two claims.

207
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,260
