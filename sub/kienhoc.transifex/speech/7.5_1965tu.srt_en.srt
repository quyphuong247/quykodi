00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,330
MATT MCGARRITY: As we get further and further into the persuasive speech, I

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,380
think it is very helpful to start thinking in terms of status quo and

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,740
burden of proof.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,270
And why should you think through this?

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,430
Well, because as an advocate--

6
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,230
in this speech, you're an advocate, and as an advocate, you're asking for

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,970
a change to the status quo for the current state of affairs or you're

8
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,460
arguing against a change.

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,110
You're in essence saying to your audience either do

10
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,310
this or don't do this.

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,650
So you need to be thinking in terms of what bar, what argumentative threshold

12
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,200
you need to cross in that audience's mind.

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,190
If you're going to motivate them to take actions, what is that threshold?

14
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,800
What do you need to prove?

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,190
What is your burden of proof in order to motivate them to take action?

16
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,050
Now, a lot of this you're going to have to think through your specific

17
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,400
case, right?

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,970
The burden of proof in a burning building to convince people to exit

19
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,860
the building, pretty low, right?

20
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,520
That's a change from the status quo.

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,090
It's easy to get them out of there.

22
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,560
The burden of proof in other cases, far higher.

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,830
So you need to vibrate this concept against the particulars of your

24
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,340
specific case.

25
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,780
Nevertheless, it's a good way of thinking.

26
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,170
It's a nice intellectual tool for thinking through persuasive speech

27
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,450
encounters and argumentative encounters.

28
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,290
And I think that having a solid understanding of burden of proof just

29
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,510
makes life a better.

30
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,650
I genuinely believe you're going to win more arguments at the end of this

31
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,740
lecture if you're unfamiliar with this concept now.

32
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,690
It's just a very useful way of thinking about what needs to occur in

33
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,790
an argument, what needs to occur in order for persuasion to occur.

34
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,050
So what I want to do is I just kind of want to talk a little bit about what

35
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,560
the status quo is and how you can think about the status quo in general

36
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,960
and in your specific case.

37
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,550
And then I want to shift to talk about burden of proof.

38
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,900
First I'll work through an example of burden of proof, because this is very

39
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,580
formally stated in law cases.

40
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,470
And then we'll work through sort of burden of proof in argumentation.

41
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,520
So to begin with, status quo.

42
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,320
Status quo gets a lot of bad rap, right?

43
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,830
I mean, certainly in American political discourse, status quo is

44
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,240
framed as a bad thing.

45
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,670
He is not but a defender of the status quo.

46
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,120
Ah, status quotidian.

47
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,830
Status quotain.

48
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,590
But it's not.

49
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,760
Status quo is merely a descriptive term.

50
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,080
It simply means the existing state of affairs, what is.

51
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,590
Status quo is neither good nor is it bad.

52
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,720
It is descriptive.

53
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,410
So any time you're making an argument, you're probably bumping up against

54
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,660
this status quo concept.

55
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,770
So let's say--

56
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,170
when I was very young, I started in radio.

57
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,610
And it was a public radio station, college radio station, so they had to

58
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,810
do fundraising.

59
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,400
So lots of time we had to go to the air and do on-air fundraising.

60
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,670
Well, I'm arguing for a change to the status quo when I'm asking for funds.

61
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,200
They currently haven't given us their money.

62
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,290
I would like them to change that and give us their money.

63
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,220
So you're arguing for a change to the status quo.

64
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,240
They're not giving money now.

65
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,460
They should be giving.

66
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,900
As we've talked about I think at least once or twice, I've mentioned if you

67
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,990
were advocating, if your persuasive speech is on encouraging people to go

68
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:12,260
to farmers markets or support their local food supply chain, then you

69
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,980
would argue that people need to go to farmers markets.

70
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,320
The idea is that the status quo is currently not enough people are going.

71
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,840
And so more people need to go.

72
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,000
So you're arguing for a change to the status quo.

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,740
Or certainly any time you're at work and there is a new policy that's at

74
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,410
issue or a problem that needs to be solved, you're bumping up against what

75
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,090
is the current state of affairs and do we maintain it or do we change it?

76
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,790
So in your persuasive speech for this class, you're arguing somewhere around

77
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,070
the status quo.

78
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:46,110
So you might say, some people want to change the status quo.

79
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,610
But I don't believe we should.

80
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,730
So you're defending the status quo.

81
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,170
Or in other cases, you would say, ah, what we have right now is not good.

82
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,820
We need to change the status quo.

83
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,860
Here in the US--

84
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,350
and this has certainly probably gained a lot of coverage globally--

85
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,110
is health care reform.

86
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,730
Health care reform, big issue in the US.

87
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:09,750
So up until recently, the administration was arguing for a

88
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,020
change to the status quo.

89
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,840
We didn't have what they saw as sufficient health care coverage laws.

90
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,649
They argued for these health care coverage laws.

91
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:20,750
Those who were opposed, the Republicans mainly in Congress, were

92
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,829
opposed to these changes.

93
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:22,950
And they said, no.

94
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,310
We don't need that new health care law.

95
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:30,030
Or those new health care laws will be more problems than they're solving.

96
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:34,180
So you've got for and against, for change, against change.

97
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,310
And this arguing for and against change gets us to the concept of

98
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,780
burden of proof.

99
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,120
And burden of proof is once again very helpful in thinking through what sort

100
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,380
of evidence you're going to come up with or how you're going to structure

101
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,070
your argument.

102
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:54,060
In the court system, we formally identify what thresholds are.

103
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,860
What are the burdens of proof?

104
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,780
Certainly for US courts, we're always placing the burden of proof on the

105
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,460
prosecution, the person bringing the charge.

106
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,580
In our common vernacular, it is innocent until proven guilty.

107
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,560
That's a formal statement of burden of proof and of status quo.

108
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,550
You are innocent, status quo, unless that has formally been changed and a

109
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,110
burden of proof has been satisfied.

110
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:28,590
The Latin that drives this in essence translates to "the burden of proof

111
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,900
lies with those who declare, not those who deny."

112
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,980
So you can think in terms of this as varying levels of burden of proof, in

113
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,500
increasing thresholds.

114
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,960
So we've got a certain burden of proof for civil trials, another burden of

115
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,260
proof just for when maybe we're thinking about making--

116
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,870
police are trying to make an arrest.

117
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,490
And certainly the highest the burden of proof we reserve

118
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,670
for criminal trials.

119
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,020
And that makes sense, right?

120
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,930
Even though you might lose money in a civil trial, you're probably not going

121
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:57,970
to lose your freedom.

122
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:02,960
So we place a higher burden of proof on those who are trying to in essence

123
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,440
deny the freedom of someone.

124
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,480
They might deserve to have their freedom denied.

125
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,020
Maybe they committed a heinous crime.

126
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,400
But we say that burden of proof is reserved for someone who's going to be

127
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,910
potentially put in jail.

128
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,160
So in civil court cases, we would say, all right.

129
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,420
We formally state the burden of proof is that the prosecution must show a

130
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,850
preponderance of evidence.

131
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,060
This is sort of the 51% rule.

132
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,150
It's more likely true than it's not true.

133
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,340
So you've got burden of proof being once again always with the

134
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,010
prosecution.

135
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,780
The prosecution has the burden.

136
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:41,160
But they just have to say that-- they have to prove to that audience that

137
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,280
the defendant is more likely guilty of this than not.

138
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,950
Beyond that, in some civil courts, we'll talk about clear

139
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,800
and convincing evidence.

140
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,150
So that's slightly higher than just a preponderance of evidence, sort of

141
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,550
preponderance here, clear and convincing.

142
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,920
Let's say we're thinking about when police are pulling somebody over at a

143
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,440
traffic stop.

144
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,020
Well, even there, we've got a couple of different burdens of proof.

145
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,210
We've got reasonable suspicion.

146
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,330
Reasonable suspicion, it has to be more than just a hunch or that person

147
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,700
looks fishy.

148
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,540
You've got to have a reasonable suspicion.

149
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,310
We formally state what type of suspicion it must satisfy.

150
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,830
Beyond that, we talk about probable cause.

151
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:30,960
Evidence will probably be found if you engage in an arrest or do a search.

152
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,460
Then we get to criminal cases.

153
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,890
Criminal cases are very standardized.

154
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:41,460
We say that the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.

155
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,850
That's a high bar, beyond a reasonable doubt.

156
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,390
It's not beyond an unreasonable doubt.

157
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,470
That would be too high.

158
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,060
Some people think that--

159
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,890
all sorts of things.

160
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,420
So you can't satisfy all unreasonable doubts.

161
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,680
Buy you say, beyond a reasonable doubt.

162
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,210
That's the highest threshold that we use in court cases.

163
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,470
Now, argumentation doesn't have these formal laws.

164
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,810
No one's getting their--

165
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,860
passing the bar to become an arguer.

166
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,570
That's reserved just for that profession.

167
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,540
You're engaged in persuasion and argumentation, so we don't have a hard

168
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,540
and fast rule.

169
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:22,200
Typically though, a useful way of thinking about this is he who asserts

170
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,800
must prove.

171
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:31,110
So if you were arguing for a change to the status quo, we would say you have

172
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,809
the burden of proof if you're arguing for a change.

173
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:38,250
If you're arguing against a change to the status quo, then you probably have

174
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,100
presumption.

175
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,250
You were there first.

176
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:46,490
And the reason we do this is, just like in court cases, making change

177
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,720
typically costs stuff.

178
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,870
It costs time.

179
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,750
It costs money.

180
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,590
It costs intellectual effort.

181
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:58,020
And so you have to prove that the expenditure of that resource, time,

182
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,210
money, whatever, is worth it.

183
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,580
If you are arguing for a change, you have to prove that the

184
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,430
change is worth it.

185
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,380
And I'd like to just sort of end by running this through an example.

186
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:15,090
So there is a professor of argumentation, Christopher Johnstone,

187
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,450
and he told this story.

188
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:22,020
He actually had an elected position in addition to being a teacher, public

189
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,220
speaking teacher, professor of rhetoric.

190
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,450
He had an elected position.

191
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,560
This is at a small college town.

192
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,080
And he tells a story of he was sitting on the board.

193
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,780
And there was this husband and wife developer team.

194
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:37,520
And they wanted to go into a residential neighborhood and build a

195
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,270
tall building.

196
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,210
Not hugely tall, but it was above what the building code had

197
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,910
set for that area.

198
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:47,260
The building code probably was you can only go three stories.

199
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,500
And they wanted go in and build this five-story building.

200
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,920
And so he's sitting there.

201
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,950
And people said, well, you know, the neighbors were concerned that if they

202
00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:00,920
built this building, the property values of those houses would go down.

203
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:08,820
So they come in front of the city council for an exception so they can

204
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,650
build this tall building.

205
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,610
The professor is sitting on the city council.

206
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:15,780
And he says, well, they're worried that it's going to harm

207
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,870
their property values.

208
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,270
Can you show that it won't harm their property values?

209
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,050
And the husband and wife team says, well, no.

210
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:21,540
We can't.

211
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,085
But can they show that it will harm their property values?

212
00:10:24,085 --> 00:10:26,890
The professor says, they don't have to.

213
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,230
You are the one arguing for a change.

214
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,490
You are the one that if this change goes through and it in fact harms

215
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,020
their property value, are to blame.

216
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,860
So they hadn't thought through burden of proof.

217
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,890
They had just said, well, it's 50/50 one way or the other.

218
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,990
Maybe it will devastate their life savings.

219
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:43,950
Maybe it won't.

220
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,440
Come on.

221
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:44,970
Give it to us.

222
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:45,990
It sounds fun.

223
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,530
No.

224
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,610
Burden of proof means you have to think through what are the potential

225
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,280
consequences.

226
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,660
If you're arguing for a change, usually the burden of

227
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,590
proof lies with you.

228
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:59,210
So knowing what the status quo is and how your argument stands in

229
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,790
relationship to it is very helpful.

230
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:05,590
And so in the next lecture, we're going to look at some ideas for

231
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,600
developing arguments around this status quo idea.

232
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,850
