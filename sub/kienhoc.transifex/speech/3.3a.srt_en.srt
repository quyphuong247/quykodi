MATT MCGARRITY: So last week we talked about claims and evidence.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,900
And we just finished talking more about evidence.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,490
And that's really what we've been looking at.

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,580
We've been looking at sort of the bricks of the

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,560
speech, claims and evidence.

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,550
But a wall is more than simply just a pile of bricks, it needs mortar.

7
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,470
And that's what we're going to be talking about now, the role of

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,030
structure in your speech.

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,730
We're going to be focusing on this mortar of your speech.

10
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,630
Specifically for the impromptu speech, we're going to be looking at

11
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,730
introductions, transitions, and conclusions.

12
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,240
So as a way of working on introductions, transition, and

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,510
conclusions, I would like you have something prepped so you could just

14
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:40,180
run a real quick introduction, or conclusion as the case may arise.

15
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,210
So you don't have to prep obviously, but I do think it is a good habit.

16
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,040
So what I would recommend you do is go to that impromptu list on the class

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,880
website, and grab one of those, and just draft up a real quick speech.

18
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,910
Or of course, you can go and make up your own impromptu prompt.

19
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:00,520
But go ahead and pull together a basic impromptu outline, so that it can

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,890
sharpen our discussion of introductions, transitions, and

21
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:04,550
conclusions.

22
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,940
So go ahead and do that now.

23
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,350
And in the next lecture, we'll start talking about introductions.

24
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,675
