MATT MCGARRITY: Hi, my name's Matt McGarrity.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,890
And I'm a senior lecturer here at the University of Washington.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,120
And you've signed up for an introduction to public speaking.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,850
And I absolutely love this course.

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,750
I've taught it for years here at the University of Washington.

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,620
And I would like to begin our course, I'd like to begin our study of public

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,190
speaking with a quotation.

8
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,340
And this comes from Daniel Webster, who was an American senator in the

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,640
late 18th century, early 19th century.

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,190
And he said, "if all my talents and powers were to be taken from me by

11
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:35,180
some inscrutable Providence, and I had my choice of keeping but one I would

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,900
unhesitatingly ask to be allowed to keep the power of speaking, for

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,700
through it, I would quickly regain the rest." And I like this quotation,

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,390
because it captures so much of my approach to public speaking.

15
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,460
First off, it's funny.

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,930
Well, it's funny by 18th century standards.

17
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,240
So it's not like it's hilarious, but it's witty.

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:59,530
But it gets to what I think is a core truth, which is, speech is power.

19
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:04,590
In its rawest form, the ability to speak well is power.

20
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,770
So many people are bad at public speaking.

21
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,400
So many people are afraid of public speaking.

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,010
The ability to stand up in front of an audience and effectively communicate

23
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,980
your ideas is one of the absolute rawest forms of power that will always

24
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,390
travel with you, if you have that capacity.

25
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,720
So I really look at it as humans doing what humans do best--

26
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,730
speech.

27
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,300
So I love speaking, and I love teaching speech.

28
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,640
But we'll get to that.

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,330
So what I want to do in this very first video is just give you an

30
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,510
overview of the week.

31
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,600
Really, there's sort of two components to this week.

32
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,960
We're going to start off with some course orientation.

33
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,110
I want to talk through some key terms, go over the assignments for the

34
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,810
course, so you know where we're heading.

35
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,310
But I also want to start looking at the oral mode that

36
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,600
public speaking requires.

37
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,030
So that'll be the second half of this week.

38
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,670
And without a doubt, you'll have a chance to explore the course and the

39
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,480
course website.

40
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,390
But I wanted to briefly talk about some of the ways you're going to

41
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,930
engage in this class.

42
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,100
So to begin with, you're certainly going to be learning about speech.

43
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,230
That's the role of these videos and many of the readings that we'll have

44
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,130
on the website.

45
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,200
You're also going to be analyzing speeches.

46
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,310
I've got a number of sample students speeches that we'll be looking at, and

47
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,100
of course, a ton of professional speakers and professional speeches

48
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,970
that we'll be analyzing to see what's working, what's not working.

49
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,940
You are going to be practicing speech a lot.

50
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:30,490
Almost every lecture has you practicing some specific skill of

51
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,760
public speaking in some specific way.

52
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,720
A lot of these are going to be independently.

53
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,600
So you can do it privately at home, you can do it wherever you are.

54
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,870
So you can do it on the bus if you wish.

55
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,260
You'll also have the opportunity to record speeches and post them online

56
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,360
to get feedback.

57
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,400
This is optional.

58
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,640
If you don't want to record a speech, that's fine too.

59
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,330
You should be able to get something out of this course, even if you never

60
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,350
record a speech.

61
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,580
I think recording a speech and getting peer feedback is an excellent

62
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,110
opportunity to get some eyes on your speech, eyes outside your own body,

63
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,220
analyzing your speech.

64
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,800
But it is an optional portion of this online class.

65
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,300
But perhaps one of the most important ways you're going to engage in this

66
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,550
class is by engaging with each other.

67
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,410
So you'll be able to get peer feedback on your speeches, or you can also go

68
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:19,390
on to the online discussion forums for discussing analysis of speeches or

69
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,150
analyzing what works or what doesn't work for you or in general.

70
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,060
So I really love this course.

71
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,430
I want to thank you for joining me in this experience.

72
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,090
I hope you enjoy it as well.

73
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,340
So let's get started.

74
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,150
