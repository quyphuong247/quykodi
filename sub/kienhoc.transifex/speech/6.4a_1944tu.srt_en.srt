00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,770
MATT MCGARRITY: Now that we've taken a look at ethos in general and we've

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,880
moved through that Clinton and Bush clip, we've sort of got a general

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,109
sense of what ethos is.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,930
Now let's move into a more specific realm.

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,670
You are going to be performing informative speeches, either for this

6
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,340
class or in your daily life and your workplace life.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,400
So the question is, how are you developing your credibility in those

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,540
settings, on that subject matter?

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,580
Well, I want to move through a more specific issue.

10
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,690
I want to move through informative ethos and some things you can be

11
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,080
thinking about to augment, to highlight, to telegraph your

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,920
enthusiasm, your excitement, your ethos on your

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,490
informative subject matter.

14
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,770
So in this lecture, what I'd like to do is just talk very generally about

15
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,010
avoiding jargon, some ideas for maybe performing your knowledge in an

16
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,170
exciting way, and then some ideas for performing your enthusiasm on that

17
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,680
topic, so really sort of being a dynamic performer of

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,460
your informative speeches.

19
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,500
So we'll do that in this one.

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,955
And then in the next lecture, we'll take a look at a specific case study,

21
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:01,180
a specific speaker.

22
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,780
So to begin with, I certainly think you want to avoid jargon in most of

23
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,220
your informative speaking.

24
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,890
If your audience is made up primarily of newcomers to this information,

25
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,110
they're not as familiar with it, simply speaking in jargon isn't going

26
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,500
to be tremendously clear for them.

27
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,590
So you want to make sure that you're using language that is accessible,

28
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,190
that's accessible for your audience, and that makes sense for your topic.

29
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,650
Now, how do you avoid jargon?

30
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,740
Well, if you're an expert, you've been using jargon so much

31
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,890
it's no longer jargon.

32
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,070
It's just the terms you use for understanding that.

33
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,960
Well, I do think the iterative approach that we talked about way back

34
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:45,230
in Week 4, performing your speech, revising it, reflecting on it, that's

35
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:49,750
a way of hunting down, tracking down those episodes of jargon that maybe

36
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,750
you didn't notice on one pass or through another pass.

37
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,020
If you're just performing it multiple times, you're hearing yourself deliver

38
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,940
it and you can identify where jargon is being used.

39
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,330
Now not all jargon is bad.

40
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,550
Sometimes jargon's very necessary.

41
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,750
There might be no other term for what you're talking about.

42
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,460
If you're going to use jargon, make sure you define.

43
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:14,730
Make sure you explain it, not just enough for you, but for someone who is

44
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,970
unfamiliar with that subject matter.

45
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:22,600
One of the key things on being able to cultivate a good informative ethos is

46
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,610
being understood.

47
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,760
One way you're understood well is to avoid jargon.

48
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,640
So now let's shift to, well, what are some things to do in order to perform

49
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,580
your knowledge?

50
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,420
And by the way here, I'm not saying fake knowledge.

51
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,660
I'm not saying lie.

52
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,970
I'm saying, you know stuff.

53
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,920
And knowing stuff in and of itself is insufficient.

54
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,970
Knowing stuff is insufficient to add to your ethos.

55
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,005
We as audience members have to see that knowledge, have to feel that you

56
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:57,980
know what you're talking about.

57
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,720
So the issue here is taking your interest and making sure that we truly

58
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,780
identify with it, and that we understand that there's true knowledge

59
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,280
backing it up.

60
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,820
Well, I think one thing you want to be thinking about in terms of how you can

61
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,860
perform your knowledge, how we can see that you are an expert or you know

62
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,720
what you're talking about, is having mastery of the topic enough that you

63
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,822
can explain it to us the audience in a number of different ways, that you

64
00:03:24,822 --> 00:03:29,200
know the topic so well that you can explain it through a

65
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,850
story, through an analogy.

66
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,020
You've got a couple of examples you can walk us through.

67
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,560
You've got a sample illustration, that you've got multiple tools for

68
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,380
explaining the same idea.

69
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:44,010
If you can only explain it in one way and let's say we don't get that one

70
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,450
way, then we're all kind of high and dry, right?

71
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,500
You can't speak on this in any other way.

72
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,855
We can't understand it in any other way.

73
00:03:51,855 --> 00:03:53,750
And we see this a lot in teaching.

74
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,180
One thing that we know works in teaching is having a teacher who can

75
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,430
provide lots of illustrations and different examples and different ways

76
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,340
and opportunities for people to come to that content.

77
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,970
So that's what you want to be thinking about.

78
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,520
What are the myriad ways that you can explain an idea?

79
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,940
So if that's performing knowledge, how do you perform your enthusiasm?

80
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,560
Well, here it's a delicate balance, right?

81
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,579
I'm not saying act, because it could be over the top and it could come

82
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,950
across as cheesy.

83
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:28,980
Years ago when I used to coach competitive speech , there was an

84
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,730
event, informative speaking.

85
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,020
And a lot of those speeches were usually pretty cheesy, because it was

86
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,570
18-year-olds trying to be experts on topics that they weren't experts on.

87
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,460
And so their enthusiasm was--

88
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,830
this is just an amazing new technology that we will all

89
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,890
benefit from in the future.

90
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:52,500
And it was just like every single time pulling teeth, because it felt fake.

91
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,450
It felt plastic.

92
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,700
It fell phony.

93
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,110
So I don't want that.

94
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,290
But we also want to make sure that you're actually telegraphing that

95
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,350
enthusiasm.

96
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,200
So what does this mean?

97
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,320
You're being you, but it's you at 110%.

98
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,600
It's you on 11, right?

99
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,910
That's what we're doing when we're performing our enthusiasm.

100
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:17,090
And over time, you just begin to develop this sense of persona, having

101
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,640
a speakerly persona.

102
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,290
That persona is someone who's really more enthusiastic.

103
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:26,150
So I've got to admit, when I'm certainly in front of a live audience

104
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:30,200
and increasingly as I'm in front of a camera, I'm doing my teacherly

105
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,170
performance.

106
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,430
So when I'm talking about something, I can get excited about it.

107
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,980
And I can be excited about having a steak at home, but it's not sitting

108
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,060
down to the table and being like, this is a great steak.

109
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,090
Oh, man.

110
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,980
We are going to have a wonderful dinner tonight.

111
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,640
Is everybody ready for this?

112
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,600
Let's dig in.

113
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,970
Oh, it is done to perfection.

114
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,120
And what's really--

115
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,720
That's not me at home, man.

116
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,220
It's like, oh, this is a good steak.

117
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,920
Yes, it is quite delightful.

118
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,000
I like the glaze.

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,460
Excellent.

120
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,070
Actually, that's not even me at home.

121
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:03,090
I can't do me at home in a fake setting here.

122
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,910
But I know my speakerly performance, my persona.

123
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,090
And it's me, it's not not me.

124
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,290
This is what I'm like.

125
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:15,690
But it's me on 11, man, because if I was like this all the time, I would be

126
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,490
punched way more than I am.

127
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:23,830
So I want you to be thinking about finding your deep interest in that

128
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,510
subject and then just making sure that we can access it.

129
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,180
Another thing in terms of performing your enthusiasm, and we're going to

130
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,940
see this here in this upcoming clip, is I think it's good to be funny.

131
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,020
Now, don't worry too much about jokes.

132
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,560
Simply be funny.

133
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,540
Now, that's easier said than done.

134
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,280
But again, the threshold for funny in speeches is stupid low.

135
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,700
You can trip on it.

136
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,230
Often audiences award merely the effort.

137
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,010
Oh, he tried to be funny in a stupid way.

138
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:55,900
Hooray.

139
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,940
Good on you, bald man.

140
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,350
So the goal is just to demonstrate that you're comfortable in front of

141
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,380
that audience.

142
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,370
And again, I'll say this as a general principle.

143
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,680
And we'll work through it more specifically after we watch this Neil

144
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,200
deGrasse Tyson clip.

145
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,940
So what are some other just small things?

146
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,290
Well, certainly probably maybe bigger gestures.

147
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,410
Certainly smiling a little bit more.

148
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:21,860
I think also you can plan in a vocabulary of interest.

149
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,070
And when I'm teaching and I'm talking about something that I'm genuinely

150
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:29,560
interested in, but I know sometimes students aren't as enthusiastic about,

151
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,940
I know I'll loop in more sentences like, this is just fascinating stuff.

152
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,880
And taken by itself, I'm basically begging.

153
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,510
Please find this fascinating.

154
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:43,890
But as you're performing it, you can loop in this vocabulary of interest,

155
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,750
what is fascinating about this subject, or the thing that

156
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,210
excites me is blank.

157
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,340
When you're working through this--

158
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:57,290
I don't know if you guys see this, but it my blows my mind that this happens.

159
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:01,560
So again, I'm not asking you to lie, but I'm thinking make very specific

160
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,850
vocabulary stylistic choices.

161
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,950
If you think something's fascinating, tell us you think it's fascinating.

162
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,410
You probably don't lose much in that transaction.

163
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,180
Another thing you might want to think in terms of performing your

164
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:19,760
enthusiasm, performing your interest in the topic is planning on points of

165
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,540
intensity and pauses.

166
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,540
Again, I'll set that up as a general idea.

167
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,240
We'll work through it specifically through Neil deGrasse Tyson.

168
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,880
But being able to get really excited about something but then

169
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,980
telescope back out.

170
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,539
Pause.

171
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:41,020
That was just really surprising that that result occurred.

172
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,130
As a sample.

173
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:47,170
So you're working in pauses as a way of hooking in the audience interest,

174
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,090
of directing our attention to something that's going to be

175
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:53,770
important, a key line or a key idea.

176
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,490
Finally, just find models.

177
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,800
And you can find models in multiple places.

178
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,540
So one thing you might want to be thinking about is, what do you sound

179
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,420
like when you're generally excited and interested?

180
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,770
Think to those episodes.

181
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,480
What did you sound like?

182
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,010
Then, just copy yourself, imitate your best self.

183
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,640
What do you sound like when you're authentically interested in something?

184
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,250
Now make sure you sound like that authentically

185
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,830
interested in your speech.

186
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,230
So you're imitating yourself.

187
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,630
Also, you can look to external models.

188
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:32,800
Once again, who are some speakers that you find just enthralling?

189
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,440
And what are they doing?

190
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,680
And can you do something similar?

191
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:44,010
So way back in Week 3, I included a clip from a commencement speaker at

192
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:51,740
the University of Richmond, absolutely outstanding model of engagement and

193
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,260
excitement.

194
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,850
I would love to have his sense of intensity.

195
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:01,520
He was very soft-spoken, but the energy in his voice, not the volume,

196
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,890
but the energy in his voice was electrifying.

197
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:10,310
And that's a model to watch and listen to and think about as I'm trying to

198
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:16,150
make sure that audiences understand my genuine passion on this subject.

199
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:20,940
So now that we've sort of talked very broadly about ethos in general and

200
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,450
broadly about informative ethos, I want to move through a

201
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,740
specific case study.

202
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,570
We're going to be watching Neil deGrasse Tyson, who's currently the

203
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:33,880
Director of the Hayden Planetarium and sort of all-around science guy.

204
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,650
He's become very popular as of late for being a science popularizer and

205
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:43,580
just being able to explain ideas, scientific ideas,

206
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,560
astrophysics to lay audiences.

207
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:54,060
So I want you to take a look at this clip and analyze what Tyson is doing.

208
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,910
And it's really just a short Q&A session.

209
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,950
So this is much more impromptu.

210
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,720
But he's informing his audience about this.

211
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,230
But I want you to watch it for a model of ethos.

212
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,710
And watch it and say, well, what is he doing that helps you sort of trust him

213
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,360
as a speaker that you are able to trust his knowledge on this?

214
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,710
But also, what is he doing that conveys his sense of excitement?

215
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,390
And analyze this as a performance.

216
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,740
I have no doubt he genuinely feels this way.

217
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,940
But I can't imitate his emotion.

218
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,200
I'm not him.

219
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,550
But I can look at and imitate and study what he does.

220
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,300
And so that's what I want you to do, is watch this clip for

221
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,320
his informative ethos.

222
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,570
