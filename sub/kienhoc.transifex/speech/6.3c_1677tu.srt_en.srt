00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,890
MATT MCGARRITY: I find that clip fascinating.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,370
I've watched it a ton of times.

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,510
And I'm always intrigued by what's going on there.

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,810
So by way of analysis, I'd like to move through three distinct phases.

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:16,140
First off, I just want to summarize both Clinton and Bush's response.

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,900
Then I want to talk to how Clinton's response differs from Bush, what

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,650
Clinton is doing specifically.

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,030
And then finally, I want to return to those three aspects of ethos,

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,142
phronesis, arete, and eunoia.

10
00:00:29,142 --> 00:00:32,180
So let's begin by sort of moving through Bush's

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,830
response to that question.

12
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:39,530
So he starts off sort of very broadly, very generally in response to this

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,230
question, which is not tremendously well-phrased.

14
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,170
In fact, the questioner tries to sort of clarify it a little bit.

15
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,080
But Bush starts off very generally in response to that question.

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,890
But then he gets interrupted.

17
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,840
That didn't shake out well.

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,120
And then he tries to get the question reframed.

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,480
And I think we can debate whether or not that's a fair

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,050
question that was asked.

21
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,040
Nevertheless.

22
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,000
it was asked.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,830
And it was a national forum and this was a presidential debate.

24
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,980
So those are the pieces that you've got to work with on the chessboard.

25
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,550
And so once that question's out there, I think it needs to be responded to.

26
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,890
And in essence that question is a question about ethos.

27
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,000
It's about expertise.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,570
But it's about empathy.

29
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,380
That's really what that question was trying to get at, was you should be

30
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,210
able to feel my financial pain if you're going to make policies that

31
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,880
affect my financial pain.

32
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,170
That's kind of what that heart of the question was.

33
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,570
But Bush tries to respond to that empathy issue.

34
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,990
But the way in which he responds to it, he finally finds something he can

35
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,850
use for this.

36
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,390
You can sort of feel a back and forth between-- the questioner gets a bit

37
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,970
hostile, not overtly, not name-callingly, but you can hear some

38
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:53,300
hostility in the interchange between President Bush and the questioner.

39
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,710
But then he sort of finds something that he can use to respond to this

40
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,820
issue of empathy.

41
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:03,230
Unfortunately, that response is not personally felt, but I went to a

42
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,890
church and I read about poor people.

43
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,900
That probably isn't exactly what you were hoping for.

44
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,039
How do you understand me?

45
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:13,410
Well, I read about everyone who doesn't have money.

46
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,340
So that probably from an invention standpoint wasn't the

47
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,850
best example to use.

48
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,450
But it all affects the ethos and how he talks through it.

49
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,410
So he's trying to make that point about caring about people who

50
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,240
experience debt.

51
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,650
But it's not about him experiencing debt.

52
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,470
And the whole thing feels hostile overall.

53
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,090
Now, Bush really got the short end of the stick on that one.

54
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,600
I mean, he had to go first in response to that question.

55
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,810
He was the incumbent.

56
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,280
He was the sitting president.

57
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,680
And he was known as being wealthy before he entered office.

58
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,990
Nevertheless, it wasn't a good answer for him.

59
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,090
But I think you can say, is it something that--

60
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:58,250
what was being pushed was can you understand my financial pain if you

61
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,100
have not experienced financial pain?

62
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,340
The dude's president, right?

63
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,070
He's not sitting around the Oval Office at his desk trying to figure

64
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,060
out how they're going to squeeze more money into the

65
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,370
Funyuns budget that week.

66
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,690
The dude's president.

67
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,850
And he was wealthy beforehand.

68
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:15,210
So that's not how it has to be responded to, is

69
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,720
saying I've been poor.

70
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,070
So he has a real challenge in front of him.

71
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:25,680
Nevertheless, that response does not grant him much ethos in that moment

72
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,320
for that questioner or on that issue.

73
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,100
Now flip to Clinton.

74
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,320
Certainly he's got more time.

75
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,040
He can plot his strategy here.

76
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,420
And he starts off by once again going back to that questioner, saying, tell

77
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,360
me your narrative.

78
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,940
Tell me how you experience this.

79
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,090
And then he responds by saying, here's how I have felt it.

80
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,690
It's a question about empathy .

81
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,090
He makes the answer about emotion and empathy.

82
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,710
So there's a one-to-one relationship there.

83
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,030
So he says, here's how I felt it.

84
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,350
We'll, I've been the governor of a small state.

85
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,020
OK.

86
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,700
That sounds good.

87
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,520
If you think about it, though, it's like, oh, yes.

88
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,700
You do understand my inability to pay off my car, because you've been a

89
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,040
governor of a small state.

90
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,310
Sure, you're no New York.

91
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,890
You get made fun of on the playground.

92
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,160
No.

93
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,030
But nevertheless, he says I've been governor of a small state, so here's

94
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,320
what I have seen.

95
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,280
I have known people who've lost their jobs.

96
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,510
I've known people who've had to close their factories.

97
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,920
I've known people just like you.

98
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,570
I've talked to people just like you.

99
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,910
So there's a lot of personal stuff in there, a lot of personal narrative and

100
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,060
bringing it down to the individual.

101
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,550
So he makes it about the personal.

102
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,450
He makes it about empathy.

103
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,050
He's the sort of affirming the questioner's sense of

104
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,630
pain or sense of loss.

105
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:42,950
And he's talking about his personal interaction with the debt, with the

106
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,890
financial issues at stake.

107
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,510
But that's not all he does, right?

108
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,460
So he makes that point.

109
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,550
And then he pivots.

110
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,300
And he starts talking about policy.

111
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,600
Then he starts rattling off facts and statistics, lack of investment, low

112
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,790
wages, no private sector job growth, so on and so forth.

113
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:02,830
So we've got both components going on in his answer maybe that weren't going

114
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,520
on in Bush's answer.

115
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,950
And then he finishes with a real nice capper.

116
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,000
So he's sort of planned that time very well.

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,630
He ends by capping off the point by saying what he would do.

118
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,780
I'm going to invest in jobs and education, health care,

119
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,750
so on and so forth.

120
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,790
So he's got a nice sort of positive end to that.

121
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,560
He talks about what he will do at the end of that point.

122
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,080
So those are sort of a side-by-side flow of their response to that.

123
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,550
So what's really different about Clinton's response?

124
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,350
Well, first off, there's a lot different in terms of invention.

125
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,570
He's talking about personal narrative.

126
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,980
He's acknowledging the questioner.

127
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,580
So the content of his response is just flat out different.

128
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,810
The style is certainly one that cultivates a different ethos.

129
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:51,710
He's highlighting the commonality, the common experiences between he himself

130
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,940
and that questioner.

131
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,970
You have known people who have lost their jobs.

132
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,260
I've known people who have lost their jobs.

133
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,310
You've felt some real struggle with this.

134
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,010
I too have had to struggle with this.

135
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,650
So he's really highlighting commonality there.

136
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,420
That's not by accident.

137
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,750
Those are specific vocabulary choices that are highlighting that

138
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,850
commonality.

139
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:15,220
And then in terms of delivery, he closes that physical space.

140
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,790
There's much more what we would call immediacy there.

141
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,490
He's right in front of that questioner, talking to them.

142
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,670
Certainly, his tone, just the very tone of his voice is softer than we

143
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,540
heard in Bush.

144
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,820
Part of that's a matter of accent, right?

145
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,840
But some of it is also affecting how his ethos is

146
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,780
experienced in that moment.

147
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,300
So then finally, how does this map on top of ethos?

148
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,950
First off, phronesis.

149
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,120
Does he come across as knowledgeable?

150
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,070
Does Clinton come across as knowledgeable in that instance?

151
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,190
Most certainly.

152
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,250
Not in the first half, but when he shifts to his discussion of policy, he

153
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,950
is rattling off statistics and figures.

154
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,720
Those are right there at the front of his brain.

155
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,750
You have a strong sense that he understands those issues.

156
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,030
You might disagree with him on his interpretation.

157
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,820
But he knows his facts and figures.

158
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,610
Second, arete.

159
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,240
Is he dynamic?

160
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,920
Yeah.

161
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,640
I think so.

162
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,570
And this is when he was running for president, so this is years before all

163
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:15,640
the Saturday Night Live sketches about Clinton come out, and I feel your

164
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,920
pain, and all those sort of caricatures.

165
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,910
But is he dynamic in that moment for that audience?

166
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,980
I would say yes.

167
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,720
He's very focused.

168
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,680
He's very focused.

169
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,190
But he appears calm.

170
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,920
There's not any of that hostility that Bush had in his answer.

171
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,760
Also, it's a question that is not friendly towards the incumbent.

172
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,010
So he benefits from that.

173
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,280
Clinton benefits from that.

174
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,360
But he's focused.

175
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,460
But he appears calm.

176
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,880
He's clearly invested in the subject matter.

177
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,910
But he's empathetic.

178
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:50,210
He's trying to demonstrate that he at least understands the emotional

179
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,600
hardship that comes with financial troubles.

180
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,780
And is there a question of goodwill?

181
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,070
Is goodwill on display, eunoia?

182
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,540
Yeah.

183
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,840
Well, certainly he's--

184
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,170
again, the caricature of Clinton is I feel your pain.

185
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,880
But here he's performing that.

186
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,470
He's demonstrating his empathy of someone else's pain.

187
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,610
But not only that in terms of goodwill.

188
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:17,340
He also ends the point by talking about its remedy, what he would do as

189
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,230
president to make sure others don't feel that exact same type

190
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,860
of emotional hardship.

191
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:29,150
So this is an opportunity to think about ethos, think about credibility

192
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:34,490
in a very specific context and look at contrasting versions of ethos in

193
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,409
response to the same question.

194
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:41,030
So in exploring this, I don't care if you like either one of these

195
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,870
candidates or not.

196
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,470
That's not the issue here.

197
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,950
But what I do think you want to be doing is looking at this clip as an

198
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,700
opportunity to understand ethos.

199
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,960
It can be very instructive in that regard, so looking at it and trying to

200
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,490
crack it open, see the moving parts there, and see how

201
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,940
ethos is being performed.

202
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,330
And then determine which one you like better and which one you can learn

203
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,740
from more so that you can improve your own ethos.

204
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:13,450
So this is an opportunity, this video was trying to understand ethos in sort

205
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,300
of its broadest terms, overall credibility.

206
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,840
But we're talking about this within the context of an informative speech.

207
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,750
So what we're going to do in the next video lecture is start

208
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,600
talking about that.

209
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,460
Now that we've talked about ethos in general, how can we talk about

210
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,710
informative ethos?

211
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,840
