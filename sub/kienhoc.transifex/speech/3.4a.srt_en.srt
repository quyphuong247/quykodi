00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,460
MATT MCGARRITY: So I'd like to start this discussion of public speak

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,050
apprehension with a story.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,970
And I get this story from a colleague who unfortunately is no longer with

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:11,740
us, [? Richard Dulcat. ?]

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,190
And he taught public speaking at a university.

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,790
And he was talking about some of the things he's dealt with with

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,240
communication apprehension.

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,160
And so he was teaching a public speaking class-- alive, in-person

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,490
public speaking class.

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:30,560
And this particular class was, he was scheduled in a piano recital room.

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,600
So he goes there first day of class.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,880
They're going to be doing an introductory speech.

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,490
And since it's a recital room, there are chairs, but there's also a stage.

14
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,730
So he had the speakers go up and stand up on the stage.

15
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,550
And there was a piano up on the stage.

16
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:48,600
And so for the most part, he had what we call traditional-age students--

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,890
18 to 22 year olds.

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,380
But there was a woman in his class who had returned to university after a

19
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,520
number of years in the workforce.

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,060
So she had you know, not a full lifetime of experience, but a lot of

21
00:00:59,060 --> 00:00:59,890
experience.

22
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,170
Anyway so they were just doing this basic, introductory speech assignment.

23
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,600
Just come up, tell us a little bit about yourself.

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,440
This woman, it's her turn.

25
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,820
So she goes up on stage.

26
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,270
And she starts to do her introductory speech.

27
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,090
And then just boom, gone--

28
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,660
just freezes up.

29
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,750
Lights on, nobody home.

30
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,250
And so this is kind of, this sometimes happens first day of

31
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,440
public speaking classes.

32
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,520
But you know, the teacher's like come on, just continue where you left off,

33
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,820
and doing all that sort of stuff.

34
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,080
Not happening.

35
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,350
And it's getting worse.

36
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,480
So she goes--

37
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,960
the cold sweats have broken out.

38
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,200
[? She ?] starts trembling.

39
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,230
And so then this woman crawled under-- this is not a joke-- this woman

40
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,170
crawled under the piano on the stage.

41
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,470
Whole class is there.

42
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,650
She's underneath the piano on the stage.

43
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,390
So [? Richard Dulcat's ?]

44
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,650
like what--

45
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,330
what do I?

46
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,170
You don't have that type of scenario happen.

47
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,770
So he goes up on the stage.

48
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,060
And he's like could you maybe, could you come out.

49
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,240
He was trying to tempt her out-- little bread crumbs on the ground.

50
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:01,600
Nothing.

51
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,540
Nothing's working.

52
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,010
She is catatonic as a result of nerves.

53
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,670
So he excuses the class.

54
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,240
All the students go home for the day.

55
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,120
And it's just him and this woman in the room-- piano recital room.

56
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,210
She's under the piano.

57
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,460
He's trying to get her to come out.

58
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,260
Nothing.

59
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,485
So he finally is like, the best thing he can think of to do is he goes, and

60
00:02:19,485 --> 00:02:21,570
he turns out the lights, and he leaves the room.

61
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,870
And then she never came back.

62
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,000
I, mean that's a given.

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,030
She never came back.

64
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,030
And that story is awful.

65
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,840
That is horrible--

66
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,820
and a little funny-- but mostly awful.

67
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,790
And what's tragic about it is, it doesn't have to happen.

68
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,840
Every single person has some type of apprehension about public speaking.

69
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,760
And it's totally natural.

70
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,190
Public speaking is-- we're the only animals that do this, right?

71
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,560
So you don't see dogs out there, you know, gathered.

72
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,590
There's five dogs, and one standing up.

73
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,970
And guys before we play poker, we got to talk about the cat situation.

74
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,730
I got one at my house.

75
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,250
Larry's got one at his house.

76
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,000
This is bad.

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,730
You don't see that.

78
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,070
We're the only animals that do this.

79
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,870
And so it's entirely natural that we are apprehensive about some type of

80
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,630
face-threatening act like this.

81
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:16,300
So what I want to be doing today is talking about what causes public speak

82
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,310
apprehension, and some of the techniques that you can use to

83
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,750
negotiate this feeling of apprehension, or to channel it in

84
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,960
positive ways.

85
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,550
Let me say at the outset, I don't know who started the whole picture your

86
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,390
audience in their underwear.

87
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,970
I once had somebody call me, and he was writing a book on public speaking.

88
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,880
And he had questions for me about, well, do you know where this started?

89
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,980
You know, how to [INAUDIBLE].

90
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,860
I have no idea.

91
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,270
I think it's a great thing to track down.

92
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,910
There's no other fearful scenario in which we suggest that.

93
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,650
I'm terrified of bears.

94
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,880
Have you pictured one in a thong?

95
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,460
Yes.

96
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,590
Now I'm terrified and slightly aroused.

97
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,820
So I mean, we don't do that with other stuff.

98
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,010
So why would we do that with public speaking?

99
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:58,660
All right.

100
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,210
But I do want to talk about what is this thing?

101
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,540
If we're going to deal with it, we got to figure out what it is.

102
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,560
So I want to talk about what public speaking apprehension is, sort of how

103
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,590
it manifests, and then what some prevention techniques are.

104
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,090
So to begin with, what is public speaking apprehension?

105
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,540
Well, there are large--

106
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,500
you know, some people have general communication apprehension, sort of

107
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,870
social nervousness.

108
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,750
But we're talking specifically about the apprehension that's associated

109
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,480
with standing up to deliver a presentation.

110
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,880
Well, we can distinguish between trait and state.

111
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,830
So we could say that some people have the trait.

112
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,530
Some people experience more public speaking apprehension than others.

113
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,080
But then also state--

114
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,960
maybe experiencing more public speaking apprehension in particular

115
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,500
situations.

116
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,870
So we can think about, are you more apprehensive the pre-speech, or

117
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,340
confrontation, that first minute of public speaking or adaptation, after

118
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,000
you've been going for a while; or post-speech, after you've finished.

119
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,670
But so we want to be thinking about is it general apprehensiveness?

120
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,540
And is their apprehensive rooted in certain types of situations?

121
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,520
And then types of public speaking apprehension.

122
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,650
Well, there's physiological--

123
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:13,010
so sweaty, sweaty palms, faster heart rate, increased blood pressure-- these

124
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:13,980
sorts of things.

125
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,740
There's cognition--

126
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:21,600
sort of how we're labeling that inner voice, what we're telling the story

127
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,300
about ourselves--

128
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,490
oh, I'm bombing.

129
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,330
As well as just sort of cognitive impacts, like if you're really nervous

130
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,960
maybe, there's going to be slower processing.

131
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,270
You're not doing stuff or thinking as quickly as you might otherwise.

132
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,040
And then we can talk about behavioral--

133
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,480
things that you're performing when you perform your nervousness--

134
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,090
trembling, things that audiences can see and interpret.

135
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:49,580
Although of course, typically we feel apprehensive than audiences see.

136
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,840
So they don't see inside our head.

137
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,440
So they don't know that we're saying to ourselves that we're nervous.

138
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,130
And more often than not, we're talking about all these factors happening

139
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,160
simultaneously.

140
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,760
So it's not like public speaking is one thing that can be

141
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,260
eliminated by one thing.

142
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,320
It's situational.

143
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,750
It's contextual, based on sort of how you've developed.

144
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,150
So how do we get this type of public speaking apprehension?

145
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,450
Well, certainly if you've had lots of bad experiences, you're probably going

146
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,320
to be a bit more apprehensive.

147
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,440
Maybe you're just generally apprehensive about social situations.

148
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,170
But there's lots of reasons why we would become apprehensive

149
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,370
about public speaking.

150
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,110
And also certain, again as I mentioned, states.

151
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,330
Certain aspects of situations may make us more apprehensive.

152
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,550
Typically these would be sort of the novelty of the speaking situation, so

153
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,720
it's just something you're not familiar with, the formality of the

154
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,800
speaking situation, and the degree of evaluation.

155
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,460
By the way, one of the advantages of taking a MOOC on this is because

156
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,410
generally what we see is where degree of evaluation goes up, so does

157
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,380
apprehensiveness.

158
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,230
So formal classes where you're getting a grade tend to, across the broad

159
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,690
spectrum, increase apprehensive more than something like when you're

160
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,740
practicing at home.

161
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,520
But of course, then you've got to make sure that your practicing well enough

162
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,320
that it's going to be beneficial to you in the development of your skill.

163
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,840
So all of these come to bear.

164
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,850
So in terms of formality, I feel very comfortable doing

165
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,220
speeches to huge audiences.

166
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,650
No problem.

167
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:26,350
10 students, 100 students, 1,000 students or audience members, I love

168
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,080
big audiences.

169
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,570
So that's not what gets it for me.

170
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:34,000
But formality and novelty of speaking situation, I can still get

171
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,880
apprehensive.

172
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,920
So for example, I'm here at the communication department.

173
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:43,300
At the end of each year, we graduate just a ton of communication majors.

174
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,360
And we have our own graduation ceremony.

175
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,730
At that ceremony, I have to read people's names.

176
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,680
And I dread this all year.

177
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,580
Because formality is huge.

178
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,280
I'm up there in my formal robes.

179
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,630
And degree of evaluation is massive.

180
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:03,810
I don't want to screw up someone's name when their family's there.

181
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:07,440
Nothing would be worse than getting your degree and have the person, the

182
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,580
professor you like, mangle your name, and just perform for everyone that

183
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,580
they don't know who you are.

184
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,810
And that's not the case, but in many cases I don't know peoples last name.

185
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,290
So that is a situation where I feel significantly more apprehension that I

186
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,660
do in other situations.

187
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,420
So all of this is to say, there are so many factors going on, and all of

188
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,820
these are entirely natural.

189
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,409
Now, what you want to know is, how do we negotiate it?

190
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,440
How do we eliminate it?

191
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,350
And the answer is, well we probably don't eliminate it.

192
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,240
And in some ways, that's a good thing.

193
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,720
Because if there's a physiological response, advanced heart rate, it's a

194
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,910
question of how we're cognitively labeling that.

195
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,240
Do I label that as oh, I'm terrified, or oh, I'm excited.

196
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,210
This is going to be awesome.

197
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,890
So some of that nervousness can actually be channeled

198
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,210
towards good ends.

199
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:01,420
So what are some of these techniques for negotiating communication

200
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:01,900
apprehension?

201
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,740
Well, first off, just becoming used to speaking situations, and a wide

202
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,970
variety of speaking situations.

203
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:14,270
This is part of in the public speaking literature they typically talk up out

204
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:18,670
systematic desensitization, cognitive modification, and skills training.

205
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:22,310
This figures in under systematic desensitization.

206
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:27,950
So basically just getting familiar with a wide range of speaking

207
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:32,640
situations so that you are desensitized to the apprehensiveness

208
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,290
you would feel in that situation.

209
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:39,220
Certainly also there are relaxation methods that can help you become

210
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,350
desensitized to the apprehension of a particular situation.

211
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:47,060
Or one thing that they'll sometimes do is have you lay down and just picture

212
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,700
yourself in front of larger and larger audiences, with the idea that you're

213
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:58,210
trying to envision yourself in those scenarios, and just not automatically

214
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,290
feeling as apprehensive.

215
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,880
So becoming used to speaking situations.

216
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,990
Under a cognitive modification, it basically means changing how you think

217
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,420
about public speaking.

218
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:12,130
Now in last week's lectures, we talked about communication and performance

219
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,110
orientation.

220
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:17,270
This is one of the ways in which we are going to be doing this-- one of

221
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,590
the ways in which we're going to be changing the way you think about

222
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,500
public speaking--

223
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,910
is through this communication orientation.

224
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:27,510
Meaning, don't look at that public speaking situation as an overly formal

225
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,610
scenario where if you say one word wrong, you are wrong.

226
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,060
And you're bad, and maybe a little evil.

227
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,290
So we're not doing that.

228
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,850
We're thinking about how can we speak more conversational.

229
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,760
And this changes the approach to communication and to that public

230
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,640
speaking event.

231
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,090
You're just talking with the audience.

232
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,550
Another thing under cognitive modification, changing how you think

233
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,510
about public speaking, is just basic visualization.

234
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:55,430
So odds are the night before you do a speech, five minutes before you do a

235
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:00,300
speech, you're going to have a picture in your head of what it looks like.

236
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,240
You can either pictures yourself doing well, or poorly.

237
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,560
That model in your head can either be you to an audience acclaiming you,

238
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,400
saying thank you, thank you, you know what, you're the real heroes for

239
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,360
showing up here tonight.

240
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,790
You know.

241
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,840
It's not me.

242
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,000
So you can either picture that, or you can picture yourself getting very

243
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,010
nervous, sweating shaking.

244
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:25,500
Odds are, you're going to do better if you visualize yourself doing better.

245
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,450
So visualize yourself do doing well.

246
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,520
And then finally, skills training.

247
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,700
This is really where I put most of my efforts towards reducing public

248
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,990
speaking apprehension--

249
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,400
just getting better at the mechanics of putting together and

250
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,860
delivering a speech.

251
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,980
So I certainly believe in a mixture of all of these.

252
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,850
Think about how to become more familiar with public speaking

253
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,900
situations so they're not as odd, and different, and novel, and terrifying.

254
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,690
And that means unfortunately, doing more speeches.

255
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,280
There's no way around that.

256
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,700
The more you get used to it, the less apprehensive you'll be.

257
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,190
Certainly, I want you to be thinking from a communication orientation

258
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:10,840
that's going to help you change your thinking about delivering a speech--

259
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,510
as well as visualize yourself doing well.

260
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,700
But a lot of this class this is going to aim at skills training.

261
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,760
Here's how to put together a speech so that it's going to sound good.

262
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,010
