CAROLINE KENNEDY: I think really this is sort of a unique moment, both in

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,310
our country's history and in my own life.

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:16,059
And we are facing unbelievable challenges--

4
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,260
our economy, health care, people are losing their jobs here

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,990
in New York, obviously.

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,370
Particularly, families are hurting.

7
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,460
Education is tough.

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,570
And so, for me, I've grown up here.

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,920
I've lived here all my life.

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,170
I love New York.

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,130


12
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,130
And going into politics is something that people have

13
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,780
asked me about forever.

14
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,106
When I first just thought it in my own mind, people come up to me on the

15
00:00:48,106 --> 00:00:50,890
street, in the subway, just this morning walking

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,610
over here on the subway.

17
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,240
And they're like, go for it.

18
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,100
We're rooting for you.

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,610
Somebody dropped off 200 signs at my husband's office two weeks ago.

20
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,019
And so I thought, well, I really ought to take this seriously.

21
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,960
This is really an incredible opportunity.

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,480
And there are issues that I really care about that are

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,140
going to come up now.

24
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,110
I come into this thinking I'd have to work twice as hard as anybody else.

25
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:18,940
And nobody's entitled to anything, and certainly not me.

26
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:24,080
And there are many qualified people in this.

27
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,010
I am an unconventional choice.

28
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,100
I understand that.

29
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,960
I haven't pursued the traditional path.

30
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,460
But I think that in our public life today, we're starting to see that

31
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:39,130
there are many ways into public life in public service.

32
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:47,240
And all our institutions are less hierarchical than they used to be.

33
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:55,870
And so I think that I bring my life experience to this, and that includes

34
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,420
being a mother.

35
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,180
I understand those choices that women make.

36
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,440
It includes being a lawyer.

37
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,290
I've written seven bestselling books--

38
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:11,510
two on the Constitution, anthologies about American history and values,

39
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,845
political courage.

40
00:02:12,845 --> 00:02:16,290
And I've really tried to encourage people to go into public service.

41
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,540
