MATT MCGARRITY: Now that we're done talking about the impromptu speech I want to

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,670
begin our work on the informative speech with a bit of an overview.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:12,070
So why should we study informative speaking?

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,300
Well, certainly in the professional realm, most of the speeches and

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,280
presentations we give are informative in scope.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,960
So you can think here in terms of, say, a research scientist who needs to

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,630
explain her research findings, or a financial officer who needs a report

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,380
on quarterly earnings for his company's board.

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,950
Or a teacher.

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,030
Teaching is a lot of informative speaking.

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,610
But a teacher who needs to help students understand

12
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,050
differential calculus.

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,230
Or even in the commercial sector.

14
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:47,380
A technology professional who needs to educate her consumers about a new

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,800
product or a product's new features.

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,250
But in all of these cases you're explaining a concept, presenting new

17
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,940
information to an audience.

18
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,330
So that gets us into this realm of informative speaking.

19
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,100
So what I'd like to do in this overview is talk a little bit about

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,970
the assignment objectives, talk a little bit about the procedure of what

21
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,550
the assignment actually is, and then end by talking about how this speech

22
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,980
relates to the impromptu that we just finished with.

23
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:17,390
So I would say, if you haven't already, please do read the assignment

24
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,890
overview that's available on the class website.

25
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,780
I talk about the issues that I'm mentioning here in a bit more depth

26
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,480
and some hints on doing well in this particular assignment.

27
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,300
So remember, of course, that as we're approaching these speech assignments,

28
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,300
we're looking at them primarily as buckets for skills.

29
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,210
So I want to talk about the skill objectives that we're going to be

30
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,350
working on over the next couple of weeks.

31
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:43,300
And these skill objectives apply if you record and upload a speech for

32
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,150
this class.

33
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,660
But they're also skills that you want to be able to refine for any type of

34
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,310
informative speaking situation, whether you do that inside this class

35
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,000
or outside of this class.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,950
So what are some of the assignment objectives?

37
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,690
Well, by the end of this speech, the informative speech, students should be

38
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:04,620
able to respond appropriately to audience topic and time constraints.

39
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,199
So here, we're trying to figure out well, what do you need to say for a

40
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,280
specific audience?

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,520
And what can you say on a topic given the time that you have?

42
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,870
So we're going to think about how to find that balance.

43
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,690
You should be able to design appropriate informative speech goals.

44
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,490
So here we're thinking strategically about what the audience should be able

45
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,970
to take away from the presentation.

46
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,290
We're thinking about how you should be able to explain complex topics and

47
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,260
evidence appropriately and effectively for an audience.

48
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,480
So in informative speaking, your job is to translate complex ideas into an

49
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,880
accessible language.

50
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,040
And this often requires a judgment on your part.

51
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,480
You should be able to arrange a speech in a clear and logical manner using

52
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,000
performance to highlight this clarity.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,400
So you've got to think about how you're going to walk people through

54
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,750
the information in a way that's easy for them to follow along with.

55
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,870
You should be able to extemporize your speech in a manner that adds to your

56
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,200
ethos and engages the audience.

57
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,550
And so here, extemporizing is in many ways the same as

58
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,780
it was in the impromptu.

59
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,990
But now we get into this performative category of ethos.

60
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,750
And so in ethos we're thinking about, how are you performing your expertise

61
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,232
on the topic?

62
00:03:21,232 --> 00:03:24,670
In general, you should know in informative speaking what you're

63
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,650
talking about.

64
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,140
But when we start thinking about ethos, we're thinking about, how can

65
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,070
you look like you know what you're talking about?

66
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,690
You should.

67
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,230
I'm not saying you shouldn't know what you're talking about.

68
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,980
I'm saying that is a necessary condition, but an insufficient

69
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,690
condition for being a really good informative speaker.

70
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,390
You should know what you're talking about.

71
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:48,150
And then you should also be able to perform that knowledge so that we know

72
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,060
that you know what you're talking about.

73
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,970
So at the end of the speech, you should be able to use delivery to

74
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,340
distinguish between key ideas and elaborating detail.

75
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,700
So in explaining your content, your burden as a speaker is to help the

76
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:07,060
audience distinguish between big ideas and their supporting details.

77
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,410
At the end of this speech, you should be able to speak confidently with

78
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,430
appropriate rate, projection, movement, and vocal variety.

79
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,540
So this is the same as it was in the impromptu, but now we can discuss

80
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,200
these ideas in greater depth.

81
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,430
So those are the objectives.

82
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,920
Those are the skills I want you to be thinking about and working on in this

83
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,830
informative speech.

84
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,790
The speech assignment itself should be a five to 10 minute speech.

85
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,470
And what you're doing is informing or educating the audience about a topic.

86
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:38,240
And as always, the goal in this assignment is to carve out of space

87
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,680
for you to work on a speech for this class that equips you with models and

88
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,660
skills for speeches outside of this class.

89
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,480
And we'll take those up later this week.

90
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,130
But for now, let's talk a little bit about how this assignment differs from

91
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,980
the impromptu that we just finished.

92
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,220
So overall, the impromptu was about mastering a few basic techniques,

93
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,590
feeling the relationship between evidence and claim.

94
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,720
But many of the issues, speech issues in the impromptu were kind of kept off

95
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,560
your plate.

96
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,520
So invention, I gave you topics.

97
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,180
You could pick your own, but you had these topics.

98
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,530
You know what you were talking about.

99
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,660
Arrangement.

100
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,910
Everyone kind of had pretty much a two point speech.

101
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,660
So that arrangement was taken care of.

102
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,630
Delivery?

103
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,070
Well, here the focus was on performing the relationship

104
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,080
between claim and evidence.

105
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,420
So now as we move into the informative speech, you need to start exercising

106
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,390
more critical speech judgment.

107
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:36,690
So in terms of invention, you're going to need to find a topic and then dial

108
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,890
it in to your audience and the time constraints.

109
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:44,750
And not only that, you need to judge what key points need to be addressed

110
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,740
given the topic, time, and audience.

111
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,020
Terms of arrangement.

112
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,550
You need to identify a logical pattern of organizing this content.

113
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,660
In terms of style, you're walking us through a new concept.

114
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,700
You're informing us.

115
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,540
So you need to avoid jargon, or at least define jargon if

116
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,410
you're using it.

117
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:06,270
But then also thinking about how you're using metaphors or examples to

118
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,270
help clarify the topic for us.

119
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,810
Memory.

120
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,590
Well, this is a longer speech.

121
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,030
And certainly you should outline it and practice it so that when it comes

122
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:19,780
time to perform it, you don't actually have to heavily rely on those notes.

123
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,260
And then we get into the final category of delivery.

124
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:27,010
And given all the complexity that's going on in this informative speech,

125
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,770
you need to be able to deliver the speech smoothly.

126
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:34,210
So I want you to think about how you're balancing your credibility on

127
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,710
this topic while at the same time being able to perform your interest,

128
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,300
your investment in this topic.

129
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,620
So what I like about the informative speech is it allows us to focus on

130
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,660
this key skill of being able to balance explanation with evidence.

131
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,490
And this is often missing in a lot of the presentations I see and people

132
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,230
that I work with.

133
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:58,500
So if I'm working with a scientist, usually the problem there is they

134
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,590
wander off and they discuss solely the research finding or the specific

135
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,860
aspect of evidence without providing that larger sense of what those

136
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,900
research findings mean, without providing that context.

137
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,640
Business leaders often will have the opposite problem.

138
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,040
They'll only talk about the large ideas without necessarily

139
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,500
demonstrating them through statistics, examples, and narratives.

140
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,950
And this balancing act between explanation and

141
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,260
evidence is a fine art.

142
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,960
But when accomplished, it really elevates the

143
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,500
presentation to the next level.

144
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,730
So in the next video lecture, we're going to start talking more

145
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,760
specifically about the feedback form.

146
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,048
