00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,590
MATT MCGARRITY: We've now worked on generating main points, which is an

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,740
invention category.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,280
We've talked about organizing them, that's an arrangement category.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,560
Now, I want to turn and talk to some style for those main points.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,810
Now, at the basic level, we want the main points to

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,600
be concise and memorable.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,960
We'll get back to this, but you're not doing the main point, explaining all

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,210
of the main point in its phrasing, right?

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,890
Because that's part of the overall argument.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,060
That's partly support, part warrant.

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,530
So that claim, we want that main point, that claim, to be phrased as

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,900
memorably and concisely as we can.

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,090
Because, as I've said before, I really want the audience to be able to

14
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,110
remember the claims.

15
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,080
That if they're going to remember anything, I want it to be the thesis

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,100
and the supporting claims.

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,980
Ideally, they would remember the claims and that they were persuasive.

18
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,710
That would be a good goal.

19
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,230
So I want my claims--

20
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,060
and with this being the goal in terms of phrasing them, I want my claims to

21
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,950
be short sentences, and I want them to use vivid verbs.

22
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,190
Now, I should point out obviously, this is pretty culturally specific

23
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,099
language, specific advice here.

24
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,270
So as we move this into discussion forums, I would be interested in

25
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,420
hearing how and where this might differ in other languages.

26
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,720
But for now, let's see how we can make our points as concisely as possible.

27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,330
So if you take a look at this sample thesis here, universities should make

28
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,015
public speaking a graduation requirement.

29
00:01:26,015 --> 00:01:29,390
And I'm just staying with that as a general example here.

30
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,710
So here are the two main points.

31
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,880
Though the existing list of requirements is rather long, we could

32
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,400
easily add public speaking to the list in a way that doesn't disrupt too many

33
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,820
majors and other activities.

34
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,500
Lest I forget, given the importance of public speaking and its role in the

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,870
university and the workforce, a student leaving a university with a

36
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:51,260
basic understanding of public speaking is well-positioned indeed.

37
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,640
So those are way too long.

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,580
Those are crazy long.

39
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,720
They might be accurate, but we want to get more concise.

40
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,400
So if you take a look at these, just take a look at these now.

41
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,890
And what I want you to do is on a sheet of paper, or just mumbling to

42
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,290
yourself, try to get to the core idea of these points in like 5

43
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,150
to 10 words, OK?

44
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,180
Much more concise phrasing on them.

45
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,450
Here's one way you might run that so universities should make public

46
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,220
speaking a graduation requirement.

47
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:21,880
Why?

48
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,460
Because universities can easily add public speaking to the requirements,

49
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,730
and public speaking adds value to a college degree.

50
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,760
So when I get into each one of those points, I can explain what I mean.

51
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,720
I can do that in the speech itself.

52
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,180
But in the intro and at the broadest level, I want the crux of the argument

53
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,460
stated as memorably as possible while still retaining its accuracy.

54
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:50,570
So I really want to be for fewer words, more concise phrasing.

55
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,600
So let's do this again.

56
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,130
So take a look at this one.

57
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,310
Cities should ban smoking in public places.

58
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:00,570
So here in the US, we've got public smoking bans, so in some places you

59
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,020
can't smoke in bars or restaurants.

60
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,740
So if you are arguing for one of these, you could say, all right,

61
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,800
environmental tobacco smoke has generally been shown to be harmful.

62
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,030
This is particularly relevant in public places where workers and

63
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,800
children might not have the ability to avoid such smoke, and though there

64
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,510
might be some legal challenges, smoking bans in other cities in

65
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,730
American states have often withstood these challenges.

66
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,130
Again, those are too long.

67
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,450
Take a look at these and think about how you might get these

68
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,150
phrased more concisely.

69
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,430
Here's one option.

70
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,340
Cities should ban smoking in public places.

71
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,150
Why?

72
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,000
Public smoking bans improve public health and many cities had easily

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,630
implemented such bans.

74
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,770
So keeping that in mind, let's play around with those verbs a bit because

75
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,900
we want to have vivid verbs.

76
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,030
That's kind of a good, nice way of phrasing these.

77
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,800
So we could say public smoking bans improve public health, we could say

78
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,060
augments public health, protects the public.

79
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,250
We could jump around into the second point.

80
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,470
We could say other cities have easily implemented such bans.

81
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,930
Public smoking bans have worked in many cities.

82
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,550
Public smoking bans are easy to implement.

83
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,210
So I kind of lost-- in that final version, I lost cities from there, but

84
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,310
it's a little bit more concise, and easy to implement.

85
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,860
That seems to me to be the core of that claim.

86
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,700
So maybe losing the city's component on that is totally fine because I can

87
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,710
pick that up in the discussion of that point.

88
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,800
So remember, as you're doing this, mumble so that you can play around

89
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,110
with the phrasing.

90
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,210
And this ability to be thinking in terms of-- not soundbites.

91
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,470
That's not the right word for this.

92
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:39,040
But being able to think in terms of clear, concise memorable claims works

93
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,980
in so many other settings, right?

94
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,630
So let's say it's a job interview.

95
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,310
So do you think you'll be good here at Corporation X?

96
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,040
Well, I have expertise in the areas that you're looking for and I actually

97
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,460
did very well in another similar position.

98
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,600
Now, let me talk a little bit about my expertise.

99
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,470
Man, those are two pretty good claims that you would want that interviewer

100
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,650
to remember.

101
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,780
Certainly, as they're discussing you with the other hiring people, people

102
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,800
who are making that decision.

103
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,870
I've had a chance to work with a number of research scientists, and

104
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,730
this really works well here.

105
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,880
Not only for doing conference presentations, but certainly, for

106
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,140
talking to the public about research.

107
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,450
So hypothetically, the public says, tell me a little bit about your

108
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,110
research, and how it impacts me.

109
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,950
Well, says the biomedical person, my research helps us better understand

110
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:33,310
biomedical industries, and that research can equip you to be a better

111
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,950
consumer and that research can drive the industry to make improvements that

112
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,300
make your life easier.

113
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,870
Well, those phrases, those claims, will be explained

114
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,890
when you explain them.

115
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,480
You can get to them in the speech.

116
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,290
But the phrasing there is doing a lot of work for you.

117
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,640
It's making those claims have punch.

118
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,160
It's making them concise and memorable.

119
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,290
So now, we're going to leave main points.

120
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,800
We've talked about coming up with main points, arranging main points, and

121
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,980
phrasing main points.

122
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,710
So now, in the last section of this week's material, we're going to move

123
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,420
from main points to coming up with support for those main points.

124
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,835
