MATT MCGARRITY: Thank you very much for joining me in this class.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,240
It's been an absolutely wonderful experience.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,460
And welcome here to week 10.

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,360
Now, week 10 is going to be a shorter week.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,250
And that's because we've finished the persuasive material, but we still need

6
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,500
to leave time for people to record speeches and start that

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,040
peer reviewing process.

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,270
But just because it's a shorter week doesn't mean it's not

9
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,330
an important week.

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,730
Much of public speaking is about being able to engage in self-assessment and

11
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,730
plan for future development, and that's what we're going to

12
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,200
be doing this week.

13
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,490
I would like to spend this lecture unpacking a little bit, reviewing a

14
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,170
little bit the core structure and objectives.

15
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:41,030
And I'll end by talking a little bit about the final cumulative quiz, test,

16
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,610
whatever you want to call it.

17
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:48,440
So at the broadest level, this course was aiming at helping you design clear

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,370
presentations and deliver them in an engaging way.

19
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,610
Now of course, we achieved those or we pursued those larger objectives

20
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,870
through some more specific ways.

21
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,320
More specifically, we said, all right.

22
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,870
You should be able to, at the end of this-- where we are now--

23
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,770
you should be able to design and deliver basic presentations concisely,

24
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:10,270
informative presentations clearly, and complex arguments persuasively.

25
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,240
In addition, we said, well, you should be able to speak confidently with

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,600
appropriate rate, projection, movement, and vocal variety.

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,450
And then of course, also, you should be able to evaluate and critique

28
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,340
speeches insightfully.

29
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,910
So those were sort of the very broad objectives for this course.

30
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,920
Now, as you well know, we pursued those larger objectives through the

31
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,310
individual assignments.

32
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,760
So we started off with the impromptu speech.

33
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,105
It had the fewest moving parts of any of the speeches that we worked with.

34
00:01:36,105 --> 00:01:40,860
In that speech, what we were really trying to do was quickly develop and

35
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,590
deliver clear and well-supported arguments, be able to explain the

36
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:49,230
relationship between main points and evidence, be able to use reviews and

37
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,910
previews and transitions to augment the clarity of the speech's

38
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,670
arrangement, and also be able to use delivery to distinguish between key

39
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,970
ideas and supporting detail.

40
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,830
So after we had done that, after we had sort of spent our time on that

41
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,550
impromptu speech with its basic elements-- elemental elements--

42
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,470
we then moved on to the informative speech, where we tried to layer in an

43
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,190
additional aspect of complexity.

44
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,960
So in the informative speech, you had to respond appropriately to

45
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,560
constraints.

46
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,780
You needed to think about and design speech goals.

47
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,500
You needed to explain complex topics and evidence.

48
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,590
You needed to arrange the speech clearly, and that had to do with what

49
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,780
the audience concerns were or what the audience lack of understanding was, as

50
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,180
well as the demands of the topic itself.

51
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,080
And of course, we spent time talking about how you would deliver the speech

52
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,620
in an engaging way that contributed to your ethos.

53
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,710
So that set us up for the persuasive speech.

54
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,670
Now, in persuasive speech, the goals were to be able to use stock issues,

55
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,370
to be able to identify realistic calls to action, to put all this together in

56
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,130
a way that highlighted the argument's congruency.

57
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,440
But of course, also being able to write a stylistically-rich speech and

58
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,650
then in turn to be able to deliver that language in a way that

59
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,920
capitalized on your good writing while at the same time being able to

60
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,960
incorporate and use appropriate emotional and delivery variations and

61
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,170
intensities.

62
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,070
So each one of these speeches added something, and each assignment allowed

63
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,120
us to explore the canons in different ways.

64
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,960
And so we did different things with invention and arrangement and style

65
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,340
certainly as we moved through those three speeches.

66
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,210
Memory, because we were working them up and preparing for them and using

67
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,670
notes for each one of these three in different ways, as well as thinking

68
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,270
about different styles of delivery.

69
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:40,300
If you'll recall, the structure of the course really aimed at this sort of

70
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,670
tiered approach to the study of public speaking.

71
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,660
So we started out with identifying and developing a core approach to public

72
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,670
speaking or orality framework, understanding

73
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,110
the rhetorical tradition.

74
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,180
Then we spent a few weeks talking about the impromptu speech, getting

75
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,180
you up and ready on the impromptu speech.

76
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,160
We started that.

77
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,240
Then we started in on the informative speech, finished that.

78
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,350
We moved through the basics of the informative speech, preparing and

79
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,480
delivering, and then we started again with the persuasive speech, basics,

80
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,910
preparing, and delivering persuasive speeches.

81
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:17,180
And then, here we are now at week 10 at the course conclusion.

82
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,930
So obviously, a lot of this course has been drawn from the rhetorical

83
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,220
tradition-- parts of an argument, ethos, stock issues--

84
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,620
so many of the terms used in this course.

85
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,960
Now, our goal is to use this content in service of the

86
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,050
skill of public speaking.

87
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,990
And the skill, if you'll remember, is highly dependent on

88
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,410
the speaking situation.

89
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,780
So if we went all the way back to week one material, you can remember that

90
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,080
the speaker responds to a whole host of constraints--

91
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,430
the topic, the audience, the occasion, so on and so forth.

92
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,370
So one thing I said in week one and I want to reiterate now at the end of

93
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,670
the course in week 10--

94
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:56,140
there is no one successful way to a successful speech.

95
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,870
There's just not this one way that will always work for

96
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,910
each and every person.

97
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,430
I hope that this course has provided you with some tools to help you

98
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:09,360
identify your path, and I hope that you can take what is useful to you in

99
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,170
your speech settings from this class.

100
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:16,030
But remember, so much about public speaking is about judgment, judging

101
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:21,840
what is best as a good response to a particular set of speech constraints.

102
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,480
So I do hope that these lectures, assignments, quizzes, and discussions

103
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,060
have helped you reflect and refine your sense of rhetorical judgment.

104
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,510
But that said, content is important, so something like the stock issues are

105
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,650
not useful to you in a speech if you can't remember what they are.

106
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:43,910
So I want to end this unit here, this opening lecture, by asking you to go

107
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,710
take that final comprehensive quiz as a way of reinforcing some of the key

108
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,560
ideas, the key concepts, the key tools from this course.

109
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,030
And I'll just point out that the quiz is drawn mainly from former lecture

110
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,970
quizzes, but really trying to get at what are those tools and refresh your

111
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,490
memory as to what those tools are as you leave this course and move into

112
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,270
your own speech settings.

113
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,430
So we'll end here.

114
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,410
And then in the next lecture, we'll talk about sort of your growth as a

115
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,770
speaker over these 10 weeks.

116
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,020
