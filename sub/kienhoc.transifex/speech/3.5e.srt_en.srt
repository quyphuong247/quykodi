https://youtu.be/nqRTv4WdL2s
About ten years ago I took on the task to teach global development to

1
00:00:29,978 --> 00:00:32,088
Swedish undergraduate students

2
00:00:32,088 --> 00:00:36,259
That was after having spent about twenty years together with African

3
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:40,009
institutions studying hunger in Africa, so I was sort of

4
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:42,349
expected to know a little about the world and

5
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,829
I started in our medical university Karolinska Institute an

6
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:49,390
undergraduate course called global health

7
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,868
But when you get the opportunity you get a little nervous. I thought

8
00:00:52,868 --> 00:00:56,488
these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in the Swedish

9
00:00:56,488 --> 00:00:59,728
college system, so I thought maybe they know everything I'm going to teach them

10
00:00:59,728 --> 00:01:00,479
about

11
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:02,349
So I did a pretest

12
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,659
when they came in. And one of the question

13
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,270
mortality

14
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,769
of these five pairs

15
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:16,479
And I put them together so that in each pair of countries, one has twice the child

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,390
mortality of the other

17
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,989
And this means

18
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:21,069
that

19
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:24,229
it's much a bigger the difference than the uncertainty of the data

20
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,639
I won't put you to a test here, but it's Turkey which is highest, then Poland

21
00:01:28,638 --> 00:01:31,129
Russia, Pakistan and South Africa

22
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:34,418
and these were the results of the Swedish students. I did it so that I got the

23
00:01:34,418 --> 00:01:37,658
confidence interval, which is pretty narrow and I got happy, of course

24
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:40,840
I got one point eight right answers out of five possible2600:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,179So that means that there was a place for a professor of international health

25
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:46,280
and for my course

26
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,358
But one

27
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:52,559
late night when I was compiling the report I really realized my discovery

28
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,939
I had shown that Swedish top students know statistically significantly less

29
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:02,929
about the world than the chimpanzees

30
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,640
Because the chimpanzees would score

31
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,098
half right. If I gave them two bananas, which: Sri Lanka or Turkey?, they would

32
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:10,799
be right in half of the cases

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,890
but the students are not that. The problem for me was not ignorance. It

34
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:16,898
was preconceived ideas

35
00:02:16,899 --> 00:02:20,949
I did an unethical study of the professors of the Karolinska Institute

36
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:22,069
that hands

37
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:25,748
out the Nobel Prize in medicine and they are on par with the

38
00:02:25,748 --> 00:02:29,799
chimpanzees there

39
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:30,248
So this is

40
00:02:30,248 --> 00:02:34,269
where I realized that there was really a need to communicate because the

41
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:35,050
data

42
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,490
of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is

43
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,790
very well aware

44
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:42,750
So we did the software which displays it like this

45
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,030
Every bubble here is a country. This bubble is a country

46
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,269
this country over here is not

47
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:49,539
disease china

48
00:02:49,538 --> 00:02:53,009
and these easy india the size of the public is the population

49
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:56,729
and on this x's here i'd put fertility rate

50
00:02:56,729 --> 00:03:01,310
because of my students what they said wendy looks upon the world and i also

51
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,699
then what do you really

52
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:04,540
think about the world

53
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:08,888
whether at first discovered that the textbook was clinton mainly

54
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,400
and they said the world this did we end them

55
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,308
and we is west of the world them is third world

56
00:03:15,308 --> 00:03:19,359
and what do you mean with western world i said well that's long life in small

57
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:22,939
family and third world is short life and large family

58
00:03:22,938 --> 00:03:27,318
so this is what they could display here i put fertility rates here

59
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:31,088
number of children per woman one-two-three-four up to about eight

60
00:03:31,088 --> 00:03:32,090
children per woman

61
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,450
we have very good data since nineteen sixty two nineteen sixty about on the

62
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,618
size of families in the country the error margin is narrow

63
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:41,688
here i put life expectancy at birth

64
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:46,028
from thirty years in some countries up to about seventy years and nineteen

65
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:50,128
sixty-two that was really a group of companies here that was industrialized

66
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:50,530
countries

67
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,569
and they had

68
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:52,558
smaller families

69
00:03:52,558 --> 00:03:56,438
and long lives and these were the developing countries they had large

70
00:03:56,438 --> 00:03:56,969
families

71
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:58,830
and they had relatively short lives

72
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,630
now what has happened since nineteen sixty two we want to see the change on

73
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:06,789
the students write it's still too types of companies or have these developing

74
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:09,189
countries got smaller families and they did here

75
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:12,870
or that they got longer lives and live up to the airport c we stopped the world

76
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,899
and this is all u_n_ statistic that has been available here we go back to see

77
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:20,149
that it's right now they're moving buildings better healthier improving

78
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:23,209
their core the green latin american countries

79
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:26,870
into a smaller families you get the ones here are the arabic countries and they

80
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,639
get larger families but they did not rule on the lack of milk larger families

81
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,079
the africans are the green don't have the still dreaming excuses india

82
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,348
indonesia is moving on pretty fast and in the eighties here got bangladesh

83
00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:42,259
fears among the african countries that but mel bangladesh it's a miracle that

84
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:46,278
happens in the eighties teen moms stock to promote family planning at the moment

85
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:51,379
the entire corner campaign nineties we have the terrible h_i_v_ epidemic that

86
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:55,588
takes tom the life expectancy of the african countries and all the rest of

87
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:56,588
the mall

88
00:04:56,588 --> 00:05:00,838
mall stopping to the corner but we have long lives and smaller family and we

89
00:05:00,838 --> 00:05:07,838
have a completely new world

90
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:19,269
let me make a comparison directly between the united states of america and

91
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:20,538
yet now

92
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:22,728
nineteen sixty four

93
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:25,158
america had smaller families and long life

94
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,379
yet and had large families and short lives

95
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:32,500
and this is what happens the date down during the war

96
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,399
indicate

97
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:37,569
that even with all the deck that was an improvement of life expectancy by the

98
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:40,680
end of the year the family planning started in vietnam and he went to a

99
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,418
smaller families and the united states up there is getting for longer life

100
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:48,738
keeping family size and in the eighties now they give up

101
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:52,098
communist planning and the global market economy and it most fast even a social

102
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:52,688
life

103
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:53,599
and today

104
00:05:53,598 --> 00:05:55,170
we have been vietnam

105
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,569
the same

106
00:05:56,569 --> 00:06:02,169
life expectancy and the same family size here in vietnam nineteen two thousand

107
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:02,889
three

108
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:04,660
as the united states

109
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,199
nineteen seventy four by the end of the war

110
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,598
i think we

111
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:13,509
old if we dont looking the date that we underestimate the tremendous change in

112
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:13,980
asia

113
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,599
which was in social change before we saw economical change

114
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:24,319
so that's more work to another way here in which we cordial display that

115
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,908
distribution in the world of the income

116
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:29,629
this is the world distribution of income

117
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:31,468
of people

118
00:06:31,468 --> 00:06:32,579
one dollar

119
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:35,928
ten dollar or one hundred dollar per day

120
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:39,318
does not get the green rich and poor and the longer this estimate

121
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:42,049
as a little comptia

122
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:43,810
but they are people all the way

123
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,038
and if we look where the income ends up

124
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:52,959
the income this is one hundred percent the world's annual income

125
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,758
the richest twenty percent

126
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,800
they take out of that

127
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,150
about seventy four percent

128
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:02,409
and the poorest twenty percent they take

129
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,000
about

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,899
two percent

131
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:07,589
and this shows that the concept developing countries is extremely adult

132
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:08,248
phone

133
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:10,210
we sort of thing about eight

134
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:11,808
like these people here

135
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:16,229
giving aid to these people here but in the middle we have most of world

136
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:16,978
population her

137
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:21,310
and they have not twenty four percent of the income we heard it in other forms

138
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,098
and who are who are tds

139
00:07:24,098 --> 00:07:26,089
where all the different countries yeah

140
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:29,078
i can show you africa

141
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:29,989
africa

142
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:32,728
ten percent the world population most imp over tea

143
00:07:32,728 --> 00:07:34,740
this is always cd

144
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,319
the rich country in the country club of the u_n_

145
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,550
and they are over here on this side and pointed overlap between africa

146
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,788
and always cd

147
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:46,509
and this is latin america it has everything on this from the poorest

148
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:47,560
to the richest

149
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,528
in latin america

150
00:07:49,528 --> 00:07:50,459
on top of that

151
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:55,310
we can put east europe we can put he's patiala and record south asia

152
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,780
and how did it look like

153
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:58,339
if we go back in time

154
00:07:58,339 --> 00:07:59,329
to about

155
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:00,488
nineteen seventy

156
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:02,159
then that was

157
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,088
more about hum

158
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:07,809
and we have mostly lived in absolute poverty workstations

159
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:10,879
the problem in the world with the poverty impatient

160
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,259
and if i know

161
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:13,900
let the world move forward

162
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:16,539
you would seem that white population increase

163
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,419
there are hundreds of millions in case you're getting out of poverty and some

164
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:22,000
others get into poverty

165
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,819
and this is the fact that we have today

166
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,979
and the best protection from the world bank

167
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:27,908
is that this will happen

168
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:31,668
and we will not have a divided world will that most people in the middle of

169
00:08:31,668 --> 00:08:36,698
course it's a logarithmic scale here but dont concept of economy is growth with

170
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:38,779
percent we looked up on that

171
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:41,740
a possibility

172
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,759
percentage increase if i change these

173
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,360
and i think g_d_p_ per capita instead of family income

174
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,079
and i'd turn these

175
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:54,469
individual it date back into regional dadar of gross domestic product

176
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,029
and i take the region's dhoni of the size of the bubble is still the

177
00:08:58,029 --> 00:08:58,539
population

178
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:01,799
and you have the always see the video and you have sub-saharan africa there

179
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:06,409
and we take off the arab states they're coming both from african from asia and

180
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:10,629
we put them separately and we can expand these axes

181
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:13,189
and i can give it up and you dont mention here

182
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:17,639
but acting at the social values that shine survive in a lot of money on their

183
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,269
taxes

184
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:21,860
and i've the possibility of children to survive and some countries ninety nine

185
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,950
point seven percent of children survive to five years of age

186
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,389
only seventy and here it seems that the subject between always see the

187
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:31,688
left in america

188
00:09:31,688 --> 00:09:32,919
east europe

189
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,870
east asia arab states

190
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,509
south asia

191
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:37,490
sub-saharan africa

192
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,649
the new year it is very strong

193
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:42,470
between charge survival

194
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,199
but let me split

195
00:09:44,198 --> 00:09:45,949
sub-saharan africa

196
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,040
dresses there

197
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,399
better uh...

198
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:50,528
at is out there

199
00:09:50,528 --> 00:09:51,918
i can go here

200
00:09:51,918 --> 00:09:56,889
and i can split sub-saharan africa into its cos and when you burst the size of

201
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:01,320
these country bubble is the size of the population sierra leone the bombay ip

202
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,740
more reaches up there

203
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,570
mile reaches was the first concrete

204
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,900
to get away with trade barriers and they could sell racial group

205
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,889
they could sell their textiles

206
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:11,149
on equal

207
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:13,620
terms as the people in europe and north america

208
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,700
does he huge difference between africa and bombers hitting the middle

209
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,780
in sierra leone humanitarian aid

210
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:22,958
he moved there you've got

211
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,038
development they need if you have time to invest

212
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:27,009
then you can go for all of the day

213
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:31,409
it's a tremendous variation within africa which we read often make

214
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:32,639
becky t when everything

215
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,500
i can split salvation here

216
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,570
ingest the big bubble in the middle but u jz difference between afghanistan

217
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,550
sri lanka

218
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:46,899
and i can speak arab states holiday same time at sing cultures and religions

219
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:48,000
huge difference

220
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,200
even between neighbors vehemence into the war united arab emirates money

221
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,200
which was quite equally and when he was

222
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,490
as the mixes

223
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,879
and that includes all the children albrecht

224
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:02,169
foreign workers who are in the pump

225
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:05,620
they canceled them better than you think many people said that they case that

226
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,370
there's an uncertainty marched

227
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,889
but we can see the difference here cambodia singapore the differences are

228
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:13,539
much bigger than the weakness of the day

229
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,599
east europe

230
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,070
soviet economy

231
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,569
for long time but they come out after ten years it's very very differently

232
00:11:21,568 --> 00:11:24,139
and there's latin america

233
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:28,199
today we don't have to go to cuba the finding of the country mcnamara techy

234
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,730
we'll have a

235
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,629
bill which i don't i don't think you but within some few years from now

236
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:36,778
and here we have high-income companies in those cd and we get

237
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:39,360
behold packed in here or the world

238
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,350
which is more or less like like this

239
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,500
if we look at it how it looks the world

240
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,120
in nineteen sixty

241
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,549
it starts to move nineteen six if this is not sad tumhi broadcast of china

242
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:56,269
and then he died and then things up in came and brought money into china and

243
00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:58,360
brought them into the mainstream again

244
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,570
and we have seen how companies more

245
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,579
be spent

246
00:12:01,578 --> 00:12:03,129
shins like this

247
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:05,500
it's sort of

248
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,190
difficult to get them

249
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:10,730
fix on both comfortable chose the pectin of the world

250
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,500
but i would like to bring your back too

251
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,548
about here

252
00:12:14,548 --> 00:12:17,949
at ect nineteen sixty

253
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,430
and i would like to compare

254
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:22,529
uh...

255
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:23,500
south korea

256
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,179
which is this one

257
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:27,088
wid with brazil

258
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:29,020
which is this one

259
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:30,789
that they'd been went away form here

260
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:34,719
and i would like to compare uganda which is there

261
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,500
and i can run late

262
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,068
forward

263
00:12:37,068 --> 00:12:38,979
like this

264
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,580
and you can see

265
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,680
south korea is making its very very fast advancement

266
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:47,889
where is brazil

267
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:49,239
is much lower

268
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:51,030
and if we move back

269
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:52,019
again here

270
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,600
and we put on

271
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,379
traders on the night dress

272
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:57,840
you can see again

273
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,030
the speed of development is very very different

274
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:03,230
the companies

275
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,940
are moving

276
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,010
more or less in the same rate

277
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:08,250
as money

278
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,799
enhanced but it seems you can move much faster if your healthy first

279
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:14,659
then if you know when he first

280
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:19,399
to show that you can put on the way talk united arab emirates they came from here

281
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,689
a mineral country

282
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:21,930
they catch all the oil

283
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:23,709
they got all the money

284
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,360
health cannot be bought at the supermarket

285
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,450
you have to invest in how do you have to get kids into schooling you have to

286
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,440
train health stuff yet the educate the population

287
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,920
and shakes a did that in the fairly good way

288
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:37,389
and in spite of falling oil prices

289
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:39,089
he brought this country up here

290
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:41,430
so we got two mm much more

291
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:45,519
mainstream appearance of the world by record companies tend to use their money

292
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,169
that uh...

293
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:49,179
then be used in the past

294
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:51,588
this is more or less if you look at

295
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:53,970
if you look at every chick

296
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,129
data of the country's

297
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:57,519
they are like this

298
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,970
not that's dangerous

299
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:02,129
to use averaged eight them because

300
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:04,679
such a lot of differences within countries

301
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,099
so if i go

302
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,129
and look here

303
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:09,759
we can see that uganda

304
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:11,029
that today

305
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:14,939
is where south korea was nineteen sixty five split cucumber

306
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,490
there's quite a difference

307
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,960
winding uganda these other quintiles of you've gone by the richest twenty

308
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,230
percent of your guns on their the poorest and on the air

309
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,340
if i split south africa

310
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,700
is like this and if i go down and look at

311
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,139
nigeria

312
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:32,669
where there was such a terrible famine lastly

313
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:37,120
is like this the twenty-percent poorest of nigeria is out here and a twenty

314
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,519
percent richest of south africa is they are

315
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,649
and yet

316
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:41,639
weekend to discuss

317
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,259
on what solutions they should be massacre

318
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,399
everything in this world existing africa

319
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,699
and you can't discuss universal access to h_i_v_ fought that quintile up here

320
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,170
with the same strategy

321
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:58,169
as down here the improvement of the world must be high in the context allies

322
00:14:58,169 --> 00:14:59,490
and it's not

323
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,909
relevant to have the on regional level we must be much more details

324
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:07,438
we find that students get very excited when they can use this

325
00:15:07,438 --> 00:15:10,938
and even more policy makers and the corporate sectors

326
00:15:10,938 --> 00:15:14,059
would like to see c_e_o_ how the world peace

327
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:16,809
seems you know why doesn't this take place

328
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:20,809
wyoming not using the date that we have we had a thing the united nations in the

329
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:22,849
national statistical agencies

330
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,879
and universities and other non-governmental organization because

331
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:30,389
the big guys have been down in the database is and the public is their and

332
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:33,389
intellect is they are but we have still not used it effectively

333
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:36,080
or that the information resource hinging on the world

334
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:42,129
does not include publicly-funded statistic that some web pages like this

335
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:47,269
they take some url irishman saddam from the databases by people put prices on

336
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:48,220
them

337
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,750
stupid passwords and boring statistics

338
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,240
hampton park

339
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,970
so what is needed we have in the database is developed a new database you

340
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:00,339
need

341
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:04,420
we have wonderful designed to withstand more and more i added up here

342
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:07,299
so we started among profit venture

343
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,059
at which we called

344
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:12,639
linking date that would be assigned to call it dept minder from london on the

345
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,669
ground where they warn your mind the gap

346
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:16,679
so we sort out my misappropriated

347
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:19,349
and we started to write software which could link

348
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,159
the data like this

349
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:24,178
and it wasn't that difficult it took some person years

350
00:16:24,178 --> 00:16:25,869
and we have produced

351
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:26,360
animations

352
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,298
you can take a dataset them put today we have been breaking you and they thought

353
00:16:31,298 --> 00:16:35,678
some fuel u_n_ organization some countries except that their data bases

354
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:36,789
can go out

355
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:40,639
on the world but what we really need is of course the search function

356
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,759
a search function where we can copy of the day thought up to a searchable

357
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:46,809
format and get developed in the world

358
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:50,909
and what do we hear when we go around i've done that apology on the main

359
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,459
statistical units

360
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,330
everyone says is impossible

361
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,670
this can't be done all information is so peculiar impeded

362
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:01,819
so that cannot be searched as out there can be served we cannot give the date

363
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,090
dot free to the students free to them for perimeters of the world

364
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:08,970
but this is what we would like to see isn't it

365
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,709
the publicly-funded database down here and we would like flowers to grow up on

366
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:18,500
the net and one of the crucial point is to make them searchable and then people

367
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,380
can use the different the assigned to to animated banner and i have a pretty good

368
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,440
news for you

369
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:29,330
by the good news that the press some new head of u_n_ statistic he doesn't say

370
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:36,199
it's impossible illness is weak on dude

371
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,019
and that's a quite clever guy

372
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:44,288
so we can see lots happening indate duck in the coming years

373
00:17:44,288 --> 00:17:46,990
we would be able to look at the income distributions

374
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,400
in completely new ways

375
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,919
this is the income distribution of china nineteen seventy

376
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,210
this is the income distribution or the united states nineteen seventy eight

377
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,950
almost no overlap

378
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,740
almost no overlap and what has happened

379
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,370
with those happens this the china's growing it's not so equal any longer and

380
00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:12,509
he's appearing here overlooking the united states

381
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:19,509
almost like a ghost isn't it time have reduced their

382
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,160
but i think is very important to have have all these

383
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,769
information

384
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:29,420
weenie we need to really two-seat

385
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,000
and instead of looking at basic

386
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,589
i would like to end up by showing

387
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:37,750
the internet users per one thousand

388
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,869
this software we excess about five hundred variables from all the countries

389
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:43,949
quite easily it takes some

390
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,720
prime tool to to change for this but

391
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,910
on the excesses

392
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,660
you can quite easily

393
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,440
get in the very beginning with like to have

394
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,769
the pricing would be to get up the databases free to get them such a bill

395
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,680
and with the second thing to get them into the graphic formats

396
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,788
weightlifting spent only

397
00:19:03,788 --> 00:19:06,879
understand i'm not statisticians doesn't like the because they say

398
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,480
that this will not this will not

399
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,529
and uh...

400
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:13,079
show

401
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:17,829
the very ality we have to ask that these people analytical methods but this is

402
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:18,750
hypothesis generating

403
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,289
i can't now with the world

404
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:26,069
bedding tonight dot com and the number of internet users are going up like this

405
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:28,009
this is the agreed to pay per capita

406
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:30,079
and using new technology coming in

407
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:33,240
but the amazingly how where it keeps tapes

408
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,690
to the economy of the country's

409
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,680
that's one of one hundred dollar computer will be so important

410
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,049
but five candidates he says he is the world is flat morphism these companies

411
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,388
are lifting more than the economy

412
00:19:45,388 --> 00:19:48,418
and will be very interesting too full of these over the year

413
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:52,140
as i would like you to be able to do with all of the publicly-funded data

414
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:59,140
thank you very much

415
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,789
peers cherished

416
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:11,190
with security one points

417
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:18,190
the realism

418
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:25,430
if there is a place where artistic vision is protected inspired design and

419
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:28,470
his little here we come

420
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,089
kicking me she needs
