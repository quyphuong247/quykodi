MATT MCGARRITY: So what we're going to do this week is we're going to finish our

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,550
work on the impromptu speech.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,970
So we left off last week by looking at claims and evidence and now this week

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,740
we're going to look at how we put it all together.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,400
So we're going to work bit by bit through how you're talking about your

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,270
evidence, and how you're performing your arrangement.

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,770
And then the second half of the week we're going to move into just focusing

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,810
on delivery.

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,280
So first we're going to look at what fear of public speaking is.

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,070
And most importantly, how you can deal with that fear of public speaking.

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,650
And then we're going to shift by just looking at some models

12
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,140
for good speech delivery.

13
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,390
So that's what this week holds.

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,600
