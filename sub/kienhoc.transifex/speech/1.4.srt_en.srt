MATT MCGARRITY: So what I'd like to do right now is talk a little bit about

1
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,880
practicing in this course.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,080
Practicing your public speaking skills, practicing in isolation at

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,180
home, or practicing in front of a webcam and posting it to YouTube.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:19,230
Because doing video in a class on public speaking is a bit odd, right?

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,350
The one thing that we tend to do when we stand up and speak in front of an

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,500
audience is not there when we're recording these videos.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,430
That audience is usually not there.

8
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,520
So what I'd like to do is talk a little bit about the role of practice

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,630
and the role of video in this class, and how that helps us understand the

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,060
skills that we're working on.

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,990
And then I've got a few things that I'd like to say in terms of how I

12
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,090
would recommend you go about practicing.

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:45,080
So first, this whole idea about recording speeches in a public

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,950
speaking course.

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:51,700
Having a public speaking course where audiences are not physically present.

16
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,890
Well, the way I look at it is this class is an opportunity to refine

17
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,270
certain skills.

18
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,390
And I'll come back to the analogy multiple times, but public speaking in

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,170
many ways is like refining your skill with any sort of art, but specifically

20
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,490
with sports, OK?

21
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:13,480
So if you like soccer or football, there is a need for refining the core

22
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,640
elemental skills.

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,330
And soccer, someone who can juggle the ball well is someone who has a dynamic

24
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,710
control of the ball, can trap it, can work with that

25
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,470
ball in multiple settings.

26
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,490
Now they're not going to do that in the middle of the game, right?

27
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,430
They're not going to stop in the middle of a game and start

28
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,460
juggling the ball.

29
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,130
But they have skills that can then be applied in the dynamic and

30
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,550
ever-shifting nature of that game.

31
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,290
That's what this course is.

32
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,060
We are refining skills.

33
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:46,210
We are isolating, honing these certain specific public speaking skills.

34
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,820
So then you can take them to the actual speech setting.

35
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,220
So then you can stand up in front of an audience and you

36
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,660
can be better prepared.

37
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,760
So can standing up in front of a video be the same, the exact same, as

38
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,140
delivering a speech for an audience of 20?

39
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,480
No, it can't.

40
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,670
I'm recording these speeches right now, and there are two cameras and two

41
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,440
camera guys, but they don't look at me.

42
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,060
So it's not the same.

43
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,000
It's not the same.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,450
I don't have an audience to work off of.

45
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,230
But it is an opportunity to refine certain skills, so that when I do go

46
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,340
out there in front of those audiences, I can tap into that ability.

47
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,030
Most certainly.

48
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,300
So we're focusing solely on skills in this class, so that you could be me

49
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,910
more dynamic in the game.

50
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,080
You can be more dynamic when you actually have an

51
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,290
audience their present.

52
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,870
And I'm reminded of a quotation, and this is often attributed

53
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,590
to Seneca the Younger.

54
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,840
Seneca the Younger was a writer, a Roman writer/philosopher, writing at

55
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,540
the dawn of the common era.

56
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,310
And this quotation's attributed to him, and I think that attribution's

57
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,320
actually kind of pretty dubious.

58
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,260
But and he didn't say it are write it.

59
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,380
It's probably something he would have agreed with.

60
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,710
And that it is, luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.

61
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,100
Now I don't know what type of public speaking opportunities you're going to

62
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,270
find yourself in.

63
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,140
To be fair, you don't either.

64
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,120
Those are going to arise in the future.

65
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,370
So you don't know what opportunities are out there.

66
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,680
But this class is going to work on that preparation, okay?

67
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,630
So that's what I see the role of practicing in this class being.

68
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,720
Being able to find those skills.

69
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,160
Now hopefully, you will post videos and get some peer feedback.

70
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,240
But that's not the same as having a physical audience present .

71
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,720
But because of that, I want to shift now and talk a little bit to some

72
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,260
recommendations I'd make to you in terms of practicing your speeches.

73
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,500
We're going to start with an introductory speech, and I'm going to

74
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,560
ask you to practice it.

75
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,250
When we get into next week, we're going to be talking about the

76
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,540
impromptu speech, and I'm going to ask you to practice it.

77
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,730
So there's sort of three key things that I want to make sure that you're

78
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,750
at least thinking about when it comes time to practice your speech.

79
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,290
One of them would be don't restart.

80
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,720
Replicate your mobility in the speech.

81
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,570
And whenever possible, speak at volume, OK?

82
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,890
So first off, don't restart your speech.

83
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,640
Either in practice when no one's around or if you're

84
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,000
recording your speech.

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,080
And I say that as much possible.

86
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,840
Don't re-record as much as possible.

87
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,880
I hope one thing you'll notice in these videos that you're watching of

88
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,730
me, is they're one shots.

89
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,590
I don't restart these speeches.

90
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,200
I don't restart the segment.

91
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,860
And I'm doing that as a pedagogical principle.

92
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,230
There are a couple times that maybe I've got a flub that I wish I

93
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,070
wouldn't have done.

94
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:35,450
But if I'm in front of a live audience, I don't have the luxury of

95
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,920
saying to everyone, OK, forget the past 15 seconds.

96
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,930
Let's take it from back when I said, um.

97
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,400
That's not a luxury.

98
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,440
So don't we restart as much as possible.

99
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,710
Because really what I want you to be doing is practicing

100
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,550
getting out of jams.

101
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,240
Not erasing them from history.

102
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,920
Because again, that's what you're going to have to do when you stand up

103
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,070
in front of an audience.

104
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,160
You're going to have to, if you find yourself lost in a speech, take a

105
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,220
moment, regather your thoughts, and keep pressing on.

106
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,690
So don't restart as much as possible.

107
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,970
And certainly, don't restart simply because you said um, er, or ah.

108
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,410
We'll get to this next week.

109
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,390
Actually, I'm sorry, we'll get to this in two weeks' time when we're talking

110
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,620
about the delivery for the impromptu speech.

111
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,760
But the issue with um, ers, or ahs, isn't so much presence or absence.

112
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,600
Did you say it or did you not?

113
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,620
So much as it is context.

114
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,220
Where is that flowing, right?

115
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:33,960
There have been, in every language since the beginning of languages, ums,

116
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,795
ers, and ahs, to suggest that utterance is somehow aberrant.

117
00:05:38,795 --> 00:05:42,030
It is a stretch at the very least.

118
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:42,800
But we'll get to that.

119
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,760
Don't merely restart because you said um once.

120
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,370
That's a performance orientation.

121
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,980
We're all about communication orientation.

122
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,750
So that's first thing.

123
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,130
Second, replicate your mobility as much as you can.

124
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,440
And in of the upcoming videos, I'll talk to how you're going to set up

125
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,890
your camera to shoot your speeches if you so choose.

126
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:04,080
But as you're practicing, or as you're shooting these, make sure that you're

127
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,440
moving as you would in front of an actual audience, OK?

128
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,780
So you're not sitting down, you're not laying down.

129
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,550
That may be how you run your speech in your mind to make sure that your

130
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,440
memory's in check.

131
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,400
But when it comes time to practice that speech, stand up and move around

132
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,210
as you will move around.

133
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:26,080
Because in so doing, you're just adding to your repertoire of speech

134
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,640
and movements and gestures.

135
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,070
You're beginning to associate certain hand gestures with certain things.

136
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,540
They're starting to look more natural.

137
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,010
So replicate your mobility as much as possible.

138
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:40,060
And at the same time, replicate your volume as much as possible.

139
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,610
Speak at volume.

140
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,390
So if you're muttering to yourself as a way of practicing the speech, you're

141
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,210
probably going to go faster.

142
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:52,100
So make sure you are able to speak as loud as you can, when you can.

143
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,930
Now one of the nice things about having a class like this in an online

144
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,180
platform is you can access it anywhere.

145
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,470
So if you're in the middle of, I don't know what would be a horrible, if

146
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,520
you're in the middle 10 babies soundly sleeping.

147
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,230
Yeah, you know what?

148
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,930
Then don't practice at volume.

149
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,320
I don't know why you would be in the middle of 10 babies soundly sleeping,

150
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,360
but if you are, don't scream and wake them up.

151
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,920
That's just rude.

152
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,410
But so for the most part, when you're practicing, I want you to speak, as we

153
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:27,510
would say in competitive speak, practice under contest conditions.

154
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,770
Because that's how you're going to get to know what works in that setting.

155
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:37,260
So in your case, practice as much as you can at replicating all the factors

156
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,050
that are going to be there when you stand up to speak.

157
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,380
You may not have an audience present, but you can move around, you can speak

158
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,740
at volume, and you can practice getting yourself out of oral jams.

159
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,780
OK, so just talking your way out of a problem.

160
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:54,670
So that's kind of how I would envision you practicing these speech skills.

161
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,990
But ultimately, you need to take these skills into public settings.

162
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,520
If this class is to have an effect, you have to take these, you know we

163
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,530
talked about soccer and juggling, you got to take that

164
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,200
ability onto the field.

165
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,080
You've got to refine these skills in the privacy of your own home, but then

166
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,110
take them into the workplace and look and sound good.

167
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,940
This class I want you to think of, and your practicing of these speeches, I

168
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,270
