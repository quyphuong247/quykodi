MATT MCGARRITY: We've finished our discussion of ethos.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,960
But when it comes to informative speaking, when it comes to speaking in

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,990
general, I wanted to spend some time talking through some very small

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,380
delivery issues that have a big impact on your overall performance, citation

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,590
and note use.

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,860
Typically we don't think about that, right?

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,200
I know what evidence I have.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,310
And I'll just talk about it.

9
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,650
And I'll just have my notes.

10
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,670
Well, these are all parts of the performance.

11
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,110
And they bear close examination, because they can make life more or

12
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,360
less stressful in that speech event, depending on whether or not you've

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,470
prepare them well or not.

14
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,510
So I just kind of want to start off by talking through a very few couple of

15
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,380
notes about how you might cite your sources, how you might use evidence in

16
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,620
a speech like this.

17
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,780
And then I want to spend more time going through different ways of

18
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,300
organizing your notes in a way that can really aid your performance.

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,460
So to begin with, citing your sources.

20
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,950
Now, you may be doing this in your informative speeches a fair

21
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,200
bit or not at all.

22
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,400
It really depends on the genre that you're working in and the audience

23
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,810
that you're speaking in front of.

24
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,230
Nevertheless, if you do have to actually cite your sources--

25
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,780
and I can think of lots of time when that's very beneficial.

26
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,646
It adds to sort of your credibility as a speaker, demonstrating that you know

27
00:01:14,646 --> 00:01:17,260
your sources and you can tell people about them.

28
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,400
But if you're going to cite your sources in the speech, just give that

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,250
audience enough information so that they can know a little

30
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,600
bit about the source.

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,910
So you're giving them enough information so that they know that the

32
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:35,310
source is recent and credible, or that they know where they could go look up

33
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,990
the source if they really wanted to.

34
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,210
But it's not APA format.

35
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,980
It's not the same thing that you would do as if you were

36
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,850
writing a research article.

37
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,990
You don't have to give us page numbers.

38
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,820
You're just giving us enough information so that if we so wished,

39
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,320
we could go look up that information ourselves.

40
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,570
More strategically, I think when you cite sources, typically it's good to

41
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,080
put that information at the beginning of a sentence.

42
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,460
So two weeks ago, The New York Times ran a story on this.

43
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,440
And what that article indicated was, boom.

44
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,320
About a year ago, Time magazine interviewed such and such.

45
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,090
And they said that, boom.

46
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,970
So the idea is putting that information at the beginning of a

47
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,490
sentence lets us know that we're about to hear cited information.

48
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:29,150
So it's opposed to if you say the information and then tell us that it's

49
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,640
cited, well, then as a listener I've got to go back and try to figure out

50
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,440
where to carve up your words versus their words.

51
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,840
So I think putting the citation at the beginning of a sentence just is a

52
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,110
little bit easier and it aids clarity.

53
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,010
So that's all I wanted to say about citation.

54
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,440
I really wanted to spend more time talking about notes.

55
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,690
