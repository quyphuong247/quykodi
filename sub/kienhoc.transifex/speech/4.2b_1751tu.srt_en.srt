MATT MCGARRITY: Now that we've overviewed the speech, I want to work

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,050
through the actual rubric we're going to be using in the discussion of the

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,500
informative speech itself.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,170
So I like doing this and we did this in the impromptu.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,230
I'm sure you remember.

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,660
I like doing this because on the one hand, I think it's fair.

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,690
I think it's fair for everybody to know where I'm running, where this

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,380
course is running, in this speech.

9
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,930
What are the exact skills that I think are important and that I'm going to be

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:28,430
teaching to you?

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:33,210
So I think it's good to be transparent in that teaching.

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,780
I also think it's good as a learning strategy because it allows us to look

13
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:43,050
at something like speaking to inform, which is a very broad category and can

14
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,740
pop up in all sorts of different types of settings--

15
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,110
but it allows us to look at that but think about, what are the constituent

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,510
skills that build up to the larger whole?

17
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,780
Also, I want to be going through the rubrics because, in the functionality

18
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,810
of an online class, I want to make sure peer evaluation is as good as it

19
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,550
possibly can be in this class.

20
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:07,230
I think one of the best ways to get to that is to make sure that there is

21
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:12,430
some sort of communal understanding, shared public understanding, about

22
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,500
what these terms mean and how they can be evaluated.

23
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,830
So I like going through the feedback form in general because it helps us

24
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:25,010
set up a general framework for studying specific genres of speeches

25
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,630
but also in a very practical way, because it's going to be important to

26
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,570
the class as an online class.

27
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,640
So let me just go through the various components of the rubric.

28
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,720
There are two invention categories, an arrangement category, a style

29
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,010
category, and a memory and delivery category.

30
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,570
So, to begin with, invention--

31
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,950
topic, time, and audience.

32
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,210
So here I've got a couple of concerns.

33
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,460
The speaker addressed points appropriate to the

34
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,940
topic and the audience.

35
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,790
So once again, you're making judgments here.

36
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:59,730
Did you select the right material for the speech to be covered, OK?

37
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,830
Did you talk about the things that had to be discussed?

38
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,780
Now certainly, outside of this class, that's a huge consideration.

39
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,650
Because you've got to figure out, well, what's the audience?

40
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,220
What does audience already know?

41
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,280
What shouldn't I say because they already know?

42
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,560
Or what should I say because I need to inform them?

43
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,010
So you got to get a read on what that audience is.

44
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,060
Are they experts?

45
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,870
Do they know a lot?

46
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,350
Are they relatively uninformed?

47
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,100
Certainly, for-- we'll talk more about this-- but in this class, your

48
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,620
audience is the definition of a universal audience.

49
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,000
And so you can assume a certain level of education but you probably can't

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,570
assume a lot of background knowledge with your topic.

51
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,050
But so you're addressing points that are appropriate for the topic, yeah,

52
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,010
you covered the right stuff, and for the audience, yeah, that's what we

53
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,130
needed to do hear.

54
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:46,660
Also what's under this category, you balanced breadth and depth well in

55
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,020
discussion of the topic.

56
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,380
So I mentioned this in the last lecture, sometimes people getting lost

57
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:56,240
in the details without the larger sense of context, or sometimes people

58
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,590
only talking about the big ideas without providing a sense of evidence.

59
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,100
So you can think about the breadth and depth.

60
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,480
Big ideas, concrete details.

61
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,080
We have this problem in business.

62
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,160
We have this problem in science.

63
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,080
We have this problem any time somebody stands up to speak.

64
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,660
And it's finding that appropriate balance between breadth and

65
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,910
depth that is key.

66
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,890
So that's our first category of invention--

67
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,400
big picture ideas.

68
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,570
Is this speech fitted appropriately to the topic and to the audience?

69
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,510
Also under invention, we've got evidence and explanation.

70
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,060
Because that's what you're doing a lot in the speech is you're informing us.

71
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,540
So you're relying on evidence and your ability to explain it well.

72
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,090
So in this, we're looking at, did the speaker include

73
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,890
appropriate, varied evidence?

74
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:45,140
So, are you looping in a number of different types of evidence.

75
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,740
It's not 100% statistics, but you've got some statistics, some interesting

76
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,040
narratives, a nice example.

77
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,550
You're providing that audience with multiple pathways into your topic.

78
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,200
So you've got a good variety of evidence.

79
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,750
And then, most importantly, you're using that evidence to explain the

80
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,480
topic clearly and effectively.

81
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,370
So the evidence isn't cluttering the ground of your speech, rather the

82
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,630
evidence is really sharpening what's going on in your

83
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,770
explanation of those ideas.

84
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,760
Then we get to arrangement.

85
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,910
Arrangement, once again, you've got to make a decision here.

86
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,220
Did the speaker arrange the speech in a clear and logical manner?

87
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:30,640
So since it's informing, we want crystal clarity when it comes to this

88
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,850
idea or these topics.

89
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,850
So you have to make a decision about-- and we'll talk to these--

90
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,280
about what arrangement pattern, what way of structuring the speech, is the

91
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,600
most logical and accessible for an audience that doesn't

92
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,430
know the topic well?

93
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,270
Then we get into some of the nitty gritty parts of arrangement.

94
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,760
Did you orient the audience to the topic in the introduction clearly and

95
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,550
effectively?

96
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,150
So we did some stuff in the impromptu under introductions.

97
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,325
We're going to be talking more about introductions for

98
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:01,500
an informative speech.

99
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,340
They're more-- probably more elaborate.

100
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,410
They've got more going on in them.

101
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,880
But it's really about bringing that audience up to speed so they can

102
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,190
follow along with what you're going to say.

103
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,330
So introductions--

104
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,080
orientations and the introduction.

105
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,010
Transitions.

106
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,590
Did you transition between the main parts clearly and effectively?

107
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,550
Conclusion.

108
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,830
Again, these are going to be bigger than they were in the impromptu.

109
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,710
But did you conclude the speech appropriately and effectively?

110
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,020
Then we get into style.

111
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,530
So under style, did you use clear and accessible language?

112
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:34,320
Was the very vocabulary that you used helping you convey information or was

113
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,930
it getting in the way?

114
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,120
Did you demonstrate an understanding, a thorough

115
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,300
understanding, of the topic?

116
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,830
Once again, this is sort of that credibility issue.

117
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:47,150
Do you sound like you know what you're talking about?

118
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,480
And I'm not here, by the way, I'm not saying, in this class, we focus merely

119
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,340
on effective lying about one's expertise.

120
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,600
That's not it at all.

121
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,450
But I would say, you must know what you're talking about.

122
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,060
But that in and of itself may not be sufficient.

123
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,960
You need to not only know what you're talking about, but you need to be able

124
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,130
to look like you know what you're talking about.

125
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,610
I don't want to say that you can look like you know what you're talking

126
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,010
about without knowing what you're talking about.

127
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,590
I don't think the inverse is true.

128
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,350
Or at least I certainly don't want to talk to it

129
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,920
because it's hugely unethical.

130
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,360
But I do want to say, not only should you know what you're talking about,

131
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,590
but it should look like it.

132
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,400
So too with your sense of excitement.

133
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,370
And again-- well, I'll link to a number of TED talks.

134
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,040
But one of things that you see in a lot of those TED talks, and is perhaps

135
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,560
pushed in those TED talks, is very much performing your interest in it.

136
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,330
And, as a speaker, we do this all the time, right?

137
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,860
So it's not enough to be interested in it, you have to look like it.

138
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,870
And I think we can get at that through a study of imitation.

139
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,870
I think we can get at being able to perform that sense of investment and

140
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,120
excitement in a topic.

141
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,710
Then we get into memory and delivery.

142
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,810
Did you use notes effectively and appropriately?

143
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,190
It's a more elaborate speech.

144
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,880
It's fine that you use notes.

145
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,740
But I want to make sure that you're not reading a manuscript, that you've

146
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,350
developed notes that are helpful to you in order to present this.

147
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,470
By the way, this is a five- to ten-minute speech.

148
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,020
You don't need notes for a five- to ten-minute speech.

149
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,030
Certainly, you can prep something, refine it, and practice it such that

150
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,970
you can do a ten-minute speech without ever looking at notes and not having

151
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,800
to memorize it.

152
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,750
That's doable.

153
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,850
You have the mental capacity.

154
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:29,850
Insofar as you were able to click a mouse and see this video, you can hold

155
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,070
a ten-minute speech in your head.

156
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:35,300
But also, are you using delivery to distinguish between key ideas and

157
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,510
elaborating detail?

158
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,950
That's some arrangement issues, but it's in how you're performing that.

159
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,230
Are you distinguishing between big ideas and detail for us?

160
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,140
And then many of the other delivery categories are the same as they were

161
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,260
in the impromptu speech.

162
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,440
You're using projection, pacing and pausings, gesture and movement,

163
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,770
effectively and appropriately.

164
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,040
So I like being able to use rubrics.

165
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,820
I think they're useful because it helps us think about the

166
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,920
next couple of weeks.

167
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,040
So as we move through the various video lectures for the rest of this

168
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,790
week and the next two weeks, you'll notice that almost all--

169
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,090
each one of them is hitting one of those learning objectives, one of

170
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,990
those evaluation criteria.

171
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,570
So there's nothing that is on that evaluative form that we haven't talked

172
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,900
about in this class.

173
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,670
This is a useful way of thinking about informative speeches, for practicing

174
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,720
speeches for this class.

175
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,180
And I would say that the categories that we just talked about, the

176
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,159
concerns that we just talked about, are certainly useful for any type of

177
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,750
informative presentation you're going to give outside of this class.

178
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,039
I would hope if you have to give a presentation tomorrow presenting

179
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:45,010
information at work, that you could use that rubric as a way of at least

180
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,900
clarifying some issues for you.

181
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,700
But above all, what I think that-- not above all.

182
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,037
I like ending on "above all," but this is a not an "above all," this is an

183
00:08:53,037 --> 00:08:54,380
"also."

184
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,390
So you should be able to use it for practice.

185
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,790
You should be able to use it to help your informative presentations outside

186
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,520
this class.

187
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,870
And also, it provides quality feedback.

188
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:10,550
The peer review system needs to have, on the front end, clarity as to what

189
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,890
evaluation means.

190
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,670
And so I think going through the rubric helps us with that.

191
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,450
In the next lecture, what we'll do is we'll take a look at-- like we did

192
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,060
last time-- a sample speech using the rubric.

193
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,310
