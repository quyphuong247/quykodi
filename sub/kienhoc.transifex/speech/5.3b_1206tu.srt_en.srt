00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,670
MATT MCGARRITY: So that's simplicity.

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,530
Let's talk a little bit about balance.

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,590
So in balance we're thinking, do the different parts of the speech feel to

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,800
be of appropriate length and complexity?

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,650
So at one very basic level, the body of your speech, the main point should

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,830
be the longest point.

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,480
I think that's pretty fair, right?

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,240
So especially in an informative speech like this, if you've got 10 minutes,

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,860
you spend five minutes on the introduction, telling us about how

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,270
awesome the concept's going to be when you get to it, then you spend one

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,100
minute talking about the concept, and then two more minutes going, was that

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,400
not the most awesome thing in the world?

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,300
That's probably a misallocation of your time resources.

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,440
The body of the speech where the core ideas are, where your main information

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,930
delivering is occurring is probably going to be the main portion of your

16
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,840
time as a speaker.

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,160
But in terms of looking at those main points, we're not looking to say, oh,

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,370
I've got three main points.

19
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,700
Each one of them is the exact same amount of time.

20
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,840
That's not really the goal here, but that the points are appropriate to

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,780
their scope.

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,020
So you're not spending too long on a small point, and not too

23
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,430
long on a big point.

24
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:15,055
So if we go back to that example research presentation that I discussed

25
00:01:15,055 --> 00:01:19,060
the last lecture, or two lectures ago, so if you're looking at this, we've

26
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:23,900
got sort of my area of research, the procedure, the findings, discussion,

27
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,710
implications.

28
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,880
So we've got a lot of points here.

29
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,710
But many of these points are necessary for research presentation, because the

30
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,160
audience are probably going to want that.

31
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,530
Now given that, you don't really want to spend too much time, especially for

32
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,940
lay audiences, on that procedure.

33
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,810
That procedure might be an important thing that you need to address, but

34
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,220
you don't need to spend too much of your time there.

35
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,480
And in fact, when I will work with scientists, this is the problem.

36
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:57,490
Their life, or their interest, or their fascination has been spent on

37
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,890
designing the research, figuring this stuff out.

38
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:04,280
And the implications are fine, but they spend too much time on the

39
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,050
procedure, also probably because it comes first, and they end up rushing

40
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,610
through the implications.

41
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,570
And for certain audiences, those implications are the speech.

42
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,140
That's what they want to hear.

43
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,230
The findings are the reason they're listening to this presentation.

44
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,550
Not how you set up the study.

45
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,570
They might not know how, they might not care how.

46
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:27,400
So the issue is that's a point that, in a scientific presentation, you

47
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,450
might have to include.

48
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,360
How I designed the study.

49
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,810
But that doesn't mean that you have to spend as much time talking about study

50
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,290
design as you do about the findings.

51
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:42,280
Based on the audience, you need to allocate time based on how much is

52
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,480
appropriate for the needs of this particular audience.

53
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,790
So simplicity, balance, and finally order.

54
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:53,610
So order just simply speaks to does the arrangement make sense to an

55
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,970
audience member?

56
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,880
Is there a logic driving your arrangement?

57
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,210
And if it's not readily apparent on the part of the audience, are you

58
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,800
explaining it?

59
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,460
So if you've done all this work of putting together a logical speech, an

60
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,080
organized speech, don't hide it.

61
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,000
Explain it.

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,580
Draw our attention to it.

63
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,450
Provide and highlight the organizing logic of your presentation.

64
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,685
So are there two really important findings I want to talk about?

65
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:23,330
Oh, OK.

66
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,610
I know what you're talking about, and I know where we're going.

67
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,270
This project is going to move once, we get the funding is going to move

68
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:35,370
through design, through data analysis, data gathering, and then finally into

69
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,200
the analysis.

70
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,980
Oh, that makes sense that you organize it that way.

71
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,420
There's a sense of order there.

72
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,560
There's a logic.

73
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,780
That chronological order has a logic to it.

74
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,140
So simplicity, balance, and order are principles that you can apply when

75
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,500
evaluating your outline.

76
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,690
It's a way of looking back on it and going, gosh, you know, aesthetically,

77
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,860
can I cut this down?

78
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,640
Can I make it simpler?

79
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,530
So I started this video lecture with a reference to a

80
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,580
public speaking textbook.

81
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,680
I spend a lot of time with public speaking textbooks, so I'd like to go

82
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,780
ahead and sort of, near the end here, tie it to another one.

83
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,530
So William Keith and Christian Lundberg have an excellent public

84
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,640
speaking textbook, and in their discussion of informative speaking,

85
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,990
they've got a line that I absolutely love.

86
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:25,260
And it is clarity is the result of choices.

87
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,100
And that's where we're at at this point in the week, and in your

88
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:36,630
outline, is making the choices that can not guarantee, but at least drive

89
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,010
greater clarity.

90
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,780
And this is why last week I talked about that iterative approach, doing

91
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,940
multiple passes on revising, reflecting, and running your speech,

92
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,980
because that first pass when you're pulling that information together,

93
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,150
you're probably still trying to figure out the speech.

94
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,760
You're learning that material.

95
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,670
You're learning how it fits together.

96
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,420
You're still kind of, even though you're running it, you're very much in

97
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,330
that invention mode.

98
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,080
But only after you've run it a couple of times can you start to enact your

99
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,240
judgment, and then you're making choices and decisions that are going

100
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,190
to reach greater clarity for that audience.

101
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,470
So what I would like you to do now, I've asked you to start pulling

102
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,290
together an outline.

103
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,960
And if you haven't, I ask you to do that now.

104
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,300
But what I think you should do is go back to the outline that you do have,

105
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,570
either for a speech for this class, or for a speech that you're doing for

106
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,780
outside of this class that's informative in scope, and apply these

107
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,280
principles to your revision.

108
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,820
Can you simplify and consolidate main points?

109
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,060
Can you make it simpler?

110
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,270
Can you reduce how many levels there are on that outline?

111
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,820
And then in terms of balance, are you putting time where you need to be

112
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,690
putting time for the topic, for the audience, or is there a misallocation?

113
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:55,590
Do you really, deep in your heart know you're spending too long in this

114
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,990
point, and you need to cut material out of it?

115
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,040
And yeah, as much as you hate to admit it, you need to spend more time here,

116
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,460
so you need to go find more material for it.

117
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,550
And then finally, just looking at that outline, is the logic apparent?

118
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,780
And if not, what can you do to make sure that that audience

119
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,040
understands the logic?

120
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,950
And they're like, oh, it makes perfect sense that you would

121
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,410
organize it in that way.

122
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,680
So speech is not a mystery novel.

123
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,770
We shouldn't only know at the end why you did what you did.

124
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,730
Oh, I did not know this was about a Mars Rover.

125
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,650
Fascinating.

126
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,060
That's what you meant by that.

127
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,820
So we're not doing that.

128
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,370
Give us the organizing logic.

129
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,180
Help us understand, so that we can be an active member, as members of the

130
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,100
audience, an active member of the creation of the meaning that is in

131
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,350
your speech.

132
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:42,810
