1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,270
MATT McGARRITY: So then we've got constraints and what the speech does.

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,510
Now we've got to start dialing in the process.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,090
What are you trying to do with a potential topic?

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,740
And how are the rhetorical constraints weighing upon that?

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,120
So let's say you're presenting research.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,020
Let's say you're a scientific researcher.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,770
And that presentation would change if you are presenting in front of a

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:29,140
funding board, trying to look for additional grant support, or if you're

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,940
presenting at a retirement home.

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,070
I don't know how that is other places in the world,

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,240
retirement homes love speakers.

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,720
And so there's lots of opportunities to go speak at retirement homes.

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,610
And so if you're presenting to that sort of lay public, you could be

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,500
talking about the exact same topic and have much of the exact same evidence.

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,870
But the speech is different.

16
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,900
The presentation is different, because those two different

17
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,200
constraints are different.

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,930
That funding board is experts, and they're looking for certain types of

19
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:57,820
information.

20
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:03,200
That retirement home I'm assuming is not a retirement home for retired

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,150
scientists.

22
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,930
But so it's a lay audience.

23
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,710
They need a little bit more background with the topic matter itself.

24
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:14,170
So as a thought experiment, as a way of working through this in a specific

25
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,560
way, let's talk about what you might choose to do for your informative

26
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,730
speech for this class.

27
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,050
Well, first let's think about what's the relationship between the topic and

28
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:24,980
the audience?

29
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,230
So in this assignment, you want to give us new information.

30
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,190
OK, so then it's like well, what sort of topic works for

31
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,540
this massive audience?

32
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,350
Rhetorician Chaim Perelman used to talk about the universal audience.

33
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,380
And that's something very specific for him.

34
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,380
You actually have a-- well, not a universal audience.

35
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,730
I don't know how far it goes out.

36
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,080
I don't think there's anyone on another planet going, this is

37
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,160
fascinating stuff.

38
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,620
So yours is a global audience.

39
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,950
But what is useful?

40
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,210
What is interesting for an audience of this scope?

41
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,760
And I think you can assume little background.

42
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,610
So whatever you're talking on, you need to assume that we're starting

43
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,560
basically from first position.

44
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,460
We don't know a lot about your topic.

45
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,620
I do think you can assume basic level of education.

46
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:15,860
But certainly, you have to meet us where we are as an audience.

47
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,870
OK, so the topic and the audience relationship, thinking about that for

48
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,730
this class.

49
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,690
Topic and speaker or relationship.

50
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,760
OK, so what's within your wheelhouse, in your bailiwick?

51
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,880
What is your area of expertise?

52
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,560
And expertise can mean various things.

53
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,000
If you've got a hobby, what is something that you spend a lot of time

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,790
within, that you just know particularly well?

55
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,650
If it's your job, what's something that from your job that you can share

56
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,810
with the rest of us that is beneficial to us, that we should understand?

57
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,710
Once again, I don't want you to spend too much time doing outside research

58
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,710
trying to figure out what you're going to be speaking on.

59
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:55,380
Take something that you can speak on with some expertise.

60
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,610
Then, we get into the occasion.

61
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,300
Well, this is a class on public speaking.

62
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,830
So you know, what's an appropriate concern for this class?

63
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,900
And I would say here, aim to be truly informative, OK?

64
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,270
Not agenda-setting.

65
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:14,430
So you could do a presentation on, if you were here, you could do a

66
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,130
presentation on the major tourist attractions of Seattle.

67
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,450
That's an informative speech.

68
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,330
That's helpful for me, even living here in Seattle, or for somebody who's

69
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,380
not from here.

70
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,250
What are the major tourist attractions of Seattle?

71
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,130
That's fine as an informative speech.

72
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,610
This is not fine as an informative speech.

73
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,710
The empirical reasons why Portland, Oregon is a horrible city.

74
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,720
That's not truly informative.

75
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,410
You're pushing an agenda there.

76
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,470
Are five reasons why everyone in Portland is ugly.

77
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,480
It's astonishing.

78
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,990
Scientists have demonstrated this.

79
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,730
That's not an informative speech.

80
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,600
Portland's awesome.

81
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,090
The people there are beautiful, hipster-y in all their ways.

82
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,680
And so I'm trying to use that as an illustration.

83
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,905
I want these speeches, you should want these speeches, to be informative.

84
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,830
You're not sneaking in anything like that.

85
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,940
Aim to be informative and noncontroversial.

86
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,890
Don't talk about how awful Portland is.

87
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,620
Because it isn't.

88
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,760
Then we're thinking about your topic and time.

89
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,500
So this is a 5 to 10 minute speech, 5 to 10 minute address.

90
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,410
How can you address your potential ideas in that time frame?

91
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,820
Because quite honestly, 5 to 10 minutes is not a lot of time.

92
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,020
That's pretty tight.

93
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,880
So you're looking at just a handful of points.

94
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,440
And you've got to really dial in that topic so that you can cover it in the

95
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,500
allotted time.

96
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,430
Now, that can mean various things.

97
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:41,370
I can talk could talk about the history of rhetoric in 10 minutes.

98
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,320
But my points are massive.

99
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,930
The classical tradition, the medieval tradition, and the modern tradition.

100
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,380
I can do that in 10 minutes.

101
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,340
That's a lot of breadth and depth.

102
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,010
But I could also in 10 minutes dial it in to one specific concept from the

103
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,240
classical tradition.

104
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,490
So you know, it's not that 10 minutes means you have to go hyper specific.

105
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,510
But that the points that you're coming up with are

106
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,700
appropriate for 10 minutes.

107
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,940
The history of the universe in 10 minutes.

108
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,480
They're going to be big points.

109
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,460
They're not going to be, first, let's get into the very specific details

110
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,660
about hydrogen particles.

111
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,350
That would take a really long time to do that presentation.

112
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,920
But you're thinking about how can the topic fit to the time.

113
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,490
So what are some potential topic ideas for this assignment for this class?

114
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,370
Research updates, some stuff that you do that you just know about.

115
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,230
New products, if that's your area.

116
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,310
Scientific breakthroughs, if you happen to follow that, you're

117
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,970
interested in those type of things.

118
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,040
You can report to us on some new scientific breakthroughs.

119
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,580
You don't have to be the one who made the breakthrough.

120
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,650
You can just tell us about some of these.

121
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,470
Some interesting ideas, history.

122
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,500
Love history speeches, they're easy to arrange.

123
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,330
And places or travel destinations.

124
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,690
So if I was-- and I'm going to work up a topic for this as a way of

125
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,310
demonstrating the various stages of this class.

126
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,160
If I'm coming up with a topic idea for this class, I'm going to sit down and

127
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,480
I'm going to think about my areas of expertise.

128
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,750
My areas of expertise are rhetoric, online education, increasingly,

129
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,040
graduate education--

130
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,540
because I teach classes on that as well-- and Seattle.

131
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,200
Not the foremost expert on Seattle.

132
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,380
But it's awesome, and I know a lot about it.

133
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,830
So if I'm looking through those and I'm thinking in terms of what would be

134
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,490
interesting to an audience, well, I can't go hyper specific.

135
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,520
But I need something that's going to be accessible to them.

136
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,810
And I've also got to think about 5 to 10 minutes.

137
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,390
So in 5 to 10 minutes, I could probably talk a little bit about

138
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,780
Isocrates, who was a rhetorician.

139
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,000
Not Socrates.

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,700
Isocrates, contemporary of Socrates, but different rhetorician.

141
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,050
So I could talk about Isocrates.

142
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,950
I could talk about the rhetorical concept of kairos.

143
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,820
Very specific thing, but it has a lot.

144
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,180
It's a very rich term.

145
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,300
I'm probably going to end up doing this one.

146
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,940
I could talk about a brief history of presidential debate, American

147
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,680
presidential debate.

148
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,920
That's something I've spoken on in the past.

149
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,840
I could talk about Seattle's Great Fire.

150
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,080
We have big fire here, like Chicago had a fire, we had a fire.

151
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,900
Leveled all of downtown, kind of interesting, because it changed the

152
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,240
way that the city developed.

153
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,400
I could do a 5 to 10 minute presentation on how to write a letter

154
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,230
of application to a graduate school.

155
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,760
All of those are things that are within my realm of expertise, can be

156
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,020
covered in 10, minutes and I think would be interesting to a vast

157
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,500
majority of this online audience.

158
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,900
So those are some of the potential topics.

159
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,150
But again, this is a matter of judgment.

160
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:38,600
And so you are now in the process of puzzling through what is an

161
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,050
appropriate response.

162
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,620
By the way, appropriate is a different from right.

163
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,340
There is no one right way to address one topic for one audience.

164
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:53,570
There are multiple ways, based on your unique skills, traits, and abilities.

165
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,150
So you're thinking in terms of what is the appropriate fit, what is the

166
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:01,240
appropriate response to these various rhetorical constraints.

167
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,460
So I'd ask you to be thinking more about this.

168
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,710
In the last lecture of this week, we're going to take up speech goals.

169
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,620
So it would help, between the end of this video and the beginning of the

170
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:17,470
next one, if you've jotted down three or four ideas for a topic presentation

171
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,530
