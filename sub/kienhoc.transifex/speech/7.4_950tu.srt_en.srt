00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,440
MATT MCGARRITY: One really good way, I think, to start working through this

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,770
speech assignment is to watch a sample.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,900
What I would like you to do, as we've done in the past, is go ahead and

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,720
watch this speech and reflect on it.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,940
And really use that evaluation form as a way of organizing your thoughts, not

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,320
only in terms of evaluating the speech, but also thinking about what

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,790
you might elect to do differently if you were speaking on the same topic,

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,390
or where you might strategize in a different way than does this speaker.

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,290
So go ahead and take a look at that with that evaluation form now.

10
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,500
SPEAKER 1: When we look at the chocolate we eat, the tea we drink, or

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,200
the soap we use, we often think of the name brand companies

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,730
behind these products.

13
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,610
But how often do we consider the hands behind the products

14
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,470
that we use and consume?

15
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:50,380
Today, people of all ages around the world are receiving minute pay to

16
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,640
produce the goods that sell big.

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,520
Companies gain huge revenue.

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,130
And yet the people behind their products get little compensation.

19
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:03,250
To begin to close this disparity, fair trade has become a growing concept.

20
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:08,800
Fair trade is defined as a trading partnership, based on dialogue,

21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,220
transparency, and respect, that seeks greater equity in international trade.

22
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,840
This idea aims to empower marginalized people and improve the quality of

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,480
their lives.

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,350
Fair trade aims to pay fair wages to every worker, increase labor and

25
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,400
living conditions, and push developing countries toward stable production.

26
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,950
However, current efforts to support fair trade around the world are

27
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,630
inadequate.

28
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,570
Developing countries have yet to see direct benefits of fair trade

29
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,550
consumption.

30
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:46,520
And as a developed society, we can help propel the progressive goals of

31
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,420
fair trade.

32
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,160
Currently, fair trade items only make up a small portion of consumer

33
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,890
products in developed countries.

34
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,910
And this is largely because we inherently choose to

35
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,060
purchase cheaper goods.

36
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,290
Stores around the US carry very few fair trade items, as low as 1% of

37
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,890
their inventory.

38
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,620
Most items we buy are conventional.

39
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,150
We buy them cheaply and laborers are paid cheaply.

40
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:16,680
Over one quarter of a million children in the Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria,

41
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,500
and Cameroon work in forced labor conditions on conventional cocoa,

42
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,930
cotton, and coffee farms.

43
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,870
For every $3 latte bought in the US, the workers who pick those coffee

44
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,960
beans are paid on average just $0.02.

45
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,950
And Nestle, the world's largest food company, produces some of the most

46
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,830
popular chocolate bars we know.

47
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,840
And out of over 6,000 products, the only fair trade item Nestle has

48
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,710
managed to put out is the Kit Kat bar.

49
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,630
The rest of their cocoa comes from forced labor farms

50
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,560
along the Ivory Coast.

51
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,250
And these workers are part of the individuals that don't receive the

52
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,030
benefits of fair trade.

53
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,860
And this is because we unintentionally contribute to a system where companies

54
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,900
can take advantage of workers.

55
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,230
So as a nation promoting international relationships, our country can do a

56
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,830
lot more to ensure fair trade is accessible, both within the country as

57
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,640
well as in developing areas around the world .

58
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,430
The United States Farm Bill is a huge barrier in efforts to integrate fair

59
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,850
trade products.

60
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,270
It was originally designed as a security system for American farms

61
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,320
during the Great Depression, by distributing subsidies

62
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,110
to struggling farmers.

63
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,790
But today, this is a disproportionate distributor, handing large sums of

64
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,540
government money to large-scale farmers to overproduce staple crops.

65
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,560
This is devastating to small farmers and small companies around the world,

66
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,600
because it decreases their abilities to export goods to large consumer

67
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,680
societies like the United States.

68
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,410
We need to call on Congress to overturn this act so that we can

69
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:01,200
promote a market for fair trade goods and have the opportunity to put more

70
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,780
sales of fair trade items into our economy.

71
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,840
In fact, if African countries can increase their share of world exports

72
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,640
by just 1%, they would generate $70 billion.

73
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:19,510
This is five times more than how much they receive in aid.

74
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:24,030
So increasing prevalence of fair trade goods means more revenue.

75
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,710
And more revenue means more opportunities to build sustainable

76
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,960
economies and lifestyles.

77
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,110
This begins with overturning barriers for growth.

78
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,190
But merely petitioning to Congress is not enough.

79
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,180
We as individuals have the power to directly benefit

80
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,000
workers around the world.

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,510
Certain clothing, coffee, fruits, soaps, and chocolates are all staples

82
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,350
that are produced fairly.

83
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,300
These items are labeled with the certified fair trade label so that we

84
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,630
as consumers can be sure of where our items came from and be sure we got

85
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,370
them fairly.

86
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:05,630
The prices we pay for fair trade items go directly to the producers, cutting

87
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,550
out the middleman that grabs profit.

88
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,040
So supporting this cause is an achievable goal for all of us.

89
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,380
For ourselves and for producers in developing countries, fair trade is an

90
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,700
incredibly vital issue.

91
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,610
We can seek out fair trade goods in place of conventional products and

92
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,620
push for our government and businesses to do the same.

93
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,010
Given the option to choose between conventional and fair trade, the

94
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,150
option is ultimately yours.

95
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:37,580
Fair trade, however, allows for all of us to provide quality livelihoods for

96
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,200
those who give us quality products.

97
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,430
MATT MCGARRITY: Now that you've taken a look at that, hopefully at least

98
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,520
thinking about some of those ideas on that evaluation form, go ahead and

99
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,000
when you go to the course page, there is, as there's been in the past, a

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,950
form, an evaluation form that I filled out for that speech with

101
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,170
my comments on it.

102
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,800
So go ahead and take a look at that evaluation form now.

103
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,050
