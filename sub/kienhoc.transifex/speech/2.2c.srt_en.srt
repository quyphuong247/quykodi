MATT MCGARRITY: Before we go too much further, I want to talk about two very

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:04,830
important concepts--

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,180
outlining and flowing.

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,500
And I want to talk about these, because I think these are going to be

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,920
very useful in general for you as you're delivering

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,110
and developing speeches.

7
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,740
But also, we're going to be doing this a lot in the impromptu, specifically.

8
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,700
So outlining you're probably familiar with.

9
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,650
You've probably been doing this a lot.

10
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,430
It's just basically preparing a speech in a hierarchical structure.

11
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,250
Now we're going to, when we get to the persuasive we'll actually do some more

12
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,530
manuscript stuff.

13
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,549
But to start with for the impromptu speech and the informative speech,

14
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,560
we're working in an outline format.

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,100
And why are we doing this?

16
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,670
Because I think outlines really set you up to extemporize well.

17
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:45,070
So last week of course, we talked about why and how reading manuscripts

18
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:49,010
can get you into trouble, in terms of adopting more of a performance

19
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,450
orientation, maybe having some monotone issues.

20
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,660
But we're going to start off our study of speech by working in a format that

21
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,490
really allows you to carefully plan what you want to say.

22
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,660
An outline gives you that sort of amount of control.

23
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,470
So it's going to allow you to carefully prepare

24
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,300
what you want to say.

25
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,560
But it also enables you to easily engage in a communication orientation.

26
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,380
So what might one of the sample outlines look like?

27
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,880
Well, for the impromptu, it's probably going to look a little

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,180
bit like this, right?

29
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,930
We've got a basic introduction.

30
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,030
I've got what probably my opening device is going to be, what my thesis

31
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,910
is, preview of my mean points.

32
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,840
I've got the body of the speech, my two main points.

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,750
I've got sort of what the language is of those main points.

34
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,660
And we'll get to that later this week.

35
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,680
And then I've kind of mapped out what my examples are.

36
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,580
So I kind of know which way I'm running in that speech.

37
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,120
But working off of an outline, I can extemporize it.

38
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,290
I can have those words emerge at that moment in response to

39
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,160
the specific situation.

40
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,850
So that's a basic outline.

41
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,030
Now that's probably something you are fairly familiar with.

42
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,950
The other concept that I want to talk through is flowing.

43
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,310
Flowing is just the flip side of outlining.

44
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,860
Flowing is taking notes on a speech in an outline format.

45
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,760
So why are we going to be flowing?

46
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,820
Well, flowing is very useful as an evaluative and an analytical tool,

47
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,030
because it allows you as a listener to track where the speaker is clear,

48
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,110
where they're unclear, where the argument is strong, where the

49
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,760
argument this weak.

50
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,140
So we outline our speeches and we're going to flow the speeches of others.

51
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,950
And I think both of these work together to sort of help you prepare

52
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,530
speeches better, and analyze speeches more critically, and being aware of

53
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,070
the various moving parts in each speech.

54
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,820
So what we're going to do now is we're going to watch a sample speaker.

55
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,780
And you'll see a split screen here.

56
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,750
And on one side is going to be the speaker doing a sample impromptu--

57
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,760
a student that I had who volunteered to help me out, doing a sample

58
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,740
impromptu speech.

59
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,070
And then the other hand, the other side will be, you'll see my flow.

60
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,040
That's my ugly hand and my terrible handwriting.

61
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,010
So you'll see how I'm listening.

62
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,770
I hadn't heard the speech before, so I'm just sort of on the fly taking

63
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,540
notes in an outline format.

64
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,170
I do apologize for the handwriting.

65
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,930
By the way, that's good for me.

66
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,005
So I've made huge advancements, but it's just-- it's awful.

67
00:03:12,005 --> 00:03:13,000
It's just terrible.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,650
But we're going to go ahead and take a look at that now.

69
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,340
And then I'll come back and sort of talk a little bit more about how

70
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,500
outlining and flowing can really help you out.

71
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,210
SPEAKER 2: So in these times of struggling economies, many

72
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,960
universities are looking towards ways to save money.

73
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,640
And one of these ways that universities are looking to cut from

74
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,660
the budget is cutting small departments with few student majors.

75
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,910
And I believe that we should not enact this policy for two main reasons.

76
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,300
Firstly, because it is harmful for students.

77
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,120
And secondly, because it doesn't guarantee savings.

78
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,610
But first let me go into why this policy would be harmful for students.

79
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,670
Well firstly, it would hinder student interest.

80
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,470
If a student's passion and future career goal is dance and the

81
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,880
department is cut, well that student can no longer pursue

82
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,350
their career option.

83
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,950
And so it is harmful for students who already know what they may want to be

84
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:08,810
pursuing, which may be more unique fields of opportunity.

85
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,270
The second reason why this policy would be harmful for students is

86
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,820
because it does not cater to post-university goals.

87
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,450
And what I mean by this is that competitive markets, such as graduate

88
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,650
schools and jobs, are looking for students who bring in unique

89
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:23,510
backgrounds.

90
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:27,450
And one great way of doing so is having an out-of-the-ordinary

91
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,190
educational upbringing.

92
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,230
Now if we eliminate these small departments, students are funneled

93
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,190
into these larger, more popular educational backgrounds, and therefore

94
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:40,230
do not look as appealing to schools and jobs.

95
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:45,680
And so because this policy would not cater to student interests nor to

96
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,690
future student opportunities, we can see that this policy simply wouldn't

97
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,675
be beneficial to enact.

98
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:58,100
But moving onto why this policy would not guarantee monetary savings, I

99
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,360
believe this firstly because we would see a decrease in tuition revenue.

100
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,490
Students who are looking towards these small departments and excited about

101
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,370
these small majors would now be looking towards other schools to

102
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,250
fulfill their educational needs.

103
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,670
And therefore, we may see decreased enrollment rates.

104
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:19,630
And since student intuition is such a huge part of university budgets today,

105
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:25,860
we would see incredible decrease in university revenue.

106
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,100
So secondly, universities would also have to accommodate for larger

107
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,210
departments.

108
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,930
These students that were originally in small departments and small majors

109
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,430
would be funneled into these existing departments, and therefore increase

110
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,300
class sizes and majors sizes.

111
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,630
And so as a result, universities would have to hire more professors, more

112
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,600
teaching assistants, and more faculty to accommodate these larger

113
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,880
departments.

114
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,480
And so because of this and this increased need in the university

115
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,950
budget, we wouldn't necessarily see monetary savings.

116
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:07,780
And so because we would see a decrease in tuition revenues and an increased

117
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,090
need for accommodating large departments, we can see that enacting

118
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,460
this policy would not necessarily save money.

119
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,190
And so in conclusion, universities need to find a

120
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,350
better way to save money.

121
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,830
Cutting these small departments and small majors simply isn't a beneficial

122
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,750
option for anyone.

123
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,000
Firstly, because it is harmful for students.

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,160
And secondly, because it does not guarantee savings.

125
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,330
SPEAKER 1: So that was my flow of the speech.

126
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,270
Again, apologies for the handwriting.

127
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:43,370
But I would imagine your flow of that speech looks more or less the same.

128
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,310
So I would recommend that you start flowing speeches in general, because I

129
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:53,740
really do believe it changes how you listen to and interact with a speech.

130
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,100
And the reason this is I think, is because there's so many things going

131
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,220
on in a speech.

132
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,340
Outlining and flowing allow you to see these various components and analyze

133
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,340
those various components in isolation, as well as how those various

134
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,780
components interact with one another.

135
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,250
So in the next lecture, we're going to take up the key elements of argument

136
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,380
that you're going to be using in the impromptu speech.

137
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,940
But I did think it was important to sort of talk to both outlining and

138
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,960
flowing at this stage in the class.

139
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,210
