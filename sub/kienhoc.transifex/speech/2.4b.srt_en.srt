MATT MCGARRITY: Having talked about coming up with your main points-- the

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,050
invention of those main points--

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,480
I now want to shift and talk about arranging those main points.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,240
Now, in order to do this, I want you to have something to

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,740
work with and evaluate.

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,750
So what I'd like you to do now is just go ahead and prepare an impromptu.

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,600
So you can go to the list on the website, and you can select one of

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,050
those impromptu prompts.

9
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,450
Or if none of those are to your liking, you can come up with your own

10
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,390
impromptu prompt.

11
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,110
But I do want you to come up with a prompt, and then--

12
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,810
as we mentioned last time-- decide if you're for or against it.

13
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,330
And then just draft up two claims.

14
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,480
At the end of the last lecture, I had you prep something-- so you can go

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,620
ahead and use that.

16
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,880
If it's been a week since you've been back to the class, that's fine--

17
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,380
welcome back.

18
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,840
But you can just go ahead and prep something new.

19
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,700
So go ahead and prep an impromptu now.

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,460
Go ahead.

21
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,710
I'll wait.

22
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,470


23
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,560
Welcome back.

24
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,810
Are you done?

25
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,090


26
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:07,290
So what I'd like to do now is take what you have for this prepped

27
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,540
impromptu, and I want to talk through some concepts.

28
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,920
I want to talk about subordination, coordination, and discreteness.

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,590
So to begin with-- subordination.

30
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:21,180
Subordination answers the question, is your discussion of the main point

31
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,950
advancing the thesis?

32
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,030
Are those main points subordinate to the thesis that they

33
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,710
are in service of?

34
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,160
Because remember the function of those main points.

35
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,560
The reason those main points are there are to support that thesis-- to

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,950
provide it with more meaning, more details, more texture.

37
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,420
So if we take a look at this sample prepped impromptu, public speaking

38
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,300
should be a university graduation requirement.

39
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,910
So if we look at these two claims--

40
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,640
these two claims are-- public speaking is good for jobs and public speaking

41
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,640
is good for civic obligations.

42
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,660
That thesis is about public speaking, but it's also about universities and

43
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,120
about requirements.

44
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,760
And that's not captured in those two claims.

45
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,360
Right?

46
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,539
Those two claims speak to a very different thesis.

47
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:12,330
If you look just from bottom to top-- if you just looked at those claims

48
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,200
before knowing what that thesis was, you would guess at a very different

49
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,680
thesis statement, right?

50
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,230
Public speaking is good for jobs.

51
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,430
Public speaking is good for civic obligations.

52
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,880
You might guess the thesis is public speaking is good--

53
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,270
it is very good.

54
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,470
But that's not what the thesis actually was attempting to argue.

55
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,150
So let's take a look at this one here.

56
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,100
So in this case, public speaking-- it's the same thesis statement--

57
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,070
public speaking should be a university graduation requirement because

58
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,670
universities can easily add public speaking to the list of requirements,

59
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,410
and public speaking adds value to a college degree.

60
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:52,040
So those seem to capture all the elements of the main point, right?

61
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,210
We've got something in there about universities.

62
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,510
We've got something in there about requirements.

63
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,220
And we've got sort of a general point about public speaking being good.

64
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,120
So we've captured sort of the key words--

65
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,210
the key ideas--

66
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,170
in that thesis in those main points.

67
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,130
So those two main points then are providing narrower details.

68
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,410
They're subordinate to the thesis.

69
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,740
So take a look at what you prepped up.

70
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,370
OK?

71
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,380
Are those two claims subordinate to the thesis that

72
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,020
you say you're arguing?

73
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,340
Right?

74
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,230
If you've got your claims on a sheet of paper, if you covered up that

75
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,780
thesis statement and just looked at those two claims, could you get a

76
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,720
pretty reasonable guess at what that thesis statement actually is?

77
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,190
So that's subordination.

78
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,580
That's a big important point.

79
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,770
I now want to talk about coordination and discreteness.

80
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,220
So in terms of coordination--

81
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,310
coordination simply means the main points work well together.

82
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,880
And this is important in these three- to six-minute impromptu speeches.

83
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,190
And it would be just as important in an hour and a half long speech.

84
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,160
So that's coordination.

85
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,980
And then on the flip side, discreteness.

86
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,530
Are the points discrete from one another?

87
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,040
So here our concern is that the main points don't overlap.

88
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,960
They address different realms--

89
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,780
different ways of being.

90
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,490
So historically, one of the problems has been is that people--

91
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:13,670
in response to a thesis, they'll come up with that first main point, but

92
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,110
it's massive.

93
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,350
It's huge.

94
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,940
And then they struggle to figure out what a second main point or third main

95
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,950
point might actually say.

96
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:27,110
So we want points that work well together but don't overlap too much.

97
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,240
So if we go back to this thesis statement-- this argument here.

98
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,070
Public speaking should be a university graduation requirement.

99
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,480
Why?

100
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,840
Because absorbing public speaking into the requirements is easy and adds much

101
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,220
to a liberal arts degree.

102
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,780
And second, the impromptu speech can help students with other classes.

103
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,330
That first point is huge.

104
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,990
That first point covers the known universe on this topic.

105
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,570
And so the second point--

106
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,160
not a whole bunch to say.

107
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,900
This second point is probably much closer to an example--

108
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,740
a piece of support-- than it is to an independent main point.

109
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,530
So if I'm looking at this-- if this were a Venn diagram, that second point

110
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,250
is completely contained within that first main point.

111
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,900
Now, I'm not saying that all your main points must be exactly the same

112
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,400
length, and deal in exactly the same scope.

113
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,280
But there should be a clear rationale driving the arrangement

114
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,780
of those main points.

115
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,360
So let's take a look at this one here.

116
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,850
Public speaking should be a university graduation requirement.

117
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,650
Why?

118
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,310
Because public speaking adds value to a college degree.

119
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,740
And because universities can easily add public speaking to the list of

120
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,830
requirements.

121
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,020
So here, they're sort of dealing with different realms.

122
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,310
Right?

123
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,770
We've got benefit and feasibility.

124
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,660
And I rearranged them, in this case, to move from large to smaller idea--

125
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,480
so a benefit being bigger than feasibility.

126
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,680
But I could easily see swapping the order and leading with feasibility.

127
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,200
Right?

128
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,580
Making this a requirement can be done, and it's a good thing.

129
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,620
So what I want you to do is go back to your impromptu and check.

130
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,600
Do your main points-- are they coordinate?

131
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,100
And are they also discrete?

132
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,790
Now, in looking at that, if you have the problem that we often have when

133
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,960
people start prepping these impromptus--

134
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,710
if you have the problem of a massive first point that kind of overshadows

135
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,630
and overtakes that second one, go back and look and see if maybe you can

136
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,650
crack that first one into two smaller bits.

137
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,650
Because that's really where you wanted the argument to be.

138
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,990
See what's actually going on in there, and maybe break it into smaller bits.

139
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,710
This, by the way, is also the benefit of mumbling your invention.

140
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,320
Right?

141
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,210
Because I can hear if two main points work well together, and if they're

142
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,290
actually subordinate to the thesis.

143
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,690
And I can do that a lot quicker than if I actually sat down and

144
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,540
wrote them out first.

145
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,835
So having talked about arrangement--

146
00:06:48,835 --> 00:06:51,680
invention of the main points, arrangement of the main points--

147
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,130
in the next lecture we're going to talk to how you're stylizing and how

148
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,860
you're phrasing those main points.

149
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,200
