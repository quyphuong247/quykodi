MATT MCGARRITY: We've spend a lot of time talking about content for the

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,790
informative speech.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,690
And now that we're in the final week of our discussion of the informative

4
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:13,050
speech, I want to get into a deeper analysis of style and delivery.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,740
And how these two things interact so well.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,040
And we're going to do this to a discussion of ethos.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,760
So we're going to be spending a couple videos now, analyzing,

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,260
talking about ethos.

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,030
In this one, we'll talk about ethos very generally, do a case study.

10
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,960
Then, we'll move on to keep those in informative speaking, more

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,180
particularly, and do another case study.

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,610
But so in this lecture, what I want to talk about is-- first

13
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,070
off, defining ethos.

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,800
Just giving you a sense for what it is.

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,970
Then, I want to discuss its components--

16
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,410
the three, sort of, components of ethos.

17
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,660
And then, I want to talk about the case study that you're going to be

18
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,790
looking at.

19
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,930
So to begin with, what is ethos?

20
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,690
Well, it's commonly defined as the speaker's credibility--

21
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,600
specifically, as it's developed in the speech, OK?

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,660
Speaker's credibility--

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,870
so obviously, I'm not the one who came up with the term ethos.

24
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,630
Ethos comes from Aristotle.

25
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,440
Aristotle's treatise length discussion of rhetoric

26
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,390
ingeniously named The Rhetoric.

27
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,800
But in that, he looks at a number of major proofs.

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,480
And he says, how do we convince somebody of an idea?

29
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,760
Well, we've talked about this in week one of this course in

30
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,030
the overview of rhetoric.

31
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,420
But he talks about logos, pathos, and ethos--

32
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,820
logos pathos, and ethos.

33
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,640
And he suggests that ethos is potentially the most

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,340
persuasive of these.

35
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,050
So we believe something because we're convinced of it, logically--

36
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:39,600
logos.

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,130
Or maybe because we're moved by the subject matter-- pathos.

38
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,680
Or ethos--

39
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,090
we believe something because we believe the person.

40
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,870
We trust the person.

41
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,780
So that's what ethos is-- really being able to perform our own

42
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,820
credibility on a subject.

43
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,180
So that's what ethos is.

44
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,160
What are its components?

45
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,060
Well, again, I want to stay with Aristotle.

46
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,840
Because his terminology in is thinking on this is useful, OK?

47
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,180
And in many ways, it's been reaffirmed by things that we've

48
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,470
learned over time.

49
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,570
But when he's looking at ethos, he suggests that ethos is made up of sort

50
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,120
of three basic components--

51
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,320
phronesis, arete, and eunoia, OK?

52
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,810
And I'll define each one of those.

53
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,810
So to begin with, phronesis.

54
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,420
Phronesis, probably for Aristotle, we can define as practical

55
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,710
wisdom or good judgment.

56
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,320
So it's not simply having a theoretical knowledge of an idea, but

57
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,380
being able to do something with that.

58
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,500
Someone who not only has mastery of their subject matter, but it can

59
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,980
translate into better practice, OK?

60
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,750
So for our sense, for these informative speeches, or for thinking

61
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,960
very broadly about informative speaking, it is the performance of

62
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,460
knowing what you're talking about.

63
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,890
You should know what you're talking about.

64
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,390
That's evident.

65
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,440
But you should also look like what you're talking about.

66
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,370
So you should have phronesis.

67
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,260
You should be the phronemos.

68
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,890
But not only that, you should be able to convey that, OK?

69
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,350
So we're going to be looking at how do you how do you telegraph the knowledge

70
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,260
that you have?

71
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,470
Really make sure that we as audience members are aware that you know what

72
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,410
you're talking about.

73
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,310
So phronesis and arete--

74
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:20,900
arete, usually rich concept in classical Greek rhetoric, in classical

75
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,770
Greek thought.

76
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:26,610
But arete is excellence or virtue.

77
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,990
For somebody like Aristotle, it would be sort of the fulfillment of purpose.

78
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,570
Sometimes when--

79
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:36,210
in other classes, I'll talk about arete as sort of just

80
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,550
leadership-ly-ness, Kennedy-ness.

81
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:44,950
This sense of excellence as it's performed, as it seen, as we

82
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,010
understand it when we're watching someone.

83
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,590
Now, in a more specific sense here, we could maybe think about arete in terms

84
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,540
of sort of that dynamism, or dynamic performance, or leadership.

85
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,330
Sort of being electric around your subject matter.

86
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:06,230
Just having that sense of excellence around your subject matter.

87
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,870
So phronesis, arete, and eunoia--

88
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,190
eunoia is generally goodwill, or specifically

89
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,730
goodwill towards audience.

90
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:19,500
In our case here, it would be the audience really getting a sense that

91
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,600
you want them to understand.

92
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,830
Or you're performing the speech for them.

93
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,930
That there's goodwill on the part of the speaker.

94
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,330
That there's a genuine desire to educate or inform, OK?

95
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:37,580
So these three broad components sort of come together for Aristotle under

96
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,900
this larger heading of ethos.

97
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,290
That's how ethos is sort of mapped out in the particular sense.

98
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:47,370
And I like these, because they allow us to think about ethos as a

99
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,520
performance.

100
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,630
Not as fake, not as inauthentic, but as a performance.

101
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,480
Because it's this sense of ethos, the sense of credibility is not

102
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,820
just what you say.

103
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,560
That's probably the realm of invention.

104
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,780
But it's how you say it-- style, the vocabulary that you're using.

105
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,580
And in many ways, who you all are in the speech--

106
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,880
it just-- who we can sense you as being in the speech--

107
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,680
that's this realm of credibility.

108
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,430
That's this realm of ethos.

109
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,700
So those are some general ideas about ethos.

110
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,250
And that's very useful.

111
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,550
But I really want to get into the ethos through case studies.

112
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,320
Because there, I can look at specific performance choices.

113
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,700
And say, here's what I think is working to augment their credibility,

114
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,180
and here's maybe something that's working against it.

115
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:40,310
So the clip that we're going to use to get into ethos is a political one.

116
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,560
But I don't want you to watch it politically.

117
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,760
The event is not strictly an informative speech setting, but we'll

118
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,630
get to one that strictly informative speech setting in two

119
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,260
lectures from now.

120
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:57,800
But I like this clip because it shows a nice contrast of ethos styles, of

121
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,880
competing ethoses.

122
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:06,360
And so, this clip comes from 1992 US Presidential Elections.

123
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,710
And those of you who aren't familiar with the '92 Presidential Elections--

124
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:14,250
as one of our camera guys just aloud told me, he was one year old.

125
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,350
It's always good to be reminded how old you are.

126
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:21,700
That's the great thing about teaching university is each year the references

127
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,590
that are so fresh in your brain make you look more and more like an

128
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,660
doddering fool.

129
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,340
Hey, who remembers this TV show that's been canceled from two years ago, from

130
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,400
18 years ago?

131
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,860
No one, old man.

132
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,580
Go home.

133
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,920
Anyway, slight diversion because that made me very angry.

134
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,160
But anyway, for those of you who don't remember--

135
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,670
this for him-- for those of you who don't remember the '92 Election, this

136
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,950
is when George Bush, Senior was running for re-election.

137
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,450
And this was when Bill Clinton was running for his election.

138
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,470
He ended up winning.

139
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,910
We also had a third party candidate at that time, Ross Perot.

140
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,380
So you can see here, the popular vote totals as well as the Electoral

141
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,050
College vote totals.

142
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:07,950
So Clinton won that election with sizable Electoral College victory, not

143
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,890
a sizable popular election.

144
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:13,140
And Ross Perot had a very strong showing, but didn't get any Electoral

145
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,120
College votes.

146
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,150
So that's sort of the context of the '92 Election.

147
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:21,010
Now more specifically, what we're going to be looking at is the town

148
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,150
hall debate from '92.

149
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:28,010
Now by the way, this is the first time they did the town hall style in the

150
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,790
Presidential Debate series.

151
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:34,310
And you'll see in this upcoming clip that it's certainly a little bit more

152
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,070
unscripted.

153
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,840
Those town hall style debates have subsequent--

154
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,740
after this debate ran, they clamped down a heck of a lot more on these

155
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,930
types of questions.

156
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,830
But this first '92 town hall style debate provided an interesting setting

157
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,170
for these three candidates.

158
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:55,740
So what I want you to do is hopefully you're on the course

159
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,970
page for this week.

160
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,850
So we're-- this is lesson six.

161
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,780
So we're week six, lesson six.

162
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,660
Embedded on the page is a clip that I want you to watch.

163
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:10,110
Specifically, what I want you to do is I want you to think about how do Bush

164
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:14,520
and Clinton develop their ethos differently in response to the

165
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,810
question that is posed.

166
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,130
We don't watch Ross Perot.

167
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,440
Sorry about that.

168
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,100
But he did great, but we're not going to watch him.

169
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,700
He's lost to history.

170
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,700
But I want you to watch specifically how Bush responds to that question,

171
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,960
how Clinton responds to that question, and how they develop their ethos.

172
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,030
Don't think who are they deeply, but think how are they performing their

173
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,940
ethos differently in that moment, in that setting.

174
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:44,290
And I would ask you to try to watch this clip rhetorically, analyzing it

175
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,230
for ethos, and not politically.

176
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,380
You might hate Bill Clinton.

177
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,320
And there's certainly evidence that lots of people do.

178
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,040
But I want you to watch this clip, not for who he is our movie was or what

179
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,050
you think about him, but for how ethos is being performed in that moment--

180
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,410
so, too, with George Bush, Senior, OK?

181
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,930
So I'm going to have you watch that clip.

182
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,390
Think about this question.

183
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,700
And then in the next lecture, we'll move through some bit by

184
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,300
bit analysis of ethos.

185
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,770
So go ahead and watch that clip now.

186
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,020
