to this adventure again next year

3
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:33,310
it is selling exciting to the able to see

4
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,520
and that's how this time destroyed

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,390
mendacious public thirst for science

6
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,350
and specialty cocktails

7
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,490
despite a show of hands i want to know how many people here have been to aside

8
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,480

9
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:51,179

00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:09,890
pariah since we've moved beyond that got us in the hall of planet earth

16
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,310
and into the column in the heart of the universe

17
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,240

00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,959
cement tomb in a discussion is going to be entirely q and a

19
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,669
and then you can tell us what you think of this and and the moves the space in

20

of the opening of this beautiful hauled the rose center for in space

26
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:55,320
and celebration we are throwing open the doors of the universe to all of you

27
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:58,429
and i can think of you know better

28
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,469
denied

29
00:01:59,468 --> 00:02:03,298
cosmic died through this universe then tonight's first

30
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,289
so it is with great honor and great pleasure that i introduce to you

31
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:11,748
that director of the hayden planetarium

32
00:02:11,748 --> 00:02:15,459
the great popularize are of science

33
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:18,908
does best friended me

34
00:02:18,908 --> 00:02:21,578
and the man who needs no introduction

35
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:28,579
doctor neil depressed etc

36
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:40,139
this is uh... great turnout

37
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:42,999
this is supposed to be an intimate

38
00:02:42,998 --> 00:02:45,649
kinda coffeehouse sort of saying so

39
00:02:45,649 --> 00:02:47,859
we have to have to let move it out of the

40
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:49,969
we had another room plan

41
00:02:49,968 --> 00:02:53,150
so i want to try to be skipping intimate

42
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,109
i don't know how

43
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:56,709
but will try

44
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,709
okay awkward welcomed

45
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:02,079
to the universe

46
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:06,790
i can say that the way james earl jones at welcome to the universe

47
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:10,938
you were here under disputes fear

48
00:03:10,938 --> 00:03:15,288
properly supported above your head

49
00:03:15,288 --> 00:03:18,028
when we first thought of designing it

50
00:03:18,028 --> 00:03:20,908
the natural thought was to support it from below

51
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:22,888
how else would you support us here

52
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:27,239
but views from the outside of look like a golf ball and golf team so that's not

53
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:28,118
cosmic

54
00:03:28,118 --> 00:03:31,968
and so the architects figured how to supported from the start

55
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:35,400
city walk under the sphere as though you are in space so welcome

56
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,558
to the whole of the universe if you have a chance before the evenings over

57
00:03:39,558 --> 00:03:42,239
you can actually fines pluto

58
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,929
it is expected

59
00:03:43,929 --> 00:03:46,218
on that planet wall there

60
00:03:46,218 --> 00:03:47,858
at the bottom

61
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:51,599
grouped with other of its icy brethren in the outer solar system

62
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,858
the type herb dot

63
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,919
that is worth little appears in this solidity

64
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:59,439
ten years ago

65
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:03,549
where the first public institution

66
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:05,629
readjust plumes associations

67
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:08,228
in the solar system that we got into trouble

68
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:10,419
with the new york times about that

69
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:13,599
but then the rest of the world caught on and so now

70
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:16,908
that hate mail has diminished significantly

71
00:04:16,908 --> 00:04:22,159
from third-graders

72
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,820
they've gotten over it and so should you expect

73
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:27,649
ut this evening i'd this is

74
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:29,158
this is a cafe

75
00:04:29,158 --> 00:04:31,829
it's a big cafe but it's a cafe

76
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:33,528
and i'd want to

77
00:04:33,528 --> 00:04:35,490
this to be principally

78
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,929
and open session

79
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:38,859
where i will walk among you

80
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,810
you ask questions

81
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,439
out toss up a few other sort of current events e kinds of things just a warm you

82
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,939
up but this will be driven

83
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:48,939
by your curiosity

84
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:51,740
not by my curiosity

85
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,490
we have playing behind me the known universe

86
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,559
it is our first

87
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:59,990
first youtube video to go viral from this institution

88
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,299
you may have seen it

89
00:05:01,298 --> 00:05:05,198
if not beard would not than among the three half a million people who have

90
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,619
it's assume out from the surface of the earth

91
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:10,360
out to the edge of unknown universe

92
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,419
produced here in collaboration

93
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:15,089
with the rubin museum of art

94
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:17,248
down in chelsea

95
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:19,778
board exhibit that's now closed sorry

96
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,040
exhibited studied

97
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,149
the ancient concepts

98
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:25,660
for eastern concepts of cosmology sp

99
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,219
but we felt to complete that story you include modern cosmology as well

100
00:05:30,218 --> 00:05:32,329
in the zoom out now resuming back in

101
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:34,798
social play the whole night

102
00:05:34,798 --> 00:05:37,698
give you some of the dead if you're tired of looking at me

103
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:39,639
just check it out that's fine

104
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,759
so a couple other current events e thing so you know poodles gone

105
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,490
is still out there but

106
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,519
we have other relationships with it

107
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,530
we can talk about the past present future of nasa

108
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:55,609
we can talk about the black holes that were not made in the supercollider n

109
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,520
switzerland

110
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:59,180
many people thought the world would end

111
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,999
and speaking of ending of the world

112
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:06,809
there's twenty twelve their people still a little worried about that

113
00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:09,740
anyone here dragged by their friend

114
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,840
to this event this evening who themselves

115
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,188
is still worried about twenty twelve raise your hand to be honest

116
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:20,569
your freight to say that in this the center of the universe okay but we can

117
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:22,669
put we can straighten that out

118
00:06:22,668 --> 00:06:23,799
if you'd like

119
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,770
uh... either things if you've forgotten what the latest is on dark matter dark

120
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:29,240
energy

121
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,538
black holes

122
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:32,498
this is the chance

123
00:06:32,499 --> 00:06:35,229
and this is a bit of statistic that i've shared

124
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,109
on some youtube somewhere

125
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,389
if you haven't seen it how you will hear it now for the first time

126
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:42,088
there's about

127
00:06:42,088 --> 00:06:45,250
six-and-a-half seven thousand astrophysicist ps

128
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,610
in the world

129
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,778
there's about

130
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:51,358
six-and-a-half seven billion people

131
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:53,558
in the world

132
00:06:53,559 --> 00:07:00,559
divide those two numbers what do you get

133
00:07:03,338 --> 00:07:06,228
that decry up here he's got he's got the answer

134
00:07:06,228 --> 00:07:07,478
one-in-a-million

135
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:08,129
cell

136
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:11,889
if you ever find yourself in the company of an astrophysicist

137
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,150
that's the time to ask all the questions you have

138
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:19,118
good you'll never know the next time that will happen

139
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:22,210
this is one of those occasions

140
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:25,899
we are also we have someone here who will be

141
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:27,709
pumping questions also

142
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:29,410
from the twitter verse

143
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,939
it's intermittently will grab one off of

144
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:34,209
of twitter

145
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:37,249
i tweaked the universe

146
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:43,549
the more the more like cosmic bring droppings pound

147
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:45,799
these they just sort of random

148
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,249
thoughts

149
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:49,729
that by had anyway

150
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:52,688
buttttt shame to keep them to myself

151
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:57,549
took earlier today you might have missed it treated

152
00:07:57,548 --> 00:07:59,178
actually

153
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:02,178
adding some words because otherwise it's like a high clue you wouldn't build

154
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:04,508
understanding

155
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:06,430
actually

156
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,139
america is

157
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:11,439
inching its way towards the metric system

158
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:13,838
uh...

159
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:15,300
but i liked

160
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,949
the photo

161
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:18,370
we're actually

162
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,119
mostly metric

163
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:23,569
okay our money is metric you never thought about that eject

164
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,669

00:08:26,668 --> 00:08:29,349
uh... a money is metric

166
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,949

are the nutrition labels

175
00:08:58,948 --> 00:09:00,339
are metric

176
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,580
they tell you what how much protein carbohydrate fat you're consuming all of

177
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,440
your food

178
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,570
that's metric

179
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,760
uh... photography is metric

180
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,580
the emergence

00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,460
field of ammunitions and

182
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,519
that's metric to but this is new york so you shouldn't know about that

183
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:21,509
but here from texas

184
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:24,319

00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,159
hand it's happening without anybody even

187
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,500
taking notice

188
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,500
it's slow but israel and i think it's irreversible

189
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,470
but any help

190
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,810
block on the floor there'll be a microphone roving so what you have to do

191
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,500
is hold your hand up sort of earlier

192
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,190
so that they can find you with a microphone we have one right there

193
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,980
superbowl great raise your hands

194
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,840
yes we have to high microphones there

195
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,070
and will come around to you as you raise your hand and i'll just keep talking to

196
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:51,669
you

197
00:09:51,668 --> 00:09:52,679
raise your hand

198
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,529
and pose the question

199
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:56,350
by the way you came here for free

200
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:00,980
but it's a cash bar complete ability to that's free booze by the way

201
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,460
you we've got our first question the first question yes

202
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,160
trying and

203
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:06,409
outside

204
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,068
uh... i'm dissident this is my space here

205
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:13,049
so i willl endowment educator

206
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:14,719
so i will require

207
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,340
that you don't start your question with the word on

208
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,509
okay

209
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:23,169
allies you get doctor terms

210
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:28,229
to start again don't start with

211
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,990
yeah

212
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,299
battlestar

213
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,289
but it's for the greater good i'm sure you

214
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:38,939
okay go

215
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,790
but

216
00:10:41,789 --> 00:10:45,360
hello start coming out of her

217
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,909
and sinunu andrea

218
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:50,250
to wafer

219
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,789
middle started saying things about

220
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:56,279
away uh... times magazine

221
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,559
that you say

222
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:03,039
uh... the e ask do

223
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,500
was this time ten questions

224
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,700
the tennis in general okay

225
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,699
yet reporter from time magazine

226
00:11:09,698 --> 00:11:11,740
came into my awesome office and asked

227
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,259
ten questions

228
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:15,019
submitted to the magazine

229
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:18,809
and then that was podcast it and it's a little video of it

230
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:20,819
for the pockets has the story and sir

231
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,950
the video is truncated so it doesn't you on youtube

232
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,080
but continuous event

233
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,550
ke asked do you know uh...

234
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:30,729
if you could go back in time

235
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,310
weights

236
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:35,369
test you would

237
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,919
genes to speak with moving in you say

238
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:40,029
so isaac newton all yes

239
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:44,139
and that inspire is just very moved by the way that you spoke about him and you

240
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:51,139
say

241
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:54,329
really

242
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,600
felt the universe and he really an aesthetic and isaac newton was in touch

243
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,389
with the cosmos right

244
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:02,069
and he said that you

245
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,480
but you have a question that we'd wait a minute now provided the eaton and i was

246
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,600
just want to share that with everyone yeah i just didn't want to be moved the

247
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,399
second time this what you're saying

248
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,779
you remove that first time

249
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:17,149
good i'll talk about isaac newton

250
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:19,549
mean you can go way back

251
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:20,870
okay

252
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,990
challan

253
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,750
yeah i would let you know i break because the way he said he said that fly

254
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,759
will elaborate about sir isaac

255
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,938
okay high-voltage self at

256
00:12:29,938 --> 00:12:30,539
accident

257
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:33,589
he did ask me what scientists what i see if i went back in time

258
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,379
he asked me

259
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:39,100
what percent do i want to meet if i went back in time right i've said it'll be

260
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,480
the scientist

261
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,930
isaac newton

262
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:44,839
isaac newton british scientist

263
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,750
he was a professor at university of cambridge

264
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,940
he held the endowed chair that stephen hawking

265
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,740
now holds duplication professor

266
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,830
of mathematics

267
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,590
and he's a physicist today we would think of him as a physicist back then he

268
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,050
was what's known as a natural philosopher

269
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:07,539
who pose questions about the natural world as opposed to the human world

270
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:11,219
human philosophical questions like the meaning of wife in the sort of thing

271
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,460
their natural source article questions

272
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,780
what is the origin of the universe and uh...

273
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:19,470
so i certainly wouldn't

274
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,240
was brilliant that i i almost of anything he's ever written

275
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,889
and i sit there and i read it

276
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:29,970
and as i read the sentences he put to page

277
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,800
here it goes up on the back actually have here they're but if you look at www

278
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:36,379
if you'd like to commence bumpy kinda thing

279
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:39,278
defied hair on my neck it would be standing on edge

280
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:41,500
as i see the dept

281
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,580
to which he was connected

282
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,740
to the operations of nature

283
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,360
there is no doubt about it

284
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,899
the man

285
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:50,909
discovered the laws of gravity

286
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:52,209
by sitting there

287
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,769
okay it's rumored that he sat under the apple tree

288
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:56,779
but what is certain is that he knew

289
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:00,259
in the same field if you if you saw on apple drop

290
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:01,389
and the moon

291
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:02,819
it worked

292
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,080
around the earth

293
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,860
okay he sees the two of them

294
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,970
one is falling to the ground and the others like up there in space

295
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,590
he connects the two

296
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,209
suggests

297
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:18,559
that the same force of gravity is operating on both of them

298
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,569
they're both falling towards arts

299
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,140
he hypothesized or how's that possible

300
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:25,629
if i can drop this camera on the ground

301
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:28,279
they would fall

302
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:31,220
but if it's a morbid it's not falling

303
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,810
plate is full

304
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,179
deities

305
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:37,519
if you're in orbit you are falling towards earth

306
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,470
he drew a diagram to illustrate this rebecca diagram is on the wall over

307
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,639
there called orbits

308
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:47,740
there's someone who's head isn't one of the work right now

309
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:51,360
typing on is that there's porpoises and hope orbit adult

310
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,399
where we describe this but i'll do it for you cuz i'm here in person

311
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,980
right he suggested suppose you had a hill

312
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,500
any sort of fire a cannibal

313
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,309
not very fast it was a sort of assault

314
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:04,839
fired a little faster

315
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,990
it goes farther before it hits the ground doesn't it

316
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,580
even faster hilton even farther

317
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,780
but wait a minute purses curved

318
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,319
so if you keep this up

319
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,129
this thing is coming around the back side of the earth

320
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:23,009
so yes constructive must be a speed

321
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:24,509
sufficiently high

322
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:27,569
so that that cannonball comes right

323
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,070
to the cannon

324
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,970
and all you have to do at that point his tuck

325
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:38,600
and aquatic animal off or just slide on by and stay in orbit

326
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,050
the fact is the catalyst for a every moment it's there

327
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:45,990
the difference is it's going sideways so fast

328
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,120
that the amount that it has fallen

329
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:53,389
is the same amount that the earth's surface has curbed away from it

330
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:55,799
that does the speed the kitchen port

331
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,128
he figures this out

332
00:15:57,129 --> 00:16:01,080
and that's why the moon is behaving the same way the apple is

333
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,570
the apple just doesn't happen to have sideways motion

334
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,250
brigade someplace other than right below

335
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,350
and when you are in free fall

336
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,759
you are weightless

337
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,879
that's the coolest thing to be we have in our midst

338
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:16,970
an astronaut

339
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,660
we have time hendrik hertzberg where are you

340
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:21,028
reject please stand up

341
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:28,028
official astronaut

342
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:35,110
on uh... several shuttle missions so you got to get the away it was cool

343
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:39,370
it's kolkata when he had put that on microphone

344
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,029
it's cool epic i'd

345
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:46,309
and so he's a free fall around the earth not only is the

346
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:50,189
shuttle orbiter in free fall everything in the orbiter isn't free fall so

347
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,740
therefore everything is weightless

348
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,620
if you're in an elevator and you cut the elevator cable

349
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,960
uh...

350
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,820
up until the point you hit the bottom of your weightless

351
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,939
you're in free fall

352
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,789
uh... here's an experiment you do

353
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:09,519
if it were a very cool cheap experiment take a tall glass of water

354
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:11,720
on the paper cup mixed-race call

355
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,970
one of those at starbucks

356
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,250
culture people to get it but you get a tall

357
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,299
filled with water

358
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:23,109
punch holes in the side

359
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,139
obviously what is going to leak out

360
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,850
the water at the bottom hole will spew out farther

361
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:30,419
then the quarter

362
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,920
entire pin pin holes are because the waterways more above it is more pressure

363
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,880
at the bottom

364
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,229
just to spray the word around so the the bottom line is far

365
00:17:39,229 --> 00:17:41,590
and the higher ones are a little less

366
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:43,419
it's all because of work pressure

367
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,950
the widgets of the water

368
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,289
take a couple water while spilling

369
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:49,879
dropping

370
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,670
into a sick

371
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:56,980
does not what you drop it into but this to minimize mess

372
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,500
instinct it leaves your hand

373
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,630
despite works

374
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,160
because it's in free fall

375
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,360
the couple's weightless orders went at the water has no wait

376
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,339
then the war does not know

377
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:12,879
to exit the whole in the side of the cockpit puncture

378
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,870
so the institute drop that cup

379
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:17,209
the water caps off

380
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:23,079
it just stops and the cup false hits the bottom and spills in your sink awhile it

381
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:26,009
fell is evidence that the war became weightless

382
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:28,970
the apple is waitlisted ms weightless

383
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,130
that was amazing

384
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,470
on top of that he discovers the laws

385
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,069
of motion

386
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:37,189
famous equation f equals an egg

387
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,539
you may remember that from highschool physics or not that's an important

388
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:41,420
equation

389
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,669
the combined ethical zeb it was a crappy gets us to the moon

390
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:48,060
allows us to team

391
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:51,929
projectiles and land where we want on mars

392
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,009
you also discovered that then the laws of optics

393
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:59,579
put like three prison show the white light is composed of colors

394
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:01,789
he named the colors of the rainbow

395
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:04,149
worried she business

396
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,810
wat you know what you did

397
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:07,339
what you did

398
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:14,339
red orange yellow

399
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:18,960
was there appear more debates named

400
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,549
with but

401
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:24,039
active problems some people but to sign-in it was

402
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,920
violent left without the art

403
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,310
indigo indigo so easily i think it will have at this table fascination for

404
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:31,389
number seven

405
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,690
and so they're really to most people only six colors they're he threw an

406
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,559
indigo

407
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,849
puts it spells were cheaper if you can't you can't give that up

408
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:44,069
affirmed so if the parties to enter colors coming out of white white

409
00:19:44,069 --> 00:19:47,599
this freak out the artists writers that's not how colours worked in art

410
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,459
within each of the colors put it back together

411
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,279
got white line again

412
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:53,648
so he can understood

413
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:55,359
the behavior of light

414
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:56,469
of these different

415
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,269
uh... fans

416
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:03,529
so to game of the laws of optics was a gravity laws of motion

417
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:05,359
and on a dare

418
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:06,459
practically on a dare

419
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,549
he invented

420
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:11,369
integral and differential calculus

421
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:13,319
on a dare

422
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:16,200
somebody said hike

423
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,470
why do the planets orbit

424
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,620
into shape we call elections

425
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:24,289
phillips flattened circle

426
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,980
why factsheet

427
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,920
you know i don't know it comes out of my classes but i don't know why statute

428
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,620
in a somewhat

429
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:33,509
i'll get back to you

430
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:36,319
so he goes home for a couple of months

431
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,079
comes back years and here's why it statute

432
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:41,419
well it's actually a cut from a car

433
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:45,179
ticket conan make cuts in if you get an ellipse a circle of parabola hyperbole

434
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:46,640
it's best people notice

435
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,540
this guy would know that we've got the prototype good earlier

436
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:54,180
then the friends i will have to get school how do you think that worried

437
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,360
that the calculus too far to find the answer

438
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:00,839
most people struggling with the just to learn it in school

439
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:03,549
he invented

440
00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:05,960
for no other reason but a friend of him

441
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,200
pose a challenge in question

442
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,539
isaac newton

443
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,730
after all of this

444
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:18,730
and turns twenty six

445
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,740
decided

446
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,700
you read in the back of one of his books called optics

447
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,740
ready discovers als laws of

448
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,509
optics

449
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:29,640
in the back yes queries

450
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,210
he isn't like spilski i'm at the time to figure out yet

451
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,230
maybe some others will find out

452
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,170
he said i wonder

453
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,890
if the stars in the night sky

454
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,430
or just like the sun

455
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,850
much much farther away

456
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:49,000
yeah it's like okay xd

457
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,339
he's wondering stuff that became entire branches of study

458
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:57,109
the crumbs off his plate

459
00:21:57,109 --> 00:22:01,679
are the entire careers of other people

460
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,160
he then later on with the eye

461
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,910
okay suggest these are factors you might want to

462
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,279
consider

463
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,119
jobs and just

464
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:15,028
artisan disclosure are just want to make sure

465
00:22:15,028 --> 00:22:18,089
you got all the facts

466
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:21,240
but when i read that in nyc communes through time

467
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,930
and feel connected to the cosmos

468
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:24,820
and

469
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:28,369
i don't know if i'd moved you a second time in regarding this

470
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:31,549
but that's why i feel about icing it and i have a blast of his head

471
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:33,740
on might

472
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,558
table in my office busted there

473
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:39,940
buzz actual head started casting

474
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,250
of his head

475
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:45,420
the other long hair before that was like fashionable for guys you know today

476
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,700
at those curls

477
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,539
newton curls

478
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:50,288
okay i i took a long time answering that let me get your

479
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:51,710
your opinion

480
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,390
should i spend a long time answering it if i got a lot of places to go in the

481
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:55,929
answer

482
00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:02,320
or do you want sound-bite answers to get them off of

483
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,629
even though i'll get a few are of you

484
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,450
your you're cool with that

485
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:10,900
uh... only flush it out if this flash to give

486
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,490
so another pic

487
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:18,430
the public to track the microphones who's got the next one

488
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,558
so a couple weeks ago ives anticipated

489
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:25,288
announced the results of an experiment in which they showed that in big bang

490
00:23:25,288 --> 00:23:28,390
like explosions

491
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:33,670
matter is produced slightly higher proportion an anti matter

492
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:37,509
and my question is if the results had been just the opposite is anti matter

493
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:38,519
were

494
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:40,579
produced preferentially by a little bit

495
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:44,619
could anti matter have created the universe that we live in now and if so

496
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:51,619
would be just like this or would we be living in a bizarre like universe

497
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:54,099
okay so let's back up a little bit

498
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:58,869
him

499
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:01,489
in a world that's actually

500
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,289
uncommon

501
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:05,149
for what goes on routinely in the universe

502
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,269
if you go to the center of the sun for example recommend this book if if you

503
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:09,849
went to the center of the sun

504
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:12,919
and you managed to not get vaporized

505
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,950
you would find that the lights

506
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,110
that is passing your head

507
00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:20,609
it's primarily x_-rays

508
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:23,299
little bit gamma rays it's mostly x_-rays

509
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:26,289
at his other like too but it's dominated by x_-rays

510
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:29,430
x_-rays is just another band of why i think that we didn't know that

511
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,490
he didn't know everything

512
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,980
the whole spectrum rory jeep they have on the other side of the city

513
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,819
we have all survived

514
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:38,139
invisible to our eyes

515
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,930
we can detect it though

516
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:40,799
he detected

517
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,269
by oksana

518
00:24:42,269 --> 00:24:43,759
you detected by

519
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:45,269
your sunburn

520
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:50,299
it while you detect a little too late suitor time delay there

521
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:54,680
then you really detective with skin cancer tree so if you want to up beyond

522
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,808
beyond ultraviolet you have

523
00:24:56,808 --> 00:24:58,069
x_-rays

524
00:24:58,069 --> 00:24:59,929
and that we can't detect those either

525
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,940
uh... and then get worse

526
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,330
but you could eventually to techies were again we detect them with cancers and

527
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:06,449
things it's not

528
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,950
southern effective way to detective

529
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,610
go to the other side of red

530
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:11,329
we find infrared

531
00:25:11,329 --> 00:25:13,309
can see that either

532
00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:15,159
beyond that we have microwaves

533
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,259
and the radio waves

534
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:19,450
all of his life dole travels at the speed of light

535
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:23,450
so if you go into the sun here these

536
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,100
x_-rays

537
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:28,668
such energy visa photons

538
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:30,450
this so much energy

539
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:32,049
energy goes up with

540
00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:35,879
violet ultraviolet rays dennis goes up goes down in the other direction

541
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,240
as so much energy

542
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,740
that you can ask

543
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:44,079
what happened to plug that energy into the equation equals m_c_ squared

544
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,579
just do that

545
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:50,589
if that's the energy on the left what comes what hammer what mass

546
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:51,409
equivalent is that

547
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,160
you know what you find out

548
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,360
it has so much energy he could spontaneously make matter

549
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:01,750
he can make a pair of electrons on its own

550
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,400
soak in the center of the sun

551
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,340
matter

552
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:07,379
is being forwards

553
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,640
out of the shoe of energy

554
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,970
every moment of the sun's light

555
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,170
what kind of matter doesn't make it makes

556
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,028
electron and entire which

557
00:26:18,028 --> 00:26:18,940
positron

558
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,490
mattered anti-matter pick anti-matter israel

559
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:26,440
we need invented it not the science fiction writers

560
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,559
until they take until the end of it

561
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,250
but its power idea

562
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:33,210
we gotta take we gotta get the get credit when we can

563
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:36,160
because a science fiction writers can be so good at this

564
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,170
so

565
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:43,950
when you have a high note energy for the white people spontaneously become matter

566
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,700
and he'd better anti-matter care come back together

567
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,710
it makes the

568
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,910
the x_-rays again is this true

569
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:54,960
that's unfamiliar to us we don't see that visible light doesn't do that

570
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,650
it's not energetic enough

571
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,028
stays as light

572
00:26:59,028 --> 00:27:03,349
buckets absorb it doesn't become energy doesn't become particles

573
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:04,909
the early universe

574
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:08,580
this went on beat

575
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:11,669
and it's one of the same actually lost a particle physics

576
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:14,980
that light becomes too particles veteran anti-matter

577
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,890
bring together they become white again

578
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,290
always symmetric

579
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:21,559
always

580
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:24,179
we're made of matter

581
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,820
here's the answer that so there's some discussions

582
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:31,210
that if an alien cayman landed from another galaxy

583
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:36,240
before you shake it and or whatever appendage it's offering you

584
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,829
flip a coin

585
00:27:38,829 --> 00:27:41,210
if the alien spontaneously

586
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,660
explodes

587
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,940
it's anti-matter food

588
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:52,090
that's always be ready to have some cults touch their liam

589
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:53,939
so

590
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,840
anti-matter art perfect counterparts to matter

591
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:00,679
so something happen in the early universe to create an asymmetry

592
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,590
it's one of the mysteries of the early universe

593
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:05,378
one out of one

594
00:28:05,378 --> 00:28:06,359
hundred

595
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,629
millions

596
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,250
of these

597
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,349
particle in type article pairs

598
00:28:11,349 --> 00:28:13,009
one out of a hundred million of them

599
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:16,589
was just a particle enough theater part

600
00:28:16,589 --> 00:28:18,109
hundred million

601
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:20,668
i mean brackets renner

602
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:24,320
but it happened enough to account for all the matter that we know when see a

603
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:25,668
lot in the universe

604
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:28,880
there's no reason to think that that happened the other way

605
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,700
that we would just be anti-matter talking about matter aliens

606
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,490
flipping them in anti-matter panic

607
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:39,359
but then they probably wouldn't call themselves anti anything

608
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:43,179
so kasagic it's one of the great mysteries in the early universe

609
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,690
how it came to be

610
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,220
that there's an asymmetry

611
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:47,919
induce

612
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,430
very symmetric process that we see all the time

613
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,500
so it's a long answer but you get the full context of that it affects the big

614
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,349
bang as well as what's going on in the center of the sun

615
00:28:57,349 --> 00:28:59,809
info technically because symmetry breaking

616
00:28:59,809 --> 00:29:02,609
more broadly can google wiki

617
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:04,329
symmetry breaking and they talk about

618
00:29:04,329 --> 00:29:06,289
the laws of physics

619
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:07,349
that are broken

620
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:10,528
by some phenomena process in the early universe

621
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,769
of microphone over here

622
00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:16,930
yet to be what writing amalia wearing outfits on the and offices into

623
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,669
off-topic

624
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:22,610
sorry this is the universe while participating in the copper send this to

625
00:29:22,609 --> 00:29:26,209
them that universe but i don't know why dont universe had a little have

626
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,429
astrophysicist at again

627
00:29:28,429 --> 00:29:31,360
so in light of card events involving

628
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:34,919
and at the will still in on

629
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,740
and

630
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,720
but something that i read in the by the way yeah

631
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,690
at one twenty three

632
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:46,230
but it's our oil spill the oil filled and harley disaster and i will we all

633
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,819
had a la carte

634
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:53,789
we are collectively that is that for conflict

635
00:29:53,789 --> 00:29:57,170
in light of that and something that i read the times on sundays thing that we

636
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:57,630
know

637
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:01,430
or about deep space and we do about the deep-sea indeed

638
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:05,480
would you protests that perhaps the c_ span more time setting

639
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,069
things that we don't know in our wealth

640
00:30:08,069 --> 00:30:10,428
as that pastor faces

641
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:13,250
can you suggest anything that might be done

642
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,039
that they are not

643
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,079
time

644
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,798
okay so the two questions there

645
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:22,109
uh... how do we help b_p_ fix the problem

646
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:24,449
uh... should we study

647
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:27,509
so we spend more money on earth and space

648
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:32,019
deal with them into the same question that's awesome that that is to do that

649
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:32,769
but

650
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:37,730
uh... i only had one suggestion for p_p_ but we did this a couple days ago

651
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,640
i said

652
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,950
what's all this effort trying to

653
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,909
plugged the hole

654
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:47,240
it's coming out of the ground ultimately that's what we what they will do anyway

655
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,890
right

656
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,540
put another pipe in phila barge with it

657
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:55,079
so rats are just treated at because i've

658
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:58,470
exceeds may be easier dot i've got a little word that they tried that

659
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,380
but that failed

660
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,770
that's gotta be easier

661
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:03,969
then try to stop

662
00:31:03,969 --> 00:31:05,070
the leak

663
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:07,799
to put kid you could put up with another

664
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,099
perfect just

665
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:12,730
okay and i gotta come in here reduces acute right to put pieces of things

666
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,059
together

667
00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:17,230
if i think it would be put in a bar

668
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:21,299
when you go out later on anyway with polly need it right now alright

669
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:23,839
so i don't understand why did that wasn't the first thought

670
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,339
one of my concerns about this failure

671
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:29,220
if it's actually been in a refill

672
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,779
and if u

673
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:32,759
create a world

674
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:34,759
absent of engineers

675
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:39,000
because all the smart people would have become engineers had no grand

676
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,859
plans to

677
00:31:39,859 --> 00:31:41,500
go into his job

678
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,759
the nineteen sixties we're going to the moon

679
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:49,230
it was a militarily drip driven enterprise it attracted cited engineers

680
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:52,889
method mathematicians to want to become those fields

681
00:31:52,888 --> 00:31:54,709
when there's a disaster that happens

682
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:57,660
i don't want people saying all we plug it with golf balls

683
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,370
by what kind of solution is that

684
00:31:59,369 --> 00:32:03,768
like where is the genius that we know the human mind is capable

685
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:07,868
well i think they all became investment bankers award they're not scientists and

686
00:32:07,868 --> 00:32:09,209
engineers

687
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:13,370
so the fewer scientists and engineers in your next

688
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:15,379
the more susceptible you are

689
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:19,020
to the failure infrastructure could you have people thinking about how to

690
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:20,700
prevent it in the first place

691
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,069
for example

692
00:32:22,069 --> 00:32:25,359
the day we find the asteroid is coming weather is one coming

693
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:28,689
if there's time will get to it but okay

694
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:32,250
but just if there's time i don't know we might

695
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:36,049
we got sc

696
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:38,089
the asteroids coming

697
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,058
most people

698
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:41,349
you know what they'll do the same

699
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:43,709
rong

700
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,180
stockpile food

701
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,840
you know they'll set okay

702
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:49,459
that's not all i want sitting next to me

703
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:53,009
bookmark what i want to be sent

704
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:55,250
how can we deflects

705
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,319
that's a different brent

706
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:58,648
that's a brain that sees

707
00:32:58,648 --> 00:33:01,989
a natural disaster as a problem to be solved

708
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,899
not has as a

709
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,889
disaster to run away from

710
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:08,919
that if you don't have engineered dot was thinking

711
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:11,990
nobody the sting out of runaway from the problem

712
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,180
that's a problem

713
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,350
in our modern society

714
00:33:16,349 --> 00:33:19,740
getting back to spending money on earth amount of space

715
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,339
that's a common

716
00:33:21,339 --> 00:33:22,428
criticism

717
00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:24,470
of nasa actually

718
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,889
one spending money up

719
00:33:25,888 --> 00:33:30,209
then when we got perfectly good problems down here

720
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,400
and i and i and i think i decided that

721
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,530
but not at all your deck rushton

722
00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:38,160
but is missing some context

723
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,288
some context for example

724
00:33:40,288 --> 00:33:43,408
did you know

725
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:47,669
global climate change

726
00:33:47,669 --> 00:33:51,320
did not exist as an understood problem on purpose

727
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:52,740
until we studied

728
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,200
if explicitly about meat

729
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,460
week the community

730
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,590
studied the effects

731
00:33:57,589 --> 00:33:59,549
of the asteroid impact

732
00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:03,869
they took out the dinosaurs sixty five million years ago

733
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:05,678
all portfolio

734
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,418
of reasons everybody's giving for what killed the dinosaurs

735
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:12,898
then we find two hundred-mile diameter crater all three of the temp initially

736
00:34:12,898 --> 00:34:14,599
and what is now mexico

737
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:18,000
dated sixty five million years ago all the dinosaurs

738
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,909
croat

739
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:22,639
i'm sayin we got an asteroid took out the dinosaurs

740
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,528
you talk about

741
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:27,268
the ugh but it was colder than if i uh... i got an asteroid

742
00:34:27,268 --> 00:34:29,948
okay so that forced people to ask

743
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:32,769
well if you were in the two hundred mile diameter

744
00:34:32,768 --> 00:34:35,378
where your we know you're toast

745
00:34:35,378 --> 00:34:38,168
howlett how might you have died on the ortho rounding errors

746
00:34:38,168 --> 00:34:41,719
so you look at the fires that would have been created you look at the earths

747
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:46,798
crust cast into the atmosphere you notice static locust birth

748
00:34:46,798 --> 00:34:49,759
blocking sunlight from reaching the photosynthetic

749
00:34:49,759 --> 00:34:50,780
of plants

750
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,470
if you take up the pace of the food chain than a wave of extinction

751
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:57,228
percolate across the tree of life

752
00:34:57,228 --> 00:35:01,509
we learned about this at this this force the climate models

753
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:06,200
to understand global climate in a way no one ever had the occasion to pick up

754
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:07,328
before

755
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:08,920
that's when it was born

756
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,450
not because somebody was looking down dot i got the solution here looking down

757
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:15,629
i'll figure it out no sometimes you have to look up

758
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:19,318
you know that planet wide greenhouse effect

759
00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:22,099
was first discovered on venus

760
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:26,670
venus has really bad greenhouse effect it's nine hundred degrees

761
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:29,489
fahrenheit on p_b_s_

762
00:35:29,489 --> 00:35:30,800
and i did the math you could

763
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,979
you could cook

764
00:35:34,978 --> 00:35:38,399
you ok over there

765
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,548
so much is planning to visit venus and that you've got a cancelled

766
00:35:41,548 --> 00:35:44,619
the vacation plans

767
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:47,528
via society to take a sixteen inch pepperoni pizza

768
00:35:47,528 --> 00:35:53,289
point of the windowsill it'll cookin nine seconds

769
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:55,520
you would paper rise as well so this is a

770
00:35:55,519 --> 00:36:02,519
this is a thought experiment if you could do this

771
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,709
global greenhouse effect

772
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:07,708
it was understood there before we could bring it over

773
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:11,239
this is not something i was in the middle of no where

774
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:14,579
connected to the cosmos

775
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:18,640
nolls science can claim in understanding of its subject

776
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:21,098
if it's subject is number

777
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:22,568
only one

778
00:36:22,568 --> 00:36:26,018
you need multiple objects to compare and contrast

779
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:28,528
you have to that's how we learn

780
00:36:28,528 --> 00:36:31,028
what is special what is not special what israel

781
00:36:31,028 --> 00:36:33,369
with the phenomena are

782
00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:38,079
and so to say but only spend the money here

783
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,139
best suicide

784
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:43,349
not only that how much does not so good

785
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:45,619
isn't that why i thought this experiment

786
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:46,749
unless people

787
00:36:46,748 --> 00:36:49,198
those that say well it's been these people

788
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:52,019
okay i have to how much you think this is going to

789
00:36:52,018 --> 00:36:57,118
here's your tax top a lot about your tax dollars how much of a cat

790
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,969
and here we go

791
00:36:58,969 --> 00:37:00,639
come about

792
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:02,869
that's five minute

793
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:05,919
itself

794
00:37:05,918 --> 00:37:09,009
tax dollar

795
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:12,809
asia text of his ten cents twenty cents thirty cent which is nasa getting

796
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:13,920
it is getting

797
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,979
one-half of one penny

798
00:37:15,978 --> 00:37:17,788
this tax dot

799
00:37:17,789 --> 00:37:19,759
one chu hundred

800
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:21,789
that's not even going to leave it in the e_p_a_

801
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:24,278
here during the edge

802
00:37:24,278 --> 00:37:25,349
pays for the brokers

803
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:27,239
the space station the space shuttle

804
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:28,568
that

805
00:37:28,568 --> 00:37:30,628
problem telescope all the nasa centers

806
00:37:30,628 --> 00:37:31,759
nasa headquarters

807
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,109
all of that

808
00:37:34,108 --> 00:37:36,469
and i ask you

809
00:37:36,469 --> 00:37:38,188
how much of the universe

810
00:37:38,188 --> 00:37:40,768
works tune

811
00:37:40,768 --> 00:37:47,768
ethics equipped

812
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:53,368
but from the twitter verse with my twitter twitter verse list

813
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:58,829
it looks like a question every year

814
00:37:58,829 --> 00:38:01,798
you compare to cluster

815
00:38:01,798 --> 00:38:02,809
month-old

816
00:38:02,809 --> 00:38:04,048
won't

817
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:07,438
seeking the only for the every twenty request

818
00:38:07,438 --> 00:38:10,898
joking dot replacing had

819
00:38:10,898 --> 00:38:11,789
x week

820
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,588
from matter

821
00:38:14,588 --> 00:38:17,578
what inventor palms

822
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:21,298
s_l_s like akito leaders coming right there

823
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:21,980
wet

824
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:28,028
well mankind's the interplanetary travel

825
00:38:28,028 --> 00:38:32,159
when that sounds like a deeper question that actually is

826
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:34,748
being when we got a marked this with that is

827
00:38:34,748 --> 00:38:37,929
latina interstellar tribe

828
00:38:37,929 --> 00:38:42,778
interplanetary with that we'd have to we're not going to be nice

829
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:43,559
there

830
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:48,569
banco hugo y if you're going to be a comeback pretzels one-way trips

831
00:38:48,568 --> 00:38:50,659
uh...

832
00:38:50,659 --> 00:38:52,869
mars is the only other

833
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:55,509
sensible planet we could possibly visit

834
00:38:55,509 --> 00:38:57,048
and in the current

835
00:38:57,048 --> 00:38:58,369
nasa budgets

836
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:01,639
which is actually increased from previous yours

837
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,608
under the obama administration

838
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:05,708
it has plans to develop

839
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:08,288
political heavy lift vehicles

840
00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:11,809
heavy lift would enable you to not only reached orbit

841
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:12,929
as current

842
00:39:12,929 --> 00:39:15,630
once vehicles to go to go beyond the low-earth orbit

843
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:19,499
like we did back in nineteen seventy two

844
00:39:19,498 --> 00:39:22,608
and those vehicles you be able to scale them in such a way so that they would

845
00:39:22,608 --> 00:39:24,518
get us to mars

846
00:39:24,518 --> 00:39:27,108
are beyond beyond the moon on to mars

847
00:39:27,108 --> 00:39:29,188
if at all goes well

848
00:39:29,188 --> 00:39:32,460
shirley before mid-century

849
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:32,970
and

850
00:39:32,969 --> 00:39:34,798
one of my concerns however

851
00:39:34,798 --> 00:39:37,259
is the motivation for going into space

852
00:39:37,259 --> 00:39:40,498
if it's not clearly defined it may never happen

853
00:39:40,498 --> 00:39:44,278
in the nineteen sixties we told ourselves we're discovers

854
00:39:44,278 --> 00:39:45,809
where barricades

855
00:39:45,809 --> 00:39:51,059
we explore meanwhile the subtext was where at war with the coming straight

856
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:55,079
briefed the colonies to space right that's really what that

857
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:56,939
flow of monies was doing

858
00:39:56,938 --> 00:39:59,348
and so if we want to go to mars

859
00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:00,599
hoan

860
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:05,289
if there's i don't believe the nation can rally around a simple question

861
00:40:05,289 --> 00:40:06,059
explore

862
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:07,910
the history of human civilization

863
00:40:07,909 --> 00:40:09,608
does not support that

864
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:12,259
what does support is the first to get rich

865
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:17,309
so if i'm like boil on mars will be there at like next week will be cut

866
00:40:17,309 --> 00:40:19,699
rockets will be there

867
00:40:19,699 --> 00:40:21,930
so i'd say by two thousand fifty

868
00:40:21,929 --> 00:40:23,098
another question

869
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:25,548
i'm going to go where that microphones are

870
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,278
okay

871
00:40:26,278 --> 00:40:27,559
the senator

872
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:31,149
greater scientist i didn't criticize thank you

873
00:40:31,148 --> 00:40:35,539
runner after beyond belief two thousand six lecture

874
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:38,579
you said that we know there were did you watch the you know what's the youtube ok

875
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:42,789
on you said that what stop middle eastern scientific progress was

876
00:40:42,789 --> 00:40:46,570
theological takeover yes do you think that's a shorthand for what i said but

877
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,210
there are if you can't make the case a little more

878
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,958
relatively than actual uh...

879
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:54,828
but do you think that's happened here in light of what's happening with like

880
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:57,318
scientific textbooks in texas and things like that

881
00:40:57,318 --> 00:40:59,119
yeah i just read recently about

882
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,938
the plight of textbook textbooks in texas

883
00:41:01,938 --> 00:41:05,558
i spent some time in texas six years actually

884
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:06,449
and

885
00:41:06,449 --> 00:41:08,190
of course texas has

886
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,710
johnson space center

887
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:12,630
these are the folks who

888
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:17,219
everything we put in orbit with humans on a after it passes through it

889
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:20,048
launch sp him

890
00:41:20,048 --> 00:41:22,728
uh... the watchtower

891
00:41:22,728 --> 00:41:24,598
in cape canaveral

892
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:29,449
or command goes over to houston so texas does that there's a fundamental part

893
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:31,289
of our space enterprise

894
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:32,829
culturally and historically

895
00:41:32,829 --> 00:41:35,619
so that for them to have now have textbooks

896
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:37,798
where the sites content is altered

897
00:41:37,798 --> 00:41:41,778
to be different from what is going on a mainstream science worries me greatly

898
00:41:41,778 --> 00:41:43,858
what you're referring to

899
00:41:43,858 --> 00:41:48,259
the the talk that i gave it that lectures and san diego two thousand six

900
00:41:48,259 --> 00:41:51,778
uh... it referenced what was going on a thousand years ago

901
00:41:51,778 --> 00:41:53,588
thousand years ago

902
00:41:53,588 --> 00:41:54,998
the

903
00:41:54,998 --> 00:41:56,698
intellectual center of the world

904
00:41:56,699 --> 00:41:59,798
with baghdad

905
00:41:59,798 --> 00:42:03,460
was busy disavowing heretics at the time

906
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,088
baghdad

907
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:06,608
was open to all box

908
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:07,838
at the time

909
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:11,389
between eighty eight hundred and eleven hundred around there

910
00:42:11,389 --> 00:42:13,288
if you look at the advances

911
00:42:13,289 --> 00:42:14,400
that unfolded

912
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,670
in that period in that location

913
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,438
it includes

914
00:42:18,438 --> 00:42:19,399
the

915
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,559
delete the invention of algebra

916
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:23,539
algebras an arabic word

917
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:25,549
algorithm is an arabic word

918
00:42:25,548 --> 00:42:29,949
two-thirds of the stars in the night sky that have names have arabic names

919
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:32,719
how does that happen

920
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:35,148
what with the navy rights comfort

921
00:42:35,148 --> 00:42:38,239
it came from the fact that at that time

922
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:39,159
advances

923
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:41,958
in the middle east in baghdad in particular

924
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:43,219
um

925
00:42:43,219 --> 00:42:44,729
was

926
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:45,518
unfolded

927
00:42:45,518 --> 00:42:48,839
in engineering mathematics specially mathematics

928
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,199
astronomy navigation

929
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:53,159
uh... physiology

930
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:56,259
didn't you say well why is that so if you look at what was going on through

931
00:42:56,259 --> 00:42:58,230
open to all lines of thought

932
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:00,188
jews moslems christians

933
00:43:00,188 --> 00:43:03,868
they were doubters back then today we would call the macy's they would all

934
00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:05,710
come around a table

935
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:09,199
and share ideas if you have some philosophy that's got a hold of some of

936
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:10,739
the find it

937
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:13,648
and to get a challenge you on those ideas and what happens is

938
00:43:13,648 --> 00:43:15,848
the conversation ratchets pop

939
00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:19,539
you discard what doesn't work and you keep what does

940
00:43:19,539 --> 00:43:22,509
and when you do that you make discoveries in you make discoveries

941
00:43:22,509 --> 00:43:23,849
rapidly

942
00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:25,349
and at the time

943
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:28,710
that terry drew to a close if you read history books

944
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:31,228
typically described sort of the

945
00:43:31,228 --> 00:43:32,878
sacking of baghdad

946
00:43:32,878 --> 00:43:34,898
bedtime for the city

947
00:43:34,898 --> 00:43:36,949
until they all came to an end

948
00:43:36,949 --> 00:43:38,259
however

949
00:43:38,259 --> 00:43:41,650
the islamic culture rolls at other times later

950
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:45,088
and those other times science an engineering discoveries were not a part

951
00:43:45,088 --> 00:43:46,349
of it

952
00:43:46,349 --> 00:43:48,039
so yes what why not

953
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:51,989
you got the cultural heritage i didn't show up again

954
00:43:51,989 --> 00:43:55,398
and that you gotta dig a little deeper from the sacking a baghdad and you find

955
00:43:55,398 --> 00:43:57,958
out there was a of muslim cleric

956
00:43:57,958 --> 00:44:00,489
alters always business name

957
00:44:00,489 --> 00:44:04,688
was to islam what saint augustine was to christianity

958
00:44:04,688 --> 00:44:08,308
sinatra seemed kinda laid out the rules for how to be a good christian at the

959
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:11,999
time to black people were practice in their own way he called a fight

960
00:44:11,998 --> 00:44:14,768
he was that was a scholar figured it out

961
00:44:14,768 --> 00:44:16,029
according to his own read

962
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,409
told everybody how to behave there's the book

963
00:44:18,409 --> 00:44:21,989
you follow this you're good christian augers always had to follow this your

964
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:23,528
good moslem

965
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:26,329
in fact text included

966
00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:27,910
the assertion

967
00:44:27,909 --> 00:44:32,670
which james influenced socially but then politically so that it had power of

968
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,579
influence

969
00:44:33,579 --> 00:44:36,548
in there was a assertion that mathematics and the manipulation of

970
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:37,288
numbers

971
00:44:37,289 --> 00:44:39,109
was the work of the devil

972
00:44:39,108 --> 00:44:40,728
it's hired a prize

973
00:44:40,728 --> 00:44:42,288
collapsed and never recover

974
00:44:42,289 --> 00:44:44,579
it has not recovered sense

975
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:51,380
if you look at the number of muslims who have won the nobel prize in the sciences

976
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:55,588
the virtues of won the nobel prize one fourth of all noble prize is in science

977
00:44:55,588 --> 00:44:57,338
have been one budget

978
00:44:57,338 --> 00:45:00,298
how many muslims in the world one point three billion

979
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:03,568
how many jews in the world fifteen million tops

980
00:45:03,568 --> 00:45:05,018
so you look at what effect

981
00:45:05,018 --> 00:45:09,389
the culture of discovery learning can have on what you discover about the

982
00:45:09,389 --> 00:45:11,449
natural it's extraordinary

983
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:15,168
so just because you're making discoveries doesn't mean it's forever

984
00:45:15,168 --> 00:45:17,818
and i look at the twentieth century in america

985
00:45:17,818 --> 00:45:19,608
as a period of great

986
00:45:19,608 --> 00:45:20,818
discovery

987
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:24,949
nicely forces now operating against it and i look at the history for the

988
00:45:24,949 --> 00:45:28,199
consequences of this and i see america just simply fading

989
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:29,518
into insignificant

990
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,968
no it's not off of the cliff

991
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:32,329
it's a slow

992
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:35,199
that every next day or a little bit further down on the slope you barely

993
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:36,180
notice it right

994
00:45:36,179 --> 00:45:39,088
until one day you can see over the hill that you just came from

995
00:45:39,088 --> 00:45:42,159
and they try to make do with what you have down here then you find out there

996
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:44,219
to rest of the world making the inventions

997
00:45:44,219 --> 00:45:45,768
and knock you

998
00:45:45,768 --> 00:45:48,468
you're trailing no longer leaving you're not even

999
00:45:48,469 --> 00:45:50,200
abreast with what's going on

1000
00:45:50,199 --> 00:45:54,879
your running behind trying to catch up

1001
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,400
have a nice day exquisite

1002
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,019
we've got a question right here

1003
00:46:00,018 --> 00:46:05,198
got a question that's

1004
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,108
part of the look how many times you've got in your pockets i smelled peak

1005
00:46:09,108 --> 00:46:10,630
believed that he wants to

1006
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:15,179
manly all about six seven eight nine proper

1007
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:20,528
we got a teacher right here the heads of the aircraft up

1008
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:21,869
what's your address that

1009
00:46:21,869 --> 00:46:26,728
seventy-year-old question about that before adn part of the basis for

1010
00:46:26,728 --> 00:46:28,518
the defense theory

1011
00:46:28,518 --> 00:46:32,429
is redshift occurs as the

1012
00:46:32,429 --> 00:46:35,018
calcite six sevareid away from us

1013
00:46:35,018 --> 00:46:38,919
how do you distinguish b that pressure from that which for the car

1014
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:43,979
from the into your bones at all because they were born first

1015
00:46:43,978 --> 00:46:44,929
because

1016
00:46:44,929 --> 00:46:46,698
there is this the president

1017
00:46:46,699 --> 00:46:49,068
you should be able to calculate

1018
00:46:49,068 --> 00:46:50,519
trajectories of all the galaxies

1019
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:52,909
and throwing center what's

1020
00:46:52,909 --> 00:46:54,568
cannot do that

1021
00:46:54,568 --> 00:46:56,019
excellent questions sup

1022
00:46:56,019 --> 00:46:57,639
of the first one yes

1023
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:01,640
for those who have been living under a rock we live in an expanding universe

1024
00:47:01,639 --> 00:47:06,009
we know this because we look out to the universe we see galaxies

1025
00:47:06,009 --> 00:47:08,809
and in a discovery made by hubble edwin hubble

1026
00:47:08,809 --> 00:47:11,528
back in nineteen twenty nine was first published

1027
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:15,619
he noted but for the people behind the media right here

1028
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:19,899
i'd look at you every now and then give i can't

1029
00:47:19,898 --> 00:47:21,958
thinking about your thinking about it

1030
00:47:21,958 --> 00:47:23,998
but this is really cool to look at

1031
00:47:23,998 --> 00:47:25,798
buoyed by the way right there

1032
00:47:25,798 --> 00:47:27,869
this is where steven kobe rlic

1033
00:47:27,869 --> 00:47:30,858
right right in that spot okay

1034
00:47:30,858 --> 00:47:33,538
the so you know

1035
00:47:33,539 --> 00:47:35,390
cyclical bear visited the row center

1036
00:47:35,389 --> 00:47:39,150
one afternoon worried that

1037
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:42,009
his talk show comedy talk show host job

1038
00:47:42,009 --> 00:47:43,240
would be in jeopardy

1039
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:46,548
in one of the before back job as an astrophysicist

1040
00:47:46,548 --> 00:47:50,380
so had they train and to be an astrophysicist that afternoon

1041
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,789
s_l_ showed him to be right then

1042
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:55,999
he just decided to lick it

1043
00:47:55,998 --> 00:48:00,348
i said that's the oldest thing your tongue has ever touched

1044
00:48:00,349 --> 00:48:02,588
at five billion years old he said no

1045
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,778
i want to jane fonda on my show

1046
00:48:04,778 --> 00:48:07,849
it's upto ballads like while read that come from

1047
00:48:07,849 --> 00:48:10,558
but then i got up on youtube clip

1048
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:14,519
and jane fonda is on the show and she saw it was around the table sis's lap

1049
00:48:14,518 --> 00:48:16,139
dance from texas

1050
00:48:16,139 --> 00:48:19,628
was like in his head when that was happening

1051
00:48:19,628 --> 00:48:24,518
so but i digress

1052
00:48:24,518 --> 00:48:29,578
jane fonda and the big bang in the same center

1053
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:33,739
so we see the galaxies and hobbled notice that you've data provided by

1054
00:48:33,739 --> 00:48:35,329
others

1055
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,509
and

1056
00:48:36,509 --> 00:48:39,259
common sense like for two very

1057
00:48:39,259 --> 00:48:40,798
a brilliant

1058
00:48:40,798 --> 00:48:41,688
experimental esp

1059
00:48:41,688 --> 00:48:44,239
in the astronomical world we call them observers

1060
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:46,510
so they look at the couches you find out

1061
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:49,039
at the spectrum

1062
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:50,420
criticizing newton the spectrum

1063
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:54,358
this features of the spectrum between a tribute to various

1064
00:48:54,358 --> 00:48:55,898
chemical elements

1065
00:48:55,898 --> 00:49:00,168
carbon has a fingerprint revealed inspection oxygen has a separate

1066
00:49:00,168 --> 00:49:00,858
fingerprint

1067
00:49:00,858 --> 00:49:03,480
by use the fingerprint almost literally here

1068
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,039
that's got itself

1069
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:07,819
every element has its own signature in the spectrum

1070
00:49:07,818 --> 00:49:12,788
so if you know what the pattern of lines the features looks like on earth

1071
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:17,129
you look at the galaxy can find that same pattern but it's shifted

1072
00:49:17,128 --> 00:49:19,688
he saw how much does interest

1073
00:49:19,688 --> 00:49:23,469
that means the galaxy is moving away from us we learned this from chris jon

1074
00:49:23,469 --> 00:49:24,229
doppler

1075
00:49:24,228 --> 00:49:26,778
the german physicist in the eighteen hundreds

1076
00:49:26,778 --> 00:49:30,168
did an experiment with training

1077
00:49:30,168 --> 00:49:31,118
and so

1078
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:32,009
what happens

1079
00:49:32,009 --> 00:49:34,088
the train whistle goes by

1080
00:49:34,088 --> 00:49:38,088
we know this intuitively even if you've never thought that doesn't go

1081
00:49:38,088 --> 00:49:40,768
well let's let's do it with a race car because that's what i can make that

1082
00:49:40,768 --> 00:49:42,298
sound better

1083
00:49:42,298 --> 00:49:45,259
the car

1084
00:49:45,259 --> 00:49:47,380
well

1085
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,878
right that that i get a writer pretty good

1086
00:49:49,878 --> 00:49:53,338
but i get a better than it right

1087
00:49:53,338 --> 00:49:56,259
the card does not go

1088
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:57,809
and he is

1089
00:49:57,809 --> 00:50:00,469
doesn't do that

1090
00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:02,989
doesn't help

1091
00:50:02,989 --> 00:50:05,579
but doesn't do any of that

1092
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:07,399
cal

1093
00:50:07,398 --> 00:50:08,920
high-pitched solo pitch

1094
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,619
so the sound waves up front

1095
00:50:11,619 --> 00:50:15,659
every sound wave it makes it now travels closer to that sound wave

1096
00:50:15,659 --> 00:50:17,209
before it makes the next wek

1097
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:18,419
so that pitch

1098
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:22,588
so the wavelength this shorter the pictures hotter

1099
00:50:22,588 --> 00:50:26,259
and when it receives the sound waves gets stretched apart

1100
00:50:26,259 --> 00:50:27,588
you get a lower pitch

1101
00:50:27,588 --> 00:50:30,630
so n malad rising what we see in the universe

1102
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:34,028
you could conclude again you can conclude

1103
00:50:34,028 --> 00:50:38,289
the galaxies that show the shift to longer wavelengths of light

1104
00:50:38,289 --> 00:50:41,869
are moving away from stay indeed work even smell test

1105
00:50:41,869 --> 00:50:44,959
that if you were twice as far away

1106
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,078
the object moving twice as fast

1107
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:49,539
and he looked in every direction and found

1108
00:50:49,539 --> 00:50:53,970
with some kind of case of cosmic beall or something called the galaxies

1109
00:50:53,969 --> 00:50:56,169
work scattering away from us

1110
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:57,798
all except for a couple

1111
00:50:57,798 --> 00:51:00,559
that are really nearby like the andromeda galaxy

1112
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:01,869
which we will collide with

1113
00:51:01,869 --> 00:51:05,439
in a few billion years more on that later

1114
00:51:05,438 --> 00:51:09,118
if you're interested get the media right before that 'cause that'll be more

1115
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,079
important so

1116
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:15,469
it's later turns out

1117
00:51:15,469 --> 00:51:16,278
feinstein

1118
00:51:16,278 --> 00:51:20,230
shows us that this redshift is not specifically

1119
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:21,278
accomplish if it's a car

1120
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:23,518
we call a cosmological redshift

1121
00:51:23,518 --> 00:51:25,678
it shifts because

1122
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:27,959
space itself is expanding

1123
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:30,339
as all the way it as it moves through space

1124
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,749
gets stretched

1125
00:51:31,748 --> 00:51:35,688
in the expansion the fabric of space and time itself

1126
00:51:35,688 --> 00:51:38,298
and so everybody's move in a while

1127
00:51:38,298 --> 00:51:39,719
turn the clock back

1128
00:51:39,719 --> 00:51:42,608
you can ask the question when was it all in the same place

1129
00:51:42,608 --> 00:51:43,719
at the same time

1130
00:51:43,719 --> 00:51:46,269
that was fourteen billion years ago

1131
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,409
that's how we dig the big bang

1132
00:51:48,409 --> 00:51:52,628
look around turn the clock back and which way is everybody got back to the

1133
00:51:52,628 --> 00:51:54,328
same spot

1134
00:51:54,329 --> 00:51:56,869
it looks like we're at the center

1135
00:51:56,869 --> 00:52:00,298
but the signature of this expansion would be revealed no matter where you

1136
00:52:00,298 --> 00:52:01,059
are

1137
00:52:01,059 --> 00:52:03,599
if you go to this other galaxy over here

1138
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:07,489
this expanding fabric of the universe will look like i said about this galaxy

1139
00:52:07,489 --> 00:52:08,798
as well

1140
00:52:08,798 --> 00:52:12,909
so everybody was at the center forty billion years ago

1141
00:52:12,909 --> 00:52:15,268
discussing center somewhere else

1142
00:52:15,268 --> 00:52:18,228
we all occupied it in a different state

1143
00:52:18,228 --> 00:52:19,518
at the same time

1144
00:52:19,518 --> 00:52:21,548
at the same place

1145
00:52:21,548 --> 00:52:23,688
fourteen billion years ago

1146
00:52:23,688 --> 00:52:30,688
to answer both questions

1147
00:52:31,139 --> 00:52:34,509
well agent yet so how do you know this ship is not because the things getting

1148
00:52:34,509 --> 00:52:36,599
old because if you're getting older

1149
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:38,800
you might have some red stars in there

1150
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,528
it doesn't actually shift the lines

1151
00:52:40,528 --> 00:52:42,969
you can change the color but without shifting

1152
00:52:42,969 --> 00:52:47,108
that the pattern of lives that's why we look at the

1153
00:52:47,108 --> 00:52:49,670
fingerprints here there are there

1154
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:51,900
and you know it's not something else going on

1155
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,729
let's get another twitter verse question you got one

1156
00:52:54,728 --> 00:52:58,608
anoop now you can start with our man will know you're just messing with me

1157
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:00,938
but you're a good omg

1158
00:53:00,938 --> 00:53:01,928
abs

1159
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:02,900
carelessly

1160
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:03,838
okay

1161
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:05,639
actor tyson

1162
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:09,039
and this is a tweet from the are awesome

1163
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:10,409
or a career

1164
00:53:10,409 --> 00:53:15,849
what percentage of outer espy's estimated to have in a deserved

1165
00:53:15,849 --> 00:53:22,849
and what is estimated that can be it served

1166
00:53:23,179 --> 00:53:26,969
potato parts of the universe data blocked from our view

1167
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:27,849
because

1168
00:53:27,849 --> 00:53:29,869
we live

1169
00:53:29,869 --> 00:53:32,209
pancake

1170
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:33,038
pancake

1171
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:36,469
so implementing we are blueberry in a pancake

1172
00:53:36,469 --> 00:53:40,648
now most blueberries are slightly wider than the width of your pink most

1173
00:53:40,648 --> 00:53:43,489
so they've sort of punch out above and below

1174
00:53:43,489 --> 00:53:45,400
our galaxy is like the pancake

1175
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,909
we are like the blueberry

1176
00:53:46,909 --> 00:53:49,119
if you want to see the rest of the universe

1177
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,400
you have to look above and below the pancake

1178
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,430
because i was the pancake itself is in the way

1179
00:53:54,429 --> 00:53:57,210
so all the data we have on this universe

1180
00:53:57,210 --> 00:53:58,059
comes to us

1181
00:53:58,059 --> 00:53:59,639
from looking above

1182
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:04,199
our flattened milky way galaxy and bowls

1183
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:07,289
all the data we have on cosmology

1184
00:54:07,289 --> 00:54:08,259
and so

1185
00:54:08,259 --> 00:54:10,548
in the known universe in fact

1186
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:14,528
there is a part where we sexually showing you can only universe

1187
00:54:14,528 --> 00:54:17,588
it means where there isn't another universe you get to see the unknown

1188
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:19,420
universe is the absence

1189
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:20,749
of the known universe

1190
00:54:20,748 --> 00:54:22,928
and so i will moderate and i'll show you

1191
00:54:22,929 --> 00:54:26,869
the cut through the sky where we don't yet have deep data

1192
00:54:26,869 --> 00:54:29,380
on the universe because woodstock

1193
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:31,640
inside of attendance disk

1194
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:33,969
of clouds of gas and dust

1195
00:54:33,969 --> 00:54:37,898
that prevents you from outside so here we are rising from the d'amato you guys

1196
00:54:37,898 --> 00:54:38,838
can see

1197
00:54:38,838 --> 00:54:40,878
sobbed i'll describe it for you

1198
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:44,368
weeks we are now overheating above the earth or fiza

1199
00:54:44,369 --> 00:54:47,949
we don't get to see how thin respect this year it is

1200
00:54:47,949 --> 00:54:48,869
the first

1201
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:51,199
were schoolroom glowed

1202
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:53,360
shrunk to that size that hurts atmosphere

1203
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,639
would be the thickness

1204
00:54:55,639 --> 00:54:59,679
of the lacquer on that schoolroom glow

1205
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:03,909
yet we think of it as this huge motion appear but it is in fact not

1206
00:55:03,909 --> 00:55:05,838
and if earth were school globe

1207
00:55:05,838 --> 00:55:09,259
the moon would be thirty feet away

1208
00:55:09,259 --> 00:55:11,269
mars would be a mile away

1209
00:55:11,268 --> 00:55:12,909
the space station the space shuttle

1210
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:17,548
will be forty three x of an inch above its surface

1211
00:55:17,548 --> 00:55:21,068
nasa tells us that that's going into space

1212
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:25,248
boldly going out where hundreds have gone before looked at it

1213
00:55:25,248 --> 00:55:27,278
so we're still sending from earth

1214
00:55:27,278 --> 00:55:31,309
it's a slow ascent actually be awhile before we get released a minute or two

1215
00:55:31,309 --> 00:55:34,909
before we get to the edge of the known universe there so there are section so i

1216
00:55:34,909 --> 00:55:36,280
would say we have mapped

1217
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,389
to the edge of the universe

1218
00:55:38,389 --> 00:55:40,579
uh... we've looked

1219
00:55:40,579 --> 00:55:41,919
in

1220
00:55:41,918 --> 00:55:43,358
artsy eighty percent

1221
00:55:43,358 --> 00:55:46,000
of the universe were not given the reason to think

1222
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,108
that if we could look

1223
00:55:48,108 --> 00:55:51,389
in those blocks zones that would be fundamentally different from the other

1224
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:52,058
eighty percent

1225
00:55:52,059 --> 00:55:53,778
so nobody's really worried

1226
00:55:53,778 --> 00:55:56,369
that they're like gremlins on the other side of this

1227
00:55:56,369 --> 00:55:58,239
this this this song

1228
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:01,449
and by the way that for a while that was known as the zone of avoidance

1229
00:56:01,449 --> 00:56:04,699
because we know it we did see the catholic season that band

1230
00:56:04,699 --> 00:56:07,639
it's not that the galaxies were boarding up is that they were simply not visible

1231
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:08,529
to us

1232
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:12,669
you can see the clouds the cloudy band that is the milky way

1233
00:56:12,668 --> 00:56:15,309
they'll give way is not visible from new york city

1234
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:16,728
but it is up there

1235
00:56:16,728 --> 00:56:20,739
it's plus a feasible from the hayden skier above us

1236
00:56:20,739 --> 00:56:23,889
if you come to one of our celestial highlights evenings

1237
00:56:23,889 --> 00:56:26,169
to get to see the night sky

1238
00:56:26,168 --> 00:56:28,438
and so there's a galaxy in view

1239
00:56:28,438 --> 00:56:31,168
we're about to sab still describe the play-by-play

1240
00:56:31,168 --> 00:56:33,348
you guys were behind the screen

1241
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:37,919
and whistles zooming out officially the constellations will distort

1242
00:56:37,918 --> 00:56:41,108
people think also which is a real things with reopens just

1243
00:56:41,108 --> 00:56:43,889
this pattern that you happen to see from earth

1244
00:56:43,889 --> 00:56:46,358
and restore expanded that here we go

1245
00:56:46,358 --> 00:56:47,679
we that

1246
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:51,400
that's the radio bubble that into that bubble has like howdy doody radio show

1247
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,519
on it

1248
00:56:52,518 --> 00:56:53,529
and so

1249
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:56,429
there's our galaxy the milky way

1250
00:56:56,429 --> 00:57:00,479
and so now you'll see data now you'll see these empty spots in the data

1251
00:57:00,478 --> 00:57:03,608
just watch as the nearby galaxies come into view

1252
00:57:03,608 --> 00:57:04,938
you'll see these

1253
00:57:04,938 --> 00:57:06,579
uh... almost

1254
00:57:06,579 --> 00:57:07,688
chance

1255
00:57:07,688 --> 00:57:09,298
here we come

1256
00:57:09,298 --> 00:57:10,099
now

1257
00:57:10,099 --> 00:57:12,078
take a look at these two slots

1258
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:13,239
above and below

1259
00:57:13,239 --> 00:57:18,019
looks like a butterfly diagram those two slots

1260
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:23,358
stifle lines unavailable to us because our own fricking galaxies in the way

1261
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:25,748
so i give it about eighty percent of

1262
00:57:25,748 --> 00:57:27,009
of the universe

1263
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:30,570
other questions who's got the most manly time for a few more questions like this

1264
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:32,910
ok this one's from behind the meteor

1265
00:57:32,909 --> 00:57:36,568
behind the media right but you know if you have your voice this priced dies in

1266
00:57:36,568 --> 00:57:40,778
this for you personal in the person where what point in your life was it

1267
00:57:40,778 --> 00:57:43,639
that you became like this is what i want to do

1268
00:57:43,639 --> 00:57:45,638
it was the grown up with a

1269
00:57:45,639 --> 00:57:46,409
very

1270
00:57:46,409 --> 00:57:50,108
afoot family and they were like okay let's check out you know astrophysicist

1271
00:57:50,108 --> 00:57:54,969
was very big part of my life growing up you get to a point like carl sagan was

1272
00:57:54,969 --> 00:57:58,949
seen that's me almost a god is a younger guy they going up like you you've

1273
00:57:58,949 --> 00:58:02,259
brought back like the passion note that's in there

1274
00:58:02,259 --> 00:58:06,309
this kind of something that's been lost very noel was almost two decades at what

1275
00:58:06,309 --> 00:58:09,798
point near life or was it like this is it this is what i want to be a man

1276
00:58:09,798 --> 00:58:13,628
you've brought back a lot of the passion to it that's kind of been missing for a

1277
00:58:13,628 --> 00:58:15,469
very long time well thank you

1278

00:58:17,949 --> 00:58:20,968
high almost can't control

1281
00:58:20,969 --> 00:58:21,759
disputes that

1282
00:58:21,759 --> 00:58:27,358
but the universe is stuff

1283
00:58:27,358 --> 00:58:29,418
when was that i was

1284
00:58:29,418 --> 00:58:30,938
nineteen years old

1285
00:58:30,938 --> 00:58:32,239
where was i do

1286
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:35,639
in the dome of the hayden planetarium

1287
00:58:35,639 --> 00:58:38,328
haha

1288
00:58:38,329 --> 00:58:39,500

1289
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:44,179
my parents took me my brother my sister on another weekend trip so the cultural

1290
00:58:44,179 --> 00:58:45,039
offerings

1291
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:46,079
of the city

1292
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:49,519
it was it wasn't here it would have been at the art museum warranty

1293
00:58:49,518 --> 00:58:50,169
the place

1294
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:54,300
is even operas and weird stuff that you're ten years old it's kinda weird

1295
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,849
but we got that exposure

1296
00:58:55,849 --> 00:58:56,940
and there i am

1297
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:01,809
i'm in the sky and the delam i'm looking up that lights did the stars come out di

1298
00:59:01,809 --> 00:59:04,338
grew up with the broths

1299
00:59:04,338 --> 00:59:06,518
and in the bronx we say

1300
00:59:06,518 --> 00:59:10,508
we got brought to the house apparently

1301
00:59:10,509 --> 00:59:12,949
liberty st dot roxbury so

1302
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:15,269
their the stars come out

1303
00:59:15,268 --> 00:59:17,698
and i say let's charming you know

1304
00:59:17,699 --> 00:59:20,460
but so that's an interesting hoax

1305
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:24,179
aren't that many stars in the night sky i've seen all eight of them from the

1306
00:59:24,179 --> 00:59:26,358
bronx i know by there's a lot

1307
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:30,150
i'll go along with it anyway sister humor them

1308
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:33,170
and i'm mayor and then that voice comes over the you know

1309
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:35,099
the planet envoy says the next

1310
00:59:35,099 --> 00:59:39,200
thing to god you'll ever hear is the planetary directors voice

1311
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:41,828
coming out of the sky alright

1312
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:45,789
and we know

1313
00:59:45,789 --> 00:59:50,119
mckinney's descendants of you know it's like howard's or your vet

1314
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:51,380
and at that point

1315
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:52,599
it's as though

1316
00:59:52,599 --> 00:59:57,028
i had no choice in the matter and the universe called me

1317
00:59:57,028 --> 01:00:00,579
and from then on our end of the something really cool about the universe

1318
01:00:00,579 --> 01:00:02,079
which takes three years

1319
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:04,969
so i was eleven to know that it could be a career

1320
01:00:04,969 --> 01:00:08,679
at nine oh two humming to make money but i think i think in that

1321
01:00:08,679 --> 01:00:10,548
eleven i knew enough

1322
01:00:10,548 --> 01:00:16,608
that it was time to direct my life in such a way for to become a career

1323
01:00:16,608 --> 01:00:18,809
fence for exciting extra classes

1324
01:00:18,809 --> 01:00:21,548
here at the hayden planetarium i still have

1325
01:00:21,548 --> 01:00:22,199
certificates

1326
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:25,409
of graduating from those classes signed by the director

1327
01:00:25,409 --> 01:00:27,668
at that time

1328
01:00:27,668 --> 01:00:29,888
when i became direct

1329
01:00:29,889 --> 01:00:31,939
ice or

1330
01:00:31,938 --> 01:00:33,768
that i would try

1331
01:00:33,768 --> 01:00:37,579
to have the influence on others that the educators and scientist

1332
01:00:37,579 --> 01:00:38,480
back then

1333
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,639
had on me and

1334
01:00:39,639 --> 01:00:43,029
until just recently and so we shifted our programmatic

1335
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:43,699
offerings

1336
01:00:43,699 --> 01:00:44,409
ice-t's

1337
01:00:44,409 --> 01:00:48,059
in those certificates of those who graduated from the courses

1338
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:55,059
just as the director had signed my certificate

1339
01:00:55,188 --> 01:00:59,190
i sign up with my pocket full of hands right

1340
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:01,188
so that's how and that's why

1341
01:01:01,188 --> 01:01:03,089
and as carl sagan said when you're in love

1342
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:06,670
the you got to tell the world

1343
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:08,659
that's not a heart blood

1344
01:01:08,659 --> 01:01:09,880
to catch

1345
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,849
pretty easy to catch

1346
01:01:11,849 --> 01:01:15,278
and one of those caught at that uh... it they're off

1347
01:01:15,278 --> 01:01:17,239
they're doing it

1348
01:01:17,239 --> 01:01:20,159
and effect without a kid i thought i could i would be a national physicist

1349
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:21,489
because everyone will want to be there

1350
01:01:21,489 --> 01:01:23,188
but they do this they don't want to be etc

1351
01:01:23,188 --> 01:01:26,478
the beetle jobs that i had that fight crazy thought

1352
01:01:26,478 --> 01:01:29,588
that i found out know most people actually don't care

1353
01:01:29,588 --> 01:01:32,070
no maybe package change

1354
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:34,980
the state of the war question on the basis for what so quickly

1355
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:39,168
the lady who wants to go to phoenix yes

1356
01:01:39,168 --> 01:01:40,268
funny

1357
01:01:40,268 --> 01:01:46,208
pilot hobbs we don't want to talk about kolkata pepperoni pizza

1358
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:48,898
monsters among the twenty nine started

1359
01:01:48,898 --> 01:01:52,818
uh... here's my question for the future of nasa it's it they concern for those

1360
01:01:52,818 --> 01:01:57,308
of us to believe in the president's never planet and

1361
01:01:57,309 --> 01:01:59,599
the world in which we live

1362
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:03,409
can you elaborate on what the status is with that and then can you talk about

1363
01:02:03,409 --> 01:02:08,530
that last right that's your president after i put folk at self

1364
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:13,199
bobby nasa it right now there's a political battle going on in congress

1365
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:16,159
regarding what happens over the next several years with nasa

1366
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:18,479
the obama plan

1367
01:02:18,478 --> 01:02:19,958
as it was

1368
01:02:19,958 --> 01:02:21,308
put forrest

1369
01:02:21,309 --> 01:02:23,219
would shifts

1370
01:02:23,219 --> 01:02:25,679
emphasis from the kind of launch vehicles

1371
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:27,239
that serve the shuttle

1372
01:02:27,239 --> 01:02:30,289
to the kind of what's vehicles that we serve a trip

1373
01:02:30,289 --> 01:02:32,419
tomorrow's bypassing the moon

1374
01:02:32,418 --> 01:02:35,148
meanwhile there people there's a huge industry built up

1375
01:02:35,148 --> 01:02:36,578
that serves the shuttle

1376
01:02:36,579 --> 01:02:39,899
meanwhile there's a whole community people who want to go back to the moon

1377
01:02:39,898 --> 01:02:42,989
uh... i would even count myself among those

1378
01:02:42,989 --> 01:02:45,199
my next trip out of low-earth orbit

1379
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:48,639
i wanted to be a four year journey i like that i will remind myself how to do

1380
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:51,219
this animal is three days away

1381
01:02:51,219 --> 01:02:54,289
into that in a new cycle right you can get them back

1382
01:02:54,289 --> 01:02:58,099
jected reasons you know kick the tires make sure everything's working

1383
01:02:58,099 --> 01:03:00,528
but i don't you'll be in the middle of that today

1384
01:03:00,528 --> 01:03:02,639
i actually celebrate

1385
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:06,598
because i try to be stratospheric here eyebrow to celebrate the fact

1386
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:08,740
that we have the luxury to argue

1387
01:03:08,739 --> 01:03:11,638
over what nasa's next destination would be

1388
01:03:11,639 --> 01:03:16,108
rather than worry about neces budget at all so i think it's it's actually happy

1389
01:03:16,108 --> 01:03:18,119
time that we're having these debates

1390
01:03:18,119 --> 01:03:19,500
debates in congress

1391
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:23,998
antelope putting the alarm strong against the next generation

1392
01:03:23,998 --> 01:03:27,958
entrepreneurs disorders there's some shocking going on

1393
01:03:27,958 --> 01:03:29,798
i'm not i'm not idon't

1394
01:03:29,798 --> 01:03:32,548
get in the middle of those fights

1395
01:03:32,548 --> 01:03:34,969
that's the concern is if we

1396
01:03:34,969 --> 01:03:36,019
break are

1397
01:03:36,019 --> 01:03:36,728
presence in

1398
01:03:36,728 --> 01:03:39,038
on their presence in space

1399
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:40,319
for five years

1400
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:42,079
maybe it'll never come back at all

1401
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,519
that's always a risk you cut the budget in the government as some sp something

1402
01:03:45,518 --> 01:03:50,158
else happens all the priority comes up it's easy to never bring it back again

1403
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:53,519
you know the pyramids in egypt

1404
01:03:53,518 --> 01:03:56,858
they stopped building pyramids a lot of the renata farrow's to build terrorist

1405
01:03:56,858 --> 01:03:57,880
who are they ran out of my

1406
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,048
that one day they stopped

1407
01:04:01,048 --> 01:04:03,978
guild appeared at the top of the tallest pyramid

1408
01:04:03,978 --> 01:04:08,048
do you know what year

1409
01:04:08,048 --> 01:04:12,139
we'd build something caller then that in it

1410
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:15,419
after that pyramid was built

1411
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:19,400
anybody now

1412
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:23,039
it was in the pass expo

1413
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,969
the eiffel tower

1414
01:04:24,969 --> 01:04:27,579
was the first object we ever built

1415
01:04:27,579 --> 01:04:28,840
as a species

1416
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:29,749
taller

1417
01:04:29,748 --> 01:04:31,498
then the pyramids

1418
01:04:31,498 --> 01:04:34,480
so just because you're doing something of one particular

1419
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,298
doesn't mean it will continue for ever

1420
01:04:36,298 --> 01:04:40,159
effect one of the migrate fears is that univ taking it for granted because it

1421
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:41,348
surrounds you all the time

1422
01:04:41,349 --> 01:04:45,269
it forget what investment a previous generation may fit

1423
01:04:45,268 --> 01:04:46,868
his cults

1424
01:04:46,869 --> 01:04:50,179
but you don't realize that you coasting downhill

1425
01:04:50,179 --> 01:04:53,939
and you end up what like i said no longer be able to see

1426
01:04:53,938 --> 01:04:55,049
above where you need

1427
01:04:55,050 --> 01:04:56,139
so

1428
01:04:56,139 --> 01:04:58,639
uptick there's some people worried about that gap

1429
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:02,559
i'm a little more confident i know people working within the obama

1430
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:03,629
administration

1431
01:05:03,628 --> 01:05:04,038
and

1432
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:05,219
and i've met him

1433
01:05:05,219 --> 01:05:07,059
east seem sincere to me

1434
01:05:07,059 --> 01:05:11,579
uh... steven factoring in the car is worth

1435
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:14,439
subtracting that out but that would be no matter what he tells you you know

1436
01:05:14,438 --> 01:05:18,719
it's this charisma they're such type i got a filter for that right

1437
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:24,059
the filter that is it still real and i got the sense that it still real but

1438
01:05:24,059 --> 01:05:25,059
we'll see

1439
01:05:25,059 --> 01:05:26,329
we've got to see how that goes

1440
01:05:26,329 --> 01:05:28,839
your next question was or the asteroid

1441
01:05:28,838 --> 01:05:32,188
are you worried about the asteroid

1442
01:05:32,188 --> 01:05:35,628
stall liam

1443
01:05:35,628 --> 01:05:38,608
the apple there's an asteroid headed our way

1444
01:05:38,608 --> 01:05:45,608
about i want you to describing this ad who we have not seen that youtube it

1445
01:05:46,518 --> 01:05:53,518
so this fucking versions of the aisle my utube version of okay

1446
01:05:56,108 --> 01:05:58,739
december two thousand four

1447
01:05:58,739 --> 01:06:00,849
effect i may have to end on this question present

1448
01:06:00,849 --> 01:06:07,358
other flesh it out in ways that there's no way another question can follow

1449
01:06:07,358 --> 01:06:09,159
december two thousand four

1450
01:06:09,159 --> 01:06:10,818
we discover

1451
01:06:10,818 --> 01:06:14,038
we again next month my community a man out there

1452
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:16,449
occasionally out there but most the time i see week

1453
01:06:16,449 --> 01:06:20,179
it's not me it's just we the astrophysicist

1454
01:06:20,179 --> 01:06:22,028
december two thousand four

1455
01:06:22,028 --> 01:06:24,349
we discover an asteroid

1456
01:06:24,349 --> 01:06:28,499
we have a couple of data points on its position in the sky

1457
01:06:28,498 --> 01:06:31,718
you look at its speed to get a doppler shift on it

1458
01:06:31,719 --> 01:06:35,989
you get its direction you plug it into the computer

1459
01:06:35,989 --> 01:06:39,719
there was at some twenty percent chance it was that if it works

1460
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:44,009
on april thirteenth twenty thirty six

1461
01:06:44,009 --> 01:06:45,938
did you hear about this asteroid when it

1462
01:06:45,938 --> 01:06:50,489
was discovered no because that same week

1463
01:06:50,489 --> 01:06:53,298
was the indonesian tsunami

1464
01:06:53,298 --> 01:06:54,929
that same week

1465
01:06:54,929 --> 01:07:00,659
and so rightfully so it did not believe the headlines the way the tsunami did

1466
01:07:00,659 --> 01:07:04,439
however if you did the calculation you would show

1467
01:07:04,438 --> 01:07:07,759
if it hit the earth in the center of the uncertainty range

1468
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,900
he would hit the pacific ocean

1469
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:12,539
five hundred miles forty five a co-authors

1470
01:07:12,539 --> 01:07:14,548
west of santa monica

1471
01:07:14,548 --> 01:07:15,449
would plunge

1472
01:07:15,449 --> 01:07:16,898
g into the ocean

1473
01:07:16,898 --> 01:07:20,588
to a depth of three months

1474
01:07:20,588 --> 01:07:23,358
it would explode at that depth

1475
01:07:23,358 --> 01:07:24,608
cavite eighteen the ocean

1476
01:07:24,608 --> 01:07:27,699
in a whole three miles wide

1477
01:07:27,699 --> 01:07:30,249
now you have a wall of war

1478
01:07:30,248 --> 01:07:31,938
three miles high

1479
01:07:31,938 --> 01:07:35,318
what happens to that wall of water

1480
01:07:35,318 --> 01:07:39,778
expert just bills back into the hall that was just made

1481
01:07:39,778 --> 01:07:43,509
splashes into itself rises high again

1482
01:07:43,509 --> 01:07:46,838
the fullest that's first impact crater tsunami

1483
01:07:46,838 --> 01:07:48,750
this five stories told by the way

1484
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:52,199
this asteroids the size of the rose bowl

1485
01:07:52,199 --> 01:07:55,079
in other words the it would fit neatly

1486
01:07:55,079 --> 01:08:02,079
in the rose bowl the way in taking does intake cup

1487
01:08:05,228 --> 01:08:07,068
is the first place

1488
01:08:07,068 --> 01:08:09,778
the first wave is just from the first impact

1489
01:08:09,778 --> 01:08:13,068
decapitate the ocean it fills up again

1490
01:08:13,068 --> 01:08:16,090
rises high into the stratosphere forced back

1491
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:17,969
cava takes the ocean again

1492
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:22,819
now it's water capitated notion not the asteroid that sends another way

1493
01:08:22,819 --> 01:08:25,239
at this repeats

1494
01:08:25,238 --> 01:08:28,288
calculation show this will be about forty times

1495
01:08:28,288 --> 01:08:29,798
forty time sc

1496
01:08:29,798 --> 01:08:33,238
forty tsunami that one right after another

1497
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:34,968
what's interesting to me

1498
01:08:34,969 --> 01:08:36,998
is that that somalis

1499
01:08:36,998 --> 01:08:40,149
would take up the entire west coast of united states

1500
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:42,129
potentially in dollars in damage

1501
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:47,219
it would make the indonesian tsunami look like a slightly over flooding pablo

1502
01:08:47,219 --> 01:08:53,088
so it was a lost opportunity to compare and contrast magnitudes of disaster

1503
01:08:53,088 --> 01:08:56,809
it would later makes the news with better data became available

1504
01:08:56,809 --> 01:08:59,609
but let me explain this salon it to you

1505
01:08:59,609 --> 01:09:03,369
so it's a father to wall of water five stories tall

1506
01:09:03,368 --> 01:09:07,788
the next somani forty seconds later good to be pollster very forty to fifty

1507
01:09:07,788 --> 01:09:08,278
seconds

1508
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:10,999
the next monday needs that work

1509
01:09:10,998 --> 01:09:13,019
is not a deliberate supply of water

1510
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:17,629
the first wave is got some of the water but the second somali wants to use

1511
01:09:17,628 --> 01:09:22,289
so what happens the friction on egos in only as far

1512
01:09:22,289 --> 01:09:25,170
because forty seconds into it

1513
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:27,989
they default with what twenty seconds it away

1514
01:09:27,988 --> 01:09:28,959
twenty-second back

1515
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,088
for the next summer

1516
01:09:31,088 --> 01:09:34,229
so in fact if you do the calculation you can show

1517
01:09:34,229 --> 01:09:38,149
the tsunami would not go past about a quarter mile inland

1518
01:09:38,149 --> 01:09:39,579
the set up a rope

1519
01:09:39,579 --> 01:09:41,949
you know like one of those club ropes

1520
01:09:41,949 --> 01:09:45,000
anticipated watch the whole thing happened

1521
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,689
the waves come in

1522
01:09:47,689 --> 01:09:52,230
passed through the mud million-dollar multi-million-dollar malibu homes

1523
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:56,238
the way it comes out bring almost

1524
01:09:56,238 --> 01:09:59,339
next wave comes takes the holding back

1525
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:02,998
in a slightly different shape that it was before

1526
01:10:02,998 --> 01:10:06,000
this process basically of the lates

1527
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,420
the entire west coast of united states

1528
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:11,270
we would know this in advance

1529
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:14,080
thanks to isaac newton and his two equations

1530
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:16,059
he developed as any

1531
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:18,048
twenty six-year-old urgent

1532
01:10:18,048 --> 01:10:20,670
and so

1533
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:23,710
so actually nobody has to dark

1534
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:26,810
they'll still do the ten trillion dollars in damage but nobody we

1535
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:29,449
we notice in advance

1536
01:10:29,448 --> 01:10:32,738
but i thought about it there to people who will die

1537
01:10:32,738 --> 01:10:33,958
two people

1538
01:10:33,958 --> 01:10:36,309
and you know there

1539
01:10:36,309 --> 01:10:39,849
use the idiots surfer who wants to get that last way

1540
01:10:39,849 --> 01:10:42,679
you know

1541
01:10:42,679 --> 01:10:44,849
radnor barbara you know

1542
01:10:44,849 --> 01:10:50,659
the the excerpt we've got one dead surfer

1543
01:10:50,658 --> 01:10:53,149
one dead weatherman

1544
01:10:53,149 --> 01:10:56,868
you know the weathermen try to get the camera closer to the allocate

1545
01:10:56,868 --> 01:10:57,779
you look at the white

1546
01:10:57,779 --> 01:11:01,899
it's crashing on the golf get out of the chemically is back it up in the polls

1547
01:11:01,899 --> 01:11:02,659
event

1548
01:11:02,659 --> 01:11:03,898
wondered whether

1549
01:11:03,899 --> 01:11:06,829
two dead people right that's what you get

1550
01:11:06,828 --> 01:11:11,599
so a little later we would learn we get better data

1551
01:11:11,599 --> 01:11:13,710
once you discover an asteroid

1552
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:15,519
and you know it's trajectory

1553
01:11:15,519 --> 01:11:18,759
you could look in historical photos

1554
01:11:18,759 --> 01:11:22,988
for where it would have been in the past if you've got your trajectory

1555
01:11:22,988 --> 01:11:27,569
if that becomes useful data team it's called a pre discovery photo

1556
01:11:27,569 --> 01:11:29,248
it's comin' in my field

1557
01:11:29,248 --> 01:11:32,868
once you have a general direction that something's going and you just turn the

1558
01:11:32,868 --> 01:11:34,398
clock back

1559
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,869
one suite

1560
01:11:35,868 --> 01:11:38,259
pre rediscovery photos

1561
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:39,989
that's a better data later

1562
01:11:39,988 --> 01:11:41,459
we'll be able to to

1563
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,038
what was going to happen

1564
01:11:43,038 --> 01:11:45,809
so here's what will happen

1565
01:11:45,809 --> 01:11:50,020
april thirteenth in the year twenty twenty-nine

1566
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:53,139
that's one orbit away from the twenty thirty six date

1567
01:11:53,139 --> 01:11:57,730
it has a seven-year intersection orbit with her on that day people thirteenths

1568
01:11:57,729 --> 01:11:59,549
which by the way

1569
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:02,788
friday un so

1570
01:12:02,788 --> 01:12:04,029
april thirteenth

1571
01:12:04,029 --> 01:12:05,399
twenty twenty-nine

1572
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:09,929
this asteroid named pop artists

1573
01:12:09,929 --> 01:12:14,590
maine for the trip shin guard of death and darkness

1574
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:18,190
named of course only after we calculated extra jaxtr

1575
01:12:18,189 --> 01:12:20,198
to intersect art

1576
01:12:20,198 --> 01:12:24,799
if there were not going to hit earth we couldn't name date like bambi or

1577
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,649
something non-threatening right

1578
01:12:28,649 --> 01:12:32,039
freddie you know something that no it's not hurting anybody

1579
01:12:32,038 --> 01:12:34,748
name that one up office

1580
01:12:34,748 --> 01:12:35,559
so

1581
01:12:35,559 --> 01:12:37,838
we know for sir

1582
01:12:37,838 --> 01:12:39,420
that apocalypse

1583
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:42,958
on friday the thirteenth people twenty twenty-nine

1584
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:45,938
x the size of the rose bowl it'll get close enough to earth

1585
01:12:45,939 --> 01:12:47,060
that will tip

1586
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:51,860
hilo earth's communication satellites would be the biggest closest thing

1587
01:12:51,859 --> 01:12:53,569
advert to come

1588
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:56,288
known to come nearer

1589
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:59,498
the communications satellite sergio synchronous orbit about twenty three

1590
01:12:59,498 --> 01:13:00,698
thousand miles up

1591
01:13:00,698 --> 01:13:03,478
this will come in at eighteen thousand miles

1592
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:06,239
it'll be visible from northern europe

1593
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:09,538
the the the says already went to the hotel rooms they are so you're not

1594
01:13:09,538 --> 01:13:12,300
you're out of block

1595
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:15,880
because they did the math and i knew when when and where it's going to happen

1596
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:19,679
uh... it'll look like a very to success moving bright object across the night

1597
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:20,989
sky

1598
01:13:20,988 --> 01:13:25,998
moving at about what speed do i give it all around ten miles per second

1599
01:13:25,998 --> 01:13:28,920
this best paul that that's fast

1600
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,560
so

1601
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,929
here's the catch

1602
01:13:32,929 --> 01:13:37,368
it's borge remains sufficiently uncertain

1603
01:13:37,368 --> 01:13:39,529
buddy back up

1604
01:13:39,529 --> 01:13:43,039
in the possible range of war but it could have

1605
01:13:43,039 --> 01:13:45,429
on that fateful day

1606
01:13:45,429 --> 01:13:48,310
there is a dc interval range

1607
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:51,830
where if it's rank that whole called akeel

1608
01:13:51,829 --> 01:13:55,668
it's a six hundred mile about six hundred mark several hundred mile

1609
01:13:55,668 --> 01:13:56,448
range

1610
01:13:56,448 --> 01:13:59,559
diverse work goes through that range

1611
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:04,530
earth's gravity will be just flat

1612
01:14:04,529 --> 01:14:06,059
or rather

1613
01:14:06,059 --> 01:14:08,130
she was wrong

1614
01:14:08,130 --> 01:14:09,498
so that

1615
01:14:09,498 --> 01:14:15,408
it will alter its orbit so that it will hit us seven years later

1616
01:14:15,408 --> 01:14:18,869
so the test is isn't going to go through the keyhole

1617
01:14:18,869 --> 01:14:21,809
the latest estimates or that the likelihood

1618
01:14:21,809 --> 01:14:23,338
with updated data

1619
01:14:23,338 --> 01:14:28,719
at the likelihood that it'll go through the keyhole is several in a million

1620
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:30,730
much better for us then the

1621
01:14:30,729 --> 01:14:34,558
thirty percent first estimate or the one in forty two thousand estimate

1622
01:14:34,559 --> 01:14:37,248
that have been around for a couple of years

1623
01:14:37,248 --> 01:14:40,599
jason all i'm not a problem

1624
01:14:40,599 --> 01:14:43,099
their people think that problem watery

1625
01:14:43,099 --> 01:14:48,828
with work spots then that expecting that they're going to win

1626
01:14:48,828 --> 01:14:51,849
would you put ten trillion dollars

1627
01:14:51,849 --> 01:14:53,699
in harm's way

1628
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:56,938
actually if any any insurance people here are no that's gotta be

1629
01:14:56,939 --> 01:15:00,010
you just do the math right ten trillion dollars divided by the

1630
01:15:00,010 --> 01:15:02,019
the the probability of a fitting

1631
01:15:02,019 --> 01:15:04,850
spread out among the total population of the west coast

1632
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:07,059
and you have an insurance policy

1633
01:15:07,059 --> 01:15:08,679
that's how that works

1634
01:15:08,679 --> 01:15:11,378
right that's how you calculate insurance policy

1635
01:15:11,378 --> 01:15:12,668
well by the way

1636
01:15:12,668 --> 01:15:15,189
i think i saw steve so eager my colleague

1637
01:15:15,189 --> 01:15:16,948
asleep so do we tell our berated

1638
01:15:16,948 --> 01:15:19,859
on all the exhibits here in the row center ten years ago

1639
01:15:19,859 --> 01:15:20,960
and our anniversary

1640
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,340
steve could you remind me who of the famous astronomers of the past

1641
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:27,229
actually invented actuarial tables

1642
01:15:27,229 --> 01:15:29,599
all right sir edmund halley

1643
01:15:29,599 --> 01:15:33,230
invented the acting notion that you can calculate the risk

1644
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:35,089
using actuarial tables

1645
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:37,469
that astronomer

1646
01:15:37,469 --> 01:15:40,409
so it's good to have people who think about the universe where we want to look

1647
01:15:40,409 --> 01:15:41,380
at her

1648
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:42,389
which you go

1649
01:15:42,389 --> 01:15:43,979
with my performance

1650
01:15:43,979 --> 01:15:46,280
she leave

1651
01:15:46,279 --> 01:15:48,618
but useful here

1652
01:15:48,618 --> 01:15:50,438
obviously cannot over here on it

1653
01:15:50,439 --> 01:15:52,119
not only want to look at our

1654
01:15:52,118 --> 01:15:56,899
people look up might also advanced stuff just want you to know

1655
01:15:56,899 --> 01:15:59,149
cell

1656
01:15:59,149 --> 01:16:00,509
the problem is if we

1657
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:04,059
so we don't know the orbit well enough to say whether that's going to go

1658
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:06,538
through the keyhole

1659
01:16:06,538 --> 01:16:10,179
we need better data on its location in space

1660
01:16:10,179 --> 01:16:11,730
so what we really want to do

1661
01:16:11,729 --> 01:16:14,638
and in fact one of the plans of mass is next for ages

1662
01:16:14,639 --> 01:16:16,639
is to visit an asteroid

1663
01:16:16,639 --> 01:16:19,850
why not visit the ash with it has our name on it

1664
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:23,010
who was headed this way

1665
01:16:23,010 --> 01:16:26,650
just call bruce willis you know that's all you have to call you

1666
01:16:26,649 --> 01:16:30,219
put him on your speed dot save brooks

1667
01:16:30,219 --> 01:16:33,788
we did was lost for the world week in the bottom of a thing right now dead

1668
01:16:33,788 --> 01:16:36,009
week seven into space

1669
01:16:36,010 --> 01:16:37,719
is immoral rick driller

1670
01:16:37,719 --> 01:16:40,840
if you remember from

1671
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:43,349
armageddon

1672
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:44,429
about that

1673
01:16:44,429 --> 01:16:48,199
movie was made with the whole of the universe of laws of physics just so you

1674
01:16:48,198 --> 01:16:49,428
know

1675
01:16:49,429 --> 01:16:51,230
not from this universe

1676
01:16:51,229 --> 01:16:55,628
that's why don't really into made that movie

1677
01:16:55,628 --> 01:17:01,639
was where was i before distracted myself

1678
01:17:01,639 --> 01:17:02,970
opposite so here's what you do

1679
01:17:02,970 --> 01:17:04,860
you go to the asteroid

1680
01:17:04,859 --> 01:17:08,308
then you stick low-tech bonnet ok something

1681
01:17:08,309 --> 01:17:09,840
where it is telling us

1682
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:10,949
where it is

1683
01:17:10,948 --> 01:17:15,518
to like one centimeter per second accuracy

1684
01:17:15,519 --> 01:17:18,960
and it's velocity and its location with that accuracy

1685
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:23,250
he put it back into the equation sharpen the orbit you reduce the uncertainty

1686
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:26,849
it you'll know when it'll go through the keyboard act

1687
01:17:26,849 --> 01:17:30,559
if it goes if it's target to go through the keyhole

1688
01:17:30,559 --> 01:17:32,639
all you have to do

1689
01:17:32,639 --> 01:17:35,139
if you're like

1690
01:17:35,139 --> 01:17:38,979
military generals would know you've got like nukes in the silo

1691
01:17:38,979 --> 01:17:42,149
it was sort of out of the scott cook week we got those folks we know who they

1692
01:17:42,149 --> 01:17:43,150
are

1693
01:17:43,149 --> 01:17:46,988
the people wanna blow stuff up problem here in america

1694
01:17:46,988 --> 01:17:50,229
is that we've really good at blowin stuff up

1695
01:17:50,229 --> 01:17:53,348
endless good it no one with the pieces go afterwards

1696
01:17:53,349 --> 01:17:55,630
which is let's call it that alright

1697
01:17:55,630 --> 01:18:00,150
so article about a blow-up office that we have two pieces one headed for new

1698
01:18:00,149 --> 01:18:01,398
york one headed for l_a_

1699
01:18:01,399 --> 01:18:03,650
i don't want to pieces

1700
01:18:03,649 --> 01:18:06,128
good we all know what'll happen when you blow it up

1701
01:18:06,128 --> 01:18:10,048
so dot the kinder gentler solution would be to nudge it

1702
01:18:10,048 --> 01:18:11,819
out of harm's way

1703
01:18:11,819 --> 01:18:13,009
only have to do

1704
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:14,219
is not shit

1705
01:18:14,219 --> 01:18:15,730
so that it misses

1706
01:18:15,729 --> 01:18:17,359
the keyhole

1707
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:20,529
that's only a six hundred mile three hundred mile knowledge

1708
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,559
one way or another

1709
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,599
and if you get a pearly enough

1710
01:18:24,599 --> 01:18:28,179
you've given us i'd ways motion i'm headed towards you

1711
01:18:28,179 --> 01:18:30,010
give me a sideways motion

1712
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:32,360
a few centimetres per second

1713
01:18:32,359 --> 01:18:34,598
that accumulates

1714
01:18:34,599 --> 01:18:37,550
so that after a tough time and i miss you completely

1715
01:18:37,550 --> 01:18:39,000
and this case you just have to miss

1716
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,349
the keyhole

1717
01:18:40,349 --> 01:18:43,889
twenty twenty-nine that's the right amount of time in the future

1718
01:18:43,889 --> 01:18:46,139
most of us will still be alive we hope

1719
01:18:46,139 --> 01:18:50,538
and that's what we cannot just budgets to make this happen so we have two new

1720
01:18:50,538 --> 01:18:52,229
isn't gauged

1721
01:18:52,229 --> 01:18:54,898
international space agencies to do this

1722
01:18:54,899 --> 01:18:57,829
dharma hadn't with there is no organization

1723
01:18:57,829 --> 01:18:59,609
to do this

1724
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:01,150
and who's going to pay for it

1725
01:19:01,149 --> 01:19:02,670
we would certainly pay for that

1726
01:19:02,670 --> 01:19:05,960
but suppose it was headed for the set the indian ocean

1727
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:08,059
does effect america

1728
01:19:08,059 --> 01:19:09,579
would in fact us

1729
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:15,509
so what kind of earth insurance policy does the world's takeout

1730
01:19:15,509 --> 01:19:17,498
how do you worked at

1731
01:19:17,498 --> 01:19:20,108
and we have an apologize astronaut

1732
01:19:20,109 --> 01:19:21,170
rusty schweitzer

1733
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:23,408
with a web page called

1734
01:19:23,408 --> 01:19:26,299
b six twelve

1735
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:27,720
dedicated to studying

1736
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:31,060
not only the says x of asteroid collisions but the politics

1737
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:32,969
of how to alleviate

1738
01:19:32,969 --> 01:19:36,198
p six twelve with i've seen that before

1739
01:19:36,198 --> 01:19:38,939
he six twelve

1740
01:19:38,939 --> 01:19:41,908
that is the name of the asteroid

1741
01:19:41,908 --> 01:19:45,229
at the little prince linda

1742
01:19:45,229 --> 01:19:50,578
haulers in that the cutest thing you've ever and her

1743
01:19:50,578 --> 01:19:54,408
so that's be six twelve so people are thinking about it and even some

1744
01:19:54,408 --> 01:19:56,638
influential people

1745
01:19:56,639 --> 01:19:58,969
we don't mobilize in time

1746
01:19:58,969 --> 01:20:00,510
because we have too many

1747
01:20:00,510 --> 01:20:03,420
lawyers among us and not engineers

1748
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:05,819
but we can always

1749
01:20:05,819 --> 01:20:07,460
get on the case of lawyers reikers

1750
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:10,480
i'm not alone amit lawyers arbitrator here

1751
01:20:10,479 --> 01:20:13,118
owes a lot he has a lot

1752
01:20:13,118 --> 01:20:15,799
but everybody makes fun of lawyers right

1753
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:19,639
effect mike favored lawyer joke was told to me by a lawyer

1754
01:20:19,639 --> 01:20:23,269
that tell you what that was

1755
01:20:23,269 --> 01:20:26,208
it's the ninety-eight percent of all are thick at the other two percent a bad

1756
01:20:26,208 --> 01:20:27,578
name

1757
01:20:27,578 --> 01:20:30,948
i thought that was pretty fun

1758
01:20:30,948 --> 01:20:32,458
lawyer told me that you know

1759
01:20:32,458 --> 01:20:34,248
but

1760
01:20:34,248 --> 01:20:37,208
a pretty good at srebrenica

1761
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:40,889
so here's what happens if you recall mobilizing time

1762
01:20:40,889 --> 01:20:43,699
and it does thread the people

1763
01:20:43,698 --> 01:20:47,859
we still have another seven years the problem is it's headed straight

1764
01:20:47,859 --> 01:20:49,429
earlist now

1765
01:20:49,429 --> 01:20:51,378
now when you have to deflect it

1766
01:20:51,378 --> 01:20:55,708
you've got a deflected by two thousand four thousand miles

1767
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:58,488
but first brady steps up much harder job

1768
01:20:58,488 --> 01:21:01,808
the deflecting it three hundred miles past of the people

1769
01:21:01,809 --> 01:21:03,369
so

1770
01:21:03,368 --> 01:21:07,408
i suggest that massive go ahead and do this just as an exercise

1771
01:21:07,408 --> 01:21:10,518
even though it's only several in a million chance of it in

1772
01:21:10,519 --> 01:21:12,619
i want to know

1773
01:21:12,618 --> 01:21:16,158
that we have the power to deflect asteroids so that we do not suffer the

1774
01:21:16,158 --> 01:21:17,658
same state

1775
01:21:17,658 --> 01:21:21,548
as our reptilian ancestor sixty five million years ago

1776
01:21:21,548 --> 01:21:23,448
who did not have

1777
01:21:23,448 --> 01:21:27,088
engineers among them so that as they're standing there

1778
01:21:27,088 --> 01:21:29,720
dining on power metal ancestors

1779
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:30,869
for export there

1780
01:21:30,869 --> 01:21:32,198
earners

1781
01:21:32,198 --> 01:21:36,328
i'm reminded of the gary larson comic t_ rex is talking to

1782
01:21:36,328 --> 01:21:39,498
some other t_-rex and they just sit there just chillin

1783
01:21:39,498 --> 01:21:40,828
and one says

1784
01:21:40,828 --> 01:21:46,179
now with the time to build an asteroid defense experts

1785
01:21:46,179 --> 01:21:51,248
because i don't want to be the laughing stock of the galaxy

1786
01:21:51,248 --> 01:21:54,949
where others know that we were smart enough to have a space program

1787
01:21:54,949 --> 01:21:59,219
but too dumb to put it into effect anti save us

1788
01:21:59,219 --> 01:22:00,878
uh... extinction

1789
01:22:00,878 --> 01:22:07,878
so thank you all for coming this evening

1790
01:22:14,889 --> 01:22:18,918
i have one encore if i'm a tech hold an encore

1791
01:22:18,918 --> 01:22:20,619
i have it by ever fought

1792
01:22:20,619 --> 01:22:24,180
that i find completely disturbing that i just want you all to have said that you

1793
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:26,710
will lose sleep tonight just as i do

1794
01:22:26,710 --> 01:22:28,618
are you reading this be marked

1795
01:22:28,618 --> 01:22:33,028
are parting thoughts together okay

1796
01:22:33,029 --> 01:22:36,050
humans tend to be

1797
01:22:36,050 --> 01:22:38,109
unjustifiably hubris stick

1798
01:22:38,109 --> 01:22:41,760
about who would what we are in the animal kingdom in in the world

1799
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:44,119
just one example

1800
01:22:44,118 --> 01:22:46,509
we have these books that have

1801
01:22:46,510 --> 01:22:50,000
optical illusions and who doesn't love a good article

1802
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,118
we all love articles

1803
01:22:52,118 --> 01:22:54,298
is simply the better

1804
01:22:54,298 --> 01:22:57,300
why do we call it optical illusions when it really should be called

1805
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:00,668
a book of brain failures

1806
01:23:00,668 --> 01:23:02,998
because that's what it is

1807
01:23:02,998 --> 01:23:08,689
electronics is a diagram i cant figures praying failure

1808
01:23:08,689 --> 01:23:12,299
we don't call it that but that's what it is

1809
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:14,699
okay we think very highly of ourselves

1810
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:16,808
we call ourselves intelligent

1811
01:23:16,809 --> 01:23:18,380
by what measure

1812
01:23:18,380 --> 01:23:22,680
well so weak list things that we do that no other animals can do

1813
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:26,029
so we still we have poetry and philosophy

1814
01:23:26,029 --> 01:23:29,469
web hubbell telescope ridley compose something

1815
01:23:29,469 --> 01:23:31,510
where intelligent

1816
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:33,510
that is our measure alright

1817
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:36,599
well i'd studied this briefly

1818
01:23:36,599 --> 01:23:41,288
and yes well what is the next closest species to human beings

1819
01:23:41,288 --> 01:23:43,559
basically the chip

1820
01:23:43,559 --> 01:23:47,369
and how much d_n_a_ do we have incomes like ninety eight percent

1821
01:23:47,368 --> 01:23:50,198
identical d_n_a_

1822
01:23:50,198 --> 01:23:56,388
but we are prone to say opera water difference that two percent

1823
01:23:56,389 --> 01:24:00,569
all that you can do baby can stack boxes of each of the mana

1824
01:24:00,569 --> 01:24:01,608
maybe

1825
01:24:01,609 --> 01:24:05,150
maybe you can combine a few hand signals

1826
01:24:05,149 --> 01:24:06,859
made the

1827
01:24:06,859 --> 01:24:09,118
but look what we

1828
01:24:09,118 --> 01:24:11,009
so we are convinced

1829
01:24:11,009 --> 01:24:14,828
that whatever is in that two percent is significant

1830
01:24:14,828 --> 01:24:18,569
but i want to pose to you disturbing fault

1831
01:24:18,569 --> 01:24:20,380
maybe the difference

1832
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:23,599
in our cognitive capacities

1833
01:24:23,599 --> 01:24:27,659
the current between hudson shipped we and chips baby that difference

1834
01:24:27,658 --> 01:24:31,998
is as small as that two percent suggests

1835
01:24:31,998 --> 01:24:32,519
maybe

1836
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:37,059
the hubble telescope in our greatest of operas and use it can poetry

1837
01:24:37,059 --> 01:24:40,929
is not much different from stacking boxes in reaching a banana

1838
01:24:40,929 --> 01:24:47,899
is eight tyson how could you send what you could meet what just block

1839
01:24:47,899 --> 01:24:49,819
that's hubris

1840
01:24:49,819 --> 01:24:51,698
because of magic

1841
01:24:51,698 --> 01:24:54,729
in whatever it is this

1842
01:24:54,729 --> 01:24:57,459
cognitive scale

1843
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:00,489
what what what woman the smartest chimps

1844
01:25:00,488 --> 01:25:03,618
the private authors rolling forward

1845
01:25:03,618 --> 01:25:08,208
and they're doing what our problems do is not right a promise to stack boxes a

1846
01:25:08,208 --> 01:25:12,148
promise to put up a number of a toddler is can make sign language

1847
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:13,659
that's left almost

1848
01:25:13,658 --> 01:25:19,098
but those are smart chips studied by the primate experts imagine

1849
01:25:19,099 --> 01:25:21,429
a species

1850
01:25:21,429 --> 01:25:23,920
two-percent beyond us

1851
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,069
in the same scale

1852
01:25:26,069 --> 01:25:29,960
in which we are two percent be on the trip

1853
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:33,578
how smart with baby to us

1854
01:25:33,578 --> 01:25:36,958
all that's just think about that

1855
01:25:36,958 --> 01:25:37,698
different

1856
01:25:37,698 --> 01:25:39,839
smart compared to us as we are

1857
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,038
to chance

1858
01:25:42,038 --> 01:25:45,489
that to them bill do you know difference between stacking boxes

1859
01:25:45,489 --> 01:25:47,399
and the hubble space telescope

1860
01:25:47,399 --> 01:25:53,170
because they be capable of mental feeds far beyond anything we could possibly

1861
01:25:53,170 --> 01:25:55,109
conceit

1862
01:25:55,109 --> 01:25:57,440
day there

1863
01:25:57,439 --> 01:25:59,049
humid telecasts

1864
01:25:59,050 --> 01:26:01,730
would steven stephen hawking forward

1865
01:26:01,729 --> 01:26:03,000
it's safe

1866
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,359
this was slightly smarter than the rest

1867
01:26:05,359 --> 01:26:07,608
'cause he can do

1868
01:26:07,609 --> 01:26:14,609
astrophysics calculations initiative light little junior over here does

1869
01:26:15,619 --> 01:26:18,099
our greatest works of art

1870
01:26:18,099 --> 01:26:21,569
and literature ensign its

1871
01:26:21,569 --> 01:26:22,670
their toddlers

1872
01:26:22,670 --> 01:26:25,930
would it create it could be a kindergarten and would be on the

1873
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:30,800
refrigerator with magnets

1874
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:35,029
almost junior just drive all the quantum mechanics isn't that cute

1875
01:26:35,029 --> 01:26:38,179
dead on the reserve door

1876
01:26:38,179 --> 01:26:44,538
politician twenty of some not all that is so view

1877
01:26:44,538 --> 01:26:47,969
we call ourselves mark

1878
01:26:47,969 --> 01:26:52,060
you don't know if you're smarter not to have another species

1879
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:54,769
blow you out of the water

1880
01:26:54,769 --> 01:26:56,860
at one of about six weeks

1881
01:26:56,859 --> 01:26:59,029
this evening

1882
01:26:59,029 --> 01:27:02,259
because it's a disturbs me i gotta get off my chest

1883
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:04,150
there's a worm in the street

1884
01:27:04,149 --> 01:27:07,948
you walked by it

1885
01:27:07,948 --> 01:27:11,488
does the worm note that you think you're smart

1886
01:27:11,488 --> 01:27:15,368
the world has no concept of your smarts

1887
01:27:15,368 --> 01:27:18,808
could hurt that much smarter than the work

1888
01:27:18,809 --> 01:27:22,519
so a worm has no idea of the celtics martyrs walking by

1889
01:27:22,519 --> 01:27:25,628
which makes me wonder what do we have any concept

1890
01:27:25,628 --> 01:27:27,279
it was super species

1891
01:27:27,279 --> 01:27:29,698
walk bypass

1892
01:27:29,698 --> 01:27:31,960
maybe their own interested in us

1893
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:38,069
because we're too stupid for them to even imagine having a conversation

1894
01:27:38,069 --> 01:27:41,688
you know what i want to chat with the worst thinking that make

1895
01:27:41,689 --> 01:27:45,119
usage is not of plot that you have

1896
01:27:45,118 --> 01:27:47,469
so one of the best pieces of evidence

1897
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:49,869
for why we haven't been visited

1898
01:27:49,868 --> 01:27:54,528
by aliens

1899
01:27:54,529 --> 01:27:56,720
is that they have actually

1900
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:58,480
observed us

1901
01:27:58,479 --> 01:28:05,479
and concluded there is no sign of intelligent life on earth fake you off

1902
01:28:23,328 --> 01:28:25,618
it
