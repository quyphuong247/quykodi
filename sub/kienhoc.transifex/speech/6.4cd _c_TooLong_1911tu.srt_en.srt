MATT MCGARRITY: Having just watched that Neil deGrasse Tyson clip, I want

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,250
to spend a little bit of time analyzing what's going on there and

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,790
what I think is useful to you as an informative speaker.

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,990
So I want to spend our time sort of looking at how he demonstrated a

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,250
thorough understanding of his topic, how from an ethos

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,280
standpoint he does that.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,630
He demonstrates that knowledge.

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,710
But also I want to look at how he conveyed a sense of

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,960
excitement about his topic.

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,350
I think these are good ways of looking at ethos.

11
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:31,500
Surprisingly, they're also the categories on that feedback form, on

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,220
our evaluative rubric for thinking about ethos.

13
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,200
How does a speaker demonstrate a thorough understanding of the topic?

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,320
We're going to take a look.

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,430
How does a speaker convey a sense of excitement or interest in the topic?

16
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,480
We're going to take a look.

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,440
So let's start off with how he's demonstrating an

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,040
understanding of the topic.

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,850
Well, you know, structurally we can look at this and say, well, he's able

20
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,600
to introduce a concept.

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,080
And then he runs it through a number of different clarifying devices.

22
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,320
So I'll talk about a couple of these.

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,209
But once again, it's just he knows the subject matter so well that he has 15

24
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:07,080
different possible ways of explaining an idea.

25
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,840
So he can loop in a bunch of different ones, right?

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,120
You've got multiple ways of accessing that information.

27
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:18,130
So I want to spend time with perhaps the longest one that he talks on,

28
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,240
which is that cannon ball analogy.

29
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,920
It's a very extended analogy.

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,640
So when we look at how he structures his time, he tells this clarifying

31
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,060
analogy of cannon balls and orbits.

32
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,110
And that analogy is good because it's easy to understand

33
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,680
and it's very visual.

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,500
And it's also, I think, an important part that he performs

35
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,640
the analogy, right?

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,810
So he says, and then all you have to do is duck and the cannonball will

37
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,760
pass over you.

38
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,300
So it's a clear analogy and it's interesting to watch.

39
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,080
So he starts off with that analogy.

40
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,230
Then he jumps over to the scientific explanation for why

41
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,750
that analogy is true.

42
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,930
So the analogy is serving a larger goal here.

43
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,150
It's not just a story about shooting a cannon ball around the world.

44
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:04,720
It is in service of explaining this concept of orbit.

45
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,470
So then he explains the concept.

46
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,430
Then he jumps back to the analogy for further elaboration.

47
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:13,950
And then he provides a summary of the orbit principle here, of the

48
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,250
mathematical principle.

49
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,740
Then he extends the analogy to talking about the moon and the apple.

50
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:25,140
So we've gotten a scientific principle told through at least two separate

51
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,950
examples and analogies.

52
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:33,090
And think too, he's sort of bouncing back and forth between the complexity

53
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,990
of the principle and the simplicity of the analogy.

54
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:40,670
But in listening to that, you know he understands the complexity.

55
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:46,340
But he understands the complexity so well that he can explain it simply.

56
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,250
And so he's achieved that sort of sublime state of informative speaking,

57
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:57,630
being able to simplify an idea without making it too simple, without

58
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,260
violating the key idea.

59
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,580
And I think too as part of the performance, his gestures are part of

60
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,160
the illustration of the concept.

61
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,950
You know, it's visually clear.

62
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:12,030
But also in his very active physical performance of that analogy, he's

63
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,390
demonstrating pretty significant interest.

64
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,630
So we also get a sense of his enthusiasm there.

65
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,530
And he's got lots of other times where he's doing this demonstration of

66
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,870
knowledge through multiple examples.

67
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,180
So when he talks about the cup experiment, dropping the cup, that's a

68
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,300
real nice easy explanation of some principles of gravity.

69
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,170
And even a small part where he's talking about Newton and he says he

70
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,160
was a natural philosopher, well, he doesn't let that

71
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,780
jargon stand out there.

72
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,360
Not everybody in that audience knows how they used to define natural

73
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,350
philosophy, so he states what a natural philosopher is.

74
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,760
And then beyond that, he actually explains why that distinction and

75
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,540
terminology existed.

76
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,400
It's a much easier way of understanding natural philosopher.

77
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,440
He doesn't just say, oh, it's what we would today call a scientist and leave

78
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,060
it at that.

79
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,510
He says, it's today what we would call a scientist, but here's why it was

80
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,620
called a natural philosopher at the time.

81
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,390
So there's depth to that explanation.

82
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,880
He understands the topic so well that he can explain that material in

83
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,130
multiple ways.

84
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,529

85
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:21,230
So he's demonstrating that deep knowledge.

86
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,300
We know that he knows the concepts.

87
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,660
But he knows them so well he can explain them

88
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,770
well for us, the audience.

89
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,250
And I think that's a key component of his ethos, not only what he's saying,

90
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,900
but how he's performing it.

91
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,970
He's able to quickly jump into and out of simplifying devices.

92
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,660
So that's how he demonstrates an understanding of knowledge.

93
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,450
Now how about how does he demonstrate his excitement?

94
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,390
Well, that clip is nothing but him demonstrating his excitement on that

95
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,180
subject matter.

96
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,600
So how is he doing this?

97
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,640
I think one thing that's happening there is he has different levels.

98
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,900
We'll talk to this more when we get into the persuasive speech.

99
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,010
We'll strategize about how to plan out different levels.

100
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:05,260
But by different levels, I mean different levels of emotionality.

101
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,670
So he's got a level that's funny, one that's relaxed.

102
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,040
He's got a couple of levels where he's very intense.

103
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,330
But there's all these different levels.

104
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,450
It's not one thing all the time.

105
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,260
So one of the things he does is he's funny.

106
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,700
Remember what I said in the last lecture before the clip, be funny, but

107
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,620
don't tell jokes?

108
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,160
So even early on, he says, it makes the hair stand up on

109
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,050
the back of my neck.

110
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,430
I don't actually have hair on the back of my neck.

111
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,970
But if I did, it would stand up.

112
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,370
That gets a laugh.

113
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,710
I want to be very clear.

114
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:41,270
That line, I don't have hairs on the back of my neck, is not a funny line.

115
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,200
There's no reason people should laugh at that.

116
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,400
It's in his performance.

117
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
It's a funny moment.

118
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,550
But it's not a joke.

119
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,340
No one is standing--

120
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,550
a comedian's not going in standing there, thank

121
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,810
you, ladies and gentlemen.

122
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,400
Tonight I want to thank you for having me here at the Old Chuckle Shack.

123
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,680
It's great to be here.

124
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,840
And I just want to start off by saying, I don't actually have hairs on

125
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,010
the back of my neck.

126
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,625
Whoo!

127
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,200
You know, that's not a joke.

128
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,460
But it's funny, because it shows sort of his level of comfort.

129
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,410
I hope that "whoo" comes through as loud in the mic as I hope it does,

130
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,980
because that should be uncomfortable for all of us.

131
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,270
But so he's playing with the audience.

132
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,000
And think too all the other times where he's got the camera and he's

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,125
talking about dropping the camera, or he's talking about the guy whose head

134
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,500
is in front of the picture.

135
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,880
Those aren't jokes.

136
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,870
But they're funny.

137
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,740
And it sort of demonstrates his excitement or his engagement or

138
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,540
certainly his dynamic nature as a speaker.

139
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,390
So I think in that case you can see people worry about being funny.

140
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,970
Or people worry about telling jokes.

141
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,750
Telling jokes is tough.

142
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:51,360
Being funny, as we see in that case study, is much easier and is rewarded.

143
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,220
So be thinking about how you can just sort of play around with the audience.

144
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,050
Remember a few lectures back I said only plan out about 80% of your

145
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,760
allocated time, 80% to 85%?

146
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,230
If you've got 10 minutes, you should be hitting 8 and 1/2

147
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,400
minutes in your practice.

148
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,640
That gives you this extra time to play around with the audience, to have fun

149
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,750
and be funny.

150
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,300
So he's funny.

151
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,170
What else is he doing that's sort of demonstrating his enthusiasm?

152
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,760
Well, he's got these different levels.

153
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,750
But he's basically breaking his time on that one question

154
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,820
into different chunks.

155
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,930
And so we can sort of map out not each and every one of these,

156
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:28,950
but a couple of these.

157
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,410
So he'll grow in intensity.

158
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,940
And then he'll break and then sort of take a breath, plays around the

159
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,730
audience again.

160
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:39,450
And then we slowly build in terms of intensity again.

161
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,820
So he's not all intense all the time.

162
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,930
That would be exhausting.

163
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,820
But rather, he's got these different levels.

164
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,480
And we understand his intensity through its contrast, right?

165
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,010
We understand his intensity through the more relaxed moments, through the

166
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,200
funnier moments.

167
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,510
And I think it's instructive when he grows intense.

168
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:06,110
So he's intense usually when he's explaining a core concept and one

169
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,840
which he feels particularly excited about.

170
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,020
Now, he's light--

171
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,600
he's not nearly as intense when he's moving between topics or when he's

172
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,790
introducing a topic.

173
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:19,760
But the different modes play a different function here.

174
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,630
So probably by design he's not light or funny when he's explaining the

175
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,390
scientific principle.

176
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,270
That's when he grows intense.

177
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:33,049
That also performs a certain dedication to that subject matter.

178
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:35,860
And I think his discussion of weightlessness is a good

179
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,860
illustration of this.

180
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,190
So he starts off with that elevator analogy.

181
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,980
And then he starts talking about that cup experiment.

182
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,080
You know, here's what you would do.

183
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,430
He makes a joke--

184
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,800
again, a joke--

185
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,680
about buying an expensive cup at Starbucks.

186
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,190
Hilarious and original.

187
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,690
But it's funny.

188
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,340
So he talks about poking holes in it.

189
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,030
And then when he's talking about it dropping and why the water would stop

190
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:01,770
coming out the sides, he grows very intense.

191
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,280
He's getting into that.

192
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,380
That part's not funny.

193
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,440
It's exciting.

194
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,340
It's intellectually thrilling.

195
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:14,730
So he performs for that audience how cool that idea is.

196
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:21,520
So he grows in intensity, gets really excited, and then walks it back, as

197
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,060
I'm trying to walk back my intensity of my discussion of him.

198
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,910
So there are different levels in this.

199
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:33,340
He's performing his understanding, because he's explaining these ideas in

200
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,270
multiple ways.

201
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:39,430
He's performing his excitement in the subject matter strategically by

202
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,110
growing intense, but also by being funny.

203
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,390
So how can you do this?

204
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:48,620
Well, like he did, maybe not in the exact same manner.

205
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:54,240
But don't be afraid to show how exciting an idea is for yourself.

206
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,020
Be able to perform that.

207
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,510
As I said last time, use a vocabulary that reinforces the point, how

208
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,310
astonishing you find something.

209
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,050
And above all, search for models.

210
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,550
I chose Tyson because I like him as a model.

211
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,630
I think he does so much well.

212
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:15,370
And he's very popular, so I seem to be standing in the common opinion by

213
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:21,660
saying that he's a good speaker and a good explainer of scientific concepts.

214
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,400
But find models that work for you, because the neat thing is everything

215
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,630
that a great speaker is doing in that speech is on display.

216
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,420
That's the nature of speaking.

217
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,550
So if you study that model closely, they're crackable.

218
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,960
Find the speaker that you find exciting and you would love to be able

219
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,880
to speak like.

220
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,610
Study that model closely.

221
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,520
Crack open their delivery, their ethos, and see what's going on.

222
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,180
See what you can take from that.

223
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,410
So now that we've finished our discussion of ethos, I want to move

224
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,400
into the final component for the discussion of the informative speech

225
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,110
and just spend a little bit more time speaking about delivery in more

226
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,360
precise terms.

227
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,080
