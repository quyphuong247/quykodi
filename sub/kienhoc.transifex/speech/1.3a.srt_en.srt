MATT MCGARRITY: The speech teacher James Winans famously said, "A speech is not

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,580
an essay on its hind legs." And that's very true.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,740
And we've already somewhat covered this.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,270
But by now it should be evident that speaking and writing are different.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,700
At a very deep level, they are different.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,900
So writing is a visual event, or tactile in the case of braille.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,120
You see the writing.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,360
That's how you're perceiving it.

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,640
That's how your brain is receiving the information.

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,770
It's visual.

11
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,430
Now in speaking, it's an oral-aural event.

12
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,640
It It comes out here, goes in here.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,020
And so we're dealing with mouths and ears, not eyes, in speech.

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,540
And so in this lecture, I kind of want to just talk at a very broad level

15
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,420
about some of the differences between speaking and writing.

16
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,880
So to begin with, fundamentally, speaking is acquired.

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,710
Writing is learned.

18
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,690
You did not emerge from the womb with the ability to write.

19
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,410
You didn't come out of the womb, pen in hand.

20
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,000
Childbirth would be even worse if this were the case.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,110
But we as human beings have the ability to speak.

22
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,360
I've got kids.

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,480
And right now my oldest, he's writing.

24
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,060
We're working on helping him craft his letters.

25
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,970
We have to teach them how to write.

26
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,020
We did not teach him how to speak.

27
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:24,830
Now we may model it.

28
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:25,800
We may correct it.

29
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,780
But as a human being, he is going to speak.

30
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,060
As a bird is going to fly, that child is going to speak, apart from some

31
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,150
extreme cases of some biological problems.

32
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,040
But he is going to speak.

33
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,450
He's got the capacity for speech.

34
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,170
And we see this.

35
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,840
You can look at linguists like Steven Pinker and The Language Instinct.

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,490
They talk about how over years of evolution we have developed language.

37
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,390
It is biological.

38
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,530
We are going to communicate.

39
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,930
And spoken language is one of the chief ways that

40
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,640
we're going to do that.

41
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,550
And that explains illiteracy.

42
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,700
Writing has to be learned.

43
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,150
There are lots of places where people just don't--

44
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,170
they haven't gotten that yet.

45
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,490
They don't know writing.

46
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:12,690
But we don't have that sort of widespread lack of speech ability.

47
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,750
It is what we are as humans.

48
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,670
Birds fly.

49
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,920
Humans speak.

50
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,300


51
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,010
So writing is learned.

52
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,470
Writing emerged later.

53
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,870
Writing is a human invention.

54
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,870
There was a time before writing.

55
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,610
There might well be a time after writing.

56
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,420
Some would argue online education is hastening that.

57
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,650
So kudos to us for bringing about oblivion.

58
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,660
But we know writing systems first emerged in Sumer probably

59
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,530
about 6,000 years ago.

60
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,230
But this writing thing is a creation.

61
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,740
It's not something that was biologically guaranteed.

62
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,820
As a consequence of this, writing is not ubiquitous.

63
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,760
So there are probably about 7,000 languages in existence today.

64
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,635
Over half of those 7,000 languages are unwritten.

65
00:03:04,635 --> 00:03:09,530
And there are all sorts of writing systems that have no way of engaging

66
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,050
in writing.

67
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,050
There's all sorts of communication and language systems that have no writing.

68
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,710
So these are deep issues.

69
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,960
And some of these historical changes are taken up in the seminal work by

70
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,250
Walter Ong in his Orality in Literacy.

71
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,340
And what he looks at-- and it's really interesting--

72
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,520
is how cultures change as they move from primarily oral to sort of a mixed

73
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,250
oral and written mode of communication.

74
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,850
Now Ong, as a thinker, was influenced by the famous media critic Marshall

75
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,350
McLuhan who famously said, the medium is the message.

76
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,450
Very true.

77
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:46,510
When we stand up to present in front of an audience, the medium is speech.

78
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,090
The medium is speech.

79
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,830
And that is a fundamental important thing to understand when it comes to

80
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,530
preparing speeches and delivering speeches.

81
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,180
A speech is not an essay on its hind legs.

82
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,830
It's not merely reading at the audience.

83
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,620
So in the next lecture, we're going to do an experiment to see how these

84
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:11,880
differences in media manifest, how we can hear writing when performed

85
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,449
orally, and how we hear orality as it exists when spoken naturally.

86
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:17,966
