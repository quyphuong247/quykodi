00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,180
MATT MCGARRITY: I want to spend a little bit of time talking about

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,980
evidence for your persuasive case.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,150
A lot of what we discussed in terms of evidence for the informative speech

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,920
holds entirely true here, thinking about how you're using evidence to

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,160
illustrate an idea, elaborating on that evidence well.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,990
Because again, you're making claims.

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,000
And so your evidence should drive those claims.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,620
But I want to spend a little bit of time talking about evidence, because

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,610
in this speech you're trying to blend that evidence with style.

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,190
And that can be tricky at times.

11
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,030
So I just have a few suggestions about how you might think in terms of

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,570
incorporating evidence with your style.

13
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,110
Above all, your evidence should support your argument

14
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,600
but not replace it.

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,040
Remember that we should remember your points, your claims, and that they

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,610
were convincing, not necessarily the evidence.

17
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,960
You want us to remember your claims and that they were convincing.

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,450
So as with any other speech, you're using evidence to convince that

19
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,520
audience, to motivate that audience.

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,360
Now structurally, in the persuasive speech, we can think about evidence

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,900
doing at least--

22
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,790
it's probably doing more, but we can think about it doing at least three

23
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,480
things, illustrating a point, setting up a point, or simply being the point.

24
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,480
So let's look at how you might use evidence as a way of

25
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,360
illustrating a point.

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,490
So this is from a speech arguing for increased taxpayer support of state

27
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,010
parks here in Washington.

28
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,480
So as you can see, it says, state parks are quintessential to

29
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,520
Washingtonians.

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,810
They are our playgrounds, backyards, oases.

31
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,750
We have never not had them around, so we are ignorant to what life would be

32
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,110
like without them.

33
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,920
Every year our state parks serve over 40 million people.

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,550
These people are our neighbors, these people are you and

35
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,830
these people are me.

36
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:49,000
we could easily lose all the access to our adored and admirable state parks.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,600
I tinkered around with that a little bit.

38
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,620
Nevertheless, what you're seeing here is the evidence there is just

39
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,940
illustrating that point.

40
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,470
So you're saying these are important to a lot of people.

41
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,400
And the way it's written into that paragraph is at the core of it.

42
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,110
It says it's important to a lot of people.

43
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,210
And then it says how many people actually use the park.

44
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,780
So I'd say that's sort of illustrating that larger idea.

45
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,400
We can also look at how maybe evidence could set up a point.

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,310
The evidence is sort of priming us for the argument that's going to be made.

47
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:24,130
So this is from a separate speech on education funding.

48
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:28,740
The Office of Student Finances says that over 50% of our students depend

49
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,880
on financial aid just to be able to afford tuition as it stands now.

50
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,010
By increasing everyone's tuition, we will make attending this university

51
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,820
harder for all and impossible for some.

52
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,810
By increasing everyone's tuition, we will make it expensive for both

53
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,780
nonresident and resident students alike.

54
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,230
Effectively, we will be putting an unrealistic price tag on a UW

55
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,410
education and the future that it promises.

56
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,150
So the evidence there is--

57
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,020
I mean, we're doing a lot of extra work in the rest of that point.

58
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,100
So that evidence is just setting up what that point is going to be.

59
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,610
OK?

60
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,250
So I'm just sort of walking into that paragraph by being able to throw out

61
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:13,290
how many people are using financial aid as a way of saying we've got half

62
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,790
of them using financial aid now.

63
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,550
We don't really want to increase much further, because there's a chance

64
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:22,690
we're going to block some people out of the opportunity for a UW education.

65
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:28,270
Then, certainly you can use evidence stylistically, as sort of quick

66
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:32,270
succession, machine-gun-type use of evidence.

67
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,850
And I think we can see that here.

68
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,650
Again, this is educational funding.

69
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:44,560
Actually, this is on the U-PASS, which for us is a bus pass that comes with

70
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,280
your student pass.

71
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,440
It's built into the cost of attending.

72
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,520
As UW transit money decreases, your costs increase.

73
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,810
As of 2010, the University of Washington Transportation Services

74
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:01,270
stated a budget shortfall on the order of $5 million, $5 million.

75
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,110
Cost per student doubled.

76
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,160
What cost $49 two years ago is now $99.

77
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,130
The budget continues to leak, so you can probably expect

78
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,940
your costs to rise.

79
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,390
So again, that's from a speech, a student's speech.

80
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,720
But here, you've got all that evidence jammed together.

81
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,620
Now normally, we wouldn't want too much evidence jammed together without

82
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,530
being able to unpack it, explain it a little bit more.

83
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,860
But here, that evidence is functioning stylistically, quite frankly.

84
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,950
It's being able to jam that evidence real quickly together so hearing it

85
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,670
all at once has an impact on the listener.

86
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,700
Being able to hear it at that point has an impact.

87
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,130
So it's functioning more stylistically.

88
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:46,080
And I will say that uniting style and evidence can be challenging, because

89
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,220
the evidence needs to be there in order to help the argument.

90
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,680
But it shouldn't get in the way of the style.

91
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,640
And so as we're using it, you want to be thinking about what

92
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,090
evidence do I need?

93
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,910
Once again, we're turning back to that target audience.

94
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,600
What does that audience need to hear?

95
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,910
What evidence needs to be there in order to motivate them to

96
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,530
take certain actions?

97
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,060
So now having done that, we're going to turn to the final section for this

98
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,230
week, which is on fallacies and avoiding fallacies.

99
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,480
