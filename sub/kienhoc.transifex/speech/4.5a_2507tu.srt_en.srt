MATT MCGARRITY: The last thing I want to do this week as part of this sort

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:08,350
of big picturing of informative speaking, developing your informative

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,730
speech for this class, is to think through goals--

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,580
informative speech goals.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,820
So I like starting this type of talk with a quotation.

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,500
This is from Baltasar Gracian.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,890
He was a medieval rhetorician.

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,950
And he wrote, "A speech is like a feast, at which the dishes are made to

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:30,030
please the guests, and not the cooks." OK, because that gets down to what the

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,130
speech is and what it's for, it's for the audience.

11
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,700
You're doing it, but you're doing a speech for that audience.

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,600
So what I want to do in this video is just talk a little bit about writing

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,230
speech goals, talk about how you would evaluate those speech goals, and then

14
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:53,600
finally, using these goals as part of your speech preparation process.

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,690
So to begin with, speech goals are there to help you think

16
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,050
through that speech.

17
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,770
What you want to get out of it.

18
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,610
So as speakers, we want audience effect, OK?

19
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:09,010
We want our audience to get something out of that presentation.

20
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,710
So in that sense, a speech isn't about what you want to say.

21
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,970
It's about what the audience needs to understand.

22
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,400
And that sounds like such a minor distinction, but it's fairly

23
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,460
significant.

24
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,790
And it comes down to your presentation is about what that audience is getting

25
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,650
from it, what that audience is taking away from it.

26
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,190
Speech goals help you to avoid rattling on.

27
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:36,360
Your job is to convey information in a way that the audience can understand.

28
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,930
But I would distinguish these sort of audience-center goals from content

29
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,930
goals, being audience-centered versus being content-centered.

30
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,330
Audience-centered, my concern is with, what does an audience need to hear?

31
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,320
What do they need to know.

32
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,900
What do they need to understand?

33
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,090
And how can I give them that in a way that's true to me as a speaker, and

34
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:56,990
true to the content?

35
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,430
OK, that's a puzzle, as opposed to being simply content-focused, which is

36
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,450
merely being wrapped up in one's own head.

37
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,970
Here's what I know about this one topic, and I'm going to deliver it.

38
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:07,870
Let me give you a story here.

39
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,770
So I had a friend who went to Princeton Seminary, and he would tell

40
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,930
this story.

41
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,680
And as a student, he would go into this big lecture hall.

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,000
And there was a teacher there who taught there for 1,000 years.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,490
And for each lecture, the teacher would come in with this book that he

44
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,680
had written-- wham--

45
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,180
hit it on the lecture, open up the book to the chapter that was assigned

46
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,740
for that day, and begin reading.

47
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,950
Read, read, read, read, read, read.

48
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,500
Bell would sound, book would close, class dismissed.

49
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,140
That sounds awful.

50
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,360
And of course, that's about the content.

51
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,440
It was, this day I shall say these things.

52
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,190
There was no concern with audience there whatsoever.

53
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,050
People could fall asleep, and you know they were falling asleep.

54
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,820
They could get up and leave, they could be-- now in this era, they could

55
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,410
be texting, they could do anything, and the speaker would

56
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,850
continue to read on.

57
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,730
That's not what you want.

58
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,220
That's simply focusing the book, your notes--

59
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,590
they're not the audience, right?

60
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,740
They're not the ones who're going to be clapping at the end.

61
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,490
You want to make sure that it's about conveying that content to that

62
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:18,150
audience, meeting that audience halfway, working with them so that

63
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,660
you're giving that audience something, and they're getting

64
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,190
something out of your talk.

65
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,290
You're conveying information, they're receiving information.

66
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,900
But you want to be audience-centered, not merely focused on your content.

67
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,580
One of the big problems that we have in informative speaking, and speaking

68
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,410
in general, is people too focused on their content.

69
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,120
They're like, I know what I'm going to say, and they haven't thought about

70
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,500
what that audience needs to be getting out of it.

71
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,410
So this is the realm of speech goals.

72
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,190
So the best way to get at this is to ask of yourself, what do you want the

73
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:49,190
audience to do, or to be able to do, after listening to your speech?

74
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,550
So this would be an example--

75
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,800
so it's not, if you were in sales, I want to sell this

76
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,120
product to my audience.

77
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,160
That's not the goal.

78
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,940
The other way of thinking of that is, I want my

79
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,570
audience to buy this product.

80
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,840
Not that I want to sell it to them.

81
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,660
That's every cartoon of a used car salesman ever, right?

82
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,530
What does it take to put you in this car today?

83
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,030
That's just trying to sell it, and it comes across as cheesy and inflexible.

84
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,630
If you're having dinner and you've got a telemarketer, they're reading the

85
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,430
same script.

86
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,050
It's just about pushing that content out.

87
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,730
And that's why it's sometimes so very frustrating to deal with that.

88
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,710
So your goal, in that scenario, isn't to sell the product.

89
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,760
It's to get the audience to buy the product.

90
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,850
All of a sudden, you've got to think about, well, why isn't the audience

91
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,040
buying it right now?

92
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,790
How can I address their concerns?

93
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,210
What do I need to do to overcome that challenge to allow them to buy the

94
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,160
product, or to encourage them to buy the product?

95
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:53,350
If you were doing a seventh grade class presentation on photosynthesis,

96
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,160
it's not, I want to talk about photosynthesis.

97
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,300
Depending on your level of expertise, you could talk about a thousand

98
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,570
different things relating to photosynthesis, and 999 of them might

99
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,080
be totally irrelevant to what the audience needs to be here.

100
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,830
So it's not, I want to talk about photosynthesis, it's, I want my

101
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,900
audience to list the steps in photosynthesis.

102
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,770
That's a goal.

103
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,580
That's thinking about what that audience should be able to do at the

104
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,920
end of that presentation.

105
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,310
That gives you a lot to work with, being able to think very specifically

106
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,120
about what you want them to be able to do with that information.

107
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,890
So what are some of the characteristics of these?

108
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,330
Well, generally, speech goals are audience-focused.

109
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,590
That's a loud sound.

110
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,930
That is a deep, boring into the wall next door.

111
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,130
My goal, at this point in time, is to not become too distracted by what

112
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,800
sounds like someone tunneling into a bank.

113
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,600
So speech goals are audience-focused.

114
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,820
That means you're thinking about what you want the audience

115
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,850
to take out of it.

116
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,970
Speech goals are concrete.

117
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,990
OK, so you're thinking of very tangible ways about what this audience

118
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,990
is going to do.

119
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,850
And generally, as you're drafting them, it's a good way to think of

120
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,225
speech goals as using active verbs, and I'll show you an example of this

121
00:06:02,225 --> 00:06:03,200
here in a moment.

122
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,490
Now, if you're in teaching, if you're in education, you might recognize

123
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,250
speech goals as kind of similar to some of the writing and talk around

124
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,040
learning goals.

125
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,740
What do you want your students to be able to do?

126
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,290
Kind of like, what do you want your audience to be able to do?

127
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:20,730
And in fact, in many cases, teaching is speaking for very specific

128
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:21,410
audience, right?

129
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,600
You're speaking for that classroom audience.

130
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,120
So let me give you an example of some very vague speech goals.

131
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,520
So let's say I'm doing a presentation on the history of American

132
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,790
presidential debate.

133
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,380
So these are vague speech goals.

134
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,730
After listening to my speech, the audience should know the history of

135
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,240
American presidential debate, think about some criteria for evaluating

136
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,820
debates, be familiar with some of the critiques of the debate format, and

137
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,040
have a new perspective on presidential debates.

138
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,090
So as goals, it's better to have these than none, but these are pretty vague.

139
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,630
I mean, if you look at that first one--

140
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,350
know the history of American presidential debate-- that's massive.

141
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:03,870
How can I check to see if the audience is able to know the entire history?

142
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,850
That so that's very broad.

143
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,470
Think about some criteria for evaluating debates.

144
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,710
I don't know if they're thinking or not.

145
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,820
So I mean, these are kind of very broadly pitched.

146
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,020
Now I could take the same talk, and refine them with more precise goals.

147
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,490
And after listening to my speech, the audience should be able to list some

148
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,770
of the key points in the development of American presidential debates.

149
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,900
OK, so there, I've got something more specific.

150
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,130
I want them to list some key points.

151
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,230
So now, I don't have to talk about the entire history of it.

152
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:36,140
I can mention some of the things, but my focus is on a couple of key points.

153
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,430
And if I'm thinking in terms of time limits, I'm limiting how many key

154
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,500
points I can discuss.

155
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,830
So if I want my audience to be able to list those key points,

156
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,550
that's pretty specific.

157
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:49,200
Let's say I want the audience to be able to explain to of the major

158
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,660
critiques of the modern American presidential format.

159
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,500
I can do that in probably about 10 minutes--

160
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,580
10 to 15 minutes.

161
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,690
I can have them list a couple of key points in the history, and I can have

162
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:02,030
them explain two major critiques of the format.

163
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,080
Those are things I can accomplish in 5 to 10 minutes, and that gives me a

164
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,000
narrower way of planning that speech, of figuring out what I need to do in

165
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,020
the time I have with that audience.

166
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,760
As a performative element, these goals are useful because they give you a

167
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,320
sense of purpose.

168
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,050
Remember in the impromptu, we talked about, well, I don't know what I'm

169
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,450
doing in each main point, but I want to achieve certain things.

170
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,590
I want to make sure that the audience understands what the claim is, or

171
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,290
understands how the example relates to the claim.

172
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,460
That's kind of what we're doing with more detail here in

173
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,344
the informative speech.

174
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:36,669
If I want them to explain two of the major critiques of the presidential

175
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:39,140
format, that's going to shape how I talk to each one.

176
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,299
I'm going to say, here's what the critique is, here's why it emerged,

177
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:46,770
here's what you need to know about, with the whole idea that, at the end

178
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,400
of that, somebody could explain it.

179
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,960
If my goal was they should just be aware of some of the critiques, that

180
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,720
would change how I go through that section.

181
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,360
All right, if I just want them to be aware of it, or that there are

182
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,130
critiques, then that's a much different section than if I'm saying,

183
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,680
I want you to be able to list and explain two of the biggest critiques

184
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,380
of the presidential debate format.

185
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,990
So they give me a sense of purpose in that section.

186
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,480
On the planning side, they give you criteria.

187
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,170
So if you're running long, or you're trying to figure out what to cut from

188
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:22,230
that presentation, those goals are criteria for inclusion/exclusion.

189
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:26,290
If I say that I want them to explain two, because I think these two are

190
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:31,420
particularly important given the topic, then I got to make sure I've

191
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,570
got time for both them.

192
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,620
If I don't have time for both of them, I got to decide, do I just want them

193
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,070
to know one of the major critiques?

194
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,270
Or, do I just want them to be aware of three of the critiques?

195
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:44,420
So these goals, if you've sort of figured out what they are, and they're

196
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,740
appropriate to that audience in that setting, they give view criteria for

197
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,760
making editing decisions, making revision decisions.

198
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,100
And so, after you've run it a few times-- once again, that process of

199
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:00,150
running, revising, and running, reflecting, and revising--

200
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,590
after you've done that a few times, you can reflect on those goals, and

201
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,760
change and adapt them as need be.

202
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,400
Are you achieving your goals?

203
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,930
If you're not, do you need to change the content, or do you need

204
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:09,980
to change the goals?

205
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,960
So these goals give you a way of thinking strategically

206
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,730
through your speech.

207
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,730
What does that audience need to hear and understand?

208
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,180
So as you are now pulling these all together, and you're looking at the

209
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,450
goals, and you're thinking about your time, your topic, and your audience,

210
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,970
be realistic.

211
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,580
Concrete goals can really help you understand your time constraints.

212
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,710
In 10 minutes, can you truly accomplish--

213
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,710
without racing--

214
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:39,060
can you truly accomplish everything that you want to accomplish?

215
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,410
Be realistic.

216
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,640
It's going to be easier to develop that speech.

217
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,130
Either extend your time, if possible, or cut your goals to

218
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,220
fit with your time.

219
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,690
So goals are a good way of sort of mapping out the big

220
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,280
themes of the speech.

221
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,940
So I'm working up this one on kairos.

222
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,900
So I like kairos.

223
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,030
I think it's a good response to this particular audience.

224
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,100
It's within my expertise, as a rhetorician--

225
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,760
kairos is a rhetorical term, which you'll find out more about later.

226
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,210
Kairos is a rhetorical term.

227
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,840
It's within my area of expertise.

228
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,980
It's probably of interest to this particular online audience.

229
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,790
And I can talk about it within 5 to 10 minutes, so I think that hits those

230
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,220
rhetorical constraints.

231
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,660
Now as I'm thinking more tangibly about how I'm going to do that in 10

232
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,370
minutes, I start this process of mapping out goals.

233
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,220
I might come back and revise these, but these are a good way of sort of

234
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,920
starting the planning process.

235
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,600
So at the end of my 10-minute presentation, I would love it if

236
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,800
viewers of that speech were able to define kairos.

237
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,920
OK, so that's probably going to be a key chunk.

238
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,370
I would like them to be able to distinguish between timing and

239
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,790
fittingness.

240
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,780
So those are two major components of this concept of kairos.

241
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,330
I would love it if that audience was able to provide a concrete example of

242
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,860
kairos, or explain this Ronald Reagan clip that I often talk

243
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,490
about in terms of kairos.

244
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,560
So those are four pretty concrete goals.

245
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,540
They at least help me start to pull together that first

246
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,130
draft of the speech.

247
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,910
And these are totally open to change, right, as part of

248
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,100
the revision process.

249
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,390
I don't want to get locked into this stuff if it's not going to work.

250
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:22,130
But this at least allows me to start thinking more concretely about what I

251
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:26,320
want to achieve in the time I have for the audience that I have before me.

252
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,500
So what I want you to do now is just very quickly draft up a few speech

253
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,430
goals for a speech you're working on.

254
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:38,090
Now ideally, this would be a speech that you would be working on for this

255
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,560
class, an informative speech.

256
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,610
But even if not, if you've got a presentation that you got to give next

257
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,820
week, think through-- what are your goals for that speech?

258
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,620
What do you really hope--

259
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,260
and realistically hope--

260
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,010
that your audience will be able to do at the end of that speech?

261
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,290
So go ahead, and do that now.

262
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,540
