MATT MCGARRITY: Let's spend a little bit of time now

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,100
thinking about next steps.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,790
How you can continue refining your skills as a speaker, now at the end of

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,910
this introductory, 10 week course?

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,710
In The Rhetorical Treatise--

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,400
Brutus, the famous orator Cicero argues that daily rhetorical exercises

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,830
are needed to retain and strengthen eloquence.

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,600
And in fact, he tells this cautionary tale of Hortensius who lost his edge.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,850
Hortensius was this great, great, grand speaker who lost his edge after

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,400
abandoning his daily exercises.

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,780
So speech skills are not content that you can just file away in your mental

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,220
file cabinet and pull out later when you need it.

13
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,000
You should be thinking of them more as athletic skills.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,400
Skills that need to continue to be refined if they're

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,210
not going to atrophy.

16
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,180
You also think about this in terms of other sort of language skills or

17
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:50,860
mental skills.

18
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,790
So language skills would be an example.

19
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,640
So when I was in college in addition to majoring in Communication, I

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,720
majored in Russian.

21
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,320
So I studied Russian language and Russian literature.

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,670
I studied abroad in Russia.

23
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,370
I went to school in Saint Petersburg and Moscow.

24
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:08,180
When I returned from Russia, I even had a few small jobs working as a

25
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:08,900
translator.

26
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,470
So I knew Russian.

27
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,530
Then, I went to graduate school and I stopped working in Russian.

28
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,600
I stopped practicing my Russian, and it atrophied.

29
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,440
It's gone.

30
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,310
It's at the point of non use.

31
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,450
Certainly, if I spent a couple of months to a year refining and

32
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,500
practicing my Russian, I could get it back up to--

33
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,020
you know--

34
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,090
not a bad level.

35
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,940
But it will never be to the level that it was 15 years ago.

36
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,560
It just-- that's gone to me because I didn't continue to

37
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,580
practice that skill.

38
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,300
I didn't continue to think in that way and work on my Russian.

39
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,280
So you don't want that to happen with your speaking skills.

40
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,130
You want to make sure that you continue to sharpen these tools that

41
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,510
you've developed over these 10 weeks, and from other sources as well.

42
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,010
So what are some ways to do this?

43
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,450
Well, first off, find someone to work with.

44
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,920
Find a practice partner.

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,220
This can work particularly well if you're in an office and you have to

46
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,420
give presentations.

47
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,300
And you just find somebody who you can show drafts to, bounce ideas off of.

48
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,259
If they see your presentation, they give you feedback, and vice versa.

49
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:13,160
So finding people to work with and practice with is key.

50
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,140
You need eyes outside of your own body.

51
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,480
You need someone to watch and listen to your speeches and give you

52
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,500
constructive feedback.

53
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,880
You can also explore Toast Masters.

54
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,470
So if you go to toastmasters.org--

55
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,180
Toast Masters is a nonprofit entity.

56
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,890
And it's really organized the around providing opportunities for people to

57
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,400
speak, providing audiences and some speech instruction.

58
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,550
They've got clubs in all cities across the United States

59
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,440
and in over 100 countries.

60
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,030
So if you go to toastmasters.org, and you--

61
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,360
I think they've got a button for Find a Chapter.

62
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,720
You can find a nearby chapter.

63
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,770
Now, these are organized by chapter.

64
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,820
And so you might want to shop around a little bit to make sure that you've

65
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,860
got a chapter that works for you and allows you to develop the skills that

66
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,760
you want to work on.

67
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,050
I've had students who had great success with Toast Masters chapters,

68
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:09,070
and others who had to shop around a lot more before they found one that

69
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,530
really satisfied their needs.

70
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,990
So those are some things.

71
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,590
Other practices that you can be doing.

72
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,360
Well, I've mentioned it a couple of times.

73
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,980
Read poetry aloud.

74
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,730
Read famous speeches aloud.

75
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:26,420
It's a great way of exposing yourself to models of imitation and being able

76
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,050
to get into a text without having to worry about creating

77
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,400
its content, right?

78
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,220
You can just find emotion and tone and delivery and pitch and even work

79
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,850
memory if you're working with established manuscripts.

80
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:44,550
So find a speaker or find a poet that you particularly like, and read their

81
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,050
stuff aloud.

82
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,040
Now, those are some things.

83
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,100
We can also look back to history to find lots of really good exercises for

84
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,510
refining your public speaking skills.

85
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,400
So for hundreds of years, students of rhetoric refined their speaking

86
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,740
abilities through what were called progymnasmata, preliminary exercises.

87
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,410
These were exercises of increasing complexity.

88
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,510
So kind of like how we move from impromptu to informative to persuasive

89
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,370
in terms of increasing complexity, the progymnasmata did the same thing.

90
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,490
And many of these are still very useful.

91
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,209
So the progymnasmata sequence began with fables.

92
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:24,250
So you would tell a well-known fable and either expand it to great lengths

93
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,490
or reduce it down for brevity.

94
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,420
And basically, what you're doing is telling a story and ending it with

95
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,990
some type of moral, a conclusion.

96
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:36,220
And the idea of these-- the pedagogical force driving something

97
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,550
like fable or many of the progymnasmata--

98
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,640
is to take content off the table to allow you to work on elaboration and

99
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,280
delivery and other speech skills.

100
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,570
And so here at the University of Washington, the introductory speech

101
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:55,730
students do here is basically this initial progymnasmata.

102
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,910
I'm not having them tell a fable, I have them tell a personal anecdote.

103
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,140
So they tell a personal anecdote about themselves and they

104
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,260
end it with a lesson.

105
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:07,430
The idea being since they know that content well, they don't have to worry

106
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,580
about relearning its invention or arrangement.

107
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,050
and they can focus on style and delivery.

108
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:13,980
So you can do that.

109
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,940
Or certainly, if you've ever told bedtime stories to a child, you're

110
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,560
involved in practicing these fables.

111
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,560
So take value in these opportunities.

112
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,990
When my son was much younger, I'd made up a story about dragons--

113
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,550
different color dragons in different parts of a made up world.

114
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,770
It started out as a five minute story, and he kept wanting more and more

115
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,330
iterations.

116
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,430
What a great speaking opportunity for me.

117
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,455
Because he wouldn't forget anything, so it ended at a 45 minute story that

118
00:05:38,455 --> 00:05:39,460
he wanted every night.

119
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,730
And it was terrible.

120
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,680
Sorry, Miles, if you ever watch this.

121
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,720
That was horrible--

122
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,510
having to remember.

123
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,920
He had a huge memory.

124
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,870
So he knew if I put the blue dragon not the water, but in the forest.

125
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,500
That was wrong.

126
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,680
He remembered it all.

127
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,950
But nevertheless, you are telling stuff again and again and being able

128
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:59,970
to play with the language and dynamic interchange of the ideas.

129
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,810
So beyond fable, there was a crea or a proverb.

130
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,250
And many of these were similar to our model for the impromptu.

131
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,510
And in fact, there's another way to practice impromptu that you might

132
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:14,190
continue to use as a way of refining your speaking ability.

133
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,560
[COUGHS]

134
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:15,940
Oh boy.

135
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,310
[CLEARS THROAT]

136
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,595
So what's this other model of impromptu?

137
00:06:19,595 --> 00:06:24,130
Well, in competitive speech, they don't do what we do which is start

138
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:27,110
with thesis statements, more often than not.

139
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,730
I started with thesis statements because what we were doing the

140
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,480
argument and evidence, that was easiest.

141
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,600
And I want you to be getting in that argumentative mindset.

142
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,870
Now, another way of doing this-- and actually, very similar to the

143
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,120
progymnasmata--

144
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,310
is to start with quotations.

145
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,050
So you get a quotation.

146
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,170
You interpret that quotation, which becomes your thesis.

147
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,740
And then, you run basically the same impromptu, but maybe your examples are

148
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,300
going to be literature or philosophy.

149
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:58,120
So you could get a quotation like Victor Hugo's "He who opens a school

150
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,080
door closes a prison." OK, well what does this mean?

151
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,730
It means education is an unprecedented--

152
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,045
education is a force for good.

153
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:10,740
Well, why is this?

154
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,940
Well, Victor Hugo suggested that, "He who opens a school door closes a

155
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,850
prison." And it is, truly--

156
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,080
education is a force for good.

157
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,110
It both educates and liberates the mind.

158
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,000
And it civilizes society.

159
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,200
When we think of liberation, we need go no further than Plato's

160
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,380
analogy of the cave.

161
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:33,010
Which illustrates how the study and pursuit of true knowledge can allow

162
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,840
someone to escape the bindings of false belief.

163
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,140
And you get the idea.

164
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,015
So you just can take a quotation and work it up as an impromptu.

165
00:07:41,015 --> 00:07:43,520
It's maybe a little bit easier than coming up with thesis

166
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,820
statements all the time.

167
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,970
And the nice thing is, this not only gives you some good practice.

168
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,230
It's a good way to warm up.

169
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:56,370
But by using quotations, it allows you to explore good turns of phrase and

170
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,280
work with those.

171
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,350
So I mean, imagine if you did just one impromptu a week for a year--

172
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,160
52 impromptus, five minutes a pop.

173
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,500
Think of the fluidity you would have at the end of that year.

174
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,670
And that's a real low cost in terms of five minutes of time allocation for

175
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,310
the results that you would see out of it.

176
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,335
The idea is being able to run something again and again.

177
00:08:18,335 --> 00:08:23,380
And becoming more and more comfortable with the very invention and idea of

178
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,820
working in speech.

179
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,820
So those are some ideas.

180
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,960
I want to pause here.

181
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,380
And in the next lecture, we'll talk about some other practicing

182
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,459
opportunities as you continue your path on becoming a good speaker.

183
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:34,709
