MATT MCGARRITY: All week we've been in essence talking about delivery.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,700
When we were talking about ethos, we were talking about how your style and

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,070
your delivery merge to form this particular persona you

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,780
carry into your speech.

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,330
Now here at the end of Week 6, I wanted to devote a little bit more

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,220
time merely to the mechanics of delivery.

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,760
Specifically I want to talk in this video lecture about pauses, vocal

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,020
variety, and movement.

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,940
And we talked a little bit about this in the impromptu.

10
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,870
But now we get to elaborate on it.

11
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:33,270
We get to enrich our discussion of these vital parts of speech delivery.

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,070
So let's start off by talking a little bit about pausing.

13
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,650
So just before you watch this clip, hopefully you watched that embedded

14
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,210
YouTube videos.

15
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,280
And one of those videos was this newsman.

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,500
And he's reading a story.

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,290
And he doesn't put an essential pause in there.

18
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,460
He says, "Dana is off tonight.

19
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,940
He was murdered and then set on fire." That's not at all

20
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,700
what he meant, right?

21
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,210
That wasn't a single phrase.

22
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,660
Those were two vitally difference phrases.

23
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,950
Dana is off tonight.

24
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,040
Important pause.

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,930
Then we've got, he was murdered.

26
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,250
And they're starting off with the lead story about someone who was murdered.

27
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:17,250
But when that newsman doesn't have that pause there, we read that, we

28
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,490
hear that, we understand that as a single phrase.

29
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,520
And I like starting with this example merely to point out that pausing makes

30
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,430
a difference.

31
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,920
It can shape meaning.

32
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,000
It also sort of highlights in that clip some of the dangers for oral

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,840
discourse as opposed to written of starting with a subordinate clause,

34
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,790
where maybe we read that as the second component of what you just said.

35
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,690
So pauses can be tremendously important in terms of shaping your

36
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,840
meaning and also in terms of helping the audience understand and access

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,580
your material.

38
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,180
So one of the things that you can be thinking about is pauses allow

39
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,420
material to sink in.

40
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,500
They give us time as audience members to process your information.

41
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,980
Now this is a type of pause that you can be practicing with.

42
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,600
So sometimes pauses may not be the thing that is easiest to practice or

43
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,800
easiest to think about.

44
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,000
But certainly if you know that there are going a couple of key phrases in

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,930
your performance, in your speech that you really want the audience to pay

46
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,230
attention to, well, there you can start practicing.

47
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,200
You can start planning those pauses.

48
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,250
So without a doubt, after big ideas, after key ideas, maybe a pause before

49
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,640
and after that.

50
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,460
I think a pause before and after any type of preview, either the main

51
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,020
introductory preview or internal previews, helps set apart that

52
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:40,320
information so that we can process it a little bit better.

53
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,770
So be thinking about, as you're going through, as you're practicing your

54
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,460
speech, maybe even marking up your outline or your manuscript in terms of

55
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,490
where you're going to want those pauses to be.

56
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:53,910
One place you want to know where you're going to put a pause in is

57
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,570
asking yourself the question, do I need to highlight this information?

58
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,480
Do I need the audience to have time to process what was just said?

59
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,030
So you want to use pauses to allow material to sink in.

60
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,630
But you can also be using pauses to emphasize an idea.

61
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:13,420
Earlier this week, we analyzed Neil deGrasse Tyson, looked at specifically

62
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,390
his informative ethos.

63
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:22,640
He uses pauses all the time to emphasize an idea, to really hammer

64
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,690
home a key thought, to suggest that one aspect, one particular aspect is

65
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,160
very important.

66
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,860
That's kind of how he would do it, right?

67
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,730
So that sort of emphasis pause can also be planned.

68
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:41,230
If you know you're going to build to a point and hit a key concept, a pause

69
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:46,460
afterwards is like underlining it heavily if you're writing or if you're

70
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,950
taking notes in a text.

71
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,620
So you can plan those pauses ahead of time.

72
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,640
So certainly you don't want to go too fast.

73
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,480
But my key concern is pauses can help the audience follow along.

74
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,910
One, they can help us process material.

75
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:06,070
But also, they can help us understand the hierarchy of ideas, the priority

76
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,960
that you're giving to one idea over another, simply by virtue of a pause

77
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,840
before and/or after a key concept.

78
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,890
So that's pauses.

79
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:19,490
That would also add to variety in your speech performance.

80
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,840
So if someone is speaking along and they never have a pause, that's going

81
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,760
to be problematic.

82
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,160
So we want to certainly have pauses in at various points in our speeches.

83
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,410
