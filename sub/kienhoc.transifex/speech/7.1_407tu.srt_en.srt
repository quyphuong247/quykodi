MATT MCGARRITY: Here we are now in the final portion of this class.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,800
We've done the impromptu.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,440
We mastered that sort of basic model of argument.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,880
We've had an opportunity to refine arrangement, think about invention.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,880
Then we moved into the informative speech.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,410
We had more moving parts there.

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,850
We started thinking about including complex ideas and how we're conveying

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:22,940
a certain ethos.

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,400
And here we are now in the persuasive speech.

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,780
In this very brief opening lecture, what I'd just like to do is kind of

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,890
preview what the week is going to be about.

12
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,760
And in essence, this week is going to be about two things, orienting you to

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,490
this speech assignment, and then starting to get you to think about how

14
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,880
your argument is positioned and what your argument needs

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,800
to be thinking about.

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,630
How is it going to be persuasive?

17
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,670
So under the heading of orientation, the next lecture will introduce the

18
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,320
assignment.

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,320
We'll go through why we're doing it, some samples that you might consider

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,470
for pursuing as topics.

21
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,480
Then after that, we'll move in and discuss the rubric and analyze a

22
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,190
samples speech.

23
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,860
So in that way, this sort of first week of the assignment is very similar

24
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,010
to what we did for the impromptu and for the informative.

25
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,980
Then in the second half of the week, what we're going to start doing is

26
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,270
thinking about some ideas for understanding argument, understanding

27
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,990
your argument either for the one that you're developing for this class or

28
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,840
the arguments you find yourself in every day in terms of how are you

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,690
thinking about persuasion.

30
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:26,190
So we'll talk about the concept of burden of proof.

31
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,320
And then we'll end this week with a hugely, hopefully useful--

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,910
I absolutely love this model--

33
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:34,810
stock issues.

34
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,230
So we'll talk about the burden of proof and stock issues.

35
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,890
So that's what we're going to be doing this week.

36
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,110
The goal is, by the end of this week, you should have some tools for

37
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,130
thinking more carefully through each and every persuasive endeavor

38
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,330
that you engage in.

39
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:51,710
And these can be cases of arguing for policy changes at work or giving your

40
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,180
client a reason to switch to your service.

41
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,030
Or it can be stuff like fundraising.

42
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,950
There's a lot of flexibility here.

43
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,840
But our core interest is with persuasion, the act of persuasion.

44
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,900
So with that, we'll start talking about the nature of this persuasive

45
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,150
assignment speech.

46
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,230
