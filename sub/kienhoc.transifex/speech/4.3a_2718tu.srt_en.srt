MATT MCGARRITY: I want to spend a little bit of time talking about a

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,560
process for preparing your speeches.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,270
I'd recommend it for your informative speech.

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,800
And in fact, I'd recommend it for most types of presentations

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,030
that you would give.

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,740
And I'm going to argue for this process.

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,129
Obviously you don't have to use it.

8
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,850
But I think it's a good way of approaching speeches.

9
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,820
Because often what happens is people tend to think of preparing a speech as

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,430
a linear process.

11
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,170
They say, well, I figure out what I'm going to talk about.

12
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,760
I draft up the outline.

13
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,020
I practice the outline.

14
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,050
And I deliver it.

15
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,010
And that's not really the most beneficial way, I think,

16
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,320
of preparing a speech.

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,380
Speeches don't flow in that linear fashion in terms of their preparation.

18
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,150
What will happen is somebody might make an early decision that makes

19
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:45,910
sense at the time.

20
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,120
But then it doesn't end up actually working out for what

21
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,970
they want to deliver.

22
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,910
But they're locked into that bad content because they

23
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,970
put it down on paper.

24
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,920
Peggy Noonan, who was one of Ronald Reagan's speechwriters,

25
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,650
had this great line.

26
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,590
"Where you falter, alter." And I think there's so much

27
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,680
going on in that quotation.

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,019
If you're making a mistake with your notes or with your

29
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,300
script, you change it.

30
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:06,960
Change it.

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,450
Don't pretend like you're not going to make that mistake again.

32
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,390
Don't try to ignore it.

33
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:15,870
If you're having a problem, change what you've written so that you can

34
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,560
deliver it in a way that works for you.

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,480
And so this process that I'm going to be talking about for developing your

36
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,980
speech is about fitting your content to your delivery and fitting your

37
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,100
delivery to your content.

38
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,090
And so this, what I'm going to suggest, is not really a linear way of

39
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,440
preparing your speech, but is more cyclical.

40
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,860
It's a way that incorporates practicing and

41
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,360
revisioning as well as drafting.

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,430
So I want to talk about what this cycle is, the composition cycle.

43
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,500
Then I want to talk a little bit about how the cycle can help

44
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,740
you prepare a speech.

45
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,250
And then, actually, what I'm going to do-- because I do this all the time--

46
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,260
is I'm going to walk you through a 45-minute talk that I gave and show

47
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,110
you the various--

48
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,970
very briefly, because it'd would take forever--

49
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,380
the various drafts that I went through to get it from raw idea through these

50
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,440
various iterations to the final product.

51
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,800
So just in terms of the basic components of this composition cycle.

52
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,120
Well, before we get into it, I would say there's a planning stage, trying

53
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,670
to figure out what the speech is, your first pass on it, getting all the

54
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,950
components together.

55
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,200
And then you enter this cycle of running the speech, reflecting on the

56
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,410
speech, revising the speech, running the speech, reflecting on it,

57
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,020
revising, and so on and so forth.

58
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,290
But at that planning stage, what you're doing is you're figuring out

59
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,400
how the topic and the audience and the speaker and the time

60
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,430
limits all fit together.

61
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,480
You're doing maybe some initial background work to shore up the

62
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,290
research that you need in order to pull together this huge, massive

63
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,090
draft, this initial draft.

64
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,450
By the way, in terms of where we are in the class, that's what the rest of

65
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,210
this week is about, is a lot of these big picture invention components,

66
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,010
these big planning components, getting all this down.

67
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,050
But then, once that initial planning is down, then you're just making

68
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,150
changes to the draft as you're practicing it.

69
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,010
You're doing revising within that.

70
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:14,230
And I would distinguish between how I would approach using the cycle to help

71
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,440
with speech composition, how I approach it as an ideal model, what I

72
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,010
want to do, and then a shorter model if I'm tight on time.

73
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,430
But let me walk you through the ideal model.

74
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,220
So in the ideal model, I've got my first pass.

75
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,740
And that first pass is finding my way, just figuring out what the heck I'm

76
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,780
going to be doing in this speech.

77
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,780
In terms of drafting, I'm trying to get as many ideas down

78
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,220
on paper as I can.

79
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,240
So I'm trying to figure out, I'm trying to think through invention.

80
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,200
What are the topics that have to be addressed?

81
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,050
I'm trying to think through goals.

82
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,450
What are the goals for this presentation for my audience?

83
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,990
What's all the research I can pull into this, all the evidence I want to

84
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,980
talk about?

85
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,210
And I just make a massive draft.

86
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,590
Usually I'm doing this on my computer.

87
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,530
This is pages, pages long.

88
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,730
And so I've got almost everything down.

89
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,630
And then once I've spent some time on that, maybe a day, depending on how

90
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:11,100
big the presentation is, maybe an hour on that, maybe a day on that,

91
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,200
depending on how far out I am from it.

92
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,030
I pull that massive draft together.

93
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,360
And then once I feel like I got almost everything there, I take that.

94
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,589
I set it aside.

95
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:22,780
Maybe I print out a copy or I often just read it off my computer.

96
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,320
And then I just talk my way through what I've got.

97
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,850
So I'm actually running the speech.

98
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,420
And there's no use in timing this.

99
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,580
I mean, it'll go way over time.

100
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,990
It's not what it's about.

101
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,900
It's about starting to internalize all that information, figuring out what

102
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,350
are the elements that are going to work?

103
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,250
What are the elements that I like?

104
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,000
So after I've planned it, I do a run-through.

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,640
Then after I do that run-through and it goes 1,000 hours or however-- it

106
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,320
doesn't go that long-- but after I've done that initial run through I sit

107
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,720
down and I reflect.

108
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,620
OK, what happened there?

109
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,890
What did I like talking about?

110
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,640
What didn't I like talking about?

111
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,070
When I was talking through it, was I like, I am BS-ing at the moment.

112
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,510
Thankfully no one's around.

113
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,190
This sounds awful.

114
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:12,010
So I'm trying to think about, what are the big things going on in the speech?

115
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,370
After I'm done with that reflection, I start making revisions.

116
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,260
I jump back into that massive outline document.

117
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,890
And I'm making big changes.

118
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,060
I'm going in, and I'm thinking you know what?

119
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,620
That entire second half of the speech needs to go.

120
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,460
Or these goals that I had for the audience?

121
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,950
I need to change these because they're not going to be doable in the time

122
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,630
that I have.

123
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:36,020
Or I'm like, oh, my second point I like, but I have no idea what I'm

124
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,780
talking about there.

125
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,860
I need to go find actual research to back up what I'm saying there.

126
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,280
So that revision is a lot of really big changes.

127
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,830
So I've done some planning.

128
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,590
I run it.

129
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,460
I reflect on it.

130
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,350
I revise it.

131
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,330
And then I run it again.

132
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,590
But now I'm in phase two, the second pass on the speech.

133
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,770
I would say if I'm going to label this one, this is redefining the speech.

134
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,950
So I'm running it.

135
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:06,290
Certainly, I'm better on time, but I know the main parts of the

136
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,050
presentation a little bit better.

137
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,120
Yeah, I'm almost pretty close to reading it.

138
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,300
I'm relying pretty heavily on that outline.

139
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,980
But I can remember some basic things.

140
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,890
I remember where the huge chunks of the presentation are.

141
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,060
So I run it that second time.

142
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,660
Then I sit down and reflect on it.

143
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,950
And now I've got some narrower reflections.

144
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,570
There's some parts I'm like, that was fun and awesome.

145
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,310
And then there are other parts where I'm like, I'm bored myself.

146
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,480
That was terrible.

147
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,860
So I want to reflect on what are some of the big chunks of the presentation?

148
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,580
Which ones are working?

149
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,710
And which ones aren't?

150
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,570
And again, I'm going through revision.

151
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:42,160
Maybe now I'm cutting entire points or entire sections of the speech.

152
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,300
I may or may not be doing massive goal changes.

153
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,460
because I've already gone through that pass.

154
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,650
But I'm really starting to take a harder look at inclusion, exclusion.

155
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,020
What gets into the speech?

156
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,810
What do I just not have time for?

157
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,510
What needs to be kicked out of the speech?

158
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,400
So I've run it.

159
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,110
I've reflected.

160
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,240
I've revised it.

161
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,130
And then we go into round three.

162
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,190
So I take another pass.

163
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,350
If I'm labeling this one, this is getting all those main

164
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,610
speech parts in line.

165
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,445
So I'm running it.

166
00:07:07,445 --> 00:07:08,030
And you know what?

167
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,080
Normally here I'll run it twice in a row back to back.

168
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,150
Because what I'm doing now, I'm really getting to the point

169
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,160
where I know the content.

170
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,930
Maybe now what I want to do is time my various chunks.

171
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,890
So I want to know, how long am I spending in my introduction?

172
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,450
How long am I spending in part three?

173
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,720
How long is that taking?

174
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,060
So I've got a timer with me.

175
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,050
I'm practicing it.

176
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,810
And I writing down where my time breaks are.

177
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,230
So I run the speech.

178
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,680
I've got a greater sense for it.

179
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,400
Now I sit down reflect again.

180
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,480
And here's where I go in my head.

181
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,730
I'm like, boy, I really like all this material, but I'm tight on time.

182
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,190
And I just have to remind myself, you can't game the system.

183
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,380
It's not just a matter of going faster.

184
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,860
That's not what you want.

185
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,080
I got to cut stuff.

186
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,660
I'm probably in the stage of cutting stuff.

187
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,030
And so at this stage, these cuts hurt.

188
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,600
I really like this section, but it's got to go.

189
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,120
No, maybe I can-- no, seriously, you cannot.

190
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,320
It has to go.

191
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,830
So I'm making those hard cuts.

192
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,100
And that's what's happening in the revisions.

193
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,600
I'm checking those time allocations.

194
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,200

195
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,330
Am I spending the most time where I want to be spending the most time or

196
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,010
where I need to be spending the most time?

197
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:20,230
That timing those chunks is really important information when I'm making

198
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:24,290
revisions because I'm, like, well, is this matching up with what I want?

199
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,400
And in that sense, I also want to check my overall congruency.

200
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,220
If I said I had three main objectives or three goals for the audience, I

201
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,549
want to look at those goals and say, am I really accomplishing those in

202
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,320
this speech?

203
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,390
If I am, great.

204
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,360
If I'm not, do I need to go back and change those goals?

205
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,340
Do I need to change my sense of what the audience is?

206
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:46,570
Or do I need to make some revisions to the outline itself?

207
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,110
So I'm doing a pass for congruency.

208
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,730
So then we enter final phase, just style and polish.

209
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,400
So I run it.

210
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,220
Once again, I'll run it twice in a row.

211
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,690
And by now I want to be pretty close to my time mark.

212
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,550
If I've got 10 minutes for the speech, I should be coming in

213
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,350
roughly around there.

214
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,180
I'll probably say this again under delivery.

215
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:12,620
But if you're presenting a speech for a live audience, you should probably,

216
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:18,270
in practice, get it to about 85% of your time allocation.

217
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:24,850
So if you got a 10-minute speech, in practice, ideally you'd want to be

218
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,470
coming in closer to 8:30.

219
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:30,310
And that's because that means when you get up in front of that audience, you

220
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,840
can play around with them.

221
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,870
If something happens, you can respond to it.

222
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,830
You can talk to them.

223
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,540
You don't have to race, because you're probably going to be going faster in

224
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,280
practice than you will in performance.

225
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,290
So you want to be able to give yourself enough relaxing time to play

226
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,080
around with that audience, have fun, relax a little bit.

227
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,010
And so I want to make sure that I know what my maximum time is so that in

228
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,450
this final stage when I'm timing my chunks, if I've got a 10-minute

229
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,930
speech, I'm coming in between 8 and 1/2 to 9 minutes.

230
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:01,170
Because then, I don't have to worry about going over when I get into that

231
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,820
actual speech setting.

232
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,960
So I run the speech.

233
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,980
I run it twice again.

234
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,990
I'm timing my chunks.

235
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,890
Reflection.

236
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,330
All right, well, at this point, I should like most of the speech.

237
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,130
And one thing that emerges at this stage is I know where I could

238
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,960
potentially go off on a tangent.

239
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,980
So it's like, oh, I've got a ton of content there.

240
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,630
If I don't watch myself, I'll go off for five minutes talking about that.

241
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,880
So I need to write around that or plan around that.

242
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,550
Or at the very least, I got to know it.

243
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,970
So I'm like, when I reach that point, I'm like, just shut up.

244
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:30,580
Keep going.

245
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,610
Remember, this works.

246
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,730
Don't go off a tangent.

247
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,770
Don't say that out loud.

248
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,100
Your audience won't know what you're talking about.

249
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,550
They'll think you're a little odd.

250
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:43,130
But I know where those different potentials for wandering tangents are.

251
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:46,200
In terms of revisions, I'm probably making small revisions.

252
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,150
I'm tweaking some of the points, maybe I'm changing up some of the phrasing,

253
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,080
probably in those main point labels or those sub-claim labels.

254
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,420
And I'm checking to make sure that that style is accessible.

255
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,010
I'm not relying too heavily on jargon.

256
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,460
So that's the ideal model.

257
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,000
And at the end of this, the speech has probably gone through about four or

258
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,620
five revisions with probably about six or eight run-throughs.

259
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,600
And this actually doesn't take as much time as you think.

260
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,400
When I walk you through the sample one I did, this is something you can do

261
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,630
over a span of days.

262
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,450
And it works well in that regard.

263
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,200
But it doesn't take as much time as you might think.

264
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,630
And even if it did, it would be worth it because the results in the actual

265
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:28,800
performance of the speech are so evidently clear because you just know

266
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,330
the speech.

267
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,440
You don't have to read it.

268
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,720
You have revised this speech in a way that makes it so you

269
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,960
can deliver it well.

270
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,660
But that's my ideal model.

271
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,770
I don't have always all the time in the world to do that.

272
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,780
So I do have a shorter model.

273
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,850
The shorter model's trying to tap into some of the basic ideas

274
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,100
of that longer model.

275
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,700
So once again, I'll probably start out by planning the speech, getting all

276
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,760
that information into one massive document.

277
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,690
Maybe I make more changes and revisions to that massive document

278
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,850
before I run it.

279
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,490
Nevertheless, I plan.

280
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,470
I run the speech.

281
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,410
I reflected on it.

282
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,540
I revise it.

283
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,690
Those are probably some pretty big changes.

284
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,300
Then I again run the speech, reflect on it, and revise it with smaller

285
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,390
changes in mind.

286
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,700
And maybe that's it.

287
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,550
So then it's probably gone through maybe two or three run-throughs with

288
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:21,220
one or two revision passes, and regardless of whether or not you do

289
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,240
the ideal version or the short version or somewhere in between those two, the

290
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,630
main thing is, the most important thing is that you are using practice

291
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:34,540
as a way of guiding your composition.

292
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,710
And that just helps you out so much.

293
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:39,890
Remember, weeks back we talked about the difference between

294
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,220
literacy and orality.

295
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:46,090
And so you're using writing, but you're also using orality as a check

296
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,200
on your writing.

297
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,910
This is why speech writing is tough.

298
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,820
It is often very difficult to write for the ear as opposed to the eye.

299
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,330
But in practicing it and paying attention to your own performance,

300
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:02,320
you're revising that written content based on what you want to say.

301
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,830
So let me go ahead and I'll wrap this up a little bit.

302
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,140
But right now let's go ahead and take a very brief pause.

303
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,820
And I'm going to show you what this might look like.

304
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,910
So just a little bit of context here.

305
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,680
This is just about, I guess, a year and a half ago, maybe

306
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,420
something like that.

307
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,910
I was asked to give a 45-minute keynote address at a scholarship of

308
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,200
teaching and learning symposium.

309
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,350
So I had to present on teaching and learning.

310
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,130
And I had some research and some thoughts.

311
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:29,930
And I want to go through my various drafts, very briefly, as an

312
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,950
archaeological way of demonstrating this method.

313
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,200
So let's go ahead and do that now.

314
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,637
