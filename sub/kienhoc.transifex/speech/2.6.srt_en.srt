MATT MCGARRITY: So here we are at the end of the content for week two.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,360
And at this point, I would say you have all the tools you

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,990
need to prep an impromptu.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,890
So do it, do it a lot.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,100
And you go to the class list that's on the web page for impromptu

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,280
prompts if you wish.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,610
You can generate your own impromptu prompts.

8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:24,610
But the main thing is, I want you to prep, prep, prep, and run, run, run.

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,130
Impromptu is such an invaluable skill.

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,450
This model is useful in so many spaces.

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,790
But it's only useful if you know it and it's built

12
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:34,920
into your muscle memory.

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,050
So this is a skill that improves with your practice.

14
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,660
So run these speeches.

15
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,820
And I know we haven't finished our discussion of

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,520
impromptu, and that's fine.

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,210
Because really the way I think speech education often works is I want you to

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,180
practice this so you can find areas that are challenging to you.

19
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,410
And then I can come back and respond to those concerns.

20
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,000
So as you're sort of moving up, I want you to be sort of going a little bit

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,680
beyond where our instruction is, so then when we get to that lesson I can

22
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,709
answer those questions for you.

23
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,510
So next week we'll talk about these various

24
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,510
components, claim and evidence.

25
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,850
And we're really going to get you to the point where you sound smooth in

26
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:13,730
these impromptu's.

27
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,580
We'll talk about warrants, we'll talk about arrangements, we'll talk about

28
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,930
doing introductions, transitions, and conclusions.

29
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,610
And we'll spend a lot of time, a lot of time talking about delivery, and

30
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,950
overcoming your fear of public speaking.

31
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,950
So I look forward to seeing you next week.

32
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,200
