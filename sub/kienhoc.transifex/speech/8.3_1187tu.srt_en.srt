00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,100
MATT MCGARRITY: I think it's a good practice to identify next steps in

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,060
persuasion.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,440
So if you're raising awareness, as you're doing in many cases in these

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,910
persuasive speeches, what can we as audience members do?

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,920
And we want to leave the audience with an idea or what about next

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,600
steps can they take?

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,480
So I want to talk through a few of these strategies for designing these

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,950
calls to action, these recommendations.

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,700
And to begin with, I want to distinguish between a cure and a call

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,710
to action, because often these can get confused.

11
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:39,570
A cure is what needs to happen in order to solve the ill or the blame.

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:46,890
A call to action is an incremental step to help implement that cure.

13
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,860
So it's, what can we do to see that to, help that cure be implemented, be

14
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,020
put into place, become a reality?

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,810
So these calls to action should be realistic and doable, because you're

16
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,980
asking your audience to play a role in the implementation of that cure.

17
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,000
And I watched--

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,560
so in the US, we've got Netflix.

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,420
Netflix is a streaming video source.

20
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,500
So at home, I watch all these movies.

21
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,970
And really what I end up watching a lot of are issue documentaries.

22
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,740
And issue documentaries are basically persuasive speeches on any number of

23
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,570
topics, on food, the role of corn production, or the dangers of fast

24
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,262
food, or the dangers of--

25
00:01:25,262 --> 00:01:29,630
I'm trying to think of one that I watched dealing with housing

26
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,050
insulation.

27
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:31,920
It sounds boring.

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,110
But it's fascinating stuff.

29
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,700
But anyways, these issue documentaries are almost all the same, right?

30
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,920
They are ill, blame, cure, call to action.

31
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,790
And if you watch any one of these, it's almost comic how much the

32
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,400
conventions have ossified around these documentaries.

33
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,790
So you know, they'll start off.

34
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,030
And usually the lighting in the ill and the blame is kind of bad.

35
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,850
And then when they get to cure, there's a change.

36
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,330
And all of a sudden it's open and the music picks up.

37
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,760
And when they get to call to action, it's all snapshots and editing and

38
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,340
quick zips in and out and things you can do.

39
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,230
And it's enjoyable.

40
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,240
And it also sort of recognizes this sort of this pattern works often.

41
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,450
But this call to action is what they end on, because it's asking that

42
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,890
audience to go out and do something.

43
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,490
It's asking that audience to make some type of change.

44
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,550
So what then can your call to action do?

45
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,700
Well, it can speak to the legislative process.

46
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,070
So what legislation should we support?

47
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,630
And how can we as audience members support it?

48
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,140
Sort of the famous line here is usually, call or write your

49
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,270
congressperson.

50
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,230
Or sign this petition.

51
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,800
Those are calls to action.

52
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,070
You're asking your audience to do something.

53
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:46,320
And you're saying, what you do here will help implement that larger cure.

54
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,100
If you're raising awareness, maybe asking that audience merely to be an

55
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,650
agent of change, get more informed on the issue.

56
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,670
So you're telling them what sort of books should they read or what other

57
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,380
sources of information should they expose themselves to to arm them with

58
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,240
the knowledge that they'll need to enact the cure that

59
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,250
you're talking about.

60
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,065
So you end a speech on food safety by saying, if you're interested, here are

61
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:10,950
a couple of websites.

62
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,700
Or here's a book that you can read.

63
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,150
You're giving us something to do, something to help implement the change

64
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,720
in our lives or in society.

65
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,130
If you were talking about raising awareness around an organization, a

66
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,880
nonprofit, you're directing my attention, my interest

67
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,960
to this other topic.

68
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,370
The famous example here are any argument for blood donation.

69
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,730
So most of those speeches end with, you should donate blood.

70
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,590
Or if you're interested, go to redcross.org to find a local blood

71
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,110
donation center.

72
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,270
So it's telling me what I can do to implement this cure.

73
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:50,370
In that case, hypothetically the standard model is we don't have enough

74
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,860
blood resources.

75
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,160
This is because of lack of awareness or lack of interest or

76
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,560
lack of certain types.

77
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,240
The cure is to increase awareness about blood donation and certainly

78
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,030
increase the stock of blood that we have.

79
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,180
So tell your friends what they can do.

80
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,880
Make sure people are aware of the need for blood.

81
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,540
And of course, go donate blood yourself.

82
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,230
So that call to action is giving me something that I can do.

83
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,529
These calls to action can also just be changes in personal behavior.

84
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:21,589
So what can I do tomorrow that will help improve the ill?

85
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:24,780
Or what can I do tomorrow that will help implement the cure?

86
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,450
You may remember back to the sample student speech then we watched last

87
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,030
week, Kathy's speech on fair trade.

88
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,740
One of the calls to action in there is, buy fair trade products.

89
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,660
That's a call to action.

90
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,380
It's saying, we want to support this larger economic practice.

91
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,570
And one of the best ways to support that economic practice is for you to

92
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,510
change your consuming behavior, so buy fair trade.

93
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,350
So this is simply something that you're leaving your audience with.

94
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,240
In life, we want to do this all the time.

95
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,280
So at the end of business meetings, you might be making recommendations.

96
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,990
Sometimes these are called deliverables or action items.

97
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,200
Certainly fundraising is all about the call to action.

98
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,520
And that call to action is always, give money.

99
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,250
So you're building a case so that giving money makes sense and you

100
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,800
understand why there is a need for you to give money.

101
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,190
In community organizations--

102
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,380
here in the US we have parent-teacher associations.

103
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,520
And these are all about calls to action, making the case for why and

104
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,540
how parents should get involved in their child's school.

105
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,940
But the idea here is to make sure that people can clearly see how these

106
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,590
specific actions relate to the overall cures.

107
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,990
We don't want to have a call to action that seems very

108
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,580
disconnected from that cure.

109
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,050
We're getting to this issue of congruency.

110
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,670
We want to be able to say, here's where the cure is.

111
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,140
And then here's what you can do.

112
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,800
And here's how what you're going to do advances that cure.

113
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,800
So by way of conclusion of this section, by this point now, if you're

114
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,430
working on a speech, in general and following this model or you're working

115
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,590
on a speech for this class to upload and post, by now you should have all

116
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,230
your argumentative elements.

117
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,000
You should have developed your case through stock issues.

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,980
You've got an idea of what you're arguing there.

119
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,400
You've thought about whether or not you should include counter arguments

120
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,420
and if so, what those counter arguments will look like.

121
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,930
And now you've got some background in terms of thinking of calls to action.

122
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,460
So in the next lecture, we're going to take a look at how you arrange--

123
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,740
some options for arranging all these various argumentative elements in a

124
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,160
way that's motivational and in a way that will allow you to write a

125
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,650
stylistically rich and moving speech.

126
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,900
