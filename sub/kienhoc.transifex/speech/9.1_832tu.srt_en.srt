MATT MCGARRITY: Welcome to week 9.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:06,620
So before we get into the material for this week as we've done in the past, I

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,140
would just like to provide a little bit of an overview as to what we're

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,350
going to be doing, and how it fits in with the larger goals of the course.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,670
And what specifically you're going to be mapping out this week.

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,130
So last week was really about getting your argument in shape.

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,850
And now we're going to turn to stylizing the language and delivery.

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,400
So as we enter this last chunk of the course, this last chunk of the

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,710
persuasive speech, I want you to think about how we've moved in terms of the

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,940
nature of our preparation, but not really the goal of our

11
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,490
public speaking course.

12
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,150
So in the impromptu, you minimized your prep in order to

13
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,670
speak for the ear.

14
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,820
And in the informative, you worked from an outline in order to master

15
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,210
those complex details, but deliver that information in a way that was

16
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,490
easy for an audience to follow along with.

17
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,640
And now we're really adding a significant manuscript

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,460
aspect to this speech.

19
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,370
So the manner in which you're presenting this speech or preparing

20
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,590
for the speech has changed, but the goal certainly hasn't.

21
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,800
It's still very much about writing and speaking for the ear.

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,210
Of course now you have more experience, you've

23
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,420
done a lot more speaking.

24
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,480
You've analyze more speeches.

25
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,190
And speech writing can be very tough because you have to find a way to

26
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,380
prepare something visually that's going to work for

27
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,000
an audience of auditors.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,920
And we see a lot of this actually in the Roman tradition.

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,410
Kind of how we've done our various speech assignments.

30
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:28,210
So in the classical tradition, specifically in the Roman tradition,

31
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,530
we will find a distinction between low, middle, and

32
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,540
grand styles of oratory.

33
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,050
So low style would be colloquial speech, just very plain spoken.

34
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,800
Middle speech would probably be now more of what we consider professional

35
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,820
type speaking.

36
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:49,340
And then grand oratory or high oratory is much closer to political oratory.

37
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,700
Certainly when people think about the speeches that they love, they're

38
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,050
probably talking more about grand oratory.

39
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,680
I have a dream is a great example of the sort of high

40
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,650
oratory, grand oratory.

41
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,130
And as we've moved through the course, we've kind of tried to touch on

42
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,790
various aspects of these.

43
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:09,720
So even though we're still trying to main focus on the oral mode, the

44
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,370
impromptu for example was about being clear, and being simple.

45
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,850
But it was pretty plain spoken.

46
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,730
The idea in terms of minimizing your prep, was that you were speaking

47
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,290
rather plainly, colloquially.

48
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,280
As we moved into the informative speech, we sort of addressed more

49
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,040
deliberately word choice.

50
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,690
And how you're going to present complex information.

51
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,070
So that was probably closer to a sort of a mixed our middle style.

52
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,040
And then this persuasive certainly has some middle elements, but also has

53
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,690
parts that are more in this grand tradition.

54
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,690
So how do you prepare these speeches also changed.

55
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,420
In the impromptu, it was a very brief outline.

56
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,320
And the informative, it was a more elaborate outline.

57
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,270
And in the persuasive, it might have a full manuscript or significant

58
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,160
portions of the speech manuscript.

59
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,200
We've increased the challenge as we've moved up from low

60
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,760
middle to a grand style.

61
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,410
But once again, the goal has remained the same.

62
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,330
Being able to speak in a clear fashion, in a motivational fashion.

63
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,260
But above all, to be able to speak in a fashion that is easy for an audience

64
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,240
of listeners to follow along with.

65
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,230
So we're going to be doing this week is really getting into

66
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,500
this oratorical tradition.

67
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,260
Really getting into this sense of how you can tap into some of the power of

68
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,430
grand oratory.

69
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,970
We're going to begin the week by talking about strategic language use.

70
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,930
And once we've got an idea of the value vocabulary you're using in your

71
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,610
persuasive speech, we'll shift to stylistic devices, stylistic language.

72
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:38,220
How you can write in a grander style.

73
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,450
And then finally, we'll shift into delivery.

74
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,080
Specifically thinking about how to deliver a grand style in a way that

75
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,220
sounds good.

76
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,570
Capturing the good writing that you've engaged in and making sure it

77
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,230
translates to an actual speaking encounter.

78
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,490
Well also end by talking through some other warm ups and projection and a

79
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,100
vocal health as well.

80
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,730
So that's what we've got in store for this penultimate week.

81
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,830
We've got one more week of material, but this is the last week that really

82
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,040
gets us to the point where you're going to be working on

83
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,390
your persuasive speech.

84
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,750
And of course at the end, we'll talk a little bit about if you so choose, you

85
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,880
can always upload a speech, and receive some peer feedback.

86
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,839
And that gives you just a general sense of where we're going in general

87
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,129
in the course and specifically in this week.

88
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:21,379
