MATT MCGARRITY: This week we're going to delve more into

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,330
your persuasive argument.

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,820
Now, next week what we're going to do is we're going to take the argument

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,940
model that we developed this week, and we're going to make it much more

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,700
stylistically rich.

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,010
So you may remember from last week this speech, this persuasive speech is

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,110
more scripted.

8
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:22,040
We've come to a point now in the class where we can start writing

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:22,930
more for the ear.

10
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,580
And we can start writing rich stylistic devices for the ear.

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,950
And for this speech you need to be thinking more in

12
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,540
terms of high oratory.

13
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,960
I think that's a good exercise, as a way of expanding the type of writing,

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,310
and speaking you can do.

15
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,850
Now before we get to that stylistically rich writing, we have to

16
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,890
get our argumentative ducks in a row.

17
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,920
And that's really what this week is about.

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,460
So we're going to start off by identifying and

19
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,340
responding to counter arguments.

20
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,990
Now, not every one of you is going to need to do this in your speech for

21
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,800
this class, or speeches that you give outside of this class.

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,450
Nevertheless, I do think it's useful to be aware of strategies for

23
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,290
identifying and responding to counter arguments.

24
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,459
Then we're going to work on developing calls to action.

25
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,610
And when we get to this, I'll certainly unpack this further.

26
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,490
But basically, a call to action is a recommendation that you're giving to

27
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,390
your audience about next steps.

28
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,100
Having talked through the issue, what can they do next?

29
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,160
And that's what we're going to be spending some time on.

30
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,530
Once we get those argumentative pieces down, we'll turn our attention to

31
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,470
arrangement.

32
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,270
Thinking in terms of some arrangements patterns you might of liked to use for

33
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:26,900
this speech.

34
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,720
We'll also spend a fair bit of time talking about congruency.

35
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,320
Making sure that the different parts of your speech work well together.

36
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,800
And then finally, we'll end with argumentative fallacies.

37
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,600
So by the end of this week, you should have some tools for making and

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,700
arranging motivational arguments.

39
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,210
Persuasive and motivational arguments.

40
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:50,080
By the end of this week, you should be able to identify fallacies in other

41
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,260
speeches, and avoid them in your own.

42
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,270
Now in a more specific sense, you should have by the end of this week a

43
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:00,260
solid argument that identifies ails, blames, and cures.

44
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,090
And provides the audience some recommendation, those calls to action.

45
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,730
So with that, we're going to turn to this first issue of thinking through

46
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,539
counter arguments.

47
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:12,190
Specifically in terms of, what does the audience need to hear?

48
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,440
