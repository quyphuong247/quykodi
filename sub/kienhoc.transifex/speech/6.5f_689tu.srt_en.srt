00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,500
PHIL DAVISON: Ladies and gentlemen of the Stark County Republican Party

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,350
Executive Committee, good evening.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,850
And thank you, not only for your attendance, but for allowing me the

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,270
opportunity to speak.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:21,250
My name is Phil Davison, and I am seeking our party's nomination for the

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:30,390
position of Stark County Treasurer November of 2010.

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,920
In terms of my background, I am from the village of Minerva, where I am

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:43,520
serving my 13th year of elected service as a Minerva council member.

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,660
In terms of education, I have a bachelor's degree in sociology, a

10
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,560
bachelor's degree in history, a master's degree in public

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,783
administration, and a master's degree in communication.

12
00:00:58,783 --> 00:01:02,540

13
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,020
In terms of elections across Stark County, I represented our party twice

14
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:13,000
on the county ballot in both the primary and the general elections when

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,860
I ran for Stark County Clerk of Courts in 1996, and Stark County Commissioner

16
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,605
in 2000, and I will not apologize for my tone tonight.

17
00:01:22,605 --> 00:01:26,190
I have been a Republican in times good, and I have been a

18
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,320
Republican in times bad.

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:35,890

20
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:40,260
Albert Einstein issued one of my most favorite quotes in the history of the

21
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,270
spoken word, and it is as follows.

22
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:53,800
"In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity." I'm going to repeat that

23
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,530
so I have clarity tonight.

24
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,766
"In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity."

25
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:04,380
This is the opportunity we've been waiting for.

26
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,736
The Stark County Treasurer's office is a mess.

27
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:13,330
It is in dire need of structure and guidance.

28
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,566
And now's the time to seize this opportunity with an aggressive

29
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:20,031
campaign and an even more aggressive campaigner.

30
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:23,398

31
00:02:23,398 --> 00:02:29,140
If nominated tonight, I promise each and every person in this room I will

32
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,010
hit the ground running, come out swinging, and end up winning.

33
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,184

34
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:42,450
Let's send a message tonight to the people of Stark County, and to the

35
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,380
people of the Stark County Democratic Party.

36
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,486
We're tired of business as usual.

37
00:02:49,486 --> 00:02:52,280
Drastic times require what?

38
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,160
SPEAKER 1: Drastic measures.

39
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,480
PHIL DAVISON: Drastic measures, yes!

40
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,070
Who said that?

41
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,200
Thank you!

42
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,440
Drastic times require drastic measures.

43
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,620

44
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:10,480
We will not tolerate incompetence and irresponsibility any longer.

45
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,080
Now is the time to snap the Democratic stranglehold on the

46
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,055
Treasurer's office in two.

47
00:03:16,055 --> 00:03:18,710
And I hearken back to what my friend Alex just said.

48
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,540
He ran against the Treasurer in 1996.

49
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,606
It was a problem then, it's a problem now--

50
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:25,856
infestation.

51
00:03:25,856 --> 00:03:29,830

52
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,730
Politics is not touch football.

53
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,180
Politics is winner take all-- it always has been, and

54
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,956
it always will be.

55
00:03:38,956 --> 00:03:41,820

56
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:47,770
If nominated tonight, I want to develop and expand my campaign for

57
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,770
what I believe is the greatest strength of the Stark County

58
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:56,150
Republican Party, and that is its people.

59
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:01,820
I believe in the axiom that all politics is local.

60
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:06,392

61
00:04:06,392 --> 00:04:12,940
And because of this belief, I want to harness the thoughts and ideas that

62
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:19,140
individuals in our party have concerning Stark County and its

63
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:29,510
political subdivisions and use that to its fullest extent.

64
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,870
Knowledge is power.

65
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,410
Let's tap into this knowledge and use it as a tool to win

66
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,840
the Treasurer's office.

67
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,720
Let's use this knowledge not only as a tool, but as a weapon.

68
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,910

69
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,850
We must win this election.

70
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,141
If nominated tonight, I will win this election.

71
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:53,140
And I'm going to say that again so there's no miscommunication tonight.

72
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,680
If nominated tonight, I win!

73
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,120
Tell your friends.

74
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,436
Tell your neighbors.

75
00:04:57,436 --> 00:05:01,090
Tell Randy Gonzalez.

76
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,340
I'm coming--

77
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,032
both barrels, guns loaded.

78
00:05:04,032 --> 00:05:07,780
I believe in the entities and the principles of the National Republican

79
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,875
Party the State of Ohio Republican Party, and the Stark

80
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,060
County Republican Party.

81
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,300
And if nominated, I will not hide those beliefs on my march to victory

82
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,260
on election day.

83
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,910
If nominated tonight, I can guarantee with 100% certainty that what you are

84
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,450
seeing from me tonight is what everyone outside those doors is going

85
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,280
to get over the next eight weeks.

86
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,245
I used to be idealistic thinker.

87
00:05:30,245 --> 00:05:33,030
I am now a pragmatic thinker.

88
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,550
Government may be about service--

89
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,940
politics is about winning.

90
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,315
Tonight as a candidate seeking the Republican nomination for the position

91
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:45,520
of Stark County Treasurer, I humbly ask for your vote as members of the

92
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,330
Stark County Republican Party Executive Committee.

93
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:48,950
Thank you.

94
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,386
[APPLAUSE]
