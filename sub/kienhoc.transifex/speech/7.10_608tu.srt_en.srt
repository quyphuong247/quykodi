MATT MCGARRITY: let's end this week with I

1
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,370
some general ideas and and and homework

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:11,219
around stock issue status quo on burden of proof so what I want to do

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,000
is you need possibility oh you do it at a desk in just do it in your head

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,090
what I would like you to do is just list out all the possible stock issues

5
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,310
for a persuasive topic can be a persuasive speech that working out for

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,010
this class

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,099
or it could be something that you're working on outside in this class

8
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:30,460
but just sit down and start listing out

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,690
all the possible topics around ill blame QR in consequence

10
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,960
remember back to that address the Delian definition of rhetoric as

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,239
the capacity to see in any given case all the available means of persuasion

12
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,899
this is a tool for helping you do some of that

13
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,700
are just thinking through how light someone are you for or against this case

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,020
and this is a way of figuring out

15
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,870
what you can choose to address once you have all these issues in front view

16
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,920
you can start to pick and choose in terms of which ones are really going to

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,320
help you

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,150
bill a motivational case they get your audience to the point where they want to

19
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,990
take action but

20
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,040
it's not necessarily the order in which you addressed said

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,350
that Obama speech that we listened to he did a straight stock issues case ill

22
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:18,180
blamed your consequences that may not be how you run through your speech

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,869
but by going two years topic with these I

24
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:25,689
stock issues and mind you can develop and number of ideas

25
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:29,509
you pry won't end up using all of the ideas that you identify any way

26
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:32,860
but it is a good activity to get everything out on a single sheet of

27
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,409
paper

28
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:37,799
seeing start thinking through what options you have in terms of argument

29
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,500
and evidence

30
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,890
an arrangement so here at the end of the week I just kinda 1 review

31
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:47,159
so what we did this week was ornate you to the persuasive speech and getting to

32
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,720
the point hopefully we can position your argument

33
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,610
up against other people arguing in that row

34
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,310
so in terms of orientation we talk about the assignment the rubric and we

35
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,490
analyzed the sample

36
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,549
and in terms of positioning the argument we talked about status quo bird approve

37
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,100
and stock issues so this material

38
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,160
should help you very tangibly it should help you design a persuasive speech that

39
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,940
this class

40
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,580
if you choose to record a speech in uploaded but it should certainly help

41
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,000
you

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,090
every single time you step forward to do a persuasive speech

43
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,030
this could be your next fundraiser are good just make you a sharper thinker in

44
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,030
business meetings

45
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:30,040
are will delve more into argument design an arrangement next week

46
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,150
but my hope is here at the end of this week or the in to this video-content

47
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,099
you have started to pull together some ideas that you can work with

48
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:41,300
even if you don't record a speech in uploaded for this class

49
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,550
I think you're gonna gain more outta this material

50
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,480
if you're working on a presentation an argument

51
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,379
because then you have to make choices instead of just think abstractly

52
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:56,849
about what burden of proof me burn a proven stock issues take on their

53
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:57,590
meaning

54
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,940
when you put them into specific context so at this point just go ahead start

55
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,530
drafting up some ideas thinking through

56
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,560
how you might elec to make a persuasive

57
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,950
motivational argument stand in as an advocate

58
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,159
for your issue and I'll see you next week
