MATT MCGARRITY: First off, welcome to Week 6.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,070
We're past the halfway point in the class.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,510
We've gone over five weeks.

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,119
We're now into Week 6 material.

5
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,500
We're going to finish out the informative speech this week.

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,200
And then next week, we're going to take up that final assignment, the

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,300
persuasive speech.

8
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,250
So here at the beginning of the week, what I'd really like to do is just

9
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,210
kind of give you a sense for what we're going to be doing over the next

10
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,280
couple of video lectures and in the discussion forums.

11
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,640
So right now, I'd just like to talk about where we are in the informative,

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,090
kind of give you a sense for what we're going to be doing this week, and

13
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,049
then finally end by talking about how all of this should translate to the

14
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:35,080
informative speeches that you are doing in this class and outside of

15
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,100
this class.

16
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,820
So to begin with, where are we in the informative?

17
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,080
The informative, unlike the impromptu, is three weeks long.

18
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,160
We're in the final third of that informative speech.

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,880
So at this point, you should have completed a draft, right?

20
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,770
That was sort of Week 4 material, the introduction to

21
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:51,880
the informative speech.

22
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,350
We've talked about goals.

23
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:58,110
Last week, you really put some flesh on the skeleton of that speech.

24
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,620
You've developed a full draft.

25
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,280
You've refined it with evidence.

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,200
So now what we're going to be doing in this week is putting those final

27
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,520
touches on your outline.

28
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,530
We're going to be talking first off about introductions and conclusions,

29
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,370
specifically introductions and conclusions for informative speeches.

30
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,420
And then we get into some really interesting stuff on

31
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,220
performance and delivery.

32
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,820
So we'll spend a fair bit of time talking about ethos, defining that

33
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,640
term, and then thinking about how it's going to work for you as an

34
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,610
informative speaker.

35
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,400
We'll really pursue ethos, do a couple of case studies.

36
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,450
We'll take a look at Bill Clinton.

37
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,890
And we'll also take a look at Neil deGrasse Tyson as a way of

38
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,950
understanding ethos through the specific case studies as well as

39
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,000
through a discussion of general principles.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,950
And then finally, we'll move into some stuff on delivery.

41
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,570
At this point, I want to talk a little bit about pacing and pausing.

42
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,380
Certainly you're probably going to be using notes for your informative

43
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,690
speech, so I want to talk a little bit about preparing your notes and using

44
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,780
your notes.

45
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,630
We'll talk about vocal variety.

46
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,490
And I've got a whole bunch of exercises to help you practice some of

47
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,220
these delivery techniques at home.

48
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,300
So that's kind of where we're going this week.

49
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,780
So in the end, these assignments should be useful to you in a very

50
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,470
tangible daily way.

51
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,780
So all of our attention this week to introductions and conclusions and

52
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,440
especially to ethos and delivery should help you in each and every

53
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,270
informative presentation that you give.

54
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:27,120
This is about helping you refine who you are as a speaker, that persona

55
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,010
that you have when you stand up to deliver information, when you're

56
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,540
educating an audience about a new topic.

57
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,700
So in that sense, what our concern is is not necessarily who you are in the

58
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,500
privacy of your home, but who you are, what you are, when you stand up to

59
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,530
deliver a speech.

60
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,370
So that's where we're going this week, so let's go ahead and get to it.

61
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,620
