00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,280
MATT MCGARRITY: I want to spend some time looking at your argument and

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,490
checking to make sure that the various elements are

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:07,550
congruent with one another.

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,030
And by that, I mean they work well together.

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,740
So your cures are in fact solving for the problems discussed.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,730
You're highlighting how the call to action advances the cure.

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,780
So you're demonstrating the relationship of these various

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,550
argumentative components.

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,950
So I want to do this simply by looking at a couple of examples.

10
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,040
so these are examples that I've run across, that I've helped people on.

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,870
And I'll show just as one there was an argument, a policy argument here in

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,130
Washington State, about taxing candy.

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:43,140
So here in Washington, as is the case at a lot of other places around the

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,260
country, candy is framed as a food item.

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,990
So candy isn't subjected to sales tax.

16
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,450
So our state, like a lot of states, was in sort of financial dire straits,

17
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,520
but also was able to make a principled argument for saying we should not

18
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,690
classify candy as a food, because it's candy.

19
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,560
And it's not a banana, so we shouldn't classify it as food.

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,280
And so it should be subject to sales tax.

21
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,070
So there was an argument for against this.

22
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,830
And so one of the arguments that I was working with someone on was they were

23
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,980
arguing for the candy tax.

24
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,310
So what they said was, all right, ill.

25
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,510
Obesity rates are high in the US in general and in Washington in

26
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,230
particular.

27
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,780
Blames.

28
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,740
Why does that ill exist?

29
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,050
Blames.

30
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,510
Because we eat too much sugar.

31
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,900
So then he said cures.

32
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,450
We should pass the bill reclassifying candy as a non-food item.

33
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,510
And then calls to action.

34
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,630
Here's what you can do to help pass the bill.

35
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,710
Support the bill.

36
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,580
Clarify the debate by knowing about it and talking to others.

37
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,900
And then support local health initiatives.

38
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,030
So this was the argument that I was presented with.

39
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,200
So I take a look at that.

40
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,310
And I say, you know, the ills and the blames seem pretty

41
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,090
disconnected from the cure.

42
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,840
So ill, obesity rates are high.

43
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,340
That's fine.

44
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,970
Blame, we eat too much sugar.

45
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:01,450
The cure would be eat less sugar, not necessarily reclassify candy as a

46
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,610
non-food item.

47
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,025
So I took a swipe at it.

48
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:04,890
And I say, all right.

49
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,520
Let's redefine the ill here.

50
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,889
Candy contributes to obesity and obesity costs in Washington State are

51
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:10,770
exceptionally high.

52
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,610
So make it sort of a more local ill.

53
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,760
Have the general ill and make a local ill.

54
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,060
And then blames.

55
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:16,260
OK.

56
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,580
Well, here's where I want to say one of the contributing factors to

57
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,460
obesity, one of the--

58
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,370
not the only reason.

59
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:29,050
But one of contributing factors is we currently classify candy as a food.

60
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:29,220
OK.

61
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,350
So now I've made the blame something I can solve for.

62
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,880
It's not we eat too much sugar.

63
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,920
I can't solve for that in this speech, certainly in a policy speech.

64
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,130
So I've made the blame something I can solve for.

65
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,040
So therefore, we need to pass the bill.

66
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,750
And then talking about some other things under this in terms of

67
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,690
generating money for other health programs.

68
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,580
Then the calls to action remain the same.

69
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:53,590
But I'm trying to bring that cure and that blame into alignment, into a

70
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,660
congruency.

71
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:00,820
You could also take another pass on this and instead of making it the

72
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,300
blame, make the blame the ill.

73
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,760
The ill is now we currently classify candy as a food.

74
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,640
And as such-- consequence--

75
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,150
candy continues to harm health without paying for its fair

76
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,230
share of the costs.

77
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,540
So then I don't have to talk about blame, because I've made the blame the

78
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,560
ill, if that makes sense.

79
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,120
You can see it here.

80
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,060
If the ill is we currently classify candy as food, then we have to pass a

81
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,310
bill re-classifying it not as food.

82
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,220
Now I've got space.

83
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,640
I can talk through consequences.

84
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,160
Well, if we pass the bill, it'll generate money for health programs.

85
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,380
And it can serve as some type of deterrent.

86
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,910
This is always tough because you're saying both we hope the activity goes

87
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,380
down but while it's going down we want it to make money.

88
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,740
Nevertheless, then the calls to action remain the same.

89
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,510
But your first pass on this argument shouldn't be your only pass.

90
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,370
The process that we talked about for your informative speech in terms of

91
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,300
this iterative way of generating and refining your speech should hold true

92
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,320
for your persuasive speech as well.

93
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,020
And one thing you want to think about is, are you solving for the blames

94
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,850
that you raise?

95
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,310
I run into this a lot.

96
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,820
People end up coming up with huge blames.

97
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:14,000
And then their cures are really small and don't really speak to that.

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,079
So one thing I sometimes suggest is start the process not with the ill and

99
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,800
trying to figure out what's the blame driving that ill, but start the

100
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,840
process with the cure.

101
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,210
What do you want to happen?

102
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,780
What are you pushing for?

103
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,020
If you start with the cure, then you're saying, all right.

104
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,350
Now I've got to figure out inherency.

105
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,130
Why isn't this cure in place right now?

106
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,740
Then I can jump back to blame.

107
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,620
Then I know blame and cure are hitting one another.

108
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,610
And then from there, I can talk about ill as sort of a general

109
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,940
way into the topic.

110
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,190
The sample speech that we'll look at the end of this week I think

111
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,600
illustrates this well, this congruency between these elements.

112
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,780
So I've run into people, again, doing various things.

113
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,700
And they end up coming up with the ill that they want to talk about.

114
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,150
But it's a big social ill.

115
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,690
And then what they talk about in terms of blame is massive.

116
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,430
Then they get to the cure and it's way too small.

117
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,930
So maybe start by thinking about what do I want to argue for what?

118
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,740
What do I want to see take hold?

119
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,870
And then write the blames and the ill backward and think forward to that

120
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,840
call to action.

121
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,480
Because odds are this outline will serve as a backbone for probably a

122
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,260
fairly manuscripted speech.

123
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,200
What I'm going to ask you to do next week in terms of developing style is

124
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,130
not going to be extemporaneous for the large measure.

125
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:31,150
So you're going to need a basic outline to write style into, develop

126
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,460
something that's oratorically moving.

127
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,580
And so that argument should be crystal clear in order for the style to

128
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,090
sharpen its impact.

129
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,850
So you should be thinking about how the speech builds to the cure and the

130
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,580
call to action, how you're making the case and getting us to the point where

131
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,760
that cure makes sense given the issues that you've talked and those calls to

132
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,090
action build on that cure.

133
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,040
So we'll take this up next week.

134
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,770
But I want you to have this very basic model of argument that you can work

135
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,030
with in various ways.

136
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,230
And check that thing for congruency.

137
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,420
Make sure all the elements are working well together.

138
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,670
