MATT MCGARRITY: All right, so now that you've watched that speech, I would

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,280
just like to spend a brief amount of time just sort of moving through it in

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,990
terms of our evaluation form.

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,120
Now, to some degree, what he's doing there is not exactly what we've been

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,550
talking about here, but it is as well.

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,890
He's raising awareness about an issue.

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,110
He's also laying out some things that people can be doing.

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,470
And I do think it's an excellent case study.

9
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,010
So let's go ahead and move through the evaluation form.

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,926
So under invention we've got the speaker discussed the ill, and blame

11
00:00:29,926 --> 00:00:33,140
and consequences if applicable, effectively and appropriately,

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,330
discussed cure effectively and appropriately, discussed realistic

13
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,030
calls to action effectively and appropriately, had congruent

14
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,045
argumentative elements, and used evidence effectively and

15
00:00:42,045 --> 00:00:42,830
appropriately.

16
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,330
Without a doubt, I just think he did these all excellent.

17
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,700
So if we move through his case, and this is more or less

18
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,970
how it was laid out.

19
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,335
But if we move through his case in terms of the stock issues, ill, he

20
00:00:54,335 --> 00:00:58,630
spends a lot of time in the beginning of that speech talking about ill.

21
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,420
He's got a very general ill, the problems related to mental illness.

22
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,849
And then he moves into a specific ill.

23
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:07,840
So we distinguish, and this is, I think, usually a savvy idea,

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,480
distinguish between sort of the general ill and the specific ill.

25
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,010
His specific ill is the lack of treatment.

26
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,620
So we've got all these global issues around mental health and then

27
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,950
specifically, we've got lack of treatment.

28
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,860
Then he moves through that to what's the blame?

29
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,650
So he's not saying what's the blame for global mental health?

30
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,150
But what's the blame for lack of treatment?

31
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,090
Well, that's easy, it's not enough doctors.

32
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:38,360
So once again, we've got an opening ill, a general ill as a way of

33
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,690
starting the speech, but it's not really what the speech is about.

34
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,300
You're getting to the specific ill and the specific blame.

35
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,380
That blame is what he's interested in, and what he can solve for.

36
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,040
So we move from ill into blame to cure.

37
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,020
So his cure is task-sharing.

38
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,560
The cure is not solve all mental health, right?

39
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,670
So it's not what that general ill was, but it was there's a problem of global

40
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,720
mental health, the specific ill is we don't have enough doctors,

41
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,440
specifically because--

42
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,669
we lack treatment, specifically because we don't have enough doctors,

43
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:12,210
and the cure is task-sharing.

44
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:17,130
Then he goes through and he explains in detail the effectiveness of

45
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,030
task-sharing with scientific studies.

46
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,230
So he rattles off these three studies that indicates that it can work.

47
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,730
Then he ends up talking about some consequences, another stock issue.

48
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,920
We've got material consequences, when he's talking about

49
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,980
the developed world.

50
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,940
He said this task-sharing can save money.

51
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,950
It can drive down health costs in the developed world.

52
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,800
Then he talks about a social consequence of task-sharing.

53
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,190
It's empowering.

54
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,660
It's a good in and of itself.

55
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,100
And then he's got calls to action.

56
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,300
Now, these are at various places in his speech, because they don't always

57
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,020
have to come at the end.

58
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,760
He's got a professional call to action under that sunder.

59
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,560
He's sort of laying out maybe what medical professionals can do.

60
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,420
He's got some social movement call to action.

61
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,110
So when he's laying out the movement for global mental health, he's giving

62
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,180
you a way of finding out more information, a

63
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,230
way of getting involved.

64
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,290
And then, of course, he ends with a very personal call to action.

65
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,620
At the beginning of the speech, he asks you to think about someone you

66
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,990
knew who might have mental health issues, and he ends by saying, reach

67
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,180
out to that person.

68
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:18,720
Do something.

69
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,740
Be an agent of change.

70
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,180
Make some change tomorrow.

71
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,180


72
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,860
So in those first elements, the stock issues and the call to action, are

73
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,550
just really well done, I think.

74
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,470
And then, in terms of using evidence effectively and appropriately, he has

75
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,550
an excellent blend of statistics, examples, and personal narratives.

76
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,770
And he really bounces back and forth between stories,

77
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,960
examples, and hard facts.

78
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,800
And so he's never sitting on any one source of evidence for too long.

79
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,520
The one thing that struck me here was that picture of that young girl at

80
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,150
around 4minutes and 20 seconds, probably merited a bit more

81
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,730
explanation.

82
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,230
He seemed to be pulling a lot more meaning out of that

83
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,680
photo than I could.

84
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,670
It showed this girl chained.

85
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,620
Well, I don't--

86
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,420
I'm not sure what the whole story there.

87
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,840
Certainly, maybe you could unpack that a little bit more, but still, it's

88
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,420
such a powerful moving image.

89
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,960
Then we shift down to arrangement.

90
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,250
Oriented the audience to the topic and the introduction appropriately and

91
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:15,780
effectively.

92
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,930
Most certainly.

93
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,990
Arranged the speech in a clear and compelling manner.

94
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:19,450
Yes.

95
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,430
And concluded the speech appropriately and effectively.

96
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,660
Most certainly.

97
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,420
So there's a good movement in the speech from beginning to end, right?

98
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,670
It doesn't lull really at any one point.

99
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,650
It's a nice movement overall.

100
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,340
And what I found particularly intriguing was how he transitioned

101
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,350
from ill into blame.

102
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,040
He did so through his personal experience as a doctor, right?

103
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,770
So remember we talk about the general ill of global mental health issues,

104
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:52,200
the specific ill of a lack of treatment, and then the blame of lack

105
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,870
of training.

106
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:58,300
Well, that transition occurs from ill to blame in his personal narrative.

107
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,030
He says, so I went to school, and I became a doctor, and then I went to go

108
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:06,270
into, I think initially, he says I went to go practice in Africa, and

109
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,990
what I was seeing was a lack of treatment.

110
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,250
So that personal narrative is that transition point, and I think it's

111
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:18,600
like we enter the river on the cure side, and we exit the river of his

112
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,510
personal narrative on the blame side--

113
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,660
I'm sorry, on the ill side and the blame side.

114
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,900
So I think that's an interesting way of structuring and arranging that

115
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,530
speech and and it works well.

116
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,350
In terms of style, his speech here is not really the same speech that we've

117
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,170
been working on, but I do think it is a good one for the end of this

118
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,810
particular week before we get into high oratory.

119
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,680
His style, certainly his ethos, is very compelling here.

120
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,990
And he has some good stylistic devices.

121
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,430
So early on, he does some good repetition.

122
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,690
So he says, you can think of at least one person, at least one

123
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,660
person, who has this.

124
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,330
And that's a stylistic device.

125
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,840
That repetition is having an emotional impact.

126
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,280
And then finally, under delivery, I think it's just a really nice pacing.

127
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,250
And there's a wonderful intensity in his voice.

128
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,450
He's not loud, but there is this persistent intensity.

129
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:13,290
And it adds to his ethos and it adds to the engagement of that delivery.

130
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,280
So in terms of the evaluation form.

131
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,450
Invention, excellent.

132
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,880
Arrangement, excellent.

133
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,010
Style, for what we're doing, we're going to be doing more high style, for

134
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,820
his speech here, excellent.

135
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,230
His delivery, excellent.

136
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:30,500
I think this is just a really nice way of demonstrating how you can use these

137
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,600
persuasive tools in a real-life setting.

138
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,160
In a setting where you're raising awareness about an issue and you're

139
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,080
outlining what can be done in general, and then what the audience can do

140
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,110
specifically.

141
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,480
So continue your discussion of the speech in the discussion forums,

142
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,770
continue to work on your persuasive speeches, and I'll see you next week.

143
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,020
