SPEAKER: I&#39;d like to take a little bit of time and talk about rhetoric.

1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,840
So my MA and PhD are in communication.

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,210
But I identify with rhetoric, I am a rhetorician.

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,060
And that&#39;s why I&#39;d like to talk to this--

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,600
not just to correct some false impressions, though,

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,500
that&#39;s a good thing.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,910
But because the way in which we&#39;re going to study public speaking in this

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,620
class is going to be from the rhetorical tradition.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,240
And I want to take some time just to make sure that we&#39;re

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,130
all on the same page.

10
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,430
That I&#39;ve clarified definition, that I&#39;ve talked about how this is going to

11
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,180
shape our time together.

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,430
Now to begin with, rhetoric has a wide range of definitions.

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,670
We&#39;ve had the term for millennia and in fact, there&#39;s compelling

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,510
scholarship that indicates Plato was the very first person to

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,100
coin the term rhetoric.

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,650
And rhetoric is something that is of key concern for Plato.

17
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,270
Not always the biggest fan he was of rhetoric.

18
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,280
But in one of his works, he defines rhetoric as the art of winning the

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,290
soul by discourse.

20
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,430
Now, his student Aristotle would define rhetoric as the faculty of

21
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,870
discovering in any particular case the available means of persuasion.

22
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:10,310
So here it&#39;s sort of an ability to see all the possible paths one might take

23
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,480
in crafting a speech or crafting an act of persuasion.

24
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,540
Quintillion, a Roman rhetorician, defined rhetoric as that thing that

25
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,900
happens, this event that occurs when the good person speaks well.

26
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,840
There&#39;s this nobility to it.

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,060
That nobility is very much absent in one of John Lockes definitions of

28
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,770
rhetoric, as a powerful instrument of error and deceit.

29
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,160
Now, a more recent definition of rhetoric comes from a modern

30
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,770
rhetorician.

31
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,180
By modern, I mean alive.

32
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,930
Gerard Hauser who says, rhetoric is communication that attempts to

33
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,980
coordinate social action.

34
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,880
Its goal is to influence human choices on specific matters that require

35
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,550
immediate attention.

36
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:57,180
So it&#39;s about being able to draw things together, really with an eye

37
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,760
towards decision making, influence.

38
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,130
So in some ways I&#39;m going to duck this issue.

39
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,690
I&#39;m not going to define rhetoric.

40
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,449
Or at the very least, what I&#39;m going to say is the rhetorical tradition

41
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:13,160
helps us in our study of the art of public speaking.

42
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,390
And I choose the term art here very deliberately.

43
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,650
There are certainly lots of social scientific work that&#39;s gone in to

44
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,960
studying public speaking.

45
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,990
But as a performance skill, I want to look at this as an art.

46
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:31,640
And in that way again borrowing from the rhetorical tradition, we can study

47
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,330
an art through instruction, imitation, and practice.

48
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,990
Each one of these is different, but very important.

49
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,980
So in terms of instruction, well, we&#39;ll study principles of

50
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,150
argumentation, arrangement, style.

51
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,620
There&#39;s no need for you to reinvent the wheel here.

52
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,900
There has been so much research, scholarship, thinking on effective

53
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,090
public speaking.

54
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,430
That&#39;s kind of the space for this class, to be able to

55
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,060
share a lot of that--

56
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,700
the history of public speaking, as well as the history of the research on

57
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,760
public speaking.

58
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,580
So that there&#39;s a space for instruction.

59
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,190
But then we also want to look at imitation.

60
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:10,520
And in any sort of skill and certainly in public speaking, we benefit by

61
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,820
identifying, and imitating some of the best practices of skilled speakers.

62
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,060
And I&#39;m not talking about stealing or plagiarizing here.

63
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,090
So it&#39;s not like taking a line and claiming it as your own.

64
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,930
So you&#39;re not sitting down like, I had a dream, no one will guess

65
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,250
where that came from.

66
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,430
So I&#39;m not talking about plagiarizing or stealing.

67
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,730
What I&#39;m talking about is finding someone that you think is a good

68
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:40,310
speaker and often that you share some traits with.

69
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,430
And studying them and cracking open what they&#39;re doing in their speech.

70
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,222
So that you could borrow some of it or you can adapt what they&#39;re doing to

71
00:03:48,222 --> 00:03:50,200
your speech repertoire.

72
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,750
So really finding good models of imitation I think

73
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,250
is key to good speaking.

74
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,950
And in fact, if you remember a couple of lectures ago we talked about

75
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,390
rhetorical situations.

76
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,890
This is a really good way of sort of adapting to that.

77
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,640
Since rhetorical situations demand so many varied responses to different

78
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,560
genres, I want to find different models that have done that.

79
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,030
Or models close to me that I can look at and study.

80
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,950
So instruction imitation and of course practice, this is the most obvious leg

81
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,410
of public speaking study.

82
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,330
You have to put in the practice, that stands to reason.

83
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:28,140
You can go get all the instruction on public speaking you want, but you need

84
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:33,680
to be able to adapt that, internalize those ideas, and develop your personal

85
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,330
style that&#39;s really going to help you do well in those speaking situations.

86
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,500
And the nice thing about practice is, of course with public speaking you can

87
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,460
do it almost anywhere.

88
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,910
In many ways, this is the benefit of doing an online

89
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,870
class in public speaking.

90
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:53,030
I&#39;m going to often ask you in these lectures to practice something right

91
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,130
where you&#39;re sitting.

92
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,980
And so if you&#39;re really nervous about public speaking as many are, we&#39;ll

93
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,440
talk to fear public speaking.

94
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,760
But if you&#39;re nervous, this gives you the opportunity to practice with no

95
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,950
one else around.

96
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,770
And hopefully in getting that practice in, you can build up that confidence

97
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,870
so you can go in front of a live audience, and do even better.

98
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,530
So instruction, imitation, and practice-- these are some of the

99
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,290
things we inherit from the rhetorical tradition that I think is going to

100
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,710
shape, and help us in our study of public speaking.

101
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:26,100
In the next lecture, I want to talk about the basic steps in putting

102
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,840
together a presentation.

103
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,660
The basic steps in putting together a presentation, the canons of rhetoric.
