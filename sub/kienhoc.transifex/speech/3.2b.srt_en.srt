MATT MCGARRITY: So I've taken a lot of MOOCs.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,550
I'm in the process of teaching a MOOC.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,940
I've done a lot in terms of online education.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,300
And one of the big issues right now is where MOOCs and universities stand in

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,030
terms of course credit.

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:21,820
And one of the debates is, should more MOOCs be offering college credit so

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,410
that they can use if for transfer?

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,680
So that students can take classes for free, and then get credit for them at

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,760
a university.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,400
There are arguments for and against this.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,759
But I'm going to argue that yes, MOOCs should do this.

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,320
And MOOCs should do this because by offering credit, establishing credit

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,850
strengthens the quality of the classes--

14
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,410
strengthens the quality of the MOOCs.

15
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,520
And beyond that, universities can always reject the pressure that these

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,650
MOOC providers are providing.

17
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,790
So there's always going to be an opt out.

18
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:55,050
So let me return to this first idea of establishing credit can strengthen the

19
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,310
quality of the MOOC.

20
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,130
And in that, what I'm saying is that I'm talking overall

21
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,020
quality of the MOOC.

22
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,910
What is the MOOC doing for us-- for us as students, for us as universities,

23
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,630
and for us as professors?

24
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:15,110
Well, I think credit can really, by establishing credit, you can improve

25
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,350
the rigor of the actual course itself.

26
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,020
And by establishing credit standards, you can actually help

27
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,830
reduce college costs.

28
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:27,030
And so the overall quality of the MOOC for the class and for the users is

29
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,080
improved if you attach credit to it.

30
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:34,670
So in terms of strengthening and fostering rigor in the course, if

31
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,450
there is credit associated with the course--

32
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,990
and I say this from the perspective of a course designer--

33
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,950
and you're looking at establishing things that can be graded, there is

34
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,000
going to be an enhanced rigor to the design of that course overall.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,310
Certainly people who offer classes without grading can

36
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,710
have very high standards.

37
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,810
But I'm talking when we look at all the classes around, how can we foster

38
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,260
the most rigor across the most courses.

39
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,960
Credit standards will do this because you have to think more carefully about

40
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,150
exams, and the assessment of knowledge, and teaching to the

41
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,490
assessment that knowledge, as opposed to just offering advice.

42
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,580
So credit standards and asking professors to think more about how

43
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,980
this course would stand in for an actual college course will raise the

44
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,440
bar for all MOOCs.

45
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,340
And that will happen as a result of establishing credit standards, or at

46
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,650
least making it a priority.

47
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,350
Beyond that, having credit standards is huge to the users of MOOCs, because

48
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,900
it can reduce college costs.

49
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,480
I don't need to tell anyone watching this video right now that college

50
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,940
costs are going through the roof.

51
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,540
That's certainly the case in the US.

52
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:54,370
And we see this sort of having impacts on a global scale.

53
00:02:54,370 --> 00:03:00,160
Now if a student can take a MOOC and get college credit for it, that is

54
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,690
money that student has saved.

55
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:08,290
And if it is transferable, it doesn't cost the university anything.

56
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:13,310
Transfer credit is an established practice at all universities.

57
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:17,780
And if the transfer credit is MOOC, that means that that student has

58
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,100
gotten that education, developed that resource base, gained that content

59
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,760
knowledge--

60
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:28,980
but done so without having to lose out on meals or having to sacrifice some

61
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,840
type of monetary issue.

62
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,760
So MOOCs here--

63
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,410
and when I speak about the quality of MOOCs, I'm talking about their quality

64
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,720
as a course good and as a social good.

65
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,470
And credit allows MOOCs to be far better and far stronger.

66
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,050
So then I would move on to the second main point.

67
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:54,960
But you can see in there-- state it, explain it, prove it, conclude it.

68
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,650
And I feel this sort of organic relationship to all of

69
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,960
these various points.

70
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,890
So what I want you to do now is you try this.

71
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,480
OK.

72
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,160
And go ahead and take the claims that I already worked up.

73
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,180
So once again, you'll be arguing the second point here.

74
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,300
So MOOC providers should pressure universities to offer university

75
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,600
credit for MOOC classes.

76
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,709
What I want you to do is argue this point.

77
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,839
Universities can always reject the pressure, and say some colleges may

78
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,710
continue to offer non-credit MOOCs, so pressure doesn't mean

79
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,640
threshold of demand.

80
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,710
They don't have to do it.

81
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,630
So some colleges may continue to do this, and other colleges

82
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,950
may just opt out.

83
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,620
And that might be regrettable, but an acceptable loss.

84
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,560
Remember back to what we talked about in terms of standard of evidence.

85
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,330
But this is what I want you to do.

86
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:45,220
Now as you're doing this I have to admit, this is in large matter and

87
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,070
issue of feel.

88
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:52,210
I sometimes feel like in discussing claim and evidence, I've got two

89
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,850
poles, or Ive got two rubber bands here.

90
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,890
And I've got my claim rubber band, and I've got my support rubber band.

91
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,820
I want to talk about the claim, but I want to make sure I'm not too far away

92
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,850
from the support.

93
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,630
So I go back and I talk about the support.

94
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,390
But I don't want to be too far from the claim.

95
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,770
So I'm trying to pull these two things together.

96
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,090
It's this matter of feel, and you're going to want to be practicing it.

97
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,600
But a lot of times when people run these impromptus, or when they do

98
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,000
speeches in general, and I give them an outline like this, they say I don't

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,610
know what to say.

100
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,520
I don't know what I'm going to say any time I do any one of these points.

101
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,460
In the sense, I don't know what sentence is going to come out of my

102
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,270
mouth five sentences from now.

103
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,750
I hope it's bunny, because that would be nice--

104
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,750
sounds cute.

105
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,320
I but I don't know what it is.

106
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,560
Anytime in discussing claim and evidence, I don't know what

107
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,450
I'm going to say.

108
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,750
But I do know what I need to accomplish.

109
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,800
First, I got to make sure you know what I'm talking about.

110
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,640
Then, I want to get you ready for the detail--

111
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,270
get you ready for the evidence.

112
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,360
Then I want to go through the detail so that you understand its

113
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,820
relationship to the claim.

114
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,950
But then I want to cap the point, so it all fits together as a nice

115
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,450
bit-sized chunk.

116
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,740
So what I want you to do now is try running this exact point--

117
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,830
universities can always reject the pressure--

118
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,520
and do it with these two pieces of support.

119
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,570
State it, explain it, prove it, conclude it.

120
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,820
