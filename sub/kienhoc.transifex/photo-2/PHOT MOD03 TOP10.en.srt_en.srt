00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:12,570
Portraiture and identity
is one of the defining

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,180
characteristic subjects that's
being explored through

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,880
contemporary photography.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,480
The sitter, or the defining
moment in people's lives that

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,830
constructs their identity or
the things that they value,

7
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:29,189
has emerged in the last 15, 20
years as one of those topics

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,670
that people are exploring in a
whole range of different ways.

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,410
This topic is looking at that as
an inspiration and as a way

10
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,019
for you to explore photography
through either yourself,

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,150
through members of your
immediate family or friends,

12
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,379
or through a range of different
ways that you might

13
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:50,000
decide to look at portraiture
and identity as the thing that

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,210
matters to you as
your subject.

15
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,700
Portraiture can be a challenging
subject in terms

16
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,350
of the way you deal with
people and their

17
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,080
relationship to other.

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,690
Sometimes it's about the
politics of identity.

19
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,239
Sometimes it's simply an
image of a person.

20
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,930
But the way that you navigate
some of the history and some

21
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,780
of the relationships that
occur and existing

22
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,970
contemporary portraiture will
help you to work out exactly

23
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,789
how you want to make those
images for yourself.

24
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,995
The self-portraiture is an
interesting place to start

25
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,710
when thinking about your
relationship to portraiture.

26
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,970
Sometimes it can be simply you
in a room by yourself.

27
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,450
Sometimes it can be
you in a location.

28
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,590
But thinking more about what
it is that you're trying to

29
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,570
explore through portraiture
rather than the candid

30
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:36,419
capturing of a moment or
an event is a much more

31
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,510
interesting and engaging way of
dealing with ourselves as

32
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,880
that subject.

33
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,990
American photographer Cindy
Sherman is probably one of the

34
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,289
most famous portrait
photographers dealing with

35
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,790
that genre of the
self-portrait.

36
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,740
Her work specifically deals with
the multiple self and the

37
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,440
idea that we all have multiple
facets of the way that we

38
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,759
engage with contemporary
society.

39
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,380
She dresses up in a whole range
of different costumes

40
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,330
that change her identity, and
she re-photographs herself

41
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:09,359
again and again and again to
explore exactly the way that

42
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,710
we project ourselves and the way
that we then think about

43
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,100
others in relationship
to that projection.

44
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,829
In the links at the end of this
topic, there are a range

45
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,700
of different artists to explore
and look at, including

46
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,480
Cindy Sherman.

47
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,890
So I encourage you to have a
look at their work and use

48
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,179
that as a source of inspiration
for how you might

49
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,000
explore this complex but often
rewarding subject.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,980
A portrait is a study
of someone.

51
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,049
A good portrait will challenge
and confront the viewer, and

52
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,430
it will provide a relationship
or a conversation between the

53
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,520
viewer and the subject
or the sitter.

54
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,880
This image by Australian
photographer and artist Linda

55
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,670
Walker makes good some
of those devices and

56
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,239
communication aspects of
how we might deal with

57
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,380
portraiture.

58
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,430
In this particular image, she's
inserted herself not

59
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,280
only as a participant in the
photograph but also as the

60
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,460
photographer.

61
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,550
And she's used a range of
devices, including the mirror

62
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,220
and the subject themselves, as
well as her and the flash

63
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,950
going off to really create a
dynamic sense of that moment

64
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:17,350
and that relationship between
culture and ourselves and how

65
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,579
we perceive ourselves.

66
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,860
So what makes a good
portraiture?

67
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,000
Well, previously we used to
think of portraiture as being

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,640
a person and their face and
the way that they are

69
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,160
responding to the viewer.

70
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,490
And there are a whole range of
codes and visual language that

71
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,820
we can use in order to deal with
those kinds of things.

72
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,380
But sometimes a portraiture
doesn't actually

73
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,380
have to be a face.

74
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,230
It can be a position.

75
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,369
It can be a person.

76
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,090
It can allude to something.

77
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,100
There are a whole range of
different ways that we might

78
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,025
deal with portraiture,
and just up

79
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:50,900
here we've got a couple.

80
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,370
We can think about the gaze,
where the person's looking if

81
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,630
you do choose to focus
on the face.

82
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,980
We can talk about lighting and
look at the way that the

83
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,519
lighting creates that sense of
movement or that sense of

84
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,570
dynamic language between
the sitter

85
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,870
and how they're feeling.

86
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,350
We can look at the type
of lens that you use.

87
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,450
A traditional lens for
portraiture might be in

88
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,299
35-mill aspect ratio.

89
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,100
It might be an 80 to
a 120, for example.

90
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,050
Those sorts of longer lenses
tend to bring the subject in

91
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,130
closer to the camera.

92
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,630
It means that they
fill the frame.

93
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,050
The aperture choice that we
choose for something like

94
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,470
that, generally it's a wide-open
aperture to blur out

95
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,150
the background.

96
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,260
But again, you might choose
to do something

97
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,560
different with that.

98
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,160
The position of someone's
head is important.

99
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,090
It's connected to that gaze,
but also the way that they

100
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,549
situate themselves
in the frame.

101
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,080
It's often a standard convention
to centralise the

102
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,979
sitter in the frame.

103
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,100
However, you don't necessarily
need to do that.

104
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,760
If they're looking off
to the side, we've

105
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,020
got space in front.

106
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,650
We've got space behind.

107
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,950
That's always an interesting
thing to experiment with.

108
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,090
The distance of the camera,
again that creates that

109
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:04,960
relationship.

110
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,560
So you might want to
be further away.

111
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,600
You might want to
be closer in.

112
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,990
It's an interesting concept,
that camera distance, because

113
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,870
the closer you are to a sitter,
the more they feel

114
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,100
like they're part
of that scene.

115
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,960
But sometimes it can be
quite intimidating.

116
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,340
Critical focus is
the final point.

117
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,810
The area that you focus on is
obviously really important.

118
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,420
And the code generally is that
you might focus on the eyes.

119
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,040
However, you could choose
anywhere within that frame to

120
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,630
set that plane of focus.

121
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,690
If you're looking for different
ways that you might

122
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,969
experiment with portraiture in
relation to these things and

123
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,200
others, sometimes it's great to
just get onto a website and

124
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,860
try and find as many portraits
that you can see.

125
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,700
Something like Flickr is
often useful for this

126
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,200
with a keyword search.

127
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,550
But some of the artists that
I've listed throughout these

128
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,300
topics, a lot of them deal
with portraiture.

129
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,940
And experimenting and looking
at the way that they've done

130
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,240
these things is often a
good place to start.

131
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,070
Another interesting aspect of
contemporary portraiture is

132
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,620
this exploration of narrative
and the intimate lives, the

133
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,770
storytelling that can take place
through peering into the

134
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,510
way that people live
their daily lives.

135
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,719
Australian artist Darren
Sylvester, here in Who You

136
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,280
Are, or How I Met You, I Don't
Know from 2007, takes that

137
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,010
idea of the portraiture and is
quite playful in the way he

138
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,380
delivers that.

139
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,250
The subject is in reverse, so
we, as viewer, are in the

140
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,630
point of view of the patient
rather than the active

141
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,830
participant, which
is the surgeon.

142
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,380
Normally one would expect to
be unconscious in a moment

143
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,580
like this, the positioning of
the surgeon in the frame to be

144
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,320
slightly off centre.

145
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,980
And him in focus versus the
other two being slightly out

146
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,280
of focus creates a visual depth
in the image as it is

147
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,719
quite confronting.

148
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,100
And then, of course, the
saturated flat lighting,

149
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,760
combined with the coldness of
the colour, really creates an

150
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,130
interesting dynamic in this
portrait that gives us that

151
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:05,080
sense of, well, who we are, I
don't know, but how we ended

152
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,849
up there is open
to suggestion.

153
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,090
Well, I hope you enjoyed Module

154
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,090
3, The Digital Darkroom.

155
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,570
And I really recommend that you
take particular notice of

156
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,700
some of the resources that we
have at the end of each of

157
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,320
these topics and explore your
photography through the eyes

158
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,310
of some of these other artists
that I've provided.

159
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,140
Also, I think a wonderful
resource for

160
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,022
you would be lynda.com.

161
00:07:28,022 --> 00:07:31,460
Lynda.com is an online tutorial
centre for all sorts

162
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,989
of software, in particular, for
Photoshop, so you'll be

163
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:39,040
able to access all of the
tutorials that you will need

164
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,610
in order to develop some of
these skills that we talked

165
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,820
about today.

166
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,280
In the next module, Visual
Language in Creative

167
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,039
Photography, we look at a range
of different ways to

168
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,210
explore some of the subject
matter that might be of

169
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,280
interest to you and finalise all
the things that we've been

170
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,489
talking about in the other three
modules to give you a

171
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,240
complete sense of how you might
take this and use it to

172
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,490
