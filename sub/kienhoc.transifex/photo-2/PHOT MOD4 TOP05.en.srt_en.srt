2
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:12,840
So by now, you will have been
exposed to a range of

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,530
different types of photography,
some artists that

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,890
we've been exploring and looking
at, and you will have

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,370
more of a sense of what sort
of photography exists out

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:25,150
there and how you might slot
yourself in there somewhere.

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,900
This topic, we're going to
explore the idea of what kind

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,869
of photographer am I?

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,830
As we go through life with our
camera, we often respond to

10
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,540
the sorts of things that fall in
front of us and our lenses

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,949
just happen to be there.

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,610
Whether it's the party, or the
kids at the beach, or the

13
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,680
pets, or family events, whatever
it is, these things

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,950
happen, and we respond
accordingly with our camera.

15
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,670
But what happens if there is
no event, no visitors, no

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,170
sporting moment that you
need to photograph?

17
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,230
What sort of things do you look
for, and what kind of

18
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,510
photographer do you become?

19
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,330
Artists are a great example of
these because they often have

20
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,660
ideas about what it is that
they're trying to explore, and

21
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,030
we've looked at a bunch of
artists over the last few

22
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,460
weeks to give you a sense of the
sorts of things that can

23
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,580
happen photographically, and
the way that photography

24
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,679
responds as a visual language,
and the way that you, then,

25
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,550
respond accordingly.

26
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,080
Some of the books that we've
talked about, and certainly

27
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,870
some of the books that are
listed in the resources, are

28
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,940
what we would call survey
books on photography.

29
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,370
Now, I've got a good
exercise for you.

30
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,790
Have a look at some of these
books if you can, and each of

31
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,490
them are divided up into certain
chapters, whether it's

32
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,699
the deadpan aesthetic, whether
it's portraiture, documentary.

33
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,200
Whatever those chapters might
be, each one of those chapters

34
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,000
contains a whole lot of
photographers in there that

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,800
explore photography
in different ways.

36
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,060
If you have a look at those
books, you'll be able to slot

37
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,560
yourself into one of
those chapters.

38
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,350
Then you can see the sorts of
photographers who are also

39
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,600
working in a similar way to you,
and they almost become

40
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,750
your friends.

41
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,370
They become your friends in
the way that you can get

42
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,060
inside their head, look at the
sorts of things they're

43
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,250
interested in, respond
accordingly for yourself.

44
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,960
You might not be able
to meet them.

45
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,270
They might be on the other side
of the world, some of

46
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,310
them probably even dead, but
that's OK because what we're

47
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,470
looking at is a way of exploring
photography and a

48
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,490
way of you determining the sorts
of things that you want

49
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,770
to photograph.

50
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,640
Quite some time ago, I was
struggling with the sorts of

51
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,149
things that I felt like
photographing, and I'd spend a

52
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,910
lot of time walking around
with a camera, shooting

53
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,130
different things, not really
being particularly interested

54
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,530
in what was coming back to me.

55
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,280
And I decided then that I needed
to go and search for

56
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,050
other photographers and another
artists who I could

57
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,660
have that conversation with,
and I discovered a

58
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,640
photographer who, for me, made
a big difference in the way

59
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,839
that I like to think
about photography.

60
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,970
Emmet Gawon is an American
photographer, and the way that

61
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:03,070
he explores his landscape, the
constructed world, his family,

62
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,940
the sorts of things that his
lens gets to be pointed at

63
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,079
made a real impact on
the kinds of images

64
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,280
that I want to make.

65
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,590
So if you're not sure, please
take this advice and find a

66
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,170
few people that you can have
those conversations with.

67
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,190
Now, the other thing that you
can do, the other way that you

68
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,970
can explore photography, and
this is quite helpful as well,

69
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,760
because photography's such a
technologically determined

70
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,810
medium, it does sometimes help
to explore photography as that

71
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:33,960
technology.

72
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,020
And so in the last few modules,
we've looked at

73
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,600
different ways of using the
manual features of our camera,

74
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,260
depth of field, aperture,
capturing moment,

75
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,570
reconstructing events,
using the camera

76
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,390
to make a new moment.

77
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,609
So you could explore that
technologically, and you could

78
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,850
start using some of
those functions.

79
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,510
It doesn't really matter what
you point the camera at.

80
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,370
It's just using the camera as
a way, as a tool, for you to

81
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,260
explore that photographic
frame.

82
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,100
There's an interesting way
that we can think about

83
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,880
something like this, and it
comes down to photography

84
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,370
being about more
than one thing.

85
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,760
So as a circle, if we start with
the visual up here, we

86
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,480
can move over to the
technological down here.

87
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,270
There might be a subject through
here, or it might even

88
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,909
be more broad than that, and
it might be a genre.

89
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,110
And the way that we think about
this is that you can

90
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,990
come into this circle
wherever you like.

91
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,400
Doesn't really matter, but the
important thing is that you do

92
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,469
cover all of these things.

93
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,530
So you might come in with the
technological way that we were

94
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,989
talking about earlier, but at
some point, you need to come

95
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,590
through the subject, you need
to identify that it might be

96
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:54,229
people or a place or an event,
and then you need to respond

97
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:57,380
to it visually and think just
about how it is that you have

98
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,260
visualised that with your
framing and the choice of lens

99
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,380
and the sorts of photographic
language that you're using.

100
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,219
Last week, I talked about
Frederick Summer and the idea

101
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,290
that, if you're always in the
zoo, it's probably because you

102
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,230
belong there.

103
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,880
Well, he's also quite famous
for coming up with a really

104
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,440
simple idea around where our
ideas might come from, and he

105
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,920
basically said that our sources
are the things that

106
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,200
happen to us.

107
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,020
So rather than be looking for
responding to certain things

108
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,169
that you're not particularly
engaged with, think about it

109
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,010
in terms of what your
source might be.

110
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,170
They are, quite often, the
things that happen to us.

111
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,420
They are, quite often, the
things that matter to us the

112
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,150
most, so use that as a way of
determining what kind of

113
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,419
photographer you might be.

114
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,957
