00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:12,660
One of the great things that
photography can do is it can

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,329
translate different ways of
seeing and allow us to see the

4
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,110
sorts of world that we
experience in new

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,560
and exciting ways.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,390
In this topic, we're going
to talk about some of the

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,370
concepts and some of the artists
and photographers who

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,780
have looked at exploring that
idea of the everyday, the

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,140
mundane, the object, as a way
of translating the ordinary

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,660
into something different and
framing the everyday to give

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,620
it that new meaning.

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,640
Some of these ideas can be
traced back to the 1960s

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,000
conceptual art movement where
the photographing and the

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,510
fetishisation of those ordinary
things made them into

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,080
these new objects of desire and
privilege and the sorts of

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,820
things that we want
one to value.

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,620
We talked about that idea of
creating a new moment.

18
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,300
And sometimes, just the act of
photographing something,

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,620
making it valuable enough that
it's what you want to spend

20
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,630
time imaging, turning it into
something new, can make for

21
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,240
exciting and new
ways of dealing

22
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,100
with different objects.

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,309
Sometimes, these things occur
on an abstract level.

24
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,520
And you can see in these two
assets that we have that the

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,160
sorts of things that are being
photographed here are the

26
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,929
sorts of things that you
might pass over as you

27
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,220
move through life.

28
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,570
But sometimes when you pay
attention, and you use the

29
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,229
device that photography
offers us--

30
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:34,240
the focal length, the framing,
the focus, the sorts of things

31
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,339
that our eyes don't do--

32
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,380
we can compose and construct
really interesting images.

33
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,920
Through the use of photography,
we can take those

34
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,510
moments and convert them and
translate them into special

35
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,760
moments that are worth keeping
and certainly those ideas and

36
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,700
moments that are worth taking
photographs of.

37
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,850
There are some wonderful
photographers around who have

38
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,410
used this idea of translating
the ordinary and taken it to

39
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,130
mean a whole range of different
things for their

40
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,240
subject matter.

41
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,479
German photographer Wolfgang
Tillmans looks at the idea of

42
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,830
authenticity and makes this
kind of interesting

43
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,120
correlation between the
photographer can do whatever

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,330
they want to what they see
in front of the lens.

45
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,650
They can frame.

46
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,090
They can have things
out of frame.

47
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,330
They can manipulate.

48
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,420
You can do all sorts of things
to the photograph, but what

49
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,510
you can never do is change
the intentions of the

50
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,519
photographer.

51
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,800
And sometimes, the actual
subject of the image is the

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,000
photographer themselves.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,130
How we see the world is always
a reflection of ourselves.

54
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,420
And that inevitably will
come across in the

55
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,290
photographs that we take.

56
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,359
Another photographer--

57
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,750
a really famous photographer,
Canadian Jeff Wall--

58
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,320
he uses the same sort of
devices, the everyday objects

59
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,680
such as a container of milk,
as well as the mundane

60
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,980
backgrounds that exist
in our world.

61
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,910
And he makes those translations,
turns them into

62
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:02,510
something interesting to make
a comment on how we exist in

63
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,530
contemporary culture.

64
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,560
So the mundane and the everyday
can be a really

65
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,350
interesting subject and a really
interesting way to

66
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,320
explore things that you might
never have considered.

67
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,769
I don't think it's
for everyone.

68
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,030
But I do think that it's quite
challenging to take a camera

69
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,370
and, rather than wait for an
event or wait for someone to

70
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,160
be there for you to photograph,
to actually just

71
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,799
walk around your own spaces
and the things that you

72
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,060
assemble for yourselves, the
worlds that you create--

73
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,350
whether it's inside your home
or outside in the street--

74
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,680
and just isolate and find
certain things.

75
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,770
And see if you can't photograph
them in unique and

76
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,020
interesting ways.

77
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,111
