https://youtu.be/-ziBKNm8QOQ

2
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:12,800
Digital images are significantly
sharper than

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,220
analogue images.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,000
The level of detail that modern
cameras can resolve in

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,040
a file is extraordinary and
allows us the flexibility and

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,689
the option to create all sorts
of amazing images.

7
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,710
But the acutance and sharpness
of an image is a really

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,860
important point, because
get it wrong, and

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,019
your images will fail.

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,120
Get it right, and your
images will sing.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,330
They will look amazing.

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:41,260
So in this particular topic,
we're going to explore some of

13
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,250
the debates around sharpening
and some of the ideas that you

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,150
might want to explore.

15
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,800
But also, I'm going to show
you a couple ways that I

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,989
sharpen and explain to
you why I sharpen in

17
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,620
the way that I do.

18
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,269
Acutance in an image is
a beautiful thing.

19
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,330
Acutance refers to the sharpness
of contrast in the

20
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,010
edges of our files.

21
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,230
So when we look at how we might
sharpen an image, we're

22
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,370
looking specifically at ways
to increase the contrast of

23
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,300
those edges as a way of
exploring different options

24
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,710
for spatial relationships.

25
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,050
And sharpening can be a global
adjustment, in the same way

26
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,450
that we looked at colour
correction.

27
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,330
And in fact, it should be
a global adjustment.

28
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,410
But it can also be a local
adjustment that allows us to

29
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:27,039
do pretty amazing things with
the way that we might position

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,890
certain elements within
our image.

31
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,370
Now, this is important,
something that I

32
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,640
need to point out.

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,070
Sharpening will not
increase focus.

34
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,139
If your image is out of focus,
no amount of sharpening in any

35
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,250
image-editing application
will correct for that.

36
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,060
Sharpening is about enhancing
the optical resolution and the

37
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,140
way that image was captured.

38
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,330
Something that's a little bit
ironic is that the tool we use

39
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,060
in Photoshop to sharpen
is actually

40
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,960
called the unsharp mask.

41
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,229
And it's called an unsharp
mask because it's about

42
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:02,990
looking at ways of edging out
that contrast and identifying

43
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,880
those edges so that
we can control

44
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,360
the amount of intensity.

45
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,060
So in analogue terms, an unsharp
mask used to be one

46
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,580
that would blur the edges of
our image so that we could

47
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,660
sharpen or increase
contrast there.

48
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,590
One of the questions that
we have when it comes to

49
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,040
sharpening and one of those
things that's a bit of a

50
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,709
debate is just how many times
do we sharpen an image.

51
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,510
I think we need to sharpen
three times.

52
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,359
Remember, when we capture a
photographic image using a

53
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,890
digital camera, we are actually
converting a readout

54
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,880
of the intensity of lights
on the photo cells.

55
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,290
And that's then converted
into those numbers.

56
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,260
So I think every time you make
one of those conversions,

57
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,910
there's a little bit of
loss that occurs.

58
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,100
And sharpening is one of the
ways we correct for that.

59
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,820
So when we first open
up our images, I

60
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,000
think we need to sharpen.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,850
And when we print our images,
different paper types rely on

62
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,739
different amounts
of sharpening.

63
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,480
So we need to sharpen there.

64
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,010
The last type of sharpening
that we do is actually the

65
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,269
middle type, which is when
we address those spatial

66
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,220
relationships with different
types of local sharpening.

67
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,609
So the first stage of sharpening
is about the global

68
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,340
correction.

69
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,950
And if you look at this image
here, you can see the before

70
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,829
and after of the two
spines on the book.

71
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,280
The before shot is the
raw file, taken

72
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,550
straight off the camera.

73
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,840
The after shot is where I've
applied a certain amount of

74
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,350
sharpening to that image.

75
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,980
And that difference is
quite astounding.

76
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,040
You can easily see just how much
clarity and definition a

77
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,390
small sharpening adjustment
can put into our images.

78
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,970
Now, for stage two, where it's
the local adjustments and the

79
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,590
sharpening for spatial
awareness, I'm going to show

80
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,480
you a bit of a video.

81
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,230
And you can see exactly
what I mean.

82
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,700
So in this image, everything
seems to be relatively clear.

83
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,220
The image is sharp.

84
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,560
It's being corrected.

85
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,590
The colour and the tone
is all right.

86
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:59,020
But the her Ned Kelly and the
his Ned Kelly outfits, they

87
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,370
just need a little
bit of clarity.

88
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,290
Likewise, the his magazines
and the her magazines--

89
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,260
they're so humorous.

90
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,420
It's such a funny scene that I
really want to bring up some

91
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,829
of that intensity and some
of that clarity in there.

92
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,570
So under here, I'm going to
duplicate that layer.

93
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,089
I'm going to call it a sharpen
layer or sharpening layer.

94
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:21,380
And then rather than use the
unsharp mask, I'm going to use

95
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,840
this selection here called
the high pass philtre.

96
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,560
If I set that radius, which
is defining the edge and

97
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,240
sharpening the edge to around
10 pixels, that's OK.

98
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,330
You can see all those
edges in there now.

99
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,719
Then I just need to change this
blending mode down to

100
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,350
soft light.

101
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,450
And I have a layer which
has applied that

102
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,360
sharpening to my image.

103
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,240
It's not a huge amount
of sharpening.

104
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,700
It's just enough to give us
that effect of what we're

105
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,430
particularly looking for.

106
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,050
All I need to do now is
put on a layer mask.

107
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,560
And I'm going to hide everything
on that mask so

108
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,750
that the image is
back to normal.

109
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,410
So the Reveal All, white;
Hide All, black.

110
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,510
You can see that down there.

111
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,520
So if we choose our brush here
and we select white as our

112
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,859
colour to brush in, then we
can apply or add in that

113
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,120
sharpening layer through the
mask and apply that density

114
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,450
and acutance in the him outfit,
in the her outfit, in

115
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,190
the his magazines, the
her magazines.

116
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,990
And just increase the overall
spatial awareness in that

117
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,350
particular image.

118
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,160
When I turn that on and off,
you can see the difference

119
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,440
that that makes just by simply
looking at that.

120
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,515
And you can see the mask there
applying that sharpening.

121
00:05:37,515 --> 00:05:40,550
If I come in and look at the
image at 100%, you'll be able

122
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,420
to see exactly what
I'm talking about.

123
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,760
So there's the sharpening
effect.

124
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,250
And I'll turn that off.

125
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,460
And that's quite dull
in comparison.

126
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,650
But it's just giving me
slightly more spatial

127
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,239
awareness so that when I look
at this particular image,

128
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,690
those two elements really stand
out off the screen or

129
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,500
off the print.

130
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,190
So the last stage of sharpening
is when we print.

131
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,120
The reason that we sharpen for
print is that not all paper

132
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,530
types are the same.

133
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,669
Remember that the conversion,
when we go from analogue to

134
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,920
digital, is the same
applies here.

135
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,800
We're going from digital
back to analogue.

136
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,080
And in this case, it's going
to be ink on paper.

137
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,150
Given that some papers are more
contrast than others,

138
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,429
some papers are harder,
softer.

139
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,870
We can print on beautiful
watercolour papers.

140
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,070
We can print on sharp, glossy
photographic papers.

141
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,349
So your choice of paper will
determine the kind of

142
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,180
sharpening that you use.

143
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,410
In this image, you can see
here I'm just trialling a

144
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,780
certain range of sharpening.

145
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,820
So I've used different
parameters

146
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,280
for the unsharp mask.

147
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,799
And I'm just testing to see
which one is most appropriate

148
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,300
on the printed surface.

149
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,230
When I've made that choice, I'll
then make a full print

150
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,480
with that sharpening applied.

151
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,032
