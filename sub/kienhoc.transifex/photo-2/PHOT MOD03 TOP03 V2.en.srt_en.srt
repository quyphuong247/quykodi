2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,710
The illusion of reality in a
photographic image is more to

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,110
do with optical accuracy rather
than it is to do with

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,540
tone and colour.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,680
When we make our photographic
images, we need to pay

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,530
attention to the way that we
might see the image when we

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,320
photograph it versus how
we see the image

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,300
when we make the edits.

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,090
This topic is about editing and
looking at the idea that a

10
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,460
photograph can be expressive
rather than factual.

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,700
In my practise, I have very
little interest in using

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,910
Photoshop to create
special effects.

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,199
I have no interest in the sorts
of things that get used

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,350
for the Photoshop
hall of fame--

15
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,640
yes, there is in fact a
Photoshop hall of fame, can

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,610
you believe?

17
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:59,250
But much more about how I see
the image and how I then want

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,910
that to be expressed or related
to my emotional

19
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,429
response, to the way that I
was feeling at the time of

20
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,080
photographing, or the sorts of
things that I was looking at

21
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,500
capturing at that moment.

22
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,730
This gets to the heart of what
is essentially an expressive

23
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,230
photograph.

24
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,030
American photographer Ansel
Adams, who we talked about

25
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,700
earlier, called this process
visualisation--

26
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,710
the connection between the
mechanical, the optical, and

27
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,110
the creative process to make
our photographic images.

28
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,390
Each step of that photographic
process is one step removed or

29
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,430
one moment or a departure from
reality from when we actually

30
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,510
saw that image.

31
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,450
I think rather than focusing on
the factual representation

32
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,530
of what we saw, photography is
much more suited towards

33
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,530
overlaying that essence of
creativity and that idea of

34
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,980
visualisation.

35
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,960
Now, some photographers
celebrate the idea of a

36
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,390
no-Photoshop approach to their
image making, and while that's

37
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,530
OK, I think at some point,
you'll need to work out what

38
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,229
your own methodology or way of
making your images might be.

39
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,300
My preference is that rather
than have extremes of one or

40
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,860
the other, that you actually use
what is most appropriate

41
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,930
for the particular image
that you've taken.

42
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,020
For me, some images have very
little post-processing or

43
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,410
editing involved, whereas other
images might contain

44
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,609
much more engagement and
much more of that

45
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,460
editing after the fact.

46
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,040
Emotional content is often
overlooked in images, and as

47
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,940
you'll see through this module,
that relationship

48
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,040
between your emotional content
and how you actually do

49
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,530
something is important, because
that then determines

50
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,530
the kinds of things
that you do.

51
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,610
Some basics to consider is the
idea of black and white, and

52
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,650
do you have any shadows
that have texture

53
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,610
and tonality in them?

54
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,500
Do you have highlights that
have the same thing?

55
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,310
And the way that good contrast
can create dimensionality in

56
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,340
our images.

57
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,460
And sometimes, that's
dimensionality that you might

58
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,350
not see when you were there,
but it's certainly how you

59
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,970
might respond to the image
when you're editing it.

60
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,500
An interesting comparison that
we can make here is that when

61
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,470
you're processing photography or
making photographic images

62
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,660
in a dark room, when you expose
the paper, you don't

63
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,600
see anything.

64
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,239
When you process the image, it
comes to life and emerges as

65
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,400
something that was hidden or
latent, and it becomes the

66
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,260
photograph itself which almost
surprises you and gives you a

67
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,950
new sense of passion or desire
for that particular image.

68
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,440
We don't have the same
relationship with a digital

69
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,000
photograph, because we're
seeing it on the screen.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,370
So we need to use different
kinds of ideas about how we

71
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,900
work with those images to get
that same sense of passion and

72
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,390
emotion in our images.

73
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:58,470
That can often involve a range
of things, including play and

74
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,180
experimentation and the way that
we simply respond to the

75
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,220
image as we see it.

76
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,180
It's also worth noting the that
I'm in no way advocating

77
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,210
a certain approach.

78
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,900
It's really up to you to
determine how you might want

79
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,040
to go about doing these sorts of
things, and you'll develop

80
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,410
your own style.

81
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,230
You'll develop your own response
and way of engaging

82
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,570
with your subject matter that
suits those images.

83
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,340
I think it's important to just
have a repertoire of technique

84
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,130
and to know how to do certain
things so that when you ask

85
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,490
questions of your images,
you're able

86
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,190
to provide the answer.

87
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,360
The tonal range of an image can
be measured in luminance,

88
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,290
brightness, and colour.

89
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,580
In &quot;Petra,&quot; you can see here
that the dimensionality of

90
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,210
that image is somewhat
challenged because it's going

91
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:51,469
against the actual depth and the
severity of the subject,

92
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,670
being a tunnel moving
through the rocks.

93
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,460
Now, tonal values and images can
either be heavy, or they

94
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,500
can be light, and the way we
distribute those values has a

95
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,700
real impact on the way the image
sings or moves through

96
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,300
the light and the way that
the viewer navigates that

97
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,600
particular image.

98
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,700
You can use both.

99
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,620
You can sometimes make an
image heavy and light.

100
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,360
It's challenging, and sometimes
it can be confusing,

101
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,530
but it can also bring
rewarding results.

102
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,710
Or you can predominantly focus
on one over the other.

103
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,650
You can lift the values of your
image so that people can

104
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,700
see right through the shadows,
they can move right through

105
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,640
the image, and they get
that sense of space.

106
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,950
In this other image here,
&quot;Fallen,&quot; the picture plane is

107
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:39,020
almost completely flat, so that
dimensionality is reliant

108
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,750
on the way that the tones and
the colours shift and push and

109
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,490
pull through that image.

110
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,720
The blur of the waterfall as
it recesses down past the

111
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,310
statute provides a sense of
movement that adds to that

112
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,810
dimensionality, but also the
framing and the crop of that

113
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,790
square, as tight as it is, means
that the highlights up

114
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,240
in the top right-hand corner
push the viewer straight down

115
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,540
that strong diagonal right into
the screaming mouth of

116
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,810
that statue.

117
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,900
The other important element we
have in our images is the way

118
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,070
that we use colour.

119
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,810
Now, colour values can
either be intense--

120
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,950
they can be strong,
vibrant, bright--

121
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,719
or, as the case in &quot;Fallen&quot; and
also in &quot;Petra,&quot; they can

122
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,690
be quite subdued, therefore
playing off that relationship

123
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,950
between tone and colour.

124
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,260
Raw processing is that first
step in the departure from

125
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,240
reality and our first step in
processing and working with

126
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,570
the expressive photograph.

127
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,790
The way that we set that up and
the way that we edit our

128
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,380
tones and push our brightness
around, pull our shadows down

129
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,710
if we need to--

130
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,409
way that we process that image
becomes that crucial first

131
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,770
step in how we might have
seen the photograph.

132
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:56,159
And again, this idea of working
with those sliders and

133
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,510
looking and seeing
what happens--

134
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,630
I can't emphasise that enough.

135
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,870
Even myself, sometimes I'll look
at an image, and I think,

136
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,860
I have no idea what needs
to happen to that image.

137
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,390
I'm just going to move some
stuff around and see what

138
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,479
comes back.

139
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,560
Now, within reason.

140
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,260
You don't want to destroy
the photograph.

141
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,510
You don't want to push it and
clip your highlights or remove

142
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,630
your shadows, but it is worth
trying some of those things

143
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:25,510
out, just to see what each of
those settings might do.

144
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,760
One of the ways that we can
think about our images and how

145
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,300
we edit our images is to
consider the two types of

146
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,230
edits that we might make.

147
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,790
The first one is global.

148
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,610
That's like, here's the whole
image, and anything that I do

149
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,300
is going to edit and affect
the entire image.

150
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,730
That's when we try and lift our
shadow values right across

151
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:51,580
the range of shadows, or it
might be we're making a simple

152
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,180
colour correction.

153
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,530
The second type of edit is
slightly more complicated and

154
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:01,409
probably as important, but
certainly more time-consuming,

155
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,640
and that is our local edits.

156
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,780
Local edits are when we isolate
pictorial or tonal or

157
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,270
colour ranges within our image
and edit just them.

158
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,549
So if you can think back to
&quot;Fallen,&quot; the way that I

159
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,530
photographed that image, that
top right-hand corner was

160
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,840
slightly too bright, so I had
to bring that back through

161
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,659
local editing, and I then had to
balance those relationships

162
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,790
up with bringing up some
of those other areas.

163
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,900
So the global edit is
the whole thing.

164
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,520
The local edit is particular
aspects of our image.

165
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,199
Method, the way that we do
these things, is a really

166
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,309
important part of
this process.

167
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:40,919
I like to think of there being
three ways that you can

168
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,380
consider method.

169
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,090
The first one is analytical and
precise, which means that,

170
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,795
as in the case of this image
here, you make a print, and

171
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,900
then you analyse the print,
and then you work out how

172
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,110
you're going to fix
those areas.

173
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,290
The analytical precise way is
usually helpful if you know

174
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,099
there are certain areas or
problems with an image.

175
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,660
The second way is
a bit more fun.

176
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,770
It's the one I prefer the most,
which is a kind of a

177
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,420
phenomenological way of dealing
with our images.

178
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,959
It's how we relate to our
experience of it, and it

179
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,940
involves what I was talking
about before, which is that

180
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,420
playfulness and the
responsiveness

181
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,719
that you might have.

182
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,440
And it's basically where you
might look at an image and

183
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,510
trial certain things to
see what might happen.

184
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,430
When you work like this, the
History Undo feature of

185
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,660
applications is definitely
your friend.

186
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,660
Sometimes you'll make mistakes,
but those mistakes

187
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,600
might lead you to other
discoveries that are

188
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,060
definitely helpful in the way
that you think about editing

189
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,829
your images.

190
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,950
The third way is responsive.

191
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,710
Now, responsive is quite
important, because it allows

192
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:53,490
us to look at an image and
identify through our response

193
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,390
certain things that we
feel need to be done.

194
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,220
It kind of links into the
visualisation process, where

195
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,240
you've thought about the way
that you might want to see

196
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,780
this, and then you've, in that
editing process, responded to

197
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,592
that accordingly.

198
00:10:07,592 --> 00:10:10,610
I don't mind which one you use,
and I use all three of

199
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,660
them, but it's up to you to
just work out what's most

200
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,699
appropriate for you and how you
feel you're getting the

201
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,100
best response from your images.

202
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,320
