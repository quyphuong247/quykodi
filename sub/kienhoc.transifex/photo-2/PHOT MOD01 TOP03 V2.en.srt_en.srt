2
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,200
So let's talk about light.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,709
Light does amazing things
to photographic images.

4
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,430
It's how we create shape.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,540
It's how we create texture,
dimensionality.

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,560
All of those things that we
experience in the world--

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,470
light is what makes that
a photographic image.

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,860
If you think about it, what
we're doing is we're taking a

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,970
three-dimensional subject with
depth and distance and texture

10
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,330
and feel to it.

11
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,540
And we're flattening that down
and making it a singular

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,519
two-dimensional image.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,000
Light is the way that we create
that dimensionality.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,730
Let me show you an example.

15
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,709
Here we have a relatively
simple subject,

16
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,050
just a tennis ball.

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,449
And you watch as we move those
lights around and we change

18
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,480
that relationship between the
light and the subject.

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,019
Dimensionality appears, depth.

20
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,000
The texture becomes
more relevant.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,530
And even if we can do something
like this-- an evil

22
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,709
tennis ball.

23
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,610
So light contacting a tennis
ball is a relatively simple

24
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,170
concept to understand.

25
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:13,220
And as we change those angles,
different shapes emerge.

26
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,250
But what happens when light hits
something more complex?

27
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,020
What happens when light's
reflecting

28
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,429
off different objects?

29
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,530
I've got another short
video to show you.

30
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,100
And you can see just what
happens as the sun

31
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,899
rises over a valley.

32
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,090
So the absence of sunlight
looks like this.

33
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,970
And as light emerges as the
sun rises over the valley,

34
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,670
different things start
to happen.

35
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,120
The temperature changes.

36
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,870
The light becomes warmer.

37
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,150
As the sun directly hits the
valley, you can start to see

38
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,760
more contrast.

39
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,960
Those trees become
more dynamic.

40
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,039
The shape of them starts to
appear more structurally.

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,840
And the sky starts to
give us much more

42
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,060
detail in that image.

43
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,040
Despite being a creative medium,
photography also has a

44
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,620
series of rules that we need to
understand in order to make

45
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,260
sure we know what's happening
with our images.

46
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,930
The first rule is that light
always travels in a straight

47
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,100
line unless we put something
there to bend it.

48
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,780
What I've got up on the board
here is a really simple image

49
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,600
of a tree, the light
from the tree

50
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,170
travelling through a camera--

51
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,140
in this case, without a lens--

52
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,929
and projecting itself on the
back of the camera upside down

53
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,440
and back the front.

54
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,260
Light will travel in
a straight line.

55
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,410
It's good to think about light
in two ways, or that there are

56
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,850
two types of light.

57
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,310
We've got hard light, and
we've got soft light.

58
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,080
Now, hard light and soft light
can come from the same source.

59
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,050
They can certainly come
from the sun.

60
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,590
It's just dependent on the
position of you as the

61
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,450
photographer and what time
of day you might be

62
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,959
photographing.

63
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,760
Landscape photographers will
always tell you, never

64
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,590
photograph in the middle
of the day.

65
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,210
The sun's directly overhead--

66
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,580
certainly in the summer--

67
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,560
and the light is too hard.

68
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,530
The shadows have edges.

69
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,570
The definitions on people's
faces become harder.

70
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,739
Highlights become
more pronounced.

71
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,080
And it generally provides a
much more harsh atmosphere

72
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,410
than at either ends
of the day.

73
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,190
That doesn't mean you shouldn't
photograph at that

74
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,940
time of day.

75
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,500
It's just worth having that
awareness so that when you do,

76
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,110
you know that the light
is going to give

77
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,000
you a certain effect.

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,180
Soft light, morning or evening
light-- or early morning,

79
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,830
mid-morning, and late-afternoon
light--

80
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,140
provides a completely
different aesthetic.

81
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,839
And it gives us a way of
thinking about light with

82
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,370
specular highlights.

83
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,500
It gives us a way of thinking
about light as being softer,

84
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,730
as being more gentle
on the image.

85
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,929
And it can create more
dimensionality because the

86
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,470
harshness of that light
doesn't cast

87
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,850
those strong shadows.

88
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,359
I think it might be worth having
an experiment with

89
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,000
something like this and
photographing the same thing

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,980
under those two different
lighting conditions and seeing

91
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,170
what that effect might have on
the way that you preference

92
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,420
one over the other.

93
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,624
