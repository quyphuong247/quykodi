2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,550
Photography, at its heart,
is a mechanical process.

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,360
Light and a device are used
to record an image.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,050
It's reproductive, which means
that multiples can be made,

5
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,950
and it has a particular affinity
with the way that we

6
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,320
create images.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,200
It's unparalleled with any other
creative application.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,460
Philosopher Roland Barthes, in
the introduction to his famous

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,650
book Camera Lucida, talks
about photography's

10
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,920
relationship to everything
else apart from itself.

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,840
He says, &quot;One day, quite some
time ago, I happened on a

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,320
photograph of Napoleon's
youngest brother and realised

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,870
then, with an amazement I have
not been able to lessen since,

14
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,599
'I am looking at eyes that
looked at the Emperor.'&quot;

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,240
A photograph of someone who is
looking at someone before

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,380
photography was invented is
a subtle reminder both of

17
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,760
photography's youth and its
genius, that the moment a

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,020
photograph represents will
always be in the past, has

19
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,050
only happened once, and is a
reference point for something

20
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,190
that is greater than the
moment it represents.

21
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,110
The eyes are one of the
core components of a

22
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,380
photographic portrait.

23
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,690
We're looking to them.

24
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,910
They stare right back at us.

25
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,250
Let's look at this image
of my friend Mick.

26
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,170
Look at the entire image,
the mouth, the scar.

27
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,960
What perception does
that bring to the

28
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,289
way that you respond?

29
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,760
What is his emotion, and how
do you respond to that?

30
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,850
Now try to look only
at the eyes.

31
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,710
Does this change
his expression?

32
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,619
Does it change the way that
you feel about that image?

33
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,630
Photography is all about
capturing light, capturing

34
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,429
light onto a sensitive
surface.

35
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,150
Now that surface used to
be silver emulsion.

36
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,460
Now we've moved into that
surface being pixels or being

37
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,169
transistors that record
information as pixels.

38
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,070
So digital photography
is still photography.

39
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,270
It's the same type of
image-making, but we have some

40
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,789
completely different options
about what we do with those

41
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,520
images and an expanded notion of
processing and post-editing

42
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,788
that we've not really had
before in the history of

43
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:10,948
photography.

44
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:14,550
In fact, that history of digital
imaging in photography

45
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,070
goes back maybe further
than you might think.

46
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,799
In the 1970s, NASA were
developing ways of capturing

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,020
images electronically so that
they could be transmitted back

48
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,520
from satellites and back from
different Voyager spacecraft

49
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,970
as they move out of our solar
system or as they move closer

50
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,490
to planets.

51
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,020
In the 1980s, that transitioned
into different

52
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,500
magazines and editorial
organisations using imaging

53
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,220
and using digital images to
remove blemishes, decrease

54
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,890
waistlines, and do the sorts
of things to people and the

55
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,790
sorts of things to photographs
that we now take for granted.

56
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,810
Now photographs that are born
digital have an interesting

57
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,520
relationship to the history
of photography.

58
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,900
You could argue that the framing
device, in and of

59
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,320
itself, is the very thing that
defines whether something has

60
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,780
a value of truth attached to it
or whether in fact it is an

61
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,530
interpretation.

62
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,240
I think all photographs
are an interpretation.

63
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,430
You and I could be covering
the same event, and what I

64
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,140
point my camera at and what you
point your camera at might

65
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,029
be two completely different
things.

66
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,290
We might even point our cameras
at the same thing, but

67
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,489
the kinds of things that I
leave in or the kinds of

68
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,670
things that you leave out create
a different sense of

69
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,989
experience and define that
photograph in different ways.

70
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,760
I don't know whether these
debates are going anywhere.

71
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,829
I think the idea of photography
is really

72
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:45,020
important, but I think it's
all just photography.

73
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,740
Pixels provide a very
interesting way of thinking

74
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,110
about photography, and they
do give us a new way of

75
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:56,130
conversing and just asking those
questions about is it

76
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,810
photography and what
is photography.

77
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,600
I think that pixels are an
amazing tool, and they

78
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,400
certainly provide interesting
ways of editing images and

79
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,800
changing the actual content of
an image, but it's still

80
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,130
captured through a lens.

81
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,660
It's still light, and it's still
that sensitivity and

82
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,769
that photographic frame.

83
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,070
American photographer Robert
Capa epitomised that idea

84
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,120
about what is photography and
whether something has that

85
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,170
truth value to it in his
photograph of the fallen

86
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,770
Spanish soldier.

87
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,180
You can see this image
referenced in the notes, but

88
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,750
the moment that he captured
that frame has caused all

89
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,170
sorts of debates about whether
that photograph is of a

90
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,550
soldier being shot or whether
he's just slightly clumsy and

91
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,380
falling down a hill.

92
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,810
Those kinds of ideas, that kind
of reference, gives us a

93
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,020
whole way of looking at
photography that asks those

94
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,539
very simple questions.

95
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,050
Is it truth?

96
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,740
Does it reflect reality?

97
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,520
And just whose reality is
it actually reflecting?

98
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,580
French documentary photographer
Henri

99
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,550
Cartier-Bresson is famous for
his line, &quot;the decisive

100
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,330
moment.&quot; But the question now
is, whose decisive moment are

101
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,930
we actually talking about?

102
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,000
Is it real?

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,330
Is it constructed?

104
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,469
Is it in fact even composited?

105
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,670
What is that decisive moment?

106
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,000
These debates are quite
interesting in contemporary

107
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,020
photography, but when you think
about all the processes

108
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,780
that we now have, and when you
look at some of the things

109
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,700
that we'll explore in these
later modules, I don't know

110
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,719
how much that really matters.

111
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,660
And I think it's important
to just understand that

112
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,670
photography is photography,
light is light, and that is

113
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,920
essentially what we're
capturing.

114
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,473
