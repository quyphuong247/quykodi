00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,250
In this topic, we're going
to talk about a really

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,840
interesting concept in
photography that's related to

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,140
apertures and the idea
of depth of field.

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,160
In Module 1, when I talked about
shadows and apertures,

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,270
we looked at the effect that the
shutter speed can have on

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,390
the way that the image is
drawn on the sensor.

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,880
Depth of field is a
similar concept.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,949
It changes the relationship
between where you're focusing

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,065
or what's in critical sharpness
and the way that

11
00:00:36,065 --> 00:00:38,339
that's drawn on our image.

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,400
Now, depth of field
is actually an

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,110
optical illusion or DOF.

14
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:48,540
And basically, when you use a
lens to focus on a particular

15
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,040
point in the picture
plane, you can only

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,580
focus on one point.

17
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,000
And then everything that's
behind that or in front of

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,070
that, if that's us with our
camera, everything that's in

19
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:04,269
front of or behind that focus
point is in varying degrees of

20
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:08,840
sharpness depending on the
aperture setting that you use.

21
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,410
The choice of aperture
determines whether something

22
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:15,580
has narrow depth of field or
a long depth of field.

23
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,650
The wider the aperture, the
bigger the hole, the more

24
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,710
narrow the depth of field.

25
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:27,809
So an aperture of 1.4 or 2.8,
they're going to give us a

26
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,430
narrow depth of field.

27
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,040
So only a very small part of
our image will be in focus

28
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,020
from, say, there to there.

29
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:42,449
A small aperture, maybe
22 or 16, gives us a

30
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,570
longer depth of field.

31
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,300
So more of our image
will be in focus.

32
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,350
Depth of field is a really
interesting way of drawing the

33
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,990
image on your sensor.

34
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,130
And you can make all sorts of
interesting choices about how

35
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,869
you want that image to look.

36
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:03,010
For example, portrait
photographers value generally

37
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,900
a fairly shallow depth of field,
because they will want

38
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,970
that background blurred to put
the emphasis on the portrait

39
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,620
or the person or the main
subject in the image.

40
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,550
The reverse of that, say a
landscape photographer, values

41
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,590
a fairly long depth of field,
so that more of

42
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,260
that image is in focus.

43
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,600
So when you're looking at how
you might want to explore

44
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,299
depth of field, just remember
there are three ways

45
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,430
that you can do it.

46
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,740
The first one, of course,
is the aperture.

47
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,740
Change your aperture.

48
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,660
The second one is that we
can change the focal

49
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,940
length of the lens.

50
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,570
So for example, the wider
the lens, the greater

51
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,760
the depth of field.

52
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,329
So when people say a lens is a
landscape lens, it might be a

53
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,250
24 or a 28 or even a 35.

54
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,400
And a portrait lens,
they're talking

55
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,810
about the focal length.

56
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:59,580
And the third one, of course, is
going to be our distance or

57
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,150
the distance of the photographer
in relation to

58
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,080
the subject.

59
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,120
The further away something is,
the more that perception of

60
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,220
depth of field and more of that
illusion will be evident.

61
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,210
And you'll be able to see
more in that image.

62
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,380
To give you a little bit more
of an example of what that

63
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,230
relationship is between the
apertures that we set and the

64
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,040
optical illusion of depth in
our image, I've just got a

65
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,351
short video to show you.

66
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:26,540
You can see here as I change the
aperture on that lens and

67
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,510
simulate the exposure time
that more and more of the

68
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,130
information in this frame
becomes into focus to the

69
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,820
point where we can now start
reading labels on lenses in

70
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,500
the distance.

71
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,600
So now, you can see that when
you combine your knowledge of

72
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,329
shutter speeds from Module 1 and
now apertures and depth of

73
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,420
field that it creates a whole
new way of thinking about

74
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,410
photography and gives you some
of the tools and options to be

75
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,579
much more creative in
the way that you

76
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,380
approach your image making.

77
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,799
Depth of field is also quite
intrinsically linked into the

78
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,190
idea of landscape
image making.

79
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,250
And that's what we're going to
discuss in the next topic.

80
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,500
