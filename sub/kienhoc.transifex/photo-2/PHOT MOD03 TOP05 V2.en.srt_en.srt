2
00:00:09,572 --> 00:00:12,489
In this topic, we're going to
look specifically at Photoshop

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,140
and how it operates as an image
editing application.

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,350
I'm not going to teach you a
lot of things in Photoshop.

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,210
There are, well, there are about
6.3 million videos on

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,790
YouTube that you can watch to
learn how to do all sorts of

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:27,980
specific things.

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,160
What I will do though is I will
give you the language and

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,210
terminology that you need in
order to be able to follow

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,840
these things up, so that you can
learn at your own pace and

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,360
decide what it is that you
need to know more about.

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,019
Image editing applications,
like Photoshop, have the

13
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,480
advantage of allowing us to work
with that visualisation

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,209
process and complete our images
the way that we think

15
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,150
they need to be finalised.

16
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,080
Now, I don't think you need to
be an expert in Photoshop.

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,080
I don't think you need to
focus on all the special

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,160
effects and everything that
it can actually do.

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,269
I certainly don't know
those things.

20
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,080
I just need to know what I need
to know and how to do the

21
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,460
things that I want
to be able to do.

22
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,089
In this video, we're looking at
Photoshop's interface and

23
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,220
the way that it lays out
all of its settings

24
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,080
and its menu items.

25
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,480
The reason that we're doing this
is because I don't think

26
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,490
Photoshop is a particularly
photographic interface.

27
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,460
And it needs a bit of work.

28
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,509
The essentials is what
it comes with.

29
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,340
That's preloaded in Photoshop.

30
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,390
I don't think it's particularly
useful.

31
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,070
I've actually created my own,
which I call Fine Art

32
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,550
Photography.

33
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,630
You can see here that there's a
big difference between those

34
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,850
two main interface settings.

35
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,869
Mine has all of the controls
laid out that I feel I need to

36
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,550
see in order to work
photographically.

37
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,850
There's my navigator.

38
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,929
There's my histogram.

39
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,290
Underneath my histogram, I have
all of the information

40
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,670
that I need in terms of the
data and numbers that

41
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,260
Photoshop tells me.

42
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,960
Down below that, I also
have my history.

43
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,570
And my history lets me go back
through certain layers and

44
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,720
levels to make different changes
as I need to work

45
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,610
across the image.

46
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,400
Down here, I have
all of my tools.

47
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,500
Each of those allow me to do
local adjustments, such as

48
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,200
painting in different effects or
editing out or brushing out

49
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,769
certain imperfections that
my image might contain.

50
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,370
Each of these tools are
quite important.

51
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,140
And we should make sure that we
know what each of those do

52
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,290
as we work through.

53
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,480
The Zoom tool here, obviously,
takes me into one image pixel

54
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,899
equals one screen
pixel or 100%.

55
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,900
A nice little shortcut there--
the hand tool, double-click

56
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,230
back, so we can see the entire
image on the screen.

57
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,940
Now, here's the important
thing.

58
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,890
Over on the other side, I have
my properties, which tells me

59
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,230
what is acting at that
particular time, in this case,

60
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,890
a curve adjustment layer,
so that I can see what's

61
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,399
happening to my image as I'm
making the adjustments.

62
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,660
At the top here, we
have our menus.

63
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,440
Now, each of our menus allows
us to interact either with

64
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,050
Photoshop or with
our computer.

65
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,610
And if I choose the background
layer down here and then I

66
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,750
come up and choose one of these
particular options, for

67
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,450
example, maybe sharpen, you can
see that there are a whole

68
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,869
range of menus that I can
choose from down here.

69
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,150
Now, the important thing
is the dot, dot, dot.

70
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,500
Each of those three dots, any
menu item with that, means

71
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,370
that we have more options.

72
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,920
I can choose sharpen
edges here.

73
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,750
And I'm sure it's sharpening
the edges.

74
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,640
It tells me that it has
sharpened the edges.

75
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,690
But I have no control over what
is an edge or, in fact,

76
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,170
how much sharpening happens.

77
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,220
If I come down and choose the
Unsharp Mask, for example,

78
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,040
those three dots tell me that I
have more options that I can

79
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,260
interact with.

80
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,429
So they are generally much
better in terms of the tools

81
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,910
that you might want
to be using.

82
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,600
One of the things that is
awkward with Photoshop is that

83
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,910
there are multiple ways that
you can do the same thing.

84
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,100
However, there are two
distinctive characteristic

85
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,420
methods in Photoshop that we
need to be aware of and we

86
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,780
need to preference one
over the other.

87
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,770
One option is that it's
destructive and that every

88
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:14,580
single move you make is
calculated and fixed as one of

89
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,690
those moves.

90
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,360
The other way is
non-destructive, where you

91
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,800
build up your image through
using multiple layers.

92
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,340
And any point in that process,
if you make a mistake, or if

93
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,130
you decide you don't like
something, you can

94
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,760
always remove it.

95
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,750
Let me show you what I mean.

96
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,900
Here in this landscape image, we
can say some rather amazing

97
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,060
mountain ranges in the
background and some really

98
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,250
atmospheric moody sky.

99
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,110
Now, I think these ranges need
a little bit more contrast.

100
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,990
I think they could do
with some punch.

101
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,480
And that sky over there
certainly needs burning down a

102
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:45,900
little bit.

103
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,770
So there's a little bit of work
that we can do to lift

104
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,969
the quality of this image.

105
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,660
I'm going to use the Adjustment
menu over here.

106
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,110
There are my tonal
adjustments.

107
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,700
There are my colour
adjustments.

108
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,690
I'm going for Curves, which
allows me to plot a new map of

109
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,200
the tones in my image.

110
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,039
But look, the problem is that I
can't position that anywhere

111
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,260
on my screen without
having it overlay

112
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,849
across parts of my image.

113
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:17,030
So I can't really see the image
and the adjustment that

114
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,799
I'm making at the same time.

115
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,180
That's one of the first
problems with

116
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:20,950
working this way.

117
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,460
But we'll just have to make
due and see how we go.

118
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,049
So I'm going to drop
down the shadows.

119
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,870
I'm going to lift up
the highlights.

120
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,730
I'm going to lock
off the centre.

121
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,940
And yes, I now have more
contrast in my image.

122
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,290
The sky is slightly
more ominous.

123
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,770
The mountain ranges are
certainly more dynamic.

124
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,440
So that's, essentially,
achieved what I was

125
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,530
hoping it would do.

126
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,070
I click OK.

127
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,590
And then I'm done.

128
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,049
The problem is that at some
point, maybe it's next week,

129
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,240
maybe it's even a month later.

130
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,620
I might come back and think,
it's not quite what I wanted.

131
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,840
It's OK.

132
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,820
But maybe I've gone too far.

133
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,050
And I just need to pull that
back a little bit and readjust

134
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:04,970
some of those things.

135
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,390
So back to Adjustments.

136
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,460
Back to Curves.

137
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,080
But my curve is now
a straight line.

138
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,930
So I don't have the curve
that I adjusted.

139
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,540
I'm stuck with a new curve.

140
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,090
But I can just reverse that.

141
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,349
I can lift the shadows.

142
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,920
I can drop the highlights.

143
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,350
That seems to do what it
says it's going to do.

144
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,990
I can fix that centre point.

145
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,160
I turn that on and off.

146
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,470
And yes, I've reduced
the contrast.

147
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,410
But what I'm doing is I'm
reducing contrast on an image

148
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,270
that I've already increased
the contrast on

149
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,500
in the first place.

150
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,180
So it's not quite what I'm
really interested in doing.

151
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,940
It is, in fact, it's a
destructive method.

152
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,780
And it's one that I would
certainly avoid.

153
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,989
It's not what I would
recommend.

154
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,190
OK.

155
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,270
Let's do it the other way.

156
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,099
Let's go back in history
to the start.

157
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,380
And let's look at how we might
do this building the image

158
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,219
rather than reducing it.

159
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,280
So instead of doing the
adjustment on the image, I'm

160
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,210
going to add a new
adjustment layer.

161
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:01,840
Same thing.

162
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,969
There are more tones.

163
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,370
There are my colours.

164
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,130
I'm going to choose Curve.

165
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,180
I can even name it if I want--

166
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,510
Contrast.

167
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,240
Hit OK.

168
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,360
And then over here you can
see, first of all,

169
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,330
I've got a new curve.

170
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,909
But it's not covering
up my image.

171
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,990
It's actually a new layer in
Photoshop that's about to do a

172
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,150
very, if not the same thing that
I did before, reduce the

173
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,870
shadows, increase
the highlights,

174
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,670
lock off the midtones.

175
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,310
There's my contrast.

176
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,530
There's the ominous sky.

177
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,479
There is more presence
in the mountains.

178
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,980
I've done the same thing
that I did before.

179
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,500
Except this time, if I've
gone too far, the

180
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,960
curve is still there.

181
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,020
It's always there.

182
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,690
It's saved with the image.

183
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,540
I'm not reducing or destroying
the image in any way.

184
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,980
I'm building on it and adding
new information.

185
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,970
That's the advantage of using
this particular method,

186
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,930
whereas the other method, once
it's done, you've permanently

187
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,180
altered the original image.

188
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,676
