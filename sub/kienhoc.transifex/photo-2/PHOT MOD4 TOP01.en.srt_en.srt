00:00:10,148 --> 00:00:11,540
Welcome to Module 4.

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,000
This week, we're going to be
looking at visual language and

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,360
creative photography.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,520
Following on from last week
where we look at the digital

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,250
darkroom and ways that we
might be editing and

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,480
processing our images, this
week I'm working on the

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,950
assumption that you have a fair
idea about what it is

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,880
that you want to be
photographing and that you

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,490
have some of those skills and
techniques to be able to

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,739
extend your photography
further.

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,310
So now, we're going to be
looking at different ways and

13
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,180
different categories and genres
within which you might

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,380
want to explore photography.

15
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,620
This topic is all about lighting
and the different

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,129
types of lighting that we
could use, basically,

17
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,610
artificial lighting, which is
flash photography, or natural

18
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,000
lighting, which is the sort of
lighting that we are provided

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,070
with through sunlight
or indoor lighting,

20
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,790
whatever it might be.

21
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,640
There's probably a big
difference between natural

22
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,690
lighting and artificial
lighting.

23
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,130
The sunlight is a very
long way away.

24
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,220
And it's a massive
ball in the sky.

25
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,840
So it's incredibly diffuse.

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,690
And it covers everything that
we can see within our lens.

27
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,440
So there's not a lot of scope
for us to explore more

28
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,110
creative ways of dealing with
natural lighting other than

29
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,580
how we position ourselves, the
vantage point that we might

30
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,530
use, and the way that we deal
with the fallout of that

31
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,820
natural lighting.

32
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,009
Flash lighting is slightly
different.

33
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,330
The flash allows us to control
the amount of light, the

34
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,840
direction of the light, and
the way that that light

35
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,630
interacts with the surface of
what we're photographing.

36
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,270
A good way to think about it is
that if you're looking at a

37
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,899
scene and the lighting looks
like rubbish, there's a very

38
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,590
good chance that the photograph
will look like a

39
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,340
photograph of rubbish
lighting.

40
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:57,070
So you need to pay particular
attention to how you deal with

41
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,360
the sorts of lighting
that you might have.

42
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,300
Working with flash on
camera can be a

43
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,880
somewhat daunting process.

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,949
And if you're not used to
dealing with something like

45
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,400
this, that might throw
you out a little bit.

46
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,490
And there is a little bit of
a misconception that flash

47
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:14,060
photography always looks
like flash photography.

48
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,440
It's not entirely true.

49
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,090
If you get it right, if you do
it well, flash photography can

50
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,050
be as natural and as beautiful
as any other type of lighting.

51
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,190
So I'm just going to show you
a couple of different ways

52
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,600
that we can work with flash,
depending on the sort of

53
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,930
camera that you have and
depending on what sort of

54
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,630
ambient lighting you're working
with, as well as what

55
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,320
sort of effect that you're
looking for.

56
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,570
So this is just a normal camera
here with a simple

57
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,890
on-camera flash.

58
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,859
There's not a lot option
that I have here.

59
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,110
It's fixed.

60
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,900
I can't move it anywhere else.

61
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,800
Its relationship to the lens
is the same all the time.

62
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,630
And it's just a simple case of
shooting with the flash.

63
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,500
Here I have a different
sort of setup.

64
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,210
And this is a much bigger--

65
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,040
it's sort of a professional
flash.

66
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,870
However, it does give us a lot
more option in terms of the

67
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,290
way that we might want to
work with our flash.

68
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:11,109
We can bounce the light off
the roof, for example.

69
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,030
We can bounce it off walls.

70
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,220
We can use diffusers on here.

71
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,960
There's a lot more
manoeuvrability.

72
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,480
And there's a lot of different
ways that you can work with

73
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,850
this sort of flash.

74
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,470
The other thing is that it's
a lot more powerful.

75
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,380
And so you can have a different
range of apertures

76
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,240
that you might be able to work
with and, certainly, different

77
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,450
shutter speeds.

78
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,929
And some of the images that you
can see on screen as we

79
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,030
talk about this show you some
of those effects, in

80
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,390
particular, the way that you
might flash at the end of the

81
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,220
exposure and get that subtle
movement through the frame, as

82
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,000
well as capturing that
defining moment.

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,470
Also, if you're photographing
something like wildlife, you

84
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,270
can see there that a fast
shutter speed helps.

85
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,720
But the flash captures and
stills that moment in an

86
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,810
absolute fraction-fraction
of a second.

87
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,780
So if you want to work with
flash in a more creative way,

88
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,930
you really do need something
that gives you a lot more

89
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,890
option in terms of how you
might be positioning and

90
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,510
working with your camera.

91
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,679
There's one other scenario where
you might want to use

92
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,880
flash photography.

93
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,140
And that's if you need to fill
in certain parts of a scene.

94
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,300
In this image, you can see
that the sun is coming

95
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,709
straight at us-- we are, in
fact, photographing a sunset--

96
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,270
and that there's plenty of light
spread out across the

97
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,570
entire scene.

98
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,810
However, because of the shadow
and the position of us, we

99
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,190
just need to fill in part of
that scene with the flash.

100
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:35,090
So using flash as a way of
filling in your areas is also

101
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,700
an interesting way of
exploring that.

102
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,190
Now, there's something else
about flash photography that

103
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,730
might be of comfort to you.

104
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,500
Most cameras have
through-the-lens metering,

105
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,080
which means that when the flash
goes off, it cuts out

106
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,380
when it detects that there's
enough light.

107
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,960
So you don't really
need to be too

108
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,719
concerned about your exposure.

109
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,950
And you can actually get quite
creative with this, especially

110
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,960
when we're shooting digital,
because you can, of course,

111
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,010
delete the images that
are no good.

112
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,800
So try and work with flash
as much as you can.

113
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,660
Don't be scared by flash.

114
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,780
Sometimes people think it's
a bit intimidating.

115
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,679
Sometimes people shy away
from flash photography.

116
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,650
But more than any other thing,
putting a flash on your camera

117
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,940
will change the way that you
photograph different

118
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,080
environments and different
scenes.

119
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,760
For a great example of different
lighting effects and

120
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,360
the way that you can use
lighting effectively, you

121
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,150
could look at the work of
Australian artist Bill Henson.

122
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,620
He's quite famous for the way
that he creates amazingly

123
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,820
detailed scenes, depending
on what it is that he's

124
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,290
photographing, and the way
that he makes beautiful

125
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,110
reference to the lighting
effects of classic painters,

126
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,730
like Rubens and Caravaggio, and
the way that they paint

127
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,350
and the way that
they manipulate

128
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,070
a scene using lighting.

129
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,392
