2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,320
Now, for this particular topic,
we're going to be

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,760
talking a little bit about
exposure and that relationship

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,810
between our shutter and our
aperture and that idea that

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,930
when we control how the light
comes into the sensor, we get

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,759
to control the amount or
length of time, which

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,490
determines the accuracy of our
exposure and whether our image

8
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,870
is too bright, too dark,
or just right.

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,820
Now, I might just tell you
a brief story here.

10
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,180
When I first started
photography, my lecturer made

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,090
what I thought at the time was a
fairly outlandish statement.

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,700
And the old bugger said
that everything in

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,430
photography is a trade-off.

14
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,610
And I spent a long time trying
to work out whether that was

15
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,100
in fact true and maybe if
I could prove him wrong.

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,090
Now, he was right.

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,400
Everything in photography is a
trade-off, and especially when

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,200
it comes to exposure.

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,030
We have to make a choice between
our aperture and our

20
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,240
shutter speed to determine just
how much light comes in,

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,179
how long it comes in for, and
what is, in fact, the right

22
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,040
amount for us for that
particular setting.

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,880
So there's some terminology here
that's useful to help us

24
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,080
understand some of these.

25
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,830
Up here I've got some settings,
and if a focal stop

26
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,520
of f/8 at 1/125 of a second--
so my aperture

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,300
and my shutter speed--

28
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,240
if that gives me a correct
exposure, that means that the

29
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,830
way the light is rendered in
that scene means that the

30
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:47,730
highlights are highlights, and
the shadow are shadows, and my

31
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,330
midtones are midtones.

32
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:54,220
If I come down here and I
use the wrong setting--

33
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,030
for example, I keep the
aperture on f/8.

34
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,380
I use 1/250 of a second--

35
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:05,560
that means that the time of the
light is half the time of

36
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,130
what gives me correct
exposure.

37
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,090
So my image will be
underexposed.

38
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,040
That means that my shadows
will be too dark.

39
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,650
My highlights won't quite be
highlights, and my midtones

40
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,260
will probably look more
like shadows.

41
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,600
So that's not the sort of
exposure that we want.

42
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,609
Likewise, if I set it the
other way, keeping the

43
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,560
aperture on f/8 and just
changing the shutter speed to

44
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,300
1/60 of a second, that means
that the light hits the sensor

45
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,170
for too much time.

46
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,329
Therefore, the shot will
be overexposed.

47
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,990
The highlights will
be too bright.

48
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,840
My midtones won't be midtones.

49
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,640
They'll be more like
highlights.

50
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,299
And my shadows will be lifted
up and probably

51
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,040
look more like midtones.

52
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,459
So the overall image will be
probably too much contrast, or

53
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,510
it'll be lacking
in definition.

54
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,989
So for this example here, I've
left the aperture the same and

55
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,210
I've changed my shutter
speeds.

56
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,130
But the inverse would also
have the same effect.

57
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,420
If I left my shutter speed at
the same and shifted my

58
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,720
apertures, I would be doing
the same thing.

59
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,350
I'd have a correct exposure, it
would be underexposed, or

60
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,500
it would be overexposed.

61
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,950
Now, our cameras are very good
at determining this for us.

62
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,260
But when we want to get slightly
more creative, we

63
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,859
need to understand this process
so that we can have

64
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,170
some control over it.

65
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,799
Now, this concept might
take you a bit of

66
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,320
time to get used to.

67
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,540
And it's a bit abstract,
because it

68
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,730
doesn't really feel creative.

69
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,119
And it doesn't really feel like
it's about the camera or

70
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,880
about the thing that you're
photographing.

71
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,700
But it is at the core of what
photography is, and that is

72
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,149
getting that balance between the
time that the light hits

73
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,580
the sensor and the amount
of light that

74
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,610
comes through the lens.

75
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,990
Now, most of our cameras--

76
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,910
or, in fact, if your camera
gives you control over this--

77
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,440
it'll have some kind of readout
or some way of telling

78
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,609
you whether you've
got it right.

79
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:15,010
So up here, I've got a frame
from a camera, so let's just

80
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,010
pretend we're looking through
a viewfinder.

81
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,180
There's an image here.

82
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,950
We've got a couple of
settings down here.

83
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,409
The first one over here is our
ISO, and I'll talk about that

84
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,760
in a little moment.

85
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,650
This is our aperture
setting up here.

86
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,549
And I haven't put a number
in, because it

87
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,100
could be any number.

88
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,210
This is our shutter speed
setting over here.

89
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,680
Again, I've not put a number
in there, because it can be

90
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,820
any number.

91
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,840
Those numbers are dependent on
the kinds of lighting that

92
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,750
exists in the situation that
you're photographing.

93
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,710
Now, the camera will tell
you if you've got

94
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,390
that combination right.

95
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,870
If you've set an aperture and a
shutter speed that gives the

96
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,550
balanced exposure, it'll tell
you by having that indicator

97
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,390
in there being in the centre.

98
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,000
If you've got it wrong--

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,100
if you're either letting the
light come in for too long

100
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,610
with a wrong shutter speed, or
if you're letting too much

101
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,715
light come in or not
enough light come

102
00:05:11,715 --> 00:05:13,310
in with your aperture--

103
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,900
it will tell you or give you
some kind of indication that

104
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,560
that is the case.

105
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,030
And for this one, that means
that I've overexposed my

106
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,520
image, that I'm letting too much
light in or it's coming

107
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,650
in for too long.

108
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,250
That would mean that I'm
underexposing my image, not

109
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,020
letting enough light in or not
letting it come in for the

110
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,680
right amount of time.

111
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,120
So if you are going to
experiment with these numbers,

112
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,290
if you are going to try
different shutter speeds, just

113
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,500
remember one simple rule--

114
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,320
it's about compensation.

115
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,250
So if you're going to lower
your shutter speed and

116
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,530
increase the amount of time that
the light is in contact

117
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,159
with the sensor for, then you'll
need to reduce the

118
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,250
amount of light in order
to get that balance.

119
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,750
Likewise, if you want to use
a fast shutter speed--

120
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,130
if you want to capture someone
jumping through the air or if

121
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,920
you want to capture the
water coming out of

122
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,850
the statue, for example--

123
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,570
you'll need to use that fast
shutter speed, which means

124
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,390
that you'll need to let more
light in in order to

125
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,610
compensate.

126
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,350
So it's a trade-off.

127
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,520
You have to work out that
balance in order to get the

128
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,890
kind of image that
you want to get.

129
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,940
Now, there's one other number
or one other concept that

130
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,450
affects this relationship and
this trade-off, and that's

131
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,099
what we call the ISO.

132
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,140
Now, the ISO is the sensitivity
of the chip.

133
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,700
So each of our sensors have a
range of values that you can

134
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,020
dial in to determine just how
sensitive they are to light.

135
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,349
So most cameras, 100 would
be the minimum.

136
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,660
And then, it would literally
just double from there

137
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,780
to 200, 400, 800.

138
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,390
Some of them even
go up to 6,400.

139
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:05,539
And what you're actually doing
is you're saying to that

140
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,390
sensor, the light is lower.

141
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:13,724
Therefore, I need you to read
or to be more intensified so

142
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:17,140
that you can measure that light
in a different way.

143
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,270
There's a trade-off though.

144
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,930
There's always a trade-off.

145
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,500
The higher that number,
the noisier your

146
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,960
image is going to be.

147
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,140
We'll talk a little bit more
about this as we go on, and

148
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,240
I've got some examples
to show you.

149
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,610
But in this relationship with
the aperture and the shutter

150
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,180
speed and the trade-off, we just
need to remember that ISO

151
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,460
is our third value in there and
to be considerate of those

152
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,359
sorts of things.

153
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,490
Now, I've got an all-in-one
diagram that I can show you

154
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,820
now that explains exactly some
of these principles and what

155
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,450
it is that we're
talking about.

156
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,580
So there are four
values on here.

157
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,719
There's our ISO, which for
here is set at 100.

158
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,140
There are our apertures
up the top going

159
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,860
from f/2 down to f/16.

160
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,200
And there are our shutter
speeds down the bottom,

161
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,330
starting at 1/60 of a second
and going up to 1 second.

162
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,440
And you can see the relationship
between what

163
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,960
happens when I dial
in certain values.

164
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,390
The smaller the aperture, the
less light that comes in, the

165
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,190
darker the square there.

166
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,469
And the longer the shutter
speed, the longer the light

167
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,520
comes in, therefore,
the higher that

168
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,770
value on this chart.

169
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,835
And likewise with the inverse.

170
00:08:27,835 --> 00:08:32,260
At 1/60 of a second, the light
is coming in for a smaller

171
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,419
amount of time.

172
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,890
Therefore, we need to compensate
and give more light

173
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:41,419
to get that same exposure or
to get that same value.

174
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:45,650
Now, there's no such thing
as the perfect exposure.

175
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,660
The perfect exposure
doesn't exist.

176
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,730
It depends on what you're
looking for from your image.

177
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,300
Sometimes, those readings that
the metre give us, those kinds

178
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,750
of combinations, they
might not be right.

179
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,950
And we'll talk more about
that as we go through.

180
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,840
But just be mindful that those
three numbers give us a

181
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,990
balanced exposure, but it's not

182
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,240
always the correct exposure.

183
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,610
The correct exposure is how you
see the image and where

184
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,160
you want to place
certain values.

185
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,838
