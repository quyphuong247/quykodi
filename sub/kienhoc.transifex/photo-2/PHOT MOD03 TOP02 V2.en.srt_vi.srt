2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,350
We all collect interesting
moments just by going about

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,650
our daily lives.

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,820
And if we think about those
moments as the things that

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,560
matter to us, then they can
become our subject matter or

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,570
our subject that matters.

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,540
Frederick Sommer, in a famous
talk he gave at the Chicago

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:34,310
University in 1970 called &quot;An
Extemporaneous Talk,&quot; had this

9
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,370
to say about that: &quot;If you find
yourself going to the zoo

10
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,250
too often, it's because
you belong in the zoo

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,440
in the first place.

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,790
You're at home there.&quot;

13
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,620
Now neither Fred nor I is
suggesting that you go and

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,849
photograph zoos.

15
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,160
I mean, you might, but basically
what Frederick is

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,989
saying here is that the places
that you feel most comfortable

17
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:00,380
doing the things that you do
most often are generally the

18
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,420
things that matter
to you the most.

19
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,860
So if you're not certain or if
you're unsure a little bit

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,210
about the kinds of things
you might want to be

21
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,929
photographing, think about the
sorts of places you visit the

22
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,820
most, the people that you
respond to well, and the sorts

23
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,979
of activities that engage you
more than anything else.

24
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,180
And that's probably the subject
that matters to you.

25
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,410
Finding a subject is a creative
act in and of itself.

26
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,860
The way that we go through our
world, we have certain

27
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,900
experiences, and those
experiences become the things

28
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,190
that we value.

29
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,840
And therefore, they're the kinds
of things that we might

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,820
want to be photographing.

31
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,589
Photography is such as a
vernacular activity.

32
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,970
There's so many photographs out
there that you might be

33
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,890
fooled into thinking that
there's nothing left to

34
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,230
photograph.

35
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,690
That's not true.

36
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,840
You photograph the sorts of
things that you want to

37
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,630
photograph because it's related
to the experiences

38
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,310
that you have.

39
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,360
In this topic, I'm going to give
you some ideas of how to

40
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,900
find the sorts of subjects that
you might be interested

41
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,880
in and how to then relate that
to the kinds of photographs

42
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,000
that you might want to take.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,020
Now photography is a
technologically determined

44
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,940
medium, and I'm a firm believer
that the more you

45
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,200
know how to use the mechanical
and the digital aspects of

46
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,119
your camera, the greater your
scope for creating and making

47
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,570
the sorts of photographs
that you want to take.

48
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,130
Our first subject can be the
external subject, and it can

49
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:36,440
literally mean either outside or
it can mean places that we

50
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,260
visit and places that we see
in our everyday life.

51
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,060
It might mean a walk
around the city.

52
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,420
It could even mean bushwalking
through a natural environment.

53
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,589
But there's a way that you
respond to things that live

54
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,725
outside, or external to
yourself, that becomes our

55
00:02:52,725 --> 00:02:54,200
first subject.

56
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,359
I travel and photograph a lot,
but I'm a slow traveller.

57
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,900
I like to take my time, and I
consider the journey to be the

58
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,450
thing of most value to me.

59
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,850
So I photograph along the way.

60
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,090
When I'm looking for external
subjects, I like to have an

61
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,400
idea in my head about exactly
what it is that I might be

62
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,570
looking for.

63
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,320
Nevada Joe is one such image.

64
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,440
As I was travelling through the
desolate outback landscape

65
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,850
of Nevada, I was looking for a
particular type of image that

66
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,310
played on that humour of
civilisation just passing

67
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,590
through, rather than cementing
itself in a location.

68
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,790
And you can see here the sign
splits the image right down

69
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,660
the centre.

70
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,750
You've got the pink bar on the
one side and then the desolate

71
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,670
landscape receding off
into the distance

72
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,820
on the other side.

73
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,120
External subjects can also be
things that you discover and

74
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,650
that are sitting there for
the camera, waiting to be

75
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,040
photographed.

76
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,640
The idea of the tourist is a
cemented way of thinking about

77
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,079
subjects in photography, and in
this particular image here,

78
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,390
I was looking for something that
referenced the desolation

79
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,160
and the destruction of
that particular site.

80
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,930
And I wanted to make a nice
parallel between the car and

81
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,720
the engine interior and
the engine exterior.

82
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,610
But in this instance, I was on
a bus, and you can't always

83
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,560
get the things that you want,
and sometimes you simply make

84
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,770
do with the best opportunity
that you have.

85
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,479
Our external subjects often need
wide lenses or lens that

86
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,800
have a wider than our normal
field of view.

87
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,870
This gives us a way of framing
and composing images to fit a

88
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,750
fair amount of detail in there
and also to give an expansive

89
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,240
overview of the scenes that
we might be looking at.

90
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,350
Now the second category of
subject is the opposite of

91
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,760
external, which is
the internal.

92
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,110


93
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,970
When something is an internal
subject what we're essentially

94
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,120
referring to is our emotional
response to the things that we

95
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,030
see, but it also means how we
might have an idea in our head

96
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,159
and be searching or seeking for
certain topics, certain

97
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,670
subjects, that respond to the
thing that we're referring to.

98
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,580
Internal subjects can also
be quite reactionary, and

99
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,260
sometimes you come across
certain things that either

100
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,380
you're interested in or that
simply catch your eye.

101
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,240
Sometimes an internal subject
can actually be someone's

102
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,220
insides, as in &quot;Baseball
Player,&quot; shot inside a glass

103
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,440
case, inside a building, of
the inside of the subject.

104
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,250
An internal image can also be
one that has been planned and

105
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,750
meticulously laid out and set
up to explore a certain way

106
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,040
that you want to portray
or investigate an idea.

107
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,360
This particular image by
Australian artist Darren

108
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,780
Sylvester, &quot;If all we have is
each other, that's OK,&quot; from

109
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,789
2004, depicts a scene where
the idea of happiness

110
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:00,090
overpowers everything else and
that as long as you're with

111
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,979
your friends, everything
will be OK.

112
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,780
Now Darren didn't stumble
across this scene and

113
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,960
photograph it.

114
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,060
He actually consciously set
everything up, including the

115
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,700
lighting, including the
positioning, the makeup, the

116
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,990
KFC on the bench.

117
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,820
Everything is meticulously laid
out to portray exactly

118
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,870
that moment that he was trying
to reproduce as a way of

119
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,390
exploring the certain idea
that he was developing.

120
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:31,120
In this particular instance,
Darren had a remembrance or a

121
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,100
memory of enjoying KFC
with his friends.

122
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,700
Now as banal as that may sound,
what he was trying to

123
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,150
explore is that relationship
between friendship and youth

124
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,450
and consumerism and the sorts
of things that can sometimes

125
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:51,170
take hold of us in culture and
the way that we might respond

126
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,830
to something like that.

127
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:57,099
Darren has skillfully set this
up and used, most likely, a 50

128
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,170
millimetre lens to reproduce
the focal length of human

129
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,230
vision so that it almost seems
like we're sitting there at

130
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:08,730
the table with them and
participating in that moment.

131
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:12,970
Subject is subjective, and it's
sometimes elusive, so we

132
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:16,340
need to pay attention to the way
that we are constructing

133
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,200
or responding to the
things that we see.

134
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,622
