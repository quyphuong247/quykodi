00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,590
Welcome to module three,
The Digital Darkroom.

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,010
Last week, we looked at
photography's evolution--

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,330
in particular, that transition
from analogue photography

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,139
through to digital practises
and the way that image is

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,110
translated by numbers.

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,240
This week, we're looking at the
digital darkroom and the

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,590
way that we might be processing
and editing our

9
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,000
images so that we can get
wonderful results out of our

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,480
photography.

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,309
Now for this topic, I'm
just going to start

12
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,920
with a little story.

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,640
Several years ago, a student
asked me a pretty standard

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,730
question in a class, which is,
why don't I teach analogue

15
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:45,699
photography anymore?

16
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,820
Why don't I teach about
the darkroom?

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,850
Now, my answer for her was the
same answer that'd I'd been

18
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,670
giving for several years,
which is that analogue

19
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:59,170
photography had kind of being
relegated to a bit of a hobby

20
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,140
and that contemporary
practises were

21
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,740
predominantly digital.

22
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,600
So as a lecturer, my
responsibility was that my

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,970
students graduated with those
skills and that knowledge so

24
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,460
that they could work
in the industry.

25
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,940
But as I was saying it that
time, something sort of

26
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,140
shifted in my head.

27
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,560
And I started realising that
the way I think about

28
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,400
photography is deeply grounded
in the analogue tradition,

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,460
which is separation of tone,
detailing shadows, texture and

30
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,770
highlights, contrasting
midtones,

31
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,280
saturation in colour.

32
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,750
And the way that I made that
translation in my head and the

33
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:45,020
way that I made photographic
images digitally used all of

34
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,580
that language and used all
of those techniques.

35
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,475
And from that point onward--

36
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:52,550
I made that explanation in class
and thanked them for the

37
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,230
realisation that they'd
given me--

38
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:58,940
and I started thinking about the
way I make photography or

39
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,940
photographic images
quite different.

40
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,730
That legacy of the darkroom
also translates to the way

41
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,060
that we might even set
up a digital studio.

42
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,620
You can see in this image that
the wall behind the monitors

43
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,660
is black, therefore reducing
colour reflections.

44
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,630
And even the walls and the
ceiling are that neutral grey

45
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,790
to make sure that the light is
completely even and that

46
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,459
there's no other hot spots or
anything that's going to have

47
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,110
an impact on the way that we
see our colour images.

48
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,430
Within that relationship, there
are three things that

49
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,210
are worth remembering as we
consider or think about that

50
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,800
transition between analogue
and digital photography.

51
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,570
The first one is the obvious
one, and it's

52
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,650
always about light.

53
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,910
Photography captures light.

54
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,430
Our digital cameras might be
called digital cameras, but

55
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,550
they are, in fact, analogue
capture devices.

56
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,500
They measure light, and
they convert that

57
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,320
to a digital number.

58
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,560
So it's always about light.

59
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,540
The second thing is that, well,
for most of the time, if

60
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,410
you are making a print from your
photographic images, then

61
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,840
the print is the final output.

62
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,500
The monitor, as amazing as they
are, is kind of similar

63
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,130
to the projected image on the
baseboard of an enlarger in

64
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,930
that you're making decisions
on that.

65
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,220
But it's really the final print
that determines how that

66
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,609
image feels and how you
might respond to it.

67
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,850
And the third thing is that
photography is a physical act.

68
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,200
So even when you're taking
photographic images, you're

69
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,720
engaging with physicality of
yourself and the subject.

70
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,900
And when you're making
photographic images or in

71
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,050
editing photographic images, as
we will see in this module,

72
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:40,040
then it is still about that
hand-eye coordination.

73
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,890
In fact, Geoffrey Batchen in
&quot;Ectoplasm&quot; talks about the

74
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,700
relationship between the digits
and digital photography

75
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,290
and that digital photography
is, in fact, closer to a

76
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,560
creative act.

77
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,890
In order to give you a good
overview of what we're talking

78
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,079
about in this module, I'd like
to begin by giving you a brief

79
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,960
history of fine art
photography.

80
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,330
There are some key artists and
photographers through the 20th

81
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,450
century who made a real impact
on the way that we think about

82
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,060
photography and the art
of photography.

83
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,600
Beginning with the pictorialists
at that turn of

84
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,730
the century who really made a
reactionary shift against what

85
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,209
photography was prior to that,
which was very much a

86
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:27,110
scientific pursuit and sat
within the realm of scientists

87
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,920
exploring the world and
using photography as a

88
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,900
way of doing that.

89
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,960
And the pictorialists made the
claim essentially that

90
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,789
photography wasn't just a
science, but that it was

91
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,940
actually also a creative act.

92
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,870
Therefore, it had a relationship
to art that they

93
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,880
were exploring.

94
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,100
Now, the interesting thing about
that is that their way

95
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,310
of exploring that relationship
to art was to use the opposing

96
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,940
ideas of what scientific
photography was about.

97
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,700
So their images was soft.

98
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,400
They were slightly
out of focus.

99
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,630
Some of them were even
hand coloured.

100
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:08,280
And they began really exploring
those relationships.

101
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,390
In fact, they're affectionately
called the

102
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,900
fuzzy-wuzzy movement of
photography simply because of

103
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,150
that out of focus softness.

104
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:19,659
And that gave rise to probably
one of the 20th century's key

105
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,140
figures in fine art
photography,

106
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,090
which is Alfred Stieglitz.

107
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,070
And in the notes down the
bottom, you'll see some links

108
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:27,849
to his work.

109
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,070
And I recommend again that you
definitely have a look at some

110
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,830
of his images.

111
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:38,419
And he started that real shift
of photography entering into

112
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:43,280
the galleries in New York, and
he started that movement of

113
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,010
writing about photography in the
same way that people were

114
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,110
writing about art.

115
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,480
And probably one of the biggest
contributions that he

116
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,760
made through his gallery
networks and his own gallery

117
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,460
was that he started running
photographic competitions that

118
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,570
were judged by other
photographers rather than

119
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,550
other painters and drawers.

120
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:12,480
And so he began that idea of
photography as fine art.

121
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,680
And along comes Ansel Adams,
the great landscape

122
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,040
photographer of the
American West.

123
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,330
And he started exploring, in
particular, Yosemite Valley

124
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:30,070
and the relationship between
nature and man and the Earth

125
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,670
and that landscape tradition.

126
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:38,220
But again, also in opposition
to the fuzzy-wuzzies, he

127
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,290
developed a group called f/64.

128
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:45,580
And, as you would remember maybe
from module one, f/64 is

129
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,490
one of the smallest apertures
we have, which means really

130
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,560
expanded depth of field.

131
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,090
And so his photography--

132
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,349
and again, I suggest
you have a look--

133
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:01,000
his photography is all about
that relationship to the land

134
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,100
and positioning ourselves as a
participant in his images.

135
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,380
And as we move through the 20th
century, there are some

136
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,430
other key players who made
really interesting

137
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,870
contributions to the way we
think about photography.

138
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:23,480
And the 1970s was kind of a
key, pivotal moment there,

139
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,440
because that's when the
galleries and the major

140
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,070
museums and institutions started
running their own

141
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,570
photography departments, and
they were collecting

142
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,380
photography as art.

143
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:41,400
And probably one of the most
influential photographers from

144
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,060
that period of time
was Stephen Shore.

145
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,620
And he started looking at
colour photography in

146
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,080
particular and also the way that
photography can replicate

147
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,609
the everyday.

148
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,790
A lot of photographers
are quite

149
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,870
jealous of Stephen Shore.

150
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,670
His work was bought by the
Museum of Modern Art in New

151
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,880
York at the very young age of
14, the youngest person to get

152
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,420
work in that collection.

153
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:12,410
And he's sort of projected
himself as a major participant

154
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,410
in 20th century photography.

155
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,390
As we start moving towards the
end of the 20th century, the

156
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:26,320
Germans came in with Candida
Hofer and Andreas Gursky and

157
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,030
the Bechers and that very
formal, large-format

158
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,150
photography where all the
lines are straight.

159
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,260
All the pictorial depths are
sequential, and they were

160
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:43,590
really tight, very structured
images.

161
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:48,270
And that sort of gave rise to
the architectural photography

162
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,500
and the relationship between
the world, the way that we

163
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,470
experience the world, and the
hyper-realistic relationship

164
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,310
that we sometimes
have with that.

165
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,160
And especially if you look at
on Andreas Gursky's images,

166
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,270
you'll see that quite evident.

167
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,260
As we moved towards the turn of
the century and to where we

168
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,500
are now, fine art photography
has a real place in that

169
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,780
tradition of how we use
photography to replicate and

170
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,890
respond to the world
that we live in.

171
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,140
