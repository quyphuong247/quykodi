00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,050
This topic, we're going to look
at local corrections, or

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,950
those kinds of corrections that
redistribute time and

4
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,380
colour in our images to create
different sorts of spatial

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,230
balance and different kinds
of emotional responses.

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,570
So when we dodge and burn our
images or when we edit for

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,670
local contrast, the sorts of
things that we need to do rely

8
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,870
on us using a range of different
tools and a range of

9
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,540
different ways of working.

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,490
Let me show you a couple of
different ways that we might

11
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,030
be able to redistribute these
tones and the sorts of effects

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,690
that they might have.

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,390
Listen carefully to the kinds
of terminology that I use.

14
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,280
So rather than show you step by
step, what I'm going to be

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,700
doing, I'm just going to
describe the sorts of

16
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,440
processes that are being used,
and then you can, at your own

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,010
leisure, look those sorts of
things up on YouTube and work

18
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,370
out exactly how to do those
particular things.

19
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,239
The important thing, though,
is that we are looking at

20
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,120
spatial relationships, and the
way that we control depth, and

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,060
the way that we deal with light
in our images through

22
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,980
these local corrections.

23
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,880
So here we have an image of
a horse in front of some

24
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,699
mountains, and while the image
is globally corrective and

25
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,310
everything looks fine, there are
some things that we could

26
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,490
do to really enhance those
relationships.

27
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,809
In particular, we need to look
at those mountain ranges in

28
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:27,460
the back there.

29
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,259
They're lacking detail, the sky
is too bright, those trees

30
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,370
over there need a little bit
more presence, for example,

31
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,090
and then down in the foreground
area, we still have

32
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,850
some issues in regards to
density and the like.

33
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,759
So up here you can see the
layers that I've put in place.

34
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,060
This first one here just adds
light to the image, and it

35
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,240
makes a big difference to the
way that that's distributed.

36
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,729
Now you can see that, as I turn
this on and off, that

37
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,820
those trees are getting a lot
more presence in the way that

38
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,820
they're situated in the image.

39
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,500
Likewise, the mountain
ranges up the back

40
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,100
have also been resolved.

41
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,030
There's more density
in the sky.

42
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,110
It's starting to look like
a sky, even more so now.

43
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,300
Here I'm just making a little
adjustment to get more

44
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:19,230
saturation into the greenery
of those trees.

45
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,810
Here we have just some more
density in the solar panels

46
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,420
there, up in the sky
as well, gives it a

47
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,109
little bit more presence.

48
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,850
Now the only thing left is I
think that window needs to be

49
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,720
visible, and I'd like to see the
inside of this restaurant.

50
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,950
So as I zoom in, you
can see more of

51
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,549
what I'm talking about.

52
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,180
There's a reflection in there.

53
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,380
I'd like to see that reflection
come up a little

54
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,870
bit more, so I'm going to add
one more adjustment layer.

55
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,420
This one's going to be a
curve adjustment layer.

56
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,119
I'll lift up those values so
that we can see what I think

57
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,770
needs to be seen.

58
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,530
Then I'm going to, with that
mask, I'm just going to fill

59
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,375
it with black so that we can't
see anything in that mask.

60
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,300
So black hides.

61
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,600
And then over here, I'll just
brush in with white to reveal

62
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,644
the areas of that window that
will apply the adjustment that

63
00:03:11,645 --> 00:03:13,290
I made previously.

64
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,850
Then you can see quite easily
the difference that that makes

65
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:20,090
and how that lifts up the
presence of that restaurant

66
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,890
and the &quot;Open&quot; sign in this
particular image.

67
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,339
So there you have a building up
of layers to help with the

68
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,010
local adjustments.

69
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,660
When we do local edits,
I always recommend

70
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,320
the use of a mask.

71
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,310
Now the reason we use masks
is because they

72
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,850
operate on the layers.

73
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,579
And in the last video, you would
have seen that layering

74
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,300
effect and that each
layer had the mask

75
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,710
positioned next to it.

76
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,420
So there's a simple rule that
applies when we use

77
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,880
something like this.

78
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:53,269
If we're talking about
black, that hides the

79
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,380
effect of the mask.

80
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,210
So anywhere in that mask that's
black you won't see the

81
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,040
effect of the adjustment
that's there.

82
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,350
And in opposition to
that, white does

83
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,579
what we call reveals.

84
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,170
So it will reveal the effect
of that mask and of course,

85
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:13,540
black's down here, white's up
here, anything in between, any

86
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,740
shade of grey, will work with
different levels of opacity

87
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,220
and transparency so that
you can reveal and

88
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,290
hide at certain degrees.

89
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:26,430
So masks really are the way that
we work non-destructively

90
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,270
and masks are key when it comes
to working with layers

91
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,520
in Photoshop.

92
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,553
