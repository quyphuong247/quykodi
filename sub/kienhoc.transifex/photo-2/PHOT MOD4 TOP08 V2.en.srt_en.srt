https://youtu.be/sOqKfz2IU1s

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,850
There's a really interesting
thing happening in photography

3
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,410
at the moment that we
simply can't ignore.

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,100
The way that software and
digital technology is

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,100
infecting the photographic
medium is actually

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,860
not such a bad thing.

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,820
The way that cameras function
and operate, there's always

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,900
going to be some
kind of error.

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,239
The way that we can composite
and put images together, those

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,690
sorts of options that we have
now to explore dynamic range,

11
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,290
all of that's happening
post-production.

12
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,030
It's all happening in software,
and it's providing

13
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,710
an amazing way for us to
engage in photography.

14
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,890
Lens corrections is a really
interesting thing that's

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:47,870
happening now.

16
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,250
The ability to stitch multiple
images together to make, I

17
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:56,390
think the record now is a 320
million megapixel image, as

18
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,730
well as looking at different
ways of photographing multiple

19
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,629
exposures of light and
compositing that together to

20
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,730
create a really expansive
dynamic range.

21
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,110
It's opening up a whole new
world of photography that I

22
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,100
think we really should
explore.

23
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,600
Let's begin by looking at lens
corrections because I think

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,929
that's one of the
most important

25
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,880
things that we can consider.

26
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,850
In Lightroom 5, we can see this
particular image of Tammy

27
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:22,250
and how her face is ever so
slightly distorted, not too

28
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,490
much, not enough to be
problematic, but certainly

29
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,309
enough to warrant some
sort of correction.

30
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,770
And also in the corners of this
image up here, you can

31
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,420
see there's some slight
vignetting, which is simply

32
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,880
just light fall off as
the frame reaches the

33
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,399
edges of the image.

34
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,590
So they're the sorts of things
we need to be able to correct.

35
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,330
Under Lens Correction, it's a
really simple function where

36
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,840
we simply just need to look at
how we might load a profile to

37
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,330
make that correction.

38
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:54,045
If I turn that on, and you can
see what happens, before and

39
00:01:54,045 --> 00:01:58,030
after shows you that the image
becomes lighter in those edges

40
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,430
and it also corrects for
any barrel distortion.

41
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,270
But what's really interesting is
that you can see down here

42
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,680
that it's read the metadata of
my camera and loaded Nikon as

43
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,980
the make, or the certain camera
that I'm using here, as

44
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,480
well as all the other details
that I used to take this

45
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,100
particular image.

46
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,450
The other thing that it's going
to load up is the lens

47
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,810
that I used as well, in this
case a 35 millimetre 1.4 lens,

48
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,190
and it also then tells me that
that's the information that

49
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,560
it's used to determine the
corrections that are needed.

50
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,190
This is a really powerful
feature and one I thoroughly

51
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,280
recommend you all to explore.

52
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,070
What we just saw is the
correction of lenses.

53
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:43,650
All lenses contain some kind
of imperfection, right from

54
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,760
the consumer level lenses up
to the professional quality

55
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,320
lenses that you can buy.

56
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,579
In fact, in the 1960s, Leica
made an 800 millimetre lens

57
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,220
that was so expensive, as part
of their promotional giveaway,

58
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,660
they were providing a VW beetle
in the US to anyone who

59
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,109
bought that lens.

60
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,380
That lens would have had just as
many imperfections as some

61
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,780
of those ones we have today,
and anything that you shoot

62
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,320
will be benefited from
going through

63
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,910
that Lightroom process.

64
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,160
The other way that we can
use photography to make

65
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,700
interesting images is to explore
the idea that multiple

66
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,589
frames can be constructed
together to create

67
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,510
one super big image.

68
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,010
Usually for the purpose of
making panoramas, we can put

69
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,209
together smaller shots of the
one scene and construct these

70
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,820
mega, mega, megapixel
photographs out of lots and

71
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,230
lots of frames.

72
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,700
One of the ways that you can do
this is with an automated

73
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,339
tripod, such as the GigaPan Pro,
or you could even use a

74
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,620
manual tripod and
do it yourself.

75
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,020
The important thing here is that
we take a longer lens,

76
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,560
and we capture the scene in
front of us using multiple

77
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,630
frames to create those
bigger pictures.

78
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,190
This image here of the boat in
the desert was shot using a

79
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,400
Canon 5D 12 megapixel image.

80
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,890
It ends up being about 197
megapixels when everything is

81
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,600
stitched together.

82
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,680
You can see here that the white
image simply looks like

83
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,980
a white image.

84
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,340
As I zoom in and we go into the
100% detailed shot, you

85
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,800
can see just how much
information, just how much

86
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,622
detail we can get in
an image like this.

87
00:04:19,622 --> 00:04:22,520
This particular image could be
printed to be several metres

88
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,280
long, or in the case of online
imagery, you can use something

89
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,840
like this and create those
massive expansive photographs

90
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,880
that people can explore in
enormous amounts of detail.

91
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,400
I think if you do a search for
GigaPan, or specifically

92
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,479
follow the link to the Gigapixel
Project down below,

93
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,090
you'll see just how big some
of these images can be.

94
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,039
This is not for everyone, but
it's certainly an interesting

95
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,660
way to explore photography,
and it's certainly an

96
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,170
interesting way of looking
at how you

97
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,310
might construct images.

98
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,470
The last thing I want to look
at is this HDR photography.

99
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,250
The expanded dynamic range
that we can achieve from

100
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,800
photographing multiple
exposures, capturing different

101
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,620
degrees of light, and
compositing all of that

102
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,680
together to create one expansive
image that has light

103
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,910
from dark areas, over-exposed,
light areas that might be

104
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:20,210
under-exposed, and putting all
that together to create some

105
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,280
of these sorts of amazing
images that you can get.

106
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,719
And these are really unnatural
looking images in the case of

107
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,920
the one that we can see here,
or they can be composited to

108
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,500
make compensation for certain
lighting conditions where you

109
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,230
just can't quite get the
thing that you want.

110
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,910
There's lots of software that
can help you do this, and it's

111
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,140
such a popular way of using
photography now that some

112
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,930
cameras even capture HDR built
in to their sequencing.

113
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,200
So you simply set the frame,
press the button.

114
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,010
It will take the multiple shots
and do the exposure

115
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,240
compensation to give you the
sorts of information that you

116
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,200
need to create these
amazing images.

117
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,460
So there's three types of
photography that we can

118
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,500
explore, outside of the camera,
using certain types of

119
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,800
software to expand our notion of
what photography means, but

120
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,100
also create interesting and new
types of images that we

121
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,450
may not have explored
previously.

122
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,998
