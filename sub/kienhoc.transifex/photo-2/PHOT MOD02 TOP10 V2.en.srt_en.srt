00:00:10,084 --> 00:00:13,129
Within contemporary photography
in the last 30,

3
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,940
50, even 70 years, the idea of
landscape has formed one of

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,500
the grand narratives of how
people have looked at the

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,030
world and reproduced and
photographed the world.

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,810
Landscape is more than a
rendering or photographing of

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,160
a natural scene.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,100
It refers to a complex system
of ideas and politics and

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,200
economics and place that deals
with how we relate to our

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,550
world and how we experience our

11
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,890
movement through our world.

12
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,650
Landscape means different things
for different people,

13
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,030
but I think the important thing
to understand is that it

14
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,190
is not as simple
as just framing

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,739
something that you see.

16
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,810
It's much more interesting when
you have an idea that

17
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,230
you're searching out or seeking
as a way of responding

18
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,680
to that natural environment.

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,230
In this image here, Broken
Hill, I was looking for

20
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,700
something that referenced to
the name of the town, which

21
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,850
was Broken Hill, as well as
something that gave me an

22
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,970
indication of just how big and
how massive that idea of

23
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,590
restructuring the landscape
or mining might be.

24
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,180
So we now have this massive
cliff staring quite defiantly

25
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,470
back at us.

26
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,929
Landscape can also be a way of
looking at how other people

27
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,150
relate to the world, as in Mark
Galer's photograph here

28
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,380
where he's photographing someone
photographing someone

29
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,600
else in front of that iconic
Hoover Dam landscape.

30
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,030
Landscape is a culturally
embedded concept that has an

31
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,230
extensive presence in the
lexicon of how we deal with

32
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,590
contemporary art and photography
and the idea of

33
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,720
who we are as people
and the way we

34
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,400
interact with our world.

35
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,140
So I'm going to take you through
how I photograph a

36
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,480
landscape image.

37
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,750
You might have to use your
imagination here.

38
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,560
Pretend that I'm in front of an
environment or a landscape.

39
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,350
I'm looking for certain
things.

40
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,119
I'm looking for interesting
shapes and textures.

41
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,490
I'm looking for, in this case, a
sky that's quite dynamic and

42
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:15,990
gives me a sense of space and
an awareness of where I am.

43
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,780
And I'm also looking for a
little bit of detail in that

44
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,550
foreground so that I can
position the viewer somewhere

45
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,820
in this frame.

46
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,030
Now, I think tripods are
really handy for

47
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,320
this kind of work.

48
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,239
Again, it sort of
slows us down.

49
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,280
It becomes a little bit
more meticulous.

50
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,680
And it allows us to really
think about what we're

51
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,540
photographing, rather than
simply walking around with a

52
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,690
camera; going, oh, yeah,
that looks OK;

53
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:39,870
framing it; and shooting.

54
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,680
So I always use a tripod.

55
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,530
And I always position my
tripod like this so I'm

56
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,070
standing directly behind it.

57
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,489
I don't have to straddle
any of the legs.

58
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,450
I'm also using a lens hood.

59
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,910
Lens hoods are really important
to keep flare out.

60
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,410
For this particular
demonstration, I'm also using

61
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,299
a remote shutter release so that
I don't have to touch the

62
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,530
camera when I make the shoot.

63
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,720
Now, I use a tripod that has
geared controls so that I can

64
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,140
really accurately set
that in place.

65
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,100
And I also begin with my camera
centred on both axes so

66
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,470
that I know that everything is
parallel and set up the way

67
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,370
that I want it.

68
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,280
And then I just move it
depending on what it is that

69
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,710
I'm trying to look at.

70
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,750
So in this case, I just want
to bring up more of that

71
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,230
foreground, reduce the
sky a little bit.

72
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,489
And I'll make sure that I'm
horizontally centred.

73
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,570
So that looks pretty
good to me.

74
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,970
I'm quite happy with that.

75
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,350
I just need to set my focus.

76
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,890
OK, my focus is now set.

77
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,070
I need to make sure that my
aperture and shutter speed are

78
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,570
where I want them to be.

79
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,730
So in this case, I'm using a
fairly low shutter and a

80
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,510
fairly narrow aperture.

81
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,679
So I'm going to be using f/16
so I can get more of that

82
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,510
depth of field in here.

83
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,829
And now I think I'm pretty much
ready to go except that

84
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,600
the sun's just been hidden
by a cloud, so I'll wait.

85
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,530
I'll wait until it looks
exactly the way that

86
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,530
I want it to look.

87
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,330
I also set my camera so that the
mirror locks up before I

88
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,660
take the exposure.

89
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,159
That mirror flipping up causes
a little bit of vibration.

90
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,950
It's not much, but if I'm making
a big print, I just

91
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,380
want to make sure that
everything is as locked off

92
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,840
and as stable as it
can possibly be.

93
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,260
So I first trigger
the camera there.

94
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,780
The mirror is now flipped up.

95
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,750
So now I'm ready to
take that image.

96
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,830
I'm hands off.

97
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,020
Nothing's touching the camera.

98
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,760
There's no vibration.

99
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,530
There's my image.

100
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,440
The mirror's flipped
down again.

101
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,840
I'm looking on the back here.

102
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,479
I check my histogram.

103
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,510
I've got shadows.

104
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,580
I've got midtones.

105
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,010
I've got highlights.

106
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,700
That looks pretty good to me.

107
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,719
That's how I would take a
landscape photographic image.

108
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,840
So what makes for an interesting
landscape image?

109
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,479
Well, there's some codes and
conventions out there that you

110
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,580
can begin with.

111
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,300
But really, it's how you want
to see it yourself.

112
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,320
But a wide lens gives us an
interesting field of view, so

113
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,599
24, 28, something like that on
a full-frame camera, or even

114
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,040
wider if you're using
a smaller chip.

115
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,460
Also, we want to be able to look
for interesting figures

116
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,120
or movements or shapes
in that image.

117
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,960
So a dynamic sky is often
quite helpful.

118
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,960
And a central subject to begin
with is usually also quite

119
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,440
important, something to focus
on and also something to

120
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,719
maintain dimensionality in that
image and something to

121
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,150
lock people's awareness of.

122
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,929
A central subject's
quite important.

123
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,840
Now, the other interesting way
that we can think about this

124
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,650
is how do you want to position
your foreground.

125
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,239
How do you want to position
your middle areas?

126
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,160
And then what do you want to
have happen with the sky?

127
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,680
One of those codes is to have a
foreground, a midground, and

128
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,730
a background.

129
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,970
You don't have to.

130
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,940
But when you begin something
like this, having an awareness

131
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,510
of what those things are can
really help you to compose

132
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,440
your landscape images.

133
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,969
So that's the end
of module two.

134
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,000
I hope it's been informative
for you.

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,260
The next module is all
about processing.

136
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,969
It's all about the digital
darkroom and what we can do

137
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,220
with the images that we take.

138
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,631
