00:00:09,837 --> 00:00:13,379
In this topic, I'd like to talk
about the idea of truth

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,600
and photography.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,470
Photography has always had
a really interesting

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,020
relationship with concepts
around truth and what is

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,960
actually believable, and whether
what we're looking at

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,000
in that photograph is what
happened, or whether it is, in

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,830
fact, someone's perception
of what happened.

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,379
Digital imaging kind of changes
that a little bit.

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,470
And the relationship between
digital photography and truth,

11
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,100
whilst it's still similar as a
concept, there are a few other

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,990
things that we might need to
consider when we think about

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,000
this as an idea.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,780
A digital image is infinitely
repeatable.

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,850
You can make an original
photographic image and you can

16
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,380
copy that 1,000 times, and
every single one of those

17
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,110
copies will be absolutely
identical to that original

18
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,860
first photograph.

19
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,170
Analogue photography
was not like that.

20
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,530
Every time you made a copy,
there was some kind of loss

21
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,870
that occurred, some kind
of generational

22
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,630
shift in that image.

23
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,369
And eventually, it would degrade
so much, that as you

24
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,270
make a copy of a copy of a copy,
that it would eventually

25
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,679
be unrecognisable.

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,230
Spanish artist Joan Fontcuberta,
his entire image

27
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,020
making is about that
relationship between truth and

28
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,460
photography.

29
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,890
In the mid '90s, he went to one
of the Spanish islands in

30
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,330
the Mediterranean Sea, and did
a bit of a project around

31
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,899
astronomy and that relationship
between the night

32
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,880
sky and constellations.

33
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,710
But rather than photograph
through the telescope, rather

34
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,309
than take images of the night
sky, he just drove around the

35
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,370
island in his car at dusk, had
all the bugs splattering on

36
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,700
the wind screen, parked in his
garage, put a big piece of

37
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,860
photo-sensitive paper up there,
flashed it from outside

38
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,100
the wind screen, and created
his own version of

39
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,199
constellations, complete with
coordinates and names, and

40
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,160
kind of tricked everyone into
thinking that they were

41
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,759
looking at constellations.

42
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,570
But we were really
looking at bugs

43
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,280
splattered on a wind screen.

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,900
Truth can be as abstract as you
like it to be, or it can

45
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,900
be referencing something that
doesn't exist, or it can

46
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,840
actually be something that's
not quite what

47
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,610
you think it is.

48
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,750
Author, William Mitchell,
in his book, The

49
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,140
Reconfigured Eye--

50
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,049
Visual Truth in a
Post-Photographic Era, makes a

51
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,810
really interesting observation
about the idea of truth

52
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,300
representation in photography.

53
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,730
It's a really interesting quote
around the idea that

54
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,230
what we see does not always have
to exist to draw it, but

55
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,980
if we are going to photograph
it, it does have to exist.

56
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,780
He says, &quot;The existence of
horses means that you can take

57
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,850
a photograph of some particular
horse, but it does

58
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,510
not prevent a horse painting
from showing no horse in

59
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,709
particular.

60
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,750
You cannot, however, take a
photograph of no horse in

61
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,670
particular.&quot;

62
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,609
Just taking this idea a little
bit further, here's a drawing

63
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,860
of a horse.

64
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,780


65
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,680
It looks more like a lemon
with a head, doesn't it?

66
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,090
But there's a drawing
of a horse.

67
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,550
Let's call him, Ed.

68
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,940
I can tell you now, despite
the inaccuracies of that

69
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,490
drawing, Ed is not here
in the studio with me.

70
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,100
So I've made that up from my
memory of what horses look

71
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,269
like or from a reference point
where I know how horses have

72
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,840
four legs and a head
and a large body.

73
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,780
But here's a photograph
of Rajesh, a man

74
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,170
dressed as a horse.

75
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,470
In order for me to take that
photograph, he had to be in

76
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,430
that location at that particular
time, looking the

77
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,430
way that he did.

78
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,370
German photographer Andreas
Gursky is a good example here.

79
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,950
One of his most famous images,
The River Rhine from the late

80
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,859
'90s, shows a really devoid flat
scene of a river bank, a

81
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,250
river, and then the
other river bank.

82
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,150
But what he did in that
photograph is he digitally

83
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,680
removed the factory that
was on the other side

84
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,970
of the river bank.

85
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,780
The presence of that factory
meant that Gursky didn't want

86
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,970
something in there.

87
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,260
Maybe he didn't want to make
a comment about Germany

88
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,720
industrialisation.

89
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,580
Maybe he wanted to look more
at the hyperrealism of the

90
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,570
environment.

91
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:17,230
Whatever it was, he didn't want
that factory in there, so

92
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,839
he simply took it out.

93
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,240
Now I think you should probably
go and have a look at

94
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,810
some of the resources here.

95
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,990
And there are links on those
tabs that can tell you where

96
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,840
to go to have a look at this
image, and you'll see what I'm

97
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,880
talking about .

98
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,120
And it's important that
you have a close look.

99
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,020
And there's lots of information
that has been

100
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,180
written about him, and his
relationship to truth and

101
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,310
reality and the way that
he photographs.

102
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,110
Author Gerry Badger in his book,
The Pleasure of Good

103
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,340
Photographs, asks whether he
would be as troubled about

104
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,929
that if he knew that that
factory was never there in the

105
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,130
first place.

106
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,370
And he even uses that image as
a way of saying, can he ever

107
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,790
truly trust photography again.

108
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:59,270
By comparison, he also ponders
whether he would be as

109
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,750
troubled if he knew that a
certain documentary photograph

110
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,050
was taken several seconds
later or even framed in

111
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,260
different way.

112
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,050
So photography and truth is
a really debatable point.

113
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,380
And in the forum, I suggest that
maybe some of you post

114
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,500
your ideas about what
you think around

115
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,890
photography and truth.

116
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,409
And see if you can have some
kind of conversation about

117
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,080
that as a concept, and also
as a way of thinking about

118
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,330
contemporary photography.

119
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,750
