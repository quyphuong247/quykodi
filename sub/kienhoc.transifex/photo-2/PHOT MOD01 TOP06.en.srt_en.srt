2
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,810
So in this topic, we're going to
be talking about apertures

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,410
and shutter speeds and how
apertures and shutter speeds

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,160
are the two primary ways
that we control

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,530
light in our camera.

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,080
But they also allow us lots of
creative options in terms of

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,279
how we use the light and also
how we control the projection

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,550
of the image onto the sensor.

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,290
And there's a couple of things
that we need to be really

10
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,620
mindful of with aperture.

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,029
And it's a little bit
mathematical.

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,410
But it will make sense.

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,440
And you'll see up here, as I've,
not to scale, outlined

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,510
each of these apertures,
everything doubles down for

15
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,260
each of those major f-stops.

16
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,629
And the way that that works is
that for every one of these,

17
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,430
that's twice as much light as
the previous one, twice as

18
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,980
much light, twice as much light,
as we keep going along

19
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,459
that aperture scale.

20
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,330
So using aperture determines the
amount of light that comes

21
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,730
into the sensor through
the lens.

22
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:14,270
And if we look at a lens here,
you'll know that sometimes

23
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,610
you're told what the maximum
aperture of a lens is or how

24
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,730
fast a lens might be.

25
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,390
That maximum aperture is quite
a simple calculation.

26
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:26,760
It's the diameter of the front
of the lens, which, in this

27
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,080
case is 49 millimetres, divided
by the focal length of

28
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,420
the lens, which for this one
is 35-millimetre lens.

29
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:42,230
That will give us 1.4 or a focal
stop of 1.4 or f/1.4.

30
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,570
Just to sum up what an aperture
does, if you look at

31
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,509
this particular one here, f/8,
that sitting determines the

32
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,690
exact amount of light that
comes through the lens

33
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,120
diaphragm and makes contact
with our sensor.

34
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,580
And so if you need to control
exposure, if there's more

35
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,050
light, for example, we need
to use a smaller aperture.

36
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,289
If you want to let more
light in, you need to

37
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,080
use a bigger aperture.

38
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,960
And you'll notice that the
numbers go in reverse.

39
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,200
So the bigger the number, the
smaller the aperture.

40
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,739
The lower the number, the
bigger the aperture.

41
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,080
So we talked about aperture and
that aperture determines

42
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,060
the amount of light that
contacts the sensor.

43
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,000
Shutter speed is similar
to that.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,700
But it determines how long that
light is in contact with

45
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,730
our sensor.

46
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,970
Now, up here, I've got
some shutter speeds.

47
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,500
And you can see that each of
those shutter speeds doubles

48
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,170
and halves, which gives us twice
as much time or half the

49
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,329
amount of time that light is
in contact with our sensor.

50
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,600
And I've got a camera
here with--

51
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,829
well, it's a bit unusual
because I've

52
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,770
taken the lens off.

53
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,130
But what I want you to see is
what happens with our shutter

54
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,700
when I click this button.

55
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,489
You'll notice that the mirror
goes up and that there is a

56
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:09,350
curtain in front of the sensor
that opens for a predetermined

57
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:13,850
amount of time and then closes
again very quickly in order to

58
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,420
expose my sensor.

59
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,690
So I'm going to use 125 first.

60
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,846
And you'll just see
how fast that is.

61
00:03:21,846 --> 00:03:22,330
OK.

62
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,440
The mirror goes up.

63
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,010
The curtain opens.

64
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,489
Everything happens in
1/125 of one second.

65
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,750
If I close this down,
this time I'll use

66
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,850
one second over here.

67
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,109
Same thing happens.

68
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,510
But it just takes longer.

69
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,799
The mirror goes up.

70
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,060
The curtain opens.

71
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,890
The sensor is exposed.

72
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:42,980
It goes in reverse.

73
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,950
The curtain closes.

74
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,820
The mirror flips down again.

75
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,440
That's how shutter speed
works in a camera.

76
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,780
And it determines for us just
how long that light impacts or

77
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,060
exposes our sensor.

78
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,130
The world, by default, simply
moves forward in time.

79
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,990
A photograph creates a static
captured moment that we can

80
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,740
keep forever and return to next
week, next year, in 20

81
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,100
years and remember
that moment.

82
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,829
But if we get creative and if
we start using our shutter

83
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,589
speeds in ways that extend
beyond the normal use of

84
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:24,640
creating that static moment,
we can create and make new

85
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,120
moments that we would otherwise
not be able to see

86
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,040
as we move through the world.

87
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,660
For example, something simple
like using one of those longer

88
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,540
shutter speeds and moving the
camera through the frame

89
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,480
creates this new effect that we
would not see normally with

90
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,830
our own eyes.

91
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:46,520
Likewise, if a subject is moving
and the frame stays

92
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,020
still but we capture that for a
long period of time, again,

93
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,280
maybe half a second or one
second, we can start to see

94
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,270
them move through the frame.

95
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,010
The reverse of that is if we
use a really fast shutter

96
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,050
speed, maybe 1/500 of a
second or even faster.

97
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,430
And you can start to capture
things that you would never

98
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,850
actually see, like the stillness
of water being

99
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,930
projected from a
statue's mouth.

100
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,280
So there are our aperture
and our shutter speed.

101
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,349
They the two primary devices
through which we control light

102
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,070
and we control time.

103
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,500
And when we start to control
both of those things, we open

104
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,740
up a whole new way of dealing
with photography and a whole

105
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,480
new way of making all sorts of
really interesting images.

106
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,350
I suggest or I even urge you
to try and experiment with

107
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,560
some of these things if you're
camera allows you to manually

108
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,480
do that and look at different
ways that you can see the

109
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,920
world and explore photography
in that way.

110
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,170
