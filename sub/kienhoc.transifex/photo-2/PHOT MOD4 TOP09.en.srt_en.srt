00:00:10,022 --> 00:00:13,700
One of the things I'm often
asked about is what do I think

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,270
about the direction that
photography's taking, and

4
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,700
where do I think it's going
to go in the future?

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,419
They're two very interesting
questions, and I think it's

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,320
worth exploring some of this for
a moment and having a look

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,680
at just what is happening with
photography, with technology,

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,180
the way these things are coming
together, and what it

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,090
means for how we photograph
our images.

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,410
There are two types of movements
in photography that

11
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,279
are beginning to have
a real impact in the

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,110
way we use our cameras.

13
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,760
The first one is the idea of
location and how we might sort

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,120
our images and find our images
simply because we're taking so

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,629
many of them.

16
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,390
And the second one is different
ways that we might

17
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,190
engage with our scenery,
different ways that we might

18
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,510
use our camera, to take the
sorts of photographs that we

19
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,019
might take.

20
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,680
The first one really comes
down to location and

21
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,000
geotagging.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,290
In this screen shot of
Lightroom, you can see that

23
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,450
there's lots of markers and lots
of locations around the

24
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,290
world where I've either been
and taken photographs, or

25
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,010
where I've logged certain
photographs.

26
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,510
And what that allows me to do
is, if I'm looking for a

27
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,490
certain image, if I'm, say, I
want to find that photograph

28
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,660
from China of those guys
sleeping on the bench, rather

29
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,090
than try and browse through my
library, rather than try and

30
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,270
find something, I can simply
just go to that map, go to the

31
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,050
images that I photographed
in China, and find that

32
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,100
particular picture.

33
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,570
There's two ways that these
sorts of things are happening.

34
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,029
One is that cameras are
coming with GPS

35
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,700
devices built into them.

36
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,780
That allows us to

37
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,120
automatically tag our locations.

38
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,790
The other way is that we can
manually do that in some sort

39
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,340
of sorting software.

40
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,020
But that device, that GPS
enabling in cameras, lets us

41
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,710
do all sorts of interesting
things, from how we locate our

42
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,320
images, but also how we might
photograph our images.

43
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,870
For example, you can now set
cameras to take a photograph

44
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,530
every 200 metres,
every kilometre.

45
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,410
You can look at all sorts of
ways that you might use your

46
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:20,940
camera and use that GPS device
to enable location and

47
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,160
photography.

48
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,200
The other way that we can think
about our cameras and

49
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,220
the devices that are built into
them is this idea the

50
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,680
cameras can now run really
complex software algorithms to

51
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,840
detect certain features in
frames that allows us to do

52
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,310
things like facial recognition
and using that as a way of

53
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,240
changing the nature of
photography and how we might

54
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,420
photograph our images.

55
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,070
For example, in this image of
Emmett, my son, and myself,

56
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,989
he's smiling, he's got a really
joyful expression on

57
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,980
his face, and the camera
knows that is a face.

58
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,440
It knows that the face is
smiling, and it therefore

59
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,250
knows, if you set it like this,
to take the photograph

60
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,400
at that particular moment.

61
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,150
We can also use these devices
to input certain faces.

62
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,890
So if you've got a family
photograph of eight or nine

63
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,170
different people, the camera
will know to focus on either

64
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,559
myself or someone else that it
recognises as being a face

65
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,920
that's built into the database
of that camera, and it will

66
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,190
focus on that face and expose
for that face and use that as

67
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,300
the basis through which
to photograph.

68
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,020
So photography's going through a
really interesting change at

69
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,720
the moment, and all of these
complex processing devices and

70
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,700
computers are starting to seep
into the photography that we

71
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,030
know and love, but also change
the way that we might think

72
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,070
about the sorts of devices
that we use.

73
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,720
Mobile phones kind of
led the charge.

74
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,270
All of those camera phones had
those devices built into them.

75
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,500
We now know that the iPhone is
the most popular camera on

76
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,290
Flickr, for example.

77
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,880
The metadata that comes attached
to the way that we

78
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,859
take photographs and the
information that's displayed

79
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,980
and collected with that
photograph gives us a whole

80
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,220
range of options that we can
use to explore the future

81
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,840
direction that photography
might have.

82
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,430
If you're thinking about a
camera, if you're looking for

83
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,620
sorts of new ways to photograph,
or if you just

84
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,590
want to make sure that you've
got the latest technology and

85
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,080
the best camera that you can
get, some of these things are

86
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,109
going to be voluntary.

87
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,770
You certainly don't have to
use them, but some of them

88
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,919
might change the way that you
start photographing and start

89
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,320
thinking about that future
direction for photography.

90
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,709
