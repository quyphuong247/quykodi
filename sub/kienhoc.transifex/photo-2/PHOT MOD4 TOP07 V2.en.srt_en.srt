2
00:00:10,022 --> 00:00:12,350
One of the really interesting
ways that you can explore

3
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,620
photography is by analysing
the way that other artists

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,160
have photographed certain scenes
and looking at the way

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,620
that they put their
images together.

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,670
There's a wonderful book
called The Making of 40

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,620
Photographs by Ansel Adams,
and it does what it says.

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,720
He goes through and outlines
how he made 40 of his most

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,930
famous photographs and the kinds
of decisions and stories

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,510
that he had in relationship
to those images.

11
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,900
So I'm going to do a little bit
of the same thing here.

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm going to take three of my
images and just talk to you

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,900
about how I made them, and the
sorts of decisions and the way

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,900
that I connected that
relationship between what I

15
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,930
saw and then what I produced.

16
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,030
I'll start with this first one
here about Broken Hill.

17
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,500
I'll begin with a little bit of
a story because the story

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,570
is part of a context.

19
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,460
One of the ways that I
photograph is by replicating

20
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,430
this idea of the expedition,
and I get in the car and I

21
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,260
drive as long as I possibly can,
and search and seek for

22
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,430
certain parts of the iconic
Australian environment.

23
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,590
And on this particular day, I
was driving into Broken Hill

24
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,490
as these massive dust storm--

25
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,449
this sort of massive central
Australian dust storm-- was

26
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,420
coming in and rolling over me
as I was driving towards

27
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,770
Broken Hill.

28
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,050
At some point, I came across
this site, which is an old

29
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,770
speedway, and I couldn't
resist.

30
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,380
I thought, this is exactly
the sort of thing

31
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,589
that I'm looking for.

32
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,450
It's iconic Australia.

33
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,450
The weather's iconic
Australia.

34
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,260
The lighting was amazing.

35
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,310
And I stopped and I

36
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,870
photographed Broken Hill Speedway.

37
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,000
We're going to have a look at
two shots of the same image.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,680
The first shot is how the camera
saw this sight-- saw

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,580
this scene--

40
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,550
as it unfolded before
the lens.

41
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,140
And it's also quite close to
how I saw it when I was

42
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,060
standing there.

43
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,820
But it wasn't the sort of
photograph that I wanted.

44
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,679
I wanted a much more emotional,
much more

45
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,100
fragmented, a lot more contrast,
and a lot more

46
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,478
detail in my image.

47
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,770
So the second one that
we can see here is my

48
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,710
version of that scene.

49
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,140
The before, and the after.

50
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,209
There are a couple of decisions
that I had to make

51
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,120
while I was photographing the
image, and that had to carry

52
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,440
over through to how I was
editing Broken Hill Speedway.

53
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,150
The first thing was I wanted
a fragmented foreground.

54
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,860
I wanted that place where
people stand to be

55
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,050
uncomfortable and to be as
disruptive as possible.

56
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,640
So I needed more contrasting
in there.

57
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,869
The second thing I needed was
an expensive depth of field.

58
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,230
Everything needed to be in
focus, right from the first

59
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,209
rocks in front of the lens at
the very, very foreground

60
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,840
right through to the trees
in the distance.

61
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,340
That focus was important to
me because I wanted as an

62
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,060
expansive image as possible.

63
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,500
The third thing is I needed
that highlight in

64
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,420
the sky to be clear--

65
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,140
the sun streaking through that
storm, creating that extra

66
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,559
dimensionality and that extra
bit of punch in that sky.

67
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,660
So the image ended up being
somewhat different from how I

68
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,890
first saw it, but it ended up
how I saw it in my head.

69
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,570
When we talk about Ansel Adams
and his idea of visualisation,

70
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,560
this is a classic
example of that.

71
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,370
What I saw with my eyes and how
the image was captured by

72
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,300
the camera versus how I
perceived my emotional

73
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,680
response to that particular
site.

74
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,670
The second image I want to talk
about, Sleepers, is one

75
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,140
of those examples where
sometimes you come across a

76
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,690
scene or a moment that really
fits in with the kinds of

77
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,329
things are you looking for and
makes for an interesting

78
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,890
photographic image.

79
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,209
One was in Beijing walking
around the streets early in

80
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,920
the morning, and I happened to
have my camera on the ready

81
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,459
with me, and I came across
this particular scene.

82
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,770
Now, seeing someone sleeping
in the streets is not an

83
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,610
unusual occurrence--

84
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,570
who knows what sort of night
they had before.

85
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,720
But seeing three guys lined up
on a bench at the window in

86
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,250
KFC was too good an opportunity
to pass up.

87
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,680
And as I was putting the camera
up to my eye, and as I

88
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,530
was trying to work out what
sort of vantage point am I

89
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,980
interested in here, I started to
notice other things in that

90
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,970
frame, which led me to
rephotograph it and

91
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,330
restructure it quite differently
to what you're

92
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,640
seeing here.

93
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,740
I noticed that the idea of the
number three was repeating

94
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,130
itself quite a lot--

95
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,330
the three pillars in the window,
the three guys asleep,

96
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,800
the three posters of KFC,
the three icons of KFC--

97
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,460
everything started referring
back to that triplet identity

98
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,719
in that frame.

99
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,270
So I repositioned myself and I
made sure that I captured as

100
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,770
much of that as I
possibly could.

101
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,150
When I saw that image back in
post, when I was looking at it

102
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,929
on my screen, I noticed that
that was even more evident on

103
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,510
a bigger scale, and certainly
something

104
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,060
that I wanted to promote.

105
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,690
So in editing, I simply just
very easily local adjustment,

106
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,430
lifted up some of the contrast,
brightened up some

107
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,640
of those areas inside
the shop--

108
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,360
in particular the posters--

109
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,600
and just referenced and
reproduced that identity and

110
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,590
that number three as much
as I possibly could.

111
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,900
I think doing something
like that creates a

112
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,549
more dynamic image.

113
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,210
I could've stood front on.

114
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,729
I could've ignored everything
else in that frame and simply

115
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,560
taken the photographs of
the three guys asleep.

116
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,710
Rather than do that, I looked
at how I can use photography

117
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,190
and that frame to construct
a more interesting image.

118
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,710
Something that you can do as
an exercise, even if you're

119
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,049
not photographing is apply
that idea of a frame just

120
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,760
around the things that you see
and notice that when you move

121
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,000
or change your position,
different things emerge.

122
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,280
Much more interesting
photographs occur by having

123
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,140
that level of engagement and
that level of detail in the

124
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,930
things that you're
looking for.

125
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,860
Another way you can think about
your photography is to

126
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,620
slow things down.

127
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,220
By default, we have this idea
that photography's about

128
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,110
capturing that instant moment,
and that we have to be as

129
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,460
responsive and as quick
as we possibly can.

130
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,479
I don't think that's necessarily
always the case,

131
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,720
and I think sometimes it's
better to slow those moments

132
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,670
down and be much more analytical
about the sorts of

133
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,730
things that you want
to photograph.

134
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,510
Landscape photographers are
a classic with this.

135
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,930
They'll sit there for hours
waiting for the right light in

136
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,890
order to capture the scene that
they want to capture.

137
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:37,020
In this particular image here,
Ned Kelly's Last Stand, again

138
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,919
it was one of those
responsive things.

139
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,320
I was looking for elements
of iconic Australia

140
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,170
that existed overseas.

141
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,820
And this particular restaurant
here, this particular bar in

142
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,060
Hong Kong was quite iconic and
indicative of what I was

143
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,370
searching for.

144
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,150
Ned Kelly is a famous bush
ranger in Australia.

145
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,560
The idea that Ned Kelly's last
stand exists somewhere outside

146
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,500
of the bush in Australia is
humorous, to say the least.

147
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,770
And it's certainly something
that I was

148
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,830
interested in exploring.

149
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,400
So I set myself up in a certain
way for this image.

150
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,560
I didn't think that I could
capture everything that I

151
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,180
wanted in either one particular
moment, or even in

152
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,530
one particular frame.

153
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,650
I wanted the stand--

154
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,530
the Ned Kelly's Last Stand--

155
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,859
as both a sign on the bar
itself, as well as the sign

156
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,860
sticking off the bar and the
way that the light fell on

157
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,210
those two things.

158
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,430
I also wanted those windows to
be quite reflective, and I

159
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,000
wanted to see inside the bar.

160
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,120
I've got three images
here to show you.

161
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,200
The first one is the
finished product.

162
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,909
The first one is the
entire image.

163
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:50,590
Then you can see in the second
one that it's inside Ned

164
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,479
Kelly's Last Stand,
inside the bar.

165
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,140
Now, the interesting thing
here is that I

166
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,229
used a bit of trickery.

167
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,370
I couldn't see inside the bar
from the position that I

168
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,760
wanted to photograph that image,
so I had to start by

169
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,920
capturing the first frame at the
same distance, but from a

170
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,440
different angle so that you
could see inside the bar.

171
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,770
Then I repositioned myself for
the second shot, which was the

172
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,940
entire thing, so that I could
have that framed and

173
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,400
composited and set the
way that I wanted.

174
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,109
But when I shot that, I noticed
that the reflection in

175
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:31,440
the window was pretty dull
and not very interesting.

176
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,780
And I knew that if I waited
maybe half an hour, 45

177
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,308
minutes, that the lights in the
street would come on and

178
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:40,929
create a much more dynamic,
much more interesting

179
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:42,179
reflection.

180
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,939
So I sat there with a
camera on the tripod

181
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,340
and I literally waited--

182
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,560
I think it ended up being
almost an hour--

183
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,209
I waited for that window to do
something more interesting.

184
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,950
When I shot all of that--

185
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,110
back in my hotel room,
back in my studio--

186
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,710
I looked at all those frames.

187
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,980
I worked out how I was going to
composite that final image,

188
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,880
and I put all of those elements
together much in the

189
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,730
same way that I was talking
about how Gregory Crewdson

190
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,150
does this kind of thing.

191
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:13,069
And I made what is essentially
an image that doesn't exist,

192
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,700
but it references something
that does exist.

193
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,250
And that's a particular way
that we can photograph.

194
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,570
That's a particular way that
we construct our images so

195
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,910
that we get the effect that we
want to get, and we frame the

196
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,160
story that we want to tell.

197
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,517
