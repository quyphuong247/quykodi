Hi.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,840
My name is Shane Hulbert.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,800
I'm the Deputy Head of School at
the School of Art at RMIT.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,700
And I've been a photographic
artist and

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,990
educator for over 20 years.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,290
I have a real passion
for photography.

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,320
I think it's a wonderful
medium.

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,580
And I love to explore different
sites and locations

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,200
through the use of cameras
and photographic devices.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,320
I like all sorts
of photography.

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,860
But really, I think I'm mostly
a landscape photographer.

13
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,089
I respond best to place,
locations, and sites

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,130
throughout the world
that allow me to

15
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,760
develop that interest.

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,800
And I think photography is
a really dynamic medium.

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,980
And I don't really mind how the
photograph has been taken.

18
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,580
But I think digital photography
seems to be where

19
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,570
we're heading.

20
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,160
And it's certainly the
focus of this course.

21
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,910
I think the debates around
analogue photography and

22
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,150
digital photography are
quite interesting.

23
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,230
But I'm probably going to stay
clear of them here and focus

24
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,229
more on that language of
photography and how you can

25
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,360
develop and become better
photographers.

26
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,630
Photography is a core

27
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,740
experience of the 21st century.

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,699
We see, consume, and make
photographic images all of the

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,540
time using a variety of camera
devices from phones through to

30
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,640
advanced digital SLR cameras.

31
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,660
And photography has a real
indictable relationship to the

32
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,190
world that we see.

33
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,450
Everything that we see
can be photographed.

34
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,220
Everything that we experience
and the way that we engage

35
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,170
with our world works as
a photographic image.

36
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,490
But the extent of that
photographic image is being

37
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,820
challenged with contemporary
technologies that allow us to

38
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,220
tag faces and geo locate certain
positions and do all

39
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,010
sorts of things with photography
that have a

40
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,370
different relationship to how
we engage with the world.

41
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,170
In the time that it's taken me
to introduce this course, over

42
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,470
215,000 photographs have been
uploaded to the internet

43
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,140
through any of the various
devices, like Facebook or

44
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,080
Instagram or Flickr.

45
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,120
So photography is an
all-consuming product of the

46
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,600
21st century.

47
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,920
And it's an exciting medium
through which to explore the

48
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,619
things that we're
interested in.

49
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,290
In this first module, we're
looking, specifically, at the

50
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,790
crucial role that the light
and the lens plays in

51
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,470
recording and framing the
images that we take.

52
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,250
We look at understanding some
of those key concepts in

53
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,540
photography and the impact that
will have on the kinds of

54
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,620
images that you make, as well as
the way that you take them.

55
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,160
As photographers, we have four
basic or four formal ways that

56
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,260
we can think about our images.

57
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,120
The first one is our
vantage point.

58
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,990


59
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,960
This is where we stand in
relationship to the subject

60
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,590
that we're photographing.

61
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,440
The second device we have
is our framing.

62
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,600


63
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,670
This determines how
we crop or what we

64
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,579
position inside our frame.

65
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,430
Our third option is
optical drawing.

66
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,320


67
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,820
In photography, light always
travels through glass or

68
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,870
through a lens or some type of
device that shifts and pushes

69
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,580
that light around to draw
the image on our frame.

70
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,280
And our last one is time.

71
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,250
Time operates on two levels--

72
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,610
when we choose to expose the
image but, also, how we use

73
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,970
that shutter speed to determine
how long our image

74
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,970
is exposed for.

75
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,510
In order to get the most out of
this course, it's important

76
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,810
that you start sharing your
images and responding to the

77
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,050
images of others.

78
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,980
We're trying to establish
the art of

79
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,660
photography community here.

80
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,600
And the more you engage with
that, the more you'll get out

81
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,790
of this course.

82
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,130
We've set up a Google+
community for you.

83
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,460
And if you use the #O2Sphoto,
you'll be able to set your

84
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,190
images up so that other
people can see them.

85
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,930
There's a link within your
Further Readings tab that will

86
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,890
take you straight to the Arts
and Humanities category and

87
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,160
give you the instructions
you need in order

88
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,920
to engage with this.

89
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,690
American photographer Robert
Adams in Why People Photograph

90
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,270
has a really nice thing to
say about community.

91
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,840
And he begins it with the idea
that your own photography is

92
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,250
never enough.

93
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,520
I can't emphasise this more.

94
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,770
You need to be part of this
community, because it will

95
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,159
help you to become a better
photographer.

96
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,030
You'll see other
people's work.

97
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,530
They'll be doing the same course
that you're doing.

98
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,940
They'll have the same
information that you have.

99
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,930
And they might even be able
to provide insights and

100
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,800
information that's beyond what
I'm talking about here to give

101
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,420
you more insight and more
information about how do to

102
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,670
improve your photography.

103
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,870
