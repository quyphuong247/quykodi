00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:11,330
We've talked about some
technique and

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,530
some technical stuff.

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,139
Let's now talk about some
conceptual things.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,920
The world has no edges.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,380
Composition and framing is
defining edges in the subjects

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,599
that we see using the camera
that we're using.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,940
And it sounds like a
really easy thing.

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,630
But in order to get really good,
strong, dynamic images,

10
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,360
we do need to be quite mindful
of how we compose and how we

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,390
frame our world.

12
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,990
We talked about lenses earlier
and that they have different

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,370
focal lengths.

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,250
Using the focal length is one
of the key ways that we can

15
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,620
manipulate and set our
image within the

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,440
confines of that frame.

17
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,339
Now I think there are two ways
that we can talk about framing

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,240
and two types of frames
that we can consider.

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,920
There's the passive frame and
there's the active frame.

20
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,140
A passive frame, as you can see
in this image here, is one

21
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,120
where the edges of the device or
the edges of the thing that

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,470
you're photographing,
it's not outside the

23
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,630
frame of the camera.

24
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,089
It's not outside the
frame of the image.

25
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,350
It's fully contained.

26
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:23,190
That means that the subject in
there rests and sits by itself

27
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,060
and is not in composition
or competition

28
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,590
with anything else.

29
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,300
An active frame is not
necessarily the opposite of

30
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,679
that, but it does
have a different

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,140
treatment in our image.

32
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,290
And an active frame, as you
can see here, is one that

33
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:41,840
extends beyond the framing
of our image and it has a

34
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,430
different relationship to the
edges and the corners that

35
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,960
we're dealing with
in our images.

36
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,330
We can think about composition
and framing in the way that we

37
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,820
think about order
and structure.

38
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,559
Photographer Stephen Shore has
a really wonderful way of

39
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,370
articulating this.

40
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,670
He makes comparisons between a
photographer and a painter.

41
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,260
A painter, he says, starts
with a blank canvas, then

42
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,550
creates order and structure.

43
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,810
The opposite of this
is a photographer.

44
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,080
A photographer starts with the
messiness of the world and

45
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,490
finds order and structure in
that image, and imposes their

46
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,400
own value or our own idea of
what we consider to be

47
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,410
important, and defines that and
uses the camera and the

48
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,859
lens and the focal length and
all the things that we've

49
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,840
talked about as a way of
creating that order and that

50
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,500
structure out of
that messiness.

51
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,030
It's an interesting way of
thinking about things.

52
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,790
But it also gives us a wonderful
opportunity to sit

53
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:45,130
back and ponder and just take
our time and think about how

54
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,160
we might want to compose and
frame the thing that we're

55
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,720
looking at.

56
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,650
Messy compositions, or
compositions that don't work,

57
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,000
they're really obvious.

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,390
And it's more than just having
a lamp pole sticking out of

59
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:03,839
someone's head or things not
quite balancing out correctly.

60
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,190
And it doesn't take much to just
shift yourself off to the

61
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,730
side, stand up on tippy toes
even or just change your

62
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,600
vantage point and look at how
you want to see that image and

63
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,109
just consider the order and
structure of that frame.

64
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,620
Another interesting way that
we can talk about vantage

65
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,070
point composition and framing
is to look at how other

66
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,519
artists and other photographers
do that.

67
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,250
I've got a drawing here of
a Lee Friedlander image.

68
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,430
And at the end of the topic
you'll get the link to this

69
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,400
particular image, and I
do suggest that you

70
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,500
go and have a look.

71
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,630
Because what he did
is he wanted to

72
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,390
frame a certain scene.

73
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,089
It's just simply a street.

74
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,080
There's a house, there's a hill,
that's a give way sign.

75
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,750
And all he did is reposition
himself slightly lower and

76
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,720
slightly off to the side so
that the clouds in the sky

77
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,950
actually formed this wonderful
little melting ice cream cone

78
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,570
kind of an object that
sat exactly on top of

79
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,150
that give way sign.

80
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,220
And something simple like that
made what might have been a

81
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,180
relatively mundane,
uninteresting image come alive

82
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,010
and have a real sense of
composition and structure.

83
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,269
And the final thing that we
can consider, and I think

84
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,339
these are really important, is
that relationship with our

85
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,089
corners in the image.

86
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:25,440
And we've got four of them.

87
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,770
We've always got four of them.

88
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,960
It doesn't matter what sort of
camera you're using, what sort

89
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,340
of lens or whatever it is.

90
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,380
There's always those
four corners.

91
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,510
And they act as the levers
in our field of view.

92
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:43,370
And there's always the longest
visual cues and visual levers

93
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,240
in that field.

94
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,110
So quite often, and my students
get very sick of me

95
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,750
saying this, I look at those
images that they show me and I

96
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,030
look at them for critiques
and I'm always

97
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,359
saying, check your corners.

98
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,760
What's happening in the
corners of your image?

99
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,909
And is there a balance?

100
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,310
Is there symmetry?

101
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,810
Does it make sense?

102
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,400
Do those corners complement
relationships that are

103
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,799
occurring in the frame?

104
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,580
Do they contradict those
relationships?

105
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,609
Just think about what's
happening in those corners and

106
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,870
it can really make for a
concise, well-framed image.

107
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,120
