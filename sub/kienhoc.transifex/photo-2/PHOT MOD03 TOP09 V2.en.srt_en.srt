2
00:00:09,922 --> 00:00:11,960
Tone is how we determine
space and

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,180
dimensionality in our images.

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,540
An image that is flat, that has
no blacks and no whites,

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,390
is lacking in that contrast.

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,440
And therefore, it doesn't have
a full tonal range within

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,030
which to determine the dynamic
dimensions and the way that

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,910
our image sits on the page or
pushes itself off the page.

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,810
So in this particular topic,
we're going to look at some

10
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,690
photographic language in
relation to shadows, to

11
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,849
mid-tones, and to highlights;
why we need all three of those

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,310
in most images; and the way that
we can determine whether

13
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,700
or not we have them and
what we can do if

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,100
we're missing them.

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,980
Shadows act as the base point
in our image from which all

16
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,129
the other tones emerge.

17
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,260
The interesting thing about
shadows is that when you

18
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,550
naturally look at a scene, your
eyes will adjust to make

19
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,450
sure that you can see all the
texture and all the detail

20
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,860
that exists in those
shadow areas.

21
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,120
Well, a photograph should
do the same thing.

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,420
We should avoid blocks
of black in shadows.

23
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,690
We should make sure that we have
texture and tone so that

24
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,240
when you look at that image, you
can see what exists in the

25
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,530
shadow areas.

26
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,880
And then the rest of the tones
can emerge from there.

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,610
So pay particular attention
to your shadows.

28
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,020
Make sure they're
not blocked up.

29
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,270
And make sure you can
see into them.

30
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,649
The reverse of the shadows
would be our highlights.

31
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,580
Now, our highlights can blow out
quite easily, which means

32
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,820
that the tone and texture that
exists in those highlights is

33
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,050
pure white or the same texture
and tone as the paper.

34
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,830
And if you do that, you run the
risk of having an image

35
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,280
where the contrast
is too high.

36
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,140
So in the same way that our
shadows are important, our

37
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,400
highlights are important because
we need to make sure

38
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,460
that there's still texture in
there, not in the same way

39
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,300
that you're going to see detail,
but just enough so

40
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,429
that the clouds and the
reflections off buildings, the

41
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,300
brick work might show through or
that there is definition in

42
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,220
those highlights.

43
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,130
In the middle of the shadows and
highlights, of course, are

44
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,280
our mid-tones.

45
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,190
And our mid-tones act as that
fulcrum point in the image so

46
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,560
that when we see through those
areas, we have enough

47
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,530
definition and we have enough
tonality and contrast that

48
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:31,285
subjects emerge in ways that are
flanked by our shadows and

49
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:33,270
our highlights.

50
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,790
When we look at our images on
the screen or when we work in

51
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,470
Photoshop or with digital
imaging editing applications,

52
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,880
the representation of shadows
and highlights, as we learnt

53
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,710
about in Module 1, is
through our levels

54
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,560
or through our histogram.

55
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,390
And sometimes we have
an image where the

56
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,209
histogram needs editing.

57
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,890
So we use our levels to make
those adjustments.

58
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,079
And I've got a nice image
of a cat here.

59
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,810
And I'm just going to show
you what I do in order

60
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,840
to correct for that.

61
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,820
So here we have a cat with
plenty of definition, plenty

62
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,540
of shadow, good tone, and really
interesting clarity.

63
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,850
But there's a little bit
of flatness in there.

64
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,239
And if I look at my histogram,
you can see that it's peaked

65
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,550
out and that there are
in fact no highlight

66
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,510
values in this image.

67
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,630
No highlight values means
it's under-exposed.

68
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,210
It's a bit of a problem.

69
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,250
But we can correct it.

70
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,750
We simply just to need
to remap our levels

71
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,180
using Levels over here.

72
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,740
And again, there's
that flat line.

73
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,160
So if I look at that, I can
think, OK, well, all I need to

74
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,320
do is tell Photoshop that the
highlight value is that one

75
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,040
there, whatever is that value
that the pixels end on.

76
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,109
So I simply just make
that adjustment,

77
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,960
push that slider across.

78
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,700
You can see the contrast
increase.

79
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,850
And so what that's telling me
is that every value from 210

80
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:57,420
to 255 is now being converted,
or remapped, as being 255.

81
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,700
And when I click OK in this
image or in this particular

82
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,350
Levels dialogue box,
those values

83
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,200
will in fact be adjusted.

84
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,739
And the contrast that you see
on the screen will be there.

85
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,460
The only problem, however, is
that I'm now a losing that

86
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,350
number of levels.

87
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,040
So I'm losing 45 levels.

88
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,579
And if you want to pause the
video and count, you're

89
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,120
welcome to.

90
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,600
But that's how many levels are
being deleted from this

91
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,470
particular image.

92
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,770
However, that's the sacrifice
that we make.

93
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,210
That's the trade off.

94
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,940
I now have an image
that has much

95
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,750
greater sense of contrast.

96
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,380
There's my before.

97
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,040
There's my after.

98
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,080
It's a much more interesting,
much more dynamic image.

99
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,917
