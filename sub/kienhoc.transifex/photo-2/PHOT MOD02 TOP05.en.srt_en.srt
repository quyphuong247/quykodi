00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,060
In the last topic, we looked
at the mechanical of our

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,149
camera-- the shutter speed,
the aperture, how we set

4
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,180
different metering modes
and focusing options.

5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,740
They're really mechanical
engagement with the camera and

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,820
us as photographers.

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,260
Now I want to talk about the
digital settings that we have

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,780
access to because after we've
settled those options,

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,760
something happens when the
light hits that sensor.

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,610
And that something is determined
by the type of

11
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,430
settings that you do here.

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,660
There are a range of different
options we have to set here.

13
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,959
And depending on how you want
to capture that information,

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,210
that will determine the sorts
of settings that you choose.

15
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,680
So we've got to have digital
settings that we need to

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,339
determine in our camera.

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,550
And I've just thrown a little
flow chart here to help us

18
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,720
understand what happens when
we make those settings.

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,030
We've really got two options.

20
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,910
The first option is RAW and
the second option is JPEG.

21
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,539
I'll talk a lot more about
RAW in our next topic.

22
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,920
But for the purposes of what
we're doing here, you set your

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,570
exposure, you set your ISO,
and you make your capture.

24
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,089
There's no other digital
settings

25
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,790
that you need to make.

26
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,860
Let's have a look at JPEG.

27
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,580
JPEG, first and foremost,
is a compressed

28
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,795
format, so it's smaller.

29
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,930
It is faster to work with.

30
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,410
But as you can see in this
picture here, the compression,

31
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:36,390
if done poorly, makes for
a really ugly image.

32
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,130
On the right-hand side, you've
got compressed information, on

33
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,009
the left-hand side--
uncompressed information.

34
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,120
So we need to know that there
is a trade off when

35
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,980
we work with JPEG.

36
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,510
The other thing with JPEG is
that we need to set our

37
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,290
exposure in ISO, as we would
with RAW, but we also need to

38
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,780
set our white balance, we need
to set our picture style and

39
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,330
our colour space.

40
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,039
All of these things becoming
coded in the image when we

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,790
take our capture.

42
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,470
In the second shot that I've got
up here, you can see the

43
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,870
effect of having the wrong white
balance that might have

44
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,030
on our image.

45
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,630
If you set it incorrectly,
white will

46
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,740
not look like white.

47
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,400
It will be too yellow, it will
be too blue depending on the

48
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,230
types of lighting and the sorts
of situation that you're

49
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,040
photographing under.

50
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,010
The last thing down here
is our picture style.

51
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,359
All cameras have different
types of styles on them--

52
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,180
natural, portrait, landscape,
whatever it is--

53
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,250
that just does a little bit of
in-camera processing to try

54
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,250
and get the best quality
out of that sensor.

55
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,410
So when you're trying to work
out what sort of settings am I

56
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,170
going to use digitally,
these are the sorts of

57
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,339
considerations that
you need to make.

58
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,510
If you've never shot RAW, you're
in for a real treat in

59
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,730
the next topic.

60
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,920
I'm a big fan of RAW shooting.

61
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,890
If you want to shoot JPEG,
just be mindful.

62
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,600
You need to get things right.

63
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,690
And you need to make sure you
have all those things down,

64
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,340
and that they're the correct
settings, so that when you do

65
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,065
you make those captures, things
come out the way that

66
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:09,980
you expect them to.

67
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,640
So there we have two types of
settings that we need to make

68
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,589
on our camera--

69
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,870
the mechanical settings that
we talked about in the last

70
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,460
topic and the digital settings
that we talked about just now.

71
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,270
I think conceptually it's good
to separate those two things

72
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,660
out and to make sure you have
a good understanding about

73
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,579
what each of those parameters
are going to do to the kinds

74
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,890
of images that you
want to take.

75
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,140
