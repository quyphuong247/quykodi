00:00:10,038 --> 00:00:13,210
Of all the genres in
photography, the documentary

3
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,740
photography genre is probably
the one that can make the

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,290
greatest claim to simply
being photography.

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,480
You could argue that everything
that we photograph

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,895
is a document of something,
whether it's a moment in time,

7
00:00:23,895 --> 00:00:25,939
a person, or an event.

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,530
So documentary photography
has a particular sense of

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,410
authority in the way that we
think about and deal with

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,270
photographic images.

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,030
The document also exists as
another term or another way of

12
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,050
thinking about it, which is
through this idea of an index

13
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,699
or indexicality.

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,060
The multiples of something
creates a different meaning to

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,190
just a singular photograph
of the same thing.

16
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,640
In this particular topic we're
going to explore the way that

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,176
documentary photography exists
as a genre, and also some of

18
00:00:54,176 --> 00:00:55,220
the ways that you might explore

19
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,410
that creatively yourself.

20
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,610
Lewis Hine, the American
photographer, had a wonderful

21
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,630
comment about the way that the
document and the way that

22
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,280
photography sits together.

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,230
And it's simply something
like this.

24
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:10,140
While photography may not lie,
liars my photograph.

25
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,830
Garry Winogrand has a different
way of thinking

26
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:13,870
about this.

27
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,080
He's another American
photographer, and one of the

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,950
most prolific photographers
of the 20th century.

29
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,660
When he died, in fact, there
were over 300,000 unedited

30
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,270
images of his in
his collection.

31
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,089
And he basically had something
simple to say about the way he

32
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,230
photographed.

33
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,640
I photograph to see what the
world looks like photographed.

34
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,950
There are other ways that you
can think about documentary

35
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:36,740
photography.

36
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,899
Rather than simply responding
to things that you see, you

37
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,900
might actually have a particular
thing that you're

38
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,590
looking for or a particular
context within

39
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,340
which you want to work.

40
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,920
One of my all time favourite
photographers, Robert Frank in

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,220
the 1950s, did his big Americans
photographic series

42
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,350
where he went to all these
iconic places in America and

43
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,550
photographed them in a way that
responded to how America

44
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,110
was developing and ageing as a
community and as a culture.

45
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,630
And one of the images that
actually didn't make it into

46
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,150
that series but that he's used
in other ways is this famous

47
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,950
image of Hoover Dam.

48
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,019
Now, you ought to picture
yourself driving across

49
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,270
America in the '50s.

50
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,830
You go to Hoover Dam.

51
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,310
And this is, at that particular
time, one of the

52
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,940
most amazing, massive
constructions and achievements

53
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,180
that humanity has ever made.

54
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,860
And rather than photograph the
dam itself, Frank instead was

55
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,150
looking for something that was
more indicative of what that

56
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,710
dam represented.

57
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,500
Rather than be the tourist he
was much more interested in

58
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,180
being the observer and
the commentator.

59
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,550
So I suggest at this point in
time you do a Google search

60
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,910
for Robert Frank Hoover Dam or
click the link in the notes

61
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,120
and you'll see the image
that I'm talking about.

62
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,540
And come back and we'll together
have a look at what

63
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,519
it is about this image that
makes it so amazing.

64
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,940
First of all he set it
up as a portrait.

65
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,260
Rather than doing the landscape
aspect ratio he used

66
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,489
the portrait aspect ratio making
it more of a comment on

67
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,790
something rather than
a representation.

68
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:14,440
And he simply had the three
postcards stacked one on top

69
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,579
of each other.

70
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,910
The first one, as you can see
there, is the natural wonder,

71
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,920
the natural environment.

72
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,359
The middle one being the
constructed, the present

73
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,060
environment, the construction
of the dam.

74
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,910
And of course the final one
being the destructive

75
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,829
environment, the destructive
wonder of the nuclear atom

76
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,580
bomb, which in the 1950s was
still very much in people's

77
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,860
consciousness.

78
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,180
We've got the past,
the present,

79
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,830
and a possible future.

80
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,790
That's what makes this image
such an amazing documentary

81
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,320
photograph in the sense that
it's talking so much more

82
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,970
about what that environment,
what that space represents

83
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,840
rather than simply responding
to what was seen.

84
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,700
Hoover Dam is an
amazing image.

85
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,640
And as I said, it's one of the
things that makes me wonder

86
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,670
and be amazed by photography
and the way that people can

87
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,079
see and reconstruct the
world that they see.

88
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,700
The man versus nature concept in
the 1950s coming out of the

89
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,299
Industrial Revolution,
remembering the age of

90
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,440
enlightenment, all of that
content, all of those amazing

91
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,209
things about our history and who
we are as a human race all

92
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,900
falls into Hoover Dam, Nevada.

93
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,020
I talked earlier about
indexicality.

94
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,950
One of the great examples of
indexicality is American

95
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:34,479
photographer Ed Ruscha and his
26 Gasoline Stations that he

96
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,440
shot in the 1960s.

97
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,660
And he started in L.A., ended up
in Oklahoma, followed Route

98
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,710
66, and stopped and photographed
26 gasoline

99
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,340
stations from point A to point
B. What makes this an

100
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,560
interesting book and series of
photographs is that one single

101
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,520
photograph of a gasoline station
is a photograph of a

102
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,930
gasoline station,
petrol station.

103
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,080
26 of them becomes a comment
on America's dependence on

104
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,570
oil, it becomes a comment on the
age that we live in, and

105
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,460
it becomes one person's
representation, an indexical

106
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,270
relationship with that
particular road trip.

107
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:17,570
Ed Ruscha, a relaxing Catholic
so to speak, he likens this to

108
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,810
the 14 stations of the cross
and the relationship that

109
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,980
America had with gasoline in
that 1960s period, almost like

110
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,790
a spiritual age of reawakening
and the road trip.

111
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,180
All those things condensed quite
nicely into that one

112
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,770
series of images.

113
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,419
So here are some interesting
tips on how you might begin

114
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,550
working in that genre of the
document photograph.

115
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,340
And it all comes down
to the way you're

116
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,842
going to use your camera.

117
00:05:44,842 --> 00:05:47,190
There's a bit of a resurgence at
the moment happening around

118
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:51,310
photography and the old school
retro style cameras with the

119
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,040
manual settings and the way that
you interact with lenses

120
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,790
and manual focusing, and
all of these things.

121
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,930
And while they're very
interesting, what it points to

122
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,730
is that if you're going to be
responding to the world that

123
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,880
you see and the constructing
or coming up with different

124
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,550
ideas and searching for those
ideas that you can photograph,

125
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,320
you need to be pretty quick.

126
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,070
You need to be able to respond
almost instantly to something

127
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,400
that you might see as a way of
referencing the documentary

128
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,650
style of photography.

129
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,310
So I suggest that if you have
a camera and it is your

130
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,440
camera, that you spend a bit
of time becoming really

131
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,430
familiar with these controls.

132
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,640
In fact, back in the 1960s
when most documentary

133
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,169
photographers were using manual
Leica cameras, which is

134
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:41,210
a bit of a stylistic approach
now, they would spend a lot of

135
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,049
time doing that very thing
and practicing.

136
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,620
And if they were just standing
around with their camera

137
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,640
they'd look at something and
go, eh, that's about three

138
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,289
metres away.

139
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,430
They'd dial in three metres on
their focus but also look at

140
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,700
the light and think, well, that
light's just changed a

141
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,250
little bit, so I might have to
open up my shutter or open up

142
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,320
the aperture and increase
my shutter speed.

143
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,010
Make those controls, make those
adjustments so that when

144
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,500
something does happen, you're
ready to respond and you're

145
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,550
ready to photograph
right there.

146
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,490
Australian artist Matthew Sleeth
here in his photograph

147
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,180
of Australian pop icon Kylie
Minogue encapsulates what I

148
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,180
was talking about being able
to respond to a moment.

149
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,010
These sorts of moments come
by very fleetingly.

150
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,860
And Matthew was able to position
himself and to be

151
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,420
able to frame that image exactly
the way that he wanted

152
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,620
to see it and take that
amazing photograph.

153
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,500
In the reverse of that, Matthew
also does stage

154
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,220
photography where he's looking
at commenting on a document of

155
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,100
a particular moment in time.

156
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,320
And this image in Tokyo of the
woman sitting in the bar by

157
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,760
herself waiting for something to
happen, waiting for someone

158
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,830
to arrive, gives us a bit of an
insight into the lives of

159
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,370
these people, and it also taps
into that anxiety that we

160
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,190
might feel ourselves when we're
sitting alone waiting

161
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,300
for someone to arrive
or waiting for

162
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,550
something to happen.

163
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,325
