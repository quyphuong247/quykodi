2
00:00:09,912 --> 00:00:13,200
What's really interesting is
that photography and computers

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,280
have a unique shared history.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,880
 

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,290
beginnings and intersects
quite nicely now through

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,029
contemporary photography.

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,600
In 1839, Fox Talbot created
the negative-positive

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,420
photographic process.

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,740
At the same time, or around the
same time, Charles Babbage

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,570
was inventing and coming up with
the differential engine,

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,850
which was a way of calculating
the difference between two

12
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,860
numbers, which began as
the modern computer.

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,710
You will have heard me say this
before in this course.

14
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,780
But to be a better photographer,
I believe you

15
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,200
absolutely must understand the
connection between hardware

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,880
and creativity.

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,800
You really need to know that
connection between the devices

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,949
that you're using and how
you need to use them.

19
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,180
On that topic of photography and
technology, there's a nice

20
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,980
ongoing relationship that
photography has with

21
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,040
technology, which is to say that
it's always existed using

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,640
the highest technology
of the time.

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,640
Back in the 1830s and
1840s, it was

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,850
through optics and chemistry.

25
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,179
As we shifted into the
mechanical and industrial era,

26
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,340
it was through that
mechanical device.

27
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,370
As we moved then into the
electronic era in the '80s and

28
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,650
'90s, photography was right
at the forefront with

29
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,620
electronics.

30
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,150
And now as we're moving into the
digital age, photography

31
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,040
is right there, as well, using
that kind of technology as a

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,540
way of making photographic
images.

33
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,515
We need to realise that the
role that computers are

34
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:49,580
playing with photography is
becoming more and more

35
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,890
critical and relates to how we
use our cameras and how we

36
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,450
might equip ourselves for
a digital darkroom.

37
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,320
It's also worth noting that
even our cameras have

38
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,500
incredibly powerful computers
inside them that are

39
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,260
processing and dealing with
those photographic images as

40
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,590
we are capturing them.

41
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,170
And if you trace back that
history of digital

42
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,750
photography, yes, the megapixel
count goes up, so

43
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,580
that our cameras are capturing
more and more detail and more

44
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,870
data, making bigger images.

45
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,050
But the computers inside the
cameras are also becoming

46
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,780
increasingly more powerful
to process those images.

47
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,590
Of all the devices that we use
in our digital darkroom, the

48
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,800
monitor is probably the most
critical and certainly

49
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,300
something that we should
never overlook.

50
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,150
When we use our monitor,
that's how

51
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,390
we're seeing the image.

52
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,380
And that's how we're editing
the image on our screen.

53
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,859
So a monitor that can give us
good acutance and sharpness,

54
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,880
that can give us increasingly
more accurate colour

55
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,549
separation and saturation, as
well as a good strong tonal

56
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,720
scale, is an incredibly
important

57
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,280
part of that process.

58
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,920
And I would recommend that you
pay attention to the way that

59
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,350
your monitor is set up and make
sure that you can see all

60
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,549
of that information that is in
the photograph and that is

61
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,290
indeed visible on the monitor.

62
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,090
In this image that you'll see
on the screen now, you can

63
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,880
tell that there is a difference
between monitor A

64
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,900
and monitor B. Monitor A
is the correct image.

65
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,840
Monitor B has contrast
that is way too high.

66
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,200
And you can see that whilst
those numbers are the same--

67
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,690
the red, green, and blue values;
the hue saturation and

68
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,770
brightness--

69
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,470
they're exactly the same in
monitor A and monitor B--

70
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,260
the rendition of tone in monitor
A is more accurate,

71
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,870
whereas in monitor
B, it's too dark.

72
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,820
Therefore, you can't see
that shadow detail.

73
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,400
However, there is an interesting
comparison that we

74
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,250
need to make here between the
image on the monitor-- or the

75
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,410
monitor image--

76
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,829
and the enlarger in a
traditional darkroom.

77
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,940
What we see on the monitor
is not the end result.

78
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,190
If we're making prints, we can't
actually see a print on

79
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,040
the screen.

80
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,850
We need to use our judgement and
make the monitor work for

81
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,120
us so that we are able to make
those edits and make an

82
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,430
accurate print.

83
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,399
It is important to note,
however, that if the monitor

84
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,510
is not your end result, if you
do want to make beautiful

85
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,039
prints, then the monitor cannot
give you the texture of

86
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,790
the paper, the viewing distance,
or the physicality

87
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,020
of that print.

88
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,060
If you are interested in setting
up a digital darkroom,

89
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,880
there are a couple of
other considerations

90
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,659
to take into account.

91
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,150
Once you've got the monitor set
up, you'll need a computer

92
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,020
that is relatively fast and
able to process lots of

93
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,150
information.

94
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,599
So the CPU is important.

95
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,360
RAM is really critical because
all of our images

96
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,480
get stored in RAM.

97
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,990
So the more of that you have,
the easier it's going to be to

98
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,520
work with your images.

99
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,940
And then a fast hard drive
is also important.

100
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,630
You can talk to your computer
specialist about these things.

101
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,650
Tell them you want something
for photographic imaging.

102
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,280
But the only other thing to
consider is that whilst you

103
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,539
can work with slower machines,
and that's fine, but relating

104
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,120
to that photographic experience
is important.

105
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,080
And capturing images is an
instantaneous moment.

106
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,140
So we don't want to be sitting
around waiting for hours

107
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,630
whilst our images are processing
or doing the sorts

108
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,250
of things that we
need it to do.

109
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,200
Back in the beginning days of
digital photography, in the

110
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,880
early '90s, I can remember
making a very simple tonal

111
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,590
adjustment and then having to
go get a cup of tea while I

112
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,739
waited for the computer
to process that.

113
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,490
It's interruptive.

114
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,640
And it doesn't make for
a flowing photographic

115
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,890
experience.

116
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,716
