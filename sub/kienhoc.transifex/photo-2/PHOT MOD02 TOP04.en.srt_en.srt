00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:13,730
Modern cameras have lots of
controls, lots of buttons,

3
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,500
lots of menus, and all sorts of
settings that you can use

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,470
to determine a range
of different

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,400
functions on your camera.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,419
I'm just going to cover a
couple of these here.

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,960
I think they're important to
know and also give you the

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,910
option of exploring them further
in your own time when

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,320
you understand some of those
core principles.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,790
So the first thing you need to
choose, I think, is which mode

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,860
you're going to use to determine
how you engage with

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,540
the light meter in
your camera.

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,980
And most cameras will
have a couple of

14
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,389
different modes on them.

15
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,110
This one here has got P for
Programme, which means that it

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,570
will select both the aperture
and the shutter speed.

17
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:57,010
If I move around here to a TV,
which stands for Time Value,

18
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,720
you tell it what shutter
speed you want to use.

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,900
It will determine what aperture
it needs to use in

20
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,039
order to get that correct
exposure.

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,900
If you move it around to AV,
which is Aperture Value, you

22
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,900
set the aperture.

23
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,100
It will determine what shutter
speed it needs to use.

24
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,679
And then, finally, here we've
got Manual or M, which means

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,570
you set both.

26
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,029
I have a preference, because I'm
a landscape photographer.

27
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,690
And I think, for me,
the aperture is the

28
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,340
most important function.

29
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,080
We'll see later why when we
look at depth of field.

30
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,190
But I tend to prefer to
select my aperture.

31
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,080
If you're going to be doing a
lot of sports or action-type

32
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,039
photography, you put it on a
shutter speed that's going to

33
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,450
freeze action.

34
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,200
And it will set the aperture
for you to

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,240
get that right exposure.

36
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,320
It's kind of interesting,
because some of the more

37
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,309
modern cameras today even have a
whole range of other options

38
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,120
or shooting modes that could
choose, ranging from macro to

39
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,070
landscape to action photography
and, can you

40
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,210
believe it, pet photography.

41
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,089
But all they're doing is
selecting one of these options

42
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:02,960
there for you.

43
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,279
So it's not really
adding to the

44
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,030
functionality of the camera.

45
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,990
But if you're not certain about
what sort of option you

46
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,860
need to choose and you do know,
for example, that you

47
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,200
are going to be doing sports
photography, by all means,

48
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,530
choose that setting.

49
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,310
And you'll be able to work out
what's happening, so that it

50
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,590
will educate you and give you
more of an idea of what your

51
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,780
camera is doing.

52
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,910
Another really important setting
that we have on our

53
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,710
cameras is just how
we use focus.

54
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,920
Now, I think you should just
use auto focus and

55
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,899
be done with it.

56
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,520
You can discuss the merits of
manual focusing and auto

57
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,990
focusing in the forums.

58
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,330
But for here, just
use auto focus.

59
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,610
It's fast.

60
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,650
It focuses.

61
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,090
It will capture everything
that you need to do.

62
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,390
Most cameras will give you
different types of focusing--

63
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,980
single-shot focusing, where
you point it at something.

64
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,720
You hear the beep.

65
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,340
You know It's in focus.

66
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,090
Or if you're tracking a moving
subject, where you need to be

67
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,300
doing this, it will
keep maintaining

68
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,980
that focus for you.

69
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,329
I generally use the
single-shot focus.

70
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,910
But don't forget, you
can frame it.

71
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,660
You can hear it go into focus.

72
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,930
And you can recompose your
image, so that the thing you

73
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,680
focus on doesn't always have
to be in the centre.

74
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,260
Earlier on, when I accused light
metres of being dumb

75
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,209
devices, I talked about the
idea of shifting that

76
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,010
exposure, so that we can
compensate for any

77
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,230
inaccuracies that that
light metre picks up.

78
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,780
I also used that demonstration
of the beach.

79
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,700
Well, I've got another
beach here.

80
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,940
But this time, it's a wide
shot of a beach.

81
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,430
And you can see just what I mean
and how we can use some

82
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,970
of the mechanical options on our
camera to correct for that

83
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,680
in accuracy.

84
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,310
We use what we call exposure
compensation.

85
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,720
And all that does is use the
set exposure that the light

86
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,140
metre gives us and then dial in
either a positive value or

87
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,109
a negative value, depending on
whether we want to over or

88
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:58,240
under expose to compensate
for that setting.

89
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,760
In this first image, you can
see that the sand really is

90
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,299
not exposed well.

91
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,450
Using the average exposure
setting, I've simply just

92
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,440
framed it and taken the shot.

93
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,410
And the histogram is too low.

94
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,579
The sand is being positioned as
a middle value, rather than

95
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,269
being up higher along
that histogram.

96
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,640
And it just doesn't
really work.

97
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,529
If I use the exposure
compensation dial on my

98
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:25,770
camera, as you can see here,
then you can tell that by

99
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,810
lifting that up slightly and, in
this case, just two stops,

100
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,670
that the sand sits where
sand needs to sit.

101
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,630
It's more of a highlight
value.

102
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,070
And overall, that scene receives
the correct type of

103
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,300
exposure to replicate what it
is that I was looking at.

104
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,550
