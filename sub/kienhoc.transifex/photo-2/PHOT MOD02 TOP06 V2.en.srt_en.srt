00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,970
https://youtu.be/XvvIwE3c2nc

2
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:10,560
All right.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,380
Let's talk about raw.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,020
I think raw is one of the best
things to happen to digital

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,710
photography, and this topic is
really important in terms of

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,340
how we understand that image
quality and the way that we

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,880
can use our cameras.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,270
Professional photographers who
care about quality and who

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,980
care about controlling their
image, they will shoot raw,

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,420
and I think you should
as well.

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,110
And if you don't, you should
have a try and just see what

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,420
happens and whether or not you
value the sorts of control

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,620
that you can get out
of shooting raw.

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,629
In the last topic, I talked
about that raw-jpeg

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,860
comparison.

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,210
First and foremost, when you
shoot raw, you don't have to

17
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,650
worry about white balance.

18
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,000
You don't have to worry about
the picture style.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,950
You don't have to worry about
colour profiles or any of

20
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,910
those things because you are in
fact tapping into the raw

21
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,649
information that comes
off that sensor.

22
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,100
There's no compression.

23
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,820
There's no loss of quality.

24
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,699
There's just the raw information
from the sensor,

25
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,550
which you then process and make
all sorts of creative

26
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:20,060
decisions about how you value
and prefer your information

27
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,980
from that file.

28
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,810
That post-production aspect of
raw photography is a really

29
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,680
exciting and interesting way to
improve the quality of your

30
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,300
images, but also to help you
determine just how you want to

31
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,960
make your photographs.

32
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,330
Whether you want more intensity
in the sky, whether

33
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,649
you want more clarity and
sharpness in the foreground.

34
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,630
How you actually want to process
your images and the

35
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,449
things that you value can be
really controlled through

36
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,700
working with this raw format.

37
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,500
Now there's one other really
interesting part of raw, and I

38
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,860
think this is one of the best
reasons why we should be

39
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,460
working with it.

40
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,199
When I talked a couple of topics
ago about 8-bits and

41
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,889
levels and tone, and I got to
that magic number of 256, I

42
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:11,880
was talking about jpeg images.

43
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,769
Raw files exceed that number.

44
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,810
Depending on the type of camera
that you have, it's

45
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,570
often 10 bits, 12 bits,
sometimes even 16 bits worth

46
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,750
of information.

47
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:30,220
So the jpeg, at 8 bits, gives
us 256 levels of tone.

48
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:35,270
A raw file can be upwards of
65,000 levels of tone.

49
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,080
So you have all this extra
information to work with, all

50
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,400
this detail and texture and
tonality that a raw file has

51
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,210
as an advantage over
our jpeg images.

52
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,970
And that reason there is
probably one of the main

53
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,460
reasons why you should think
about shooting with raw files.

54
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,690
There's one other really
important thing that we need

55
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,140
to know about raw capture.

56
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,899
When we expose our image,
certain things happen because

57
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,260
raw files don't get captured in
the same way that say, for

58
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,530
example, film used
to be captured.

59
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,410
Remember in that earlier topic
I talked about apertures

60
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,450
doubling and halving
and shutter speeds

61
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,709
doubling and halving.

62
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:19,000
Well, the same thing applies
with raw capture, or even with

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,650
digital capture, and
that all of our

64
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,120
values double and halve.

65
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,380
You can see in this diagram
here that I've got, at the

66
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,560
top, an 8-bit digital camera
capture, with it's 256 levels

67
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,210
of tone, and then down below,
I've got a 12-bit digital

68
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,570
camera capture with its
4,096 levels of tone.

69
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:45,630
As we move down those tones,
every time we halve the image

70
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,065
or the value of toning the
image, we get a different

71
00:03:49,065 --> 00:03:51,109
f-stop of exposure.

72
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,360
And you can see here when we
get down to those shadows,

73
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,260
with an 8-bit capture, we've
only really got anywhere

74
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,040
between 4 to 16 levels of tone
to capture that shadow

75
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,730
information.

76
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,829
That was if we were
shooting jpeg.

77
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:13,860
If we shot raw, we'd have 128
or more, even 256, levels of

78
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,800
tone, to capture those shadows
in that image.

79
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,760
One of the curses of digital
photography is noise and

80
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,020
posterisation, and if you get
your exposure wrong, that's

81
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,630
what you'll end up with.

82
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,780
In this image here, you can see
that cross section of the

83
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,539
window pane, where the noise
is really obvious.

84
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,340
That's because this image was
underexposed, which meant that

85
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,190
I really only had about
8 levels of tone to

86
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,510
capture that image.

87
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,280
It was shot on jpeg.

88
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,909
It just looks--

89
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,650
this is the technical word
here-- it looks yucky.

90
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,140
And we really don't want that
sort of image or that sort of

91
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,820
tone, posterisation,
and noise in our

92
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,780
shadows and in our images.

93
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,789
So shooting raw is a real
advantage in terms of how we

94
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:07,710
get rid of that, but also when
we shoot raw properly and we

95
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,289
expose it correctly.

96
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,600
The next thing we need to talk
about, and another one of

97
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,120
those real advantages of
raw, is that we get

98
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,960
to process our image.

99
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,250
So the raw file kind of becomes
our digital negative.

100
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,140
We can start with that file,
and we can output it to all

101
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,810
sorts of different locations.

102
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,610
We might want to make a really
high quality print.

103
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,210
We might want to make a really
compressed low quality web

104
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,620
file for that image.

105
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,970
Regardless of where it's going
to end up, the raw file

106
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:42,460
becomes like the negative or the
true version of our image.

107
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,180
Let's have a look at how
we might process

108
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,090
some of these things.

109
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,020
OK, so here we're in Lightroom,
and we have an

110
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,419
interesting image where
the sky needs a

111
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,790
little bit of treatment.

112
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,080
The foreground is probably a
little bit too bright, lacking

113
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,599
a bit of colour, and there's
some tonality and shadow

114
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,630
texture I'd like to
put in there.

115
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,680
But overall it's pretty good
exposure, and it's

116
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,020
not looking too bad.

117
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,599
Up there is my histogram,
which gives me a data

118
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,100
representation of what's
happening as I make the

119
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,060
adjustments in Lightroom.

120
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,470
My highlights aren't clipped.

121
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,540
My shadows aren't clipped.

122
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,170
Down here is my white balance.

123
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,630
I can choose whatever white
balance I like.

124
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,620
I can choose tungsten, which
looks pretty ugly.

125
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,850
I can use daylight.

126
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,220
They're sort of
self-explanatory, but most of

127
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,520
the time I'll just stick with
whatever is as shot.

128
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,565
Now as I move my exposure
slider, you can see how I push

129
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:34,660
and pull that histogram around,
and you can see the

130
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,680
correlating impact that
has on my image.

131
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,040
Tones become denser or they
become brighter, depending on

132
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,220
which area I do.

133
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,570
And I can also adjust that
histogram manually and push

134
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,909
and pull some of those values
around, depending on where I

135
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,830
actually want to place them
on that histogram.

136
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,690
That's a really interesting way
of doing it, and you can

137
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,550
see the correlating effect that

138
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,680
happens down on the sliders.

139
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,610
So I think that's looking
pretty good.

140
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,370
I'm happy with that
as an exposure.

141
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,100
I always like to put a
bit of clarity in.

142
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,730
That's just some edge presence
or some edge definition, makes

143
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,730
my image pop out a
little bit more.

144
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,730
One of my favourite options in
here under the luminance

145
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:17,880
section of HSL is that I can
adjust the brightness value of

146
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,450
specific individual colours,
which gives me a whole range

147
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:24,539
of options in terms of how I
might want to treat some of

148
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,690
those values in my image.

149
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,600
You can see here I'm pushing
and warming up

150
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,100
some of those reds.

151
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,310
I can add some yellow, or in
this case, subtract that

152
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,340
yellow, which gives me more
clarity, definition, and more

153
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,640
colour in that foreground
area that I thought

154
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,150
needed a bit of work.

155
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,299
Likewise with the greens and
the blues, any of those

156
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,140
colours that you think
will have an impact

157
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,800
on the overall effect.

158
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,960
And now we can see the before
and after, and you can see

159
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,289
that difference of what I've
done just from some basic

160
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,690
adjustments.

161
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,560
So raw really is
where it's at.

162
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,980
And I encourage you to follow
some of the links that we have

163
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,730
in these resources for you so
that you can fully explore

164
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,290
your options and just know what
it is that you're getting

165
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,540
yourself into.

166
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,480
