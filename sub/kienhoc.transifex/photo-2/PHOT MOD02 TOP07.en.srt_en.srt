2
00:00:10,045 --> 00:00:12,960
So I've been talking about this
thing called a histogram

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,240
quite a lot in the last
couple of topics.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,110
And I just want to spend a
little bit of time explaining

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,250
what happens with a histogram
and what it's actually telling

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,530
us about our image, because we
can get a lot of information

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,830
just from having a really simple
understanding of what

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,020
this means.

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,990
A histogram, most simply, is
a graphic representation of

10
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:37,210
where the data and photographic
values or total

11
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,810
values sit within our image.

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,320
And we get a couple of
measurements and a couple of

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,860
readouts on here.

14
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,130
Down on the bottom here, we've
just got our levels.

15
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,950
So that's from 0, which is
black, right up to white,

16
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,760
which if it's 8-bit,
would be 255.

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,250
And along here, we have the
number of pixels that are

18
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,710
represented at that
particular value.

19
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,569
Now, a histogram is like
a light metre.

20
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,840
It doesn't know what
the photograph is.

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,800
It doesn't know what it is that
you're trying to do with

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,910
your image.

23
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,929
It just gives us that data
graphic representation.

24
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,530
But we can get quite a lot
of information from that.

25
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,700
And we can measure whether our
exposure is accurate, whether

26
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,420
we're going to need to do
anything in post-processing,

27
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,750
for example, or, actually,
whether we might even need to

28
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,410
re-expose our image.

29
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:37,220
If I have a histogram that looks
like that, that's a bit

30
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,920
of a disaster really,
depending, of

31
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,120
course, on the subject.

32
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,630
But the blacks are right
up against here.

33
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,589
So there will be lots of tone or
lots of pixels in my image

34
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,200
that are just black,
pure black, so no

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,150
continuous tone there.

36
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,270
I've also got a lot
of missing tone.

37
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,759
So there's no highlights
in this image.

38
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,850
If I'm photographing myself
under low light,

39
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,410
that might be OK.

40
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,990
But if I'm photographing a
general outdoor scene, I'm

41
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,710
going to want to black values.

42
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,020
And I'm also going to want
to highlight values.

43
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,580
So in this instance
I would need to

44
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,180
expose that image again.

45
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,440
But I would need to give it
more time or more light.

46
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,480
Most cameras and some software
for even camera phones will

47
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,369
give us the option of being
able to see the histogram

48
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,390
after we've captured
our image.

49
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,760
On screen now, you can see a
histogram there that gives us

50
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,390
an indication that I've
got shadow values.

51
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,850
I've got lots of midtones
in there.

52
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,680
And I've also got some highlight
values, which means

53
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,740
that that's for that scene a
reasonably good exposure.

54
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:51,610
Likewise up here, something
like this tells me, for

55
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,150
example, the same
sort of thing.

56
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,420
There are shadow values.

57
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,970
There are midtone values.

58
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,310
There are highlight values.

59
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,840
But it also tells me that most
of the pixels in my image are

60
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,430
sitting around that middle
area in that tonal range,

61
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,150
where the highlights and the
shadows, it falls off.

62
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:16,440
And that's probably indicative
of most outdoor scenes.

63
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,410
And it's certainly indicative
of the way that cameras will

64
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,890
capture that information.

65
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,399
So check your histogram.

66
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,710
Make sure that you've got the
right amount of information in

67
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,640
your image.

68
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,059
And make sure that you're able
to work out just exactly what

69
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,700
this means.

70
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,940
So in the last topic, when we
talked about raw, I mentioned

71
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,820
that idea of how we might
consider the way that a raw

72
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,410
file or a digital
file is exposed.

73
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,210
And looking at this histogram,
we can get some more sense

74
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,040
about how that works.

75
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,160
Really, the rule that you need
to think about is that you're

76
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,859
better off exposing to the upper
end of the histogram or

77
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,490
exposed to the right rather than
down here, the lower end

78
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,040
of the histogram, because a lot
of the information sits up

79
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,269
here in that first stop of
exposure and sequentially

80
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,030
further and further down.

81
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,320
So the more you can get your
information that way, the more

82
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,959
clarity, the more definition,
and the less noise you're

83
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,180
going to have.

84
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,410
So raw and exposure and
histograms, they're all

85
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,720
interconnected.

86
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,950
And again, in the resources,
there are some wonderful links

87
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,840
to the sorts of places that you
can go to find out more

88
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,849
about this.

89
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,180
And there are several video
tutorials on Lynda.com that go

90
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,160
into a lot of detail and a
lot of depth about how

91
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,530
to process raw files.

92
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,849
And I encourage you to have
a look at some of those.

93
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,100
