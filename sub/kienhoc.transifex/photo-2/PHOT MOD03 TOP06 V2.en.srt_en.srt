00:00:09,803 --> 00:00:12,610
In this topic, we're looking
at global adjustments.

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,170
We talked about that earlier,
there being the two types of

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,200
adjustments that we might use.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,930
Global adjustments affect
the entire image.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,830
And it's usually the way that
we might control contrast,

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,400
density, colour saturation,
correct for colour, and

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,590
overall edits to the entire
image to either lift it and to

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,570
make it more in line with how we
might have visualised that

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,990
image or to simply
make corrections.

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,470
The way that we do global
adjustments is entirely

12
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,565
dependent on you.

13
00:00:40,565 --> 00:00:44,169
You might have a particular type
of working that you like.

14
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,380
Myself, I prefer to
use curves, as we

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,420
saw in the last topic.

16
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,600
But it's entirely up to the way
that you like to work as

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,240
to which type of edits
you choose.

18
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,350
Now, the way that you think
about global adjustments is

19
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,230
quite important.

20
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:06,729
We want to use a type of tool
that allows us to do exactly

21
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,070
what it is that we need to do.

22
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,809
And sometimes, that's making
the correction or sometimes

23
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,510
it's lifting the image and
achieving a certain feel or a

24
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,460
certain type of emotional
response to the way that you

25
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,699
think that image should be.

26
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,180
In Cairo, you can see that
there's a before and after.

27
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,030
In the before, the image
is quite flat.

28
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,820
Even though all the detail is
there-- even though I've got

29
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,990
black and I've got highlights
and there are midtones--

30
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,920
overall, that image is
lacking in contrast.

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,880
And it is slightly flat.

32
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,380
In the after image you can see,
through a simple tonal

33
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,339
adjustment, that contrast
is increased.

34
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,270
And I still have blacks
that I can see into.

35
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,220
I still have highlights.

36
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,440
But I have an overall image that
is much more satisfactory

37
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,500
in terms of the kinds of ideas
it's trying to convey.

38
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,370
You can now easily and
definitely see that long, hard

39
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,940
line where civilisation
meets the desert.

40
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,810
Colour correction is another
type of global adjustment that

41
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,220
pretty important in the way that
we work with our images.

42
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,750
In Hagia Sophia, you can
see the before image.

43
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,140
The stone is too green, and
it doesn't quite do

44
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,670
what it needs to do.

45
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,910
It's not quite cold enough.

46
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,500
And so what I need to do in
looking at this particular

47
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,480
image is I need to remove
some of that green.

48
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,970
And I need to make it colder
and more like stone.

49
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,570
But at the same time, I need
to make sure that I'm not

50
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,530
introducing a colour cast that
might be displeasing to the

51
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,970
way that we see that stone.

52
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,510
Also, in the foreground now,
you can see the ghost-like

53
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,910
image moving through.

54
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,200
So I want to make sure that
I maintain that particular

55
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,030
element of the image, as it adds
to the narrative of the

56
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,870
story that I'm trying to tell.

57
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,620
So by making a simple
colour adjustment--

58
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,810
and in the after image, you
can definitely see that--

59
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,160
it's much more like
a stone would be.

60
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,579
There's that coldness to it.

61
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,680
It's harder.

62
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,580
It has that emotional feeling
that you're more in line with

63
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,960
how a particular church
like that might seem.

64
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,180
When you're working with
Photoshop, you need to make a

65
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,810
choice about how you're going
to do those kinds of edits.

66
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,260
Now, a good friend of mine,
Les Walkling,

67
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,100
had a wonderful way of
describing two types of ways

68
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,829
of working in Photoshop, which
actually also translates quite

69
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,390
nicely into there are two types
of people in the way

70
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,910
they use Photoshop.

71
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,420
The first one are the
slider people.

72
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,769
And they generally opt for the
kinds of tools where it's

73
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,280
basically sliding adjustments
and you can see the response

74
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,820
directly on the screen.

75
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,049
And things like brightness and
contrast, colour balance, hue

76
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:50,830
saturation--

77
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,480
they're all slider controls that
we can use that allow us

78
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,570
to make those individual
adjustments quite easily.

79
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,359
And we can use all of those as
adjustment layers so we can

80
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,330
build and layer up our
image as we go.

81
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,470
The other type of user
is the curve user.

82
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,240
Now, the curve user is a little
bit more mathematical

83
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,040
in the way that they
think about things.

84
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,940
They like the precision of how
they might make those edits.

85
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,540
And they like to do as much as
possible with one simple tool.

86
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,510
So you can edit the red, green,
and blue-- which is

87
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,330
your tonal channel--
in curves.

88
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,219
Or you can select each of those
individual channels, and

89
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,040
they become your colour balance
adjustments in that

90
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,290
particular dialogue box.

91
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,360
So if you're a slider person,
fantastic, if there's no

92
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,540
preference over one
or the other.

93
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,130
But think about yourself in
terms of the way that you

94
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,659
might like to use
those controls.

95
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,143
