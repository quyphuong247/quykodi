2
00:00:10,058 --> 00:00:12,330
Following on from the last
topic on constructed

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,420
narrative, here we have with us
Bronek Kozka, who's going

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,920
to explain in more detail what
it is that he looks for when

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,460
he makes his images and how he
sets them up and the sorts of

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,180
things that he does in order
to take these constructed

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,330
narratives.

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,080
So Bronek, can you tell me
a little bit about your

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,099
background and how you came to
discover or work out your

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,270
visual language?

11
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,410
Yeah, well, my background is as
a commercial photographer.

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,699
So I was working with
large-scale advertising

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:42,090
images, working with a crew,
cast, talent, hair and makeup.

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,060
So when it came to wanting
to produce my own work, I

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,750
basically employed the same
approach and found that that

16
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,140
was how I could best communicate
my ideas.

17
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,170
Now, there's also a real
definite style approach in the

18
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,280
way that you construct your
stories and evolve those

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,690
constructed narratives.

20
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,260
Can you tell us a little bit
about your intentions and what

21
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,076
you're trying to do there?

22
00:01:02,076 --> 00:01:06,380
So the idea with having a
stylised approach to this is

23
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,770
to really engage the person
that's viewing the image.

24
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,770
I'm taking very simple memories,
very simple domestic

25
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,110
scenes, and recreating them.

26
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,429
They're usually taken from
memories, so recreating them.

27
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,580
And every part of that image is
intentional, so the props

28
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,080
that go into it, the selection
of the talent, the background

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,050
story that I give the people
that are in there acting.

30
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,370
They all have a very purposeful
intention with what

31
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,450
they're doing.

32
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,760
And then adding to that
is the lighting.

33
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,570
So all of this comes together.

34
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,389
The idea is to capture the
person who's viewing it so

35
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,420
they become very interested
in it.

36
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,780
The stylised look also relates
to the language of cinema.

37
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,370
And when people look
at it, do they

38
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,170
understand it to be a memory?

39
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,380
Or do they understand it
to be a film still?

40
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,619
There's always this tension,
because they're unsure where

41
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,140
it's actually coming from.

42
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,000
So when you were describing that
process, there's clearly

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,580
a fairly astute idea around
concept and technology.

44
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,420
And you've got some really
interesting ideas.

45
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,359
Can you tell us a little bit
about that technical process?

46
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,630
We've been talking a lot about
this idea of visualisation and

47
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,790
how you see something and then
how you make the image in

48
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,870
relation to what
you're seeing.

49
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,990
So with that, is
that everything

50
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,910
that you see on set?

51
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,850
Or is there post-processing
involved?

52
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,780
And how do you draw those
connections together?

53
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,410
With every shoot, there's
pre-production, the actual

54
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,470
shoot, and then post-production.

55
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,130
Now, the amount of work that
goes into the pre-production

56
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,000
is crucial.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,690
It's one of the most
important stages.

58
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:50,230
Every detail, every choice,
lighting selection of any prop

59
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,679
within it is made
at that point.

60
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,330
I see the process on the shoot
day as almost automatic.

61
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,870
You've done all this work.

62
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,360
You have everything
ready to go.

63
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,300
And it's a matter of just
flicking a switch.

64
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,170
And then the rest of the thing
takes care of itself.

65
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,470
That's the ideal.

66
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:10,116
So we have an image or
originally I'll have an idea

67
00:03:10,116 --> 00:03:11,100
or I'll have a concept.

68
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,160
It'll be memory that I
want to work with.

69
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,390
Then I'll start working
that up.

70
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,769
And it will go from a sketch
through to a lighting diagram

71
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,120
through to a selection of
choices of what will actually

72
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,630
be in that.

73
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,500
And everything is built
from the ground up.

74
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,340
When we're ready to shoot, all
of that is signed off.

75
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,770
And I use that, because I think
of this in terms of

76
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,600
being almost like the client
and then the person who's

77
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,989
producing the shot.

78
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,190
So I have these two things
that are going on.

79
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,010
On the day of the shoot, we
systematically work through to

80
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,125
produce that result.

81
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,790
And we don't go off
on a tangent.

82
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,400
We don't start creating
something new.

83
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,770
That can happen another
time in another shoot.

84
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,620
We produce that actual shot.

85
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,950
And what tends to come out, if
I've done everything really

86
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,700
well and it's all come together,
is the vision that I

87
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,549
had originally is
what comes out.

88
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,610
Post-production is fairly
straightforward.

89
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,150
It's just a matter of
tone and grading.

90
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,065
There's not a lot of retouching
that goes on there.

91
00:04:07,065 --> 00:04:09,650
So Bronek, one of the other
things that I often talk about

92
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:14,340
is this idea of where ideas come
from and who or even what

93
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,510
sort of things inform the way
that you view the world and

94
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,930
then make your work.

95
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,860
Can you tell us a little
bit about that?

96
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,190
I guess one of things that
inspires me most is actually

97
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,090
looking a light.

98
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,070
Obviously, I'm inspired by the
stories that I want to tell

99
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,640
and the memories.

100
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,020
But the way of communicating is
really through using light.

101
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,080
When you start to really look
at light that's out there in

102
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,340
the environment, you see
these subtleties.

103
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,869
The eye compensates for a lot.

104
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,930
And we get this general
almost haze of light.

105
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,540
But if you start to look at
things, you really start to

106
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,050
see details appear and things
recede into shadow.

107
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,750
So even with the lights that are
in the studio with us now,

108
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,410
if we turn one of those lights
off, you'll see a dramatic

109
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,850
change in how my face
is represented.

110
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,790
Then we turn that back on, and
you just see this more general

111
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,720
soft light.

112
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,410
So that drama you can really
capture with lights.

113
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,090
And that's what I like to try
and bring into the images

114
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,820
where I'm controlling the light
and creating the vision

115
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,830
that you see.

116
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,000
OK.

117
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,380
So Bronek, let's have a look
at some of your images.

118
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,950
This first one here, Kew
House: Dinner Time.

119
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,830
Can you tell us a little bit how
you constructed that and

120
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:24,250
how you lit it and where it fits
in with a bigger plan?

121
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:24,510
OK.

122
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,340
So Kew House: Dinner Time, the
idea comes from me remembering

123
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,940
going to families for dinner.

124
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,350
And they were very different
to our family, because they

125
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,410
were very stayed,
quiet events.

126
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,400
My background was dinners
were a bit more lively.

127
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,450
So in the lighting, in the
choice of location, in the

128
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,920
choice of talent, I really
wanted to communicate this

129
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,330
sombre, disconnected feel.

130
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,020
So Kew House: Dinner Time is
part of a series of four

131
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,180
images that follows a
progression of a family

132
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,740
throughout the night.

133
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,440
The dinner aspect of it is
really about the disconnection

134
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,360
of the characters.

135
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,050
And if you look at the line
of sight, almost nobody is

136
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,740
looking at each other.

137
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,550
So I wanted to emphasise
that by the props

138
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,000
and also by the lighting.

139
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,330
So each person within there
is lit by their

140
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,909
own individual light.

141
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,210
It's almost like these are
four separate portraits

142
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,630
composited together.

143
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,290
Of course, it's taken
as one shot.

144
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,420
That's a great image.

145
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,950
And that's a really interesting
way of talking

146
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,700
about the individual portrait
and the way that you're

147
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,190
constructing the events
and how that unfolds.

148
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,950
And that's a great interior.

149
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,270
Can you tell us now about an
exterior shot and how you

150
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,960
might have constructed
something like that?

151
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,229
OK.

152
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,240
So Sunshine House was a
very dramatic scene.

153
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,790
And probably out of the images
from that series, it's one

154
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,980
that the really borrows
most from cinema.

155
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:51,440
It's a very highly charged
interaction of a couple--

156
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,120
we presume they're a couple--

157
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,650
and then another character
who's wearing a suit, who

158
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,530
we're really unsure who he is.

159
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,479
Now, when I came up with this
image originally, it was from

160
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,490
a recollection when I was a kid
and we're represented, I

161
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,720
should say, by the character
in the foreground who's

162
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,510
viewing this whole scene.

163
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,969
But I had a very clear idea of
who the characters were, what

164
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,260
was happening, what
the story was.

165
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,099
And that's how I briefed
my actors.

166
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,160
But I found it was
interesting.

167
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,290
When this was then taken out
and shown, it was much more

168
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,100
interesting to see what
people brought to it.

169
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,195
They were bringing their
own baggage to

170
00:07:23,195 --> 00:07:24,980
it, their own stories.

171
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,320
I found that a lot more
interesting than imposing my

172
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,190
view on it.

173
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,270
So although I totally construct
the scene and the

174
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,120
scene is lit-- again, we've got
a lot of outdoor lighting

175
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,140
going on there--

176
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,840
it's very, very controlled.

177
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,400
There's still this opportunity
for people to use these images

178
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,551
as a kind of springboard into
their own memories and their

179
00:07:41,552 --> 00:07:43,040
own reflections.

180
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,290
So that idea of the constructed
narrative and

181
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,300
allowing other people to bring
their own stories to it and

182
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,770
overlay that on the sorts of
things that you're trying to

183
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,000
do, that creates a really
interesting dynamic about just

184
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,030
whose story we're trying to tell
but also how that becomes

185
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,176
visualised.

186
00:07:59,176 --> 00:07:59,560
Yeah.

187
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,710
Well, I see my role
as twofold.

188
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,599
I want to communicate
my story.

189
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,050
And that's the first
part of it.

190
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,670
And then I want people to engage
with that but not in a

191
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,260
passive way.

192
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,610
I want them to be active with
the way they engage with it.

193
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,610
I want them to therefore then
go off on their own story.

194
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,070
It also means that the work
seems to work on a few

195
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,870
different levels.

196
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,880
You can look at it purely as a
way of stimulating memories.

197
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,640
Or you can really look
at it on a way

198
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,760
of reexamining yourself.

199
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,330
And that's where I find it
becomes really interesting.

200
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,450
Well, Bronek, that's been really
interesting insight

201
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,510
into the way that someone
makes their work.

202
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,630
So thank you very much
for coming in.

203
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,130
Now, when you're doing this
course, we've got those

204
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,820
resources for you that you can
have a look at yourself.

205
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,710
And you can just check out the
connections between the

206
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,810
lighting diagrams, for example,
and how Bronek sets

207
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,329
all of that up and the effect
that that will have on the

208
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,580
images that he's taken.

209
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,666
