00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:10,460


3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,210
Let's talk about light metres.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,550
In the last module, we looked
at shutter speeds and

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,460
apertures, and the way that they
determine how our images

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,780
are exposed.

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,520
Well, now I want to talk about
what happens inside the camera

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,689
to determine those values, and
how we arrive at the aperture

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,280
and the shutter speed.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,549
Now, light metres are not
particularly smart.

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,780
They have no idea what
they're looking at.

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,280
They don't know that
it's a person that

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,270
you're in love with.

14
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:39,880
They don't know that
it's a pet.

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,440
They don't know it's a
landscape that you're

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,820
interested in reproducing.

17
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,790
They have no idea what it is
that you're looking at.

18
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,200
They just measure the dynamic
range in the scene, the

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,970
darkest dark, the brightest
brightness.

20
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,300
And they average that out to
give us what we call an

21
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,510
exposure value, which then
translates into that shutter

22
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,380
speed and that aperture to give
us a balanced exposure.

23
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,830
Now, because they don't know
what they're looking at, they

24
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,789
can quite often get it wrong.

25
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,090
So as photographers, if we're
going to be exploring this

26
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,190
more precise way of working with
our cameras, we need to

27
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,550
have an idea of what that means,
and work out exactly

28
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,429
how we can correlate that, and
check to make sure we're

29
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,520
getting the right exposure.

30
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,369
So let's have a look at some
examples of when a light metre

31
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,450
gets it wrong, and how we might
be able to correct for

32
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,010
that kind of error.

33
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,010
The first image I've got up
here is of a black wall.

34
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:45,670
Now, as the metre says, AMS
tells me that that black wall

35
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,810
has been averaged to try and
create something that is the

36
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,840
difference between the
extreme highlights

37
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,470
and the darkest darks.

38
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:58,350
But because it's just a black
wall, there are no extremes.

39
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,009
So the average simply lifts it
up, and puts that into the

40
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,400
position of a grey--

41
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,539
what is essentially a poorly
exposed image.

42
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:12,540
The second half of that image,
which is the afterimage, shows

43
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,260
me what happens when I set
that as the metre says.

44
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,739
But I underexpose it by three
stops to try and position that

45
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,900
black in the right location.

46
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,750
And that, in fact, gives me
the correct exposure.

47
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,660
Now, the reason that this is
easy to understand for digital

48
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,410
imaging is that we get an actual
readout that tells us

49
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,380
how the camera has exposed
those values.

50
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,320
Remember we talked about levels,
and that black is down

51
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,320
one end, and white is
up the other end?

52
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,720
Those numbers are quite
easy to remember.

53
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,760
Black equals 0, and
white equals 255.

54
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,760
When you look at a histogram,
which as a graphic

55
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,980
representation of those levels,
you can see exactly

56
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,769
where those tones fall.

57
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,880
And in this case, as the metre
says, they were positioned in

58
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,400
the centre, which is grey,
or middle, values.

59
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,390
Whereas when I underexposed it
by three stops, you could see

60
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,149
those tones were shifted into
the correct position, which

61
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,420
was much closer to 0, or
much closer to black.

62
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,390
The second image that we can
see here is the same as the

63
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,380
black wall, but it's
just the opposite.

64
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,269
It's a white cupboard door.

65
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,860
And the same thing applies,
except this time, rather than

66
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,000
underexposing it by three
stops, I simply had to

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,790
overexpose it by three stops to
push those values up closer

68
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,120
towards the highlight area, and
get the reproduction of

69
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,070
the tone that is actually
in that white cupboard.

70
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,570
Now, they're pretty abstract
kind of examples, and they

71
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,650
were more just to show you
what happens when a light

72
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,600
metre does the thing that
a light metre does.

73
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,049
This last image here
is of sand.

74
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,100
Now, sand is not
a middle value.

75
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,260
Sand is always much brighter,
certainly in sunlight.

76
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,840
When you go to the beach in
summer, the sand is probably

77
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,670
more like two stops above
that middle tonal value.

78
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,859
So when you expose for sand, if
you let the metre give you

79
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,050
the response, it's going
to be too dark.

80
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,089
When you actually overexpose
that sand area--

81
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:22,800
when you tell the metre, hey,
come on, mate, I'm actually

82
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,570
exposing sand here, in sunlight,
not some wishy-washy

83
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,780
grey area--

84
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,659
then it does the right thing.

85
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,080
So those examples give us an
indication of just what a

86
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,000
light metre is capable
of doing.

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,660
But more importantly, it tells
us that we need to be able to

88
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,670
understand how they work
to make sure they

89
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,340
do the right thing.

90
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,590
So when we use our cameras, we
can determine not only what we

91
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,510
point the camera at, but also
the kind of metering that we

92
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,460
choose to use.

93
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,630
And most cameras, and certainly
ones like this, will

94
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,110
have multiple metering modes
that we can check.

95
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,580
So if we look at what I want to
photograph, and I set that

96
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,930
frame up, I need to
know, then, how

97
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,250
that's going to be exposed.

98
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,120
And it's quite simple.

99
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,490
I'll just take a shot, and I'll
check the histogram on

100
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:15,210
the back of my camera, and it
tells me that actually, that's

101
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:15,840
not too bad.

102
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,090
That gives me the correct
exposure.

103
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,640
But if it didn't, all I can do
is just change one of these

104
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,000
metering modes away from, in
this case, what I have here,

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,490
which is matrix metering,
or pattern mentoring.

106
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,210
I can put that on to
center-weighted metering, or I

107
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,239
can put it onto spot metering.

108
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,910
And those two different types
tell the camera that yes, this

109
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,640
is the scene that's
being framed.

110
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,200
But privilege most of the
exposure in the centre area of

111
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,560
that frame, or into a spot area
of that frame, even more

112
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,250
so, so that if you are inside
a dark tunnel, for example,

113
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,430
and you want to expose for
what's outside the tunnel,

114
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,940
that you would then use one of
those center-metering modes.

115
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,580
Or another example would be if
you're photographing someone,

116
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,530
and the light's coming in from
different angles, or slightly

117
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,219
behind them, you might then want
to privilege the metering

118
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,980
to happen on the centre
of that frame.

119
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,427
