2
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:11,830
One of the things that we
need to be aware of with

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,830
photography is this idea of
scale and the size of our

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,360
images and the physical
relationship that a viewer

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,530
might have with your
photographs.

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,000
There's a bit of plague
happening in photography at

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,540
the moment, I think.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,860
And that is that there's not
so much prints being made.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,509
People are looking at their
images on iPhones.

10
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:34,210
And they're photographing
with iPhones.

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,830
And they're looking at
images on phones.

12
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,610
And I'm sorry, but this is
no way to take a photo.

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,480
And it's certainly no way to
look at a photograph either.

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,769
I think that we need to be aware
of that relationship

15
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,070
between the image and the world
that we're imaging and

16
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,900
the size and the physicality of
how a viewer relates back

17
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,290
to those things.

18
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,700
In the earliest days of
photography, one of the new

19
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,420
inventions that emerged
was this idea of the

20
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,470
daguerreotype.

21
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,350
You can look this up.

22
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,330
It's a really interesting
process.

23
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,000
And it's basically everything
is one-off.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,100
And the size of the plate that
was used in the camera

25
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,890
determined the size
of the image.

26
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,020
Now, I have one here.

27
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,920
So this is about a 3 and 11/4
or a 3 and 1/2 inch plate,

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,600
which means that what was put
in the camera was this size.

29
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,399
And that became the
final image.

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,800
Probably the most interesting
thing about the daguerreotype

31
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,530
and the reason why it was
ultimately a failed medium is

32
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,830
that it was a singular, one-off
image and that is was

33
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:39,470
not reproducible in the same
way that Fox Talbot's

34
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,690
invention, which was the
negative/positive process,

35
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,289
became the standard version
of photography for

36
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,800
the next 150 years.

37
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,039
If you've got a printer at home
or if you're printing

38
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,010
your work anywhere, you'll
notice that there's lots of

39
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,160
different sizes that
we can choose.

40
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,479
And each of those different
sizes has a different

41
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,930
relationship to the way
that a viewer might

42
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,610
relate to those images.

43
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,530
This is an 8 by 10 inch
contact print.

44
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,200
And when I look at something
like this, it's still about

45
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,639
the size of my head.

46
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,580
That makes it a relatively
introspective kind of image.

47
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,380
It's me peering into
something.

48
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,750
And it's sort of looking
back at me.

49
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,170
It becomes more about myself.

50
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,269
Whereas something like this,
which is slightly bigger, it

51
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,700
becomes more immersive
and more engaging

52
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,130
beyond the size of myself.

53
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:32,109
And so an image at this scale,
which is roughly A3 or super

54
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,400
A3 for inkjet printers, or 11 by
14 in inches, that gives us

55
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,530
a bigger, more expansive
experience of the image that

56
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,830
we're looking at.

57
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,300
If we go up in scale even
more, in this case an A2

58
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,970
print, you can see that
relationship between the

59
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,740
viewer and the print becomes
even more removed.

60
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,240
I can no longer hold something
like this in my hand.

61
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,240
It no longer becomes intimate.

62
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,680
It becomes even more
expansive.

63
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,030
And it fits within the frame of
my body, so therefore that

64
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,810
relationship between size
and physicality

65
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,110
is even more evident.

66
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,770
Printing images beyond the
standard 6 by 4 or 5 by 7 inch

67
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,480
can be sometimes daunting in
terms of how you might go

68
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,030
about doing that.

69
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,870
But I thoroughly recommend that
you have a go at trying

70
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,580
to print out your images.

71
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,920
Different shops can offer
different sizes.

72
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,119
And you can even print images
on rolls and get massive 60,

73
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,860
70 inch prints.

74
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,410
And those sorts of prints are
becoming more and more popular

75
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,960
in galleries as that technology
evolves and people

76
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,480
start making these
beautiful prints.

77
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,010
Now there's a somewhat daunting
part to this process.

78
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,940
And there is this idea that what
you see on the screen is

79
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,380
not necessarily what you get
out of your printer.

80
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,250
Whether it's a desktop printer
attached to your computer or

81
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,110
whether you're taking it off
to a lab or a domestic

82
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,350
printer, what you see on your
screen may not always be the

83
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,000
same thing that you get
from the print.

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,070
And there's a way that you can
make this more accurate.

85
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,359
It's slightly advanced, but it
doesn't really need to be.

86
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,650
And all we need to know is that
sometimes you need to

87
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,570
tell the computer to print
different numbers in order to

88
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,719
get a more accurate print or in
order to get a print that

89
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,110
has more colour, more
saturation, and more tonal

90
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,030
separation, the kinds of things
that make for beautiful

91
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,580
photographic images.

92
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,380
I'll just explain a little bit
of this to you now so that you

93
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,870
have an understanding of
what this might be.

94
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,380
So if we have a pixel,
that pixel might

95
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,830
have a certain number.

96
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:43,200
It might be 200 red, 180
green, and 90 blue.

97
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,210
When I print that, it might
have a different number.

98
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,239
It might be 205 red.

99
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,805
It might be 190 for green.

100
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:58,730
And it could even be as far
away as 80 for blue.

101
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,890
What we need to do is compensate
for the difference

102
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,789
between these two values.

103
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:09,010
And what a profile will do
is it'll print this out.

104
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,099
It will measure it using
a particular device.

105
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,870
And it will compensate for the
difference between those two

106
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,300
numbers for a certain paper type
on a certain printer and

107
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,400
give us a much more
accurate result.

108
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,049
So if you're interested in
exploring your printing with a

109
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,440
little bit more detail, I would
recommend exploring this

110
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,010
idea of the profile and
how it can help

111
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,260
you make better prints.

112
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,437
