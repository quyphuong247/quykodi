Welcome to module two. This week, we're going
to be looking at the evolution of photography.

2
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,590
Last module, we looked at lights, senses,
and lenses and the relationship that has with

3
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:26,960
how the image is formed and how we might photograph
through a lens. This week, we're looking at

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,370
the new implications of how pixels and levels
and all of the new technical information in

5
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:40,370
digital photography determines the way that
image is shaped and pictorialised. In this

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,040
topic, we're looking at exploring the relationship
between the pixel and how that determines

7
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,750
the detail and information in our photographic
images.

8
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:56,699
If you take a close up of my face, you can
see all of the information that exists therein,

9
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:03,589
my eyes, the eyebrows, my nose, my mouth.
All of that is information that is rendered

10
00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:10,589
onto a photographic surface. With the pixels,
that information is all chopped up in minute

11
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:17,740
detail to represent individual squares that
determine certain values that existed as detailed

12
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:24,719
in my image.
It's kind of like steps versus a ramp. In

13
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:30,439
an analogue image, you cannot differentiate
between different values. It's like rolling

14
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:37,439
down a ramp. In a digital image, every single
value is a unique individual value, like walking

15
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,158
down stairs. You can count the number of stairs
that you take, but you certainly can't count

16
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:47,299
the number of steps on a ramp because there
aren't any.

17
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:51,829
Normally, we wouldn't see these pixels in
our photographic images unless you have an

18
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:58,359
application that allows you to zoom in to
such extreme points that you can see those

19
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:04,309
pixels. In this video, you can see that, as
I change that magnification, as I zoom in

20
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,960
on more and more of that image, the detail
starts to reveal itself. When I go beyond

21
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:16,960
that detail, you start to see the pixels.
In filmmaker Michelangelo Antonioni's classic

22
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:23,300
1960's film Blow-Up, we see the photographer
discovering more and more information as he

23
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:29,960
enlarges and enlarges and enlarges his image
to the point where he's seeing sorts of information

24
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:36,440
and detail that he didn't see when he photographed
that scene. Pixels are not quite the same.

25
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,380
Once you get to that finite position where
the pixel starts to reveal itself, the only

26
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:47,100
thing you can do is make that pixel bigger.
You cannot reveal any more information in

27
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,410
that image. The information is determined
by that pixel resolution.

28
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:57,370
When we talk about pixels, we can't really
talk about that relationship to image making

29
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:03,140
without discussing this idea of resolution.
Now, stay with me. This is not the most exciting

30
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,920
topic we're going to be covering, but it's
really important that you have basic understanding

31
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,230
of how these pixels work in relation to the
physical size of a photographic image.

32
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:20,230
Here's a pixel. It's a square. Here's 10 pixels
lined up. That means that we've got 10 pixels

33
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,610
in a row. If I wanted to give that some kind
of physical dimension, let's say it's going

34
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:34,610
to be one inch, that means we have a resolution
here of 10 pixels per inch, or 10 PPI, like

35
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,750
so.
Now, 10 pixels per inch is not very many,

36
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:50,890
but the idea is still the same. If I wanted
to change that value to a greater value, let's

37
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:57,890
say two inches, then I would have to redistribute
that number of pixels over a different physical

38
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:05,820
space, in this case two inches. So that means
my resolution would be five pixels per inch.

39
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:15,310
Now, the resolution that you have to use is
determined by the output device that you're

40
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:22,310
working to, so really, it doesn't necessarily
matter that much. You just have to make sure

41
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,980
that you match those two things together.
Someone will tell you what that is, but if

42
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:34,980
they don't, and if you're not sure, the safest
number to use, the magic resolution number,

43
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,410
is 300 pixels per inch.
Now, there's one other thing that we need

44
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:47,410
to be aware of here. Lots of people get confused
about the difference between pixels per inch,

45
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:54,250
or PPI, and dots per inch, or DPI. And a lot
of manufacturers, and unfortunately a lot

46
00:04:54,250 --> 00:05:01,250
of labs and commercial institutions and even
textbooks, get confused about these things.

47
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:08,150
Dots are referring to physical dots of ink
that are placed on a page. Pixels are not

48
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:14,239
the same as dots, and in most instances, the
number of pixels that you need in any given

49
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,520
inch will not be the same as the number of
dots that you get from a particular printer.

50
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,070
Remember that magic number of 300? You just
need to be aware that, when you distribute

51
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,990
that number of pixels, that will determine
the physical size of a print that you are

52
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,030
going to be making.
