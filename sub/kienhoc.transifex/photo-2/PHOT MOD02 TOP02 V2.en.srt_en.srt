2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,240
So in the last topic, we looked
at the way the pixels

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,370
define and construct the detail
in our image and that a

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,230
digital image has unique values
for every single one of

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,700
those pixels.

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,950
Now we're going to look
at tone and levels.

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,140
And the same principles apply.

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,480
If you have a look at my arm
here, you can see that there

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,870
are lots of different tones
wrapping around and creating

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,930
that dimensionality of my arm.

11
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,460
But you can't count the number
of tones that are on there nor

12
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,610
can you actually differentiate
between one tone to the next.

13
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,780
This is the gift
of photography.

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,530
This is the thing that
photography does best.

15
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,950
It creates images with smooth,
continuous tone.

16
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,030
In this picture here, you can
see those levels of tone and

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,540
the relationship that has with
the dimensionality and the way

18
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,890
that tone exists in the image.

19
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,690
From the bottom there, you've
got black and white, right up

20
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,050
to the top where we have
lots and lots of tone.

21
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,869
And even though there's the
illusion of continuity and

22
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,690
smoothness, it is in
fact an illusion.

23
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:19,220
And you can count every
individual tone in that image.

24
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,800
So the real question then, if
that's how levels of tone are

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,460
formed in our photographic
images, is just how many

26
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,710
levels of tone do we need in
order to get that illusion of

27
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,570
smoothness and continuity?

28
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,720
Well, in order to answer that,
we actually need to do a

29
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,610
little bit of maths.

30
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,330
And again, bear with me.

31
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,950
But we're talking about binary
data, which begins at its

32
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,630
rawest form, as being on or off
or being black and white.

33
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,640
So we therefore have
two tones.

34
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,110
And it's just 2 to the power
of 1, which gives us 2.

35
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,490
So that means we've got
black or white.

36
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,570
Now black and white's not going
to give us anywhere near

37
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,820
enough tonality.

38
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,610
So we just need to keep going
until we find that point where

39
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,250
we have enough tone.

40
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,760
So 2 to the power of 2
is simply 2 times 2.

41
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,820
That's 4.

42
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,590
Again, that's not enough.

43
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,180
But we keep going on
and on and on.

44
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,110
And we end up with 2 to the
power of 8, which 2 times 2

45
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:30,040
times 2 times 2 8 times
equals 256.

46
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,769
256 is enough tone to give us
that illusion of continuity

47
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,020
and smoothness.

48
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:44,100
And so this idea of 8 gives
us the 8-bit image.

49
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,359
The 8-bit image.

50
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,650
And that is the magic number.

51
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,760
And you will have seen that,
possibly seen that, in some of

52
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,209
the literature or some of the
technical explanations of

53
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,540
digital imaging.

54
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,590
8 bits.

55
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,020
256 levels of tone.

56
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,440
Now I've got a video here that
shows you visually how that

57
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,640
all unfolds and what that means
for the way that we see

58
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,220
our images.

59
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,330
So here we've got a standard
long image that I'm converting

60
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,440
into a grayscale, starting from
black moving through into

61
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,060
white, or shadows, midtones,
highlights.

62
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,260
And if I just use one of the
adjustment features in

63
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,549
Photoshop and posterise this
gradient, you can see what

64
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,460
black and white looks like.

65
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,630
And as I move through and simply
double each of those

66
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,549
numbers, I start to get more and
more tonality in my image.

67
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,090
16 shades.

68
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,270
32 shades.

69
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,600
Not quite enough.

70
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,370
As I keep going, 64.

71
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,810
I can still see the gaps.

72
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,380
I can still count the tones.

73
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,250
If I go to 128, that's
looking pretty good.

74
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,090
But it's still not
quite there yet.

75
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:50,970
Got to keep going.

76
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,250
255.

77
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:59,130
255 plus 0, because 0 is
a value, gives me 256.

78
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,920
And there's my smooth
continuous tone.

79
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,553
