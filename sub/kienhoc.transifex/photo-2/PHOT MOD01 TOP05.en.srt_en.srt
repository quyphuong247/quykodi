2
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:13,590
So we use our lens as a way of
determining the scale of

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,190
objects and subjects in our
frame, and we use our focus to

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,910
determine the kinds of things
that we're preferencing.

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,970
But then we also have
our vantage point.

6
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,450
Now, I'm a little bit obsessed
with vantage point because I

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,369
get very sick of seeing images
from five foot nine or six

8
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,210
foot, the normal standard height
of how we see the world

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,250
as we go about our daily
life and experience it.

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,640
I'm much more interested in
looking at different ways that

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,480
you can frame and different ways
of where you can stand to

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,889
how you photograph.

13
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,160
And if you look at the assets
that are on the screen now,

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,980
the library is photographed
in two different ways.

15
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,449
One is just how I saw it
as I'm walking past.

16
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,010
It's OK.

17
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,500
It's relatively flat.

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,620
Whereas the other image shows
you a much more interesting

19
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,980
dynamic, strong line in terms
of how that library sits in

20
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,839
that frame.

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,320
And here's a pretty
rough drawing of

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,610
what I'm talking about.

23
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,160
That's how we would normally
see the world.

24
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,200
Here is another example
of the way that we

25
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,950
might be seeing it.

26
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,170
Lying down is another example
of how you could do

27
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,110
something like this.

28
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,380
But the point I'm making is that
you don't always have to

29
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,800
stand where you're
most comfortable.

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,830
Sometimes, you need to stand so
that you can see something

31
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,060
else and that you can explore
your subject in a range of

32
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,310
different ways.

33
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,250
Remember, even though
photography is an

34
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,480
instantaneous medium, we need to
patient, and we need to be

35
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,660
considered in the way that we
frame and compose our images.

36
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,759
So when you look at images from
other artists and images

37
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,760
from other photographers, just
take a moment to think about

38
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,600
where they might have stood in
order to take that particular

39
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,070
photograph.

40
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,399
I know photographers who have
tall ladder with tripod heads

41
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,080
mounted on top of the ladder.

42
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,539
I know other photographers that
only ever use waist level

43
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,500
finder cameras so that they're
always looking like this,

44
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,580
slightly lower than
their perspective.

45
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,880
However it is that you might
see the world, explore it

46
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,870
through the lens from different
points of view and

47
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,910
different vantage points.

48
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,579
Now, the other really
interesting thing about

49
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,010
vantage point and focal length
and framing is the idea that

50
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,079
the viewfinder, the device that
we use to look through

51
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,660
the camera or at the image, is
a really important part of

52
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,780
that process.

53
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,390
And I'm a little bit obsessed
with viewfinder because there

54
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,500
are some really bad ones out
there that don't help us to

55
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,110
see the image in the way
that we need to see it.

56
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,230
So if you're looking for a
particular camera, or if

57
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,530
you're deciding on the sorts
of device that you want to

58
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,390
use, just take a moment to think
about that viewfinder.

59
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,850
Optical viewfinders are an
interesting way of looking at

60
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,670
things, but sometimes the image
can seem far away in the

61
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,290
viewfinder.

62
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,109
Other times, it can
seem quite close.

63
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,210
The other sorts of viewfinders
that we have now are the EVF

64
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,480
viewfinder, the electronic
viewfinder, which takes the

65
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,980
image from the sensor and
projects it onto the

66
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,109
viewfinder.

67
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,370
Again, there are some good ones
and there are some bad

68
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,950
ones, but you just have
to make a choice.

69
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,429
I'm not all that keen on this.

70
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,610
I don't really find that an
interesting way to take

71
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,640
photographs.

72
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,799
I'm much more interested in
having that camera, the device

73
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,400
that you use to photograph
with, being an

74
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,260
extension of our eyes.

75
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,609
So just take a moment to think
about the viewfinder and how

76
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,400
you look through
or at a camera.

77
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,650
