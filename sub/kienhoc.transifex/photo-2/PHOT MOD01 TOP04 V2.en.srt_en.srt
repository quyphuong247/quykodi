2
00:00:09,548 --> 00:00:12,260
Let's start talking about some
of the more technical aspects

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,410
of photography.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,310
The reason that these technical
aspects are

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,870
important is I don't think you
can fully have an appreciation

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,090
of what you're trying to do as
a photographer unless you

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,189
really understand as much of
photography as you need to.

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,690
There's an interesting
comparison here.

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,340
Think about it in terms
of language.

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,720
Technique is like vocabulary.

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,330
The more technique you have,
the more you understand

12
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,220
different ways of working with
photography, the greater your

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,600
vocabulary for expression, the
more you can explore through

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,740
photography, and ultimately, the
better you will be taking

15
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,130
the kinds of images that
you want to take.

16
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,860
We're going to start talking
about lenses and optics

17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,450
because the lens is how
photography draws our image.

18
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,200
Rather than us drawing it with
out hands, we need to use a

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,380
lens in order to do that, so
there's lots of things that we

20
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,680
need to be able to consider
as a way of

21
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,430
dealing with that lens.

22
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,700
In fact, pre photography, lenses
already existed in

23
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,600
different devices called camera
obscuras or even camera

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,210
lucidas, where the lens would
project an image onto a sheet

25
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,270
or onto the back of a tent or
onto a little box, and the

26
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,850
artist would draw the outline
of what they were seeing

27
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,190
through that lens.

28
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,280
So that relationship with optics
and drawing is even

29
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,900
older than photography.

30
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,050
But let's have a look at what
lens might look like.

31
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,500
Here's the lens here, here's
the inside of the lens, and

32
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,590
down here, we've got our sensor
plane, or where the

33
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,820
light's being captured.

34
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,759
Now, the thing about lenses is
that they bend light, and

35
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,640
light needs to be bent so we can
focus on different picture

36
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,510
planes as we're looking at
the thing that we want to

37
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,170
photograph.

38
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:59,190
So light will come through, and
it will bend itself to a

39
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:03,390
very particular point
right down here.

40
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,420
This is obviously one point of
focus, and that becomes a

41
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,830
critical area of focus from what
it is that the plane is

42
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,810
being captured out here.

43
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,730
So this idea then also
translates to the type of lens

44
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,140
that we're using, and that
distance from there to there

45
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,720
becomes our focal length.

46
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,400
So in this case, maybe this is
a 35 millimetre lens, so that

47
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,120
distance from here to here
is 35 millimetres.

48
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,110
Now, there's something else that
the human eye and a lens

49
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,410
do differently.

50
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:45,230
As I focus on a particular
point, my sight is quite

51
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,829
small, and the acuity and
spatial awareness that I have,

52
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,760
and my peripheral vision,
they're all defined on that

53
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,120
one particular point.

54
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,220
And in order for me to look at,
or focus, on other areas,

55
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,050
I simply just need to
move my eyes around.

56
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,970
We don't notice this because
we do it so quickly.

57
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,530
A lens, however, has a different
set of parameters in

58
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,410
the way that it sees things.

59
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,900
It can see the whole
perspective, or the whole

60
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,340
peripheral of what it's looking
at, with the same

61
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,310
level of acuity and
spatial awareness.

62
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,290
If you look at my face, for
example, now I'm in focus.

63
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:24,250
As we shift the lens out, my
face becomes out of focus, and

64
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,350
then it comes back in focus.

65
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,540
That's a particular thing that
a lens is able to do, and it

66
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,890
makes for a really interesting
way of drawing our image using

67
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,709
these lenses.

68
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,630
American photographer Stephen
Shore calls this the mental

69
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,549
level, the fact that when
you're looking at a

70
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,120
photographic image, the image
is flat, but your eyes

71
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,370
perceive depth, and you move
around the image in the same

72
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,060
way that you would
move around, for

73
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,080
example, a normal scene.

74
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,260
Consider this image
here, Cappadocia.

75
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,410
There are three elements in this
plane, or three receding

76
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,430
levels of depth, but because the
frontal object, the house,

77
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,310
is so pronounced, that becomes
the thing that sits forward.

78
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,440
And yet the background, the
mountain ranges in the

79
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,200
distance and the sky, look like
they're receding even

80
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,420
though they're all on the
same level of flatness.

81
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,120
The other wonderful thing about
lenses is that we can

82
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,410
use different types of lenses,
and the longer the lens, the

83
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,100
bigger the subject appears
in that frame.

84
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,410
So this is a 35 mil lens.

85
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,850
If I double that, I've got a 70
mil lens, which means that

86
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,960
any subject that was here in
35 mil lens is going to be

87
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,010
twice that size for
a 70 mil lens.

88
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,719
And there are three
images that will

89
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,110
come up on your screen.

90
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,120
One of them is a 24 mil
exposure, another is a 50 mill

91
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,370
focal length exposure, and the
last one is an 85 mil focal

92
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,030
length exposure, and you can
see the difference in the

93
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,289
cropping, the framing, and the
scale and size of the subject

94
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,890
as it appears at each of those
different focal lengths.

95
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,650
Focusing can also be how we
preference certain parts of

96
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,289
the image over others and
allows us a level of

97
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,630
creativity that we can
really explore

98
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,320
to our fullest potential.

99
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,230
Let's just have a brief look at
a movie here, and I'll show

100
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,620
you what I mean.

101
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,930
You can see in this movie that
as I subtly shift that focus

102
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,060
along with the ruler plane,
certain things form into focus

103
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,740
and certain things form out of
focus, and that preference of

104
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,110
those things in focus gives them
clarity and definition

105
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,750
that separates them from
everything else.

106
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,760
Now, there's one other thing
that we need to be really

107
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,580
conscious of with focusing.

108
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,590
Digital sensors are so minute
and have such small levels of

109
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,140
tolerance that it's really
difficult to manually focus

110
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,440
accurately using some
of these devices.

111
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,040
I recommend autofocus, not
because of any aesthetic

112
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,450
relationship to the camera or
anything else, purely because

113
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,440
of accuracy.

114
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,990
Autofocus on digital cameras
is really important.

115
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,519
