2
00:00:10,562 --> 00:00:13,850
Contemporary art photography has
been somewhat dominated by

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,709
the constructed narrative.

4
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,560
These are the sorts of images
that are meticulously

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,840
detailed, wonderfully staged,
almost like film stills.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,530
And they're set up and designed
in such a way that an

7
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:33,580
entire story unfolds in our eyes
as we navigate through

8
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,480
and search these images.

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,970
You can't really talk about
constructed narrative in

10
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,730
contemporary photography without
looking at the work of

11
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,019
someone like Gregory Crewdson.

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,160
Gregory Crewdson is probably
the master of this type of

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,290
image making.

14
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,320
And he does it in such a way
that he explores the darkness

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,540
of American suburbia, the
malevolent attitudes and

16
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,830
underseeding that occurs
in places like this.

17
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,930
Whether it's real or whether
it's not, that's the sort of

18
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,980
thing that he likes
to explore.

19
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,300
And he does it in a way that he
sets it up like an entire

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:12,560
film or an entire story
in one singular image.

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,760
There's conflict.

22
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,970
There's resolution.

23
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,170
There are stories unfolding.

24
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,540
You can explore it through
looking at the people and

25
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,540
their relationship to
the background.

26
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,100
You can explore it looking
at the background.

27
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,690
Any number of elements that sit
in those images occur in

28
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:33,130
such a way that it creates
a complex story for us to

29
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,630
investigate.

30
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,530
I think, right now, you need to
go and have a look at the

31
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,410
work of Gregory Crewdson.

32
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,369
I'm not going to give you
an image in particular.

33
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,690
I think if you just do a Google
search for Gregory

34
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,730
Crewdson, you'll see exactly
what I mean.

35
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,700
His two most iconic series to
date though would have to be

36
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,180
Beneath the Roses
and Twilight.

37
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,760
So if you add those into your
search as well, or if you

38
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,930
follow the links that we have
down below for you, you'll see

39
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,330
some of this amazing
artist's work.

40
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,890
Now, Crewdson uses some pretty
amazing technology and a cast

41
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,830
or a crew of 80 people to help
him to set up these stills and

42
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,320
to make these images.

43
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,820
We don't all have access to
that kind of technology.

44
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,170
And we certainly don't
have access to

45
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,589
that level of support.

46
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,610
So you can explore this
in your own way.

47
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,750
But one of the things that
Crewdson does that's quite

48
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,890
interesting is that he
multiplies his images.

49
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:32,380
So if we've got a frame like so,
and there's someone over

50
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,484
here, there's a mountain
range up here,

51
00:02:35,485 --> 00:02:37,330
there's a car down here--

52
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,790
this is why I'm a photographer
by the way.

53
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,640
And you can see that all of
these elements, you might

54
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,230
capture them in one frame.

55
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,290
But Crewdson tends to capture
them in multiple frames and

56
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,940
composite these together
to create the kind of

57
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,609
story that he wants.

58
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,070
So in that computer element of
his design work, he'll look

59
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,549
for, yeah, that's the best
expression that I want.

60
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,640
But that's the best
kind of lighting.

61
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,339
The mist that's rolling over
the car down there from the

62
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,080
fog machine looks great
in this frame.

63
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,640
So let's put that in there.

64
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,390
So his image is of multiple
composites.

65
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,649
And you could explore that
yourself, looking at some of

66
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,690
the techniques that we used last
week as a way of creating

67
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,000
your own constructed
narratives.

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,170
So when I'm talking about this
idea of compositing, what I'm

69
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,459
talking about is that layering
and building of the image.

70
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,930
And each of those frames that
he took-- and he might have

71
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,850
taken 30, 20, 30 frames for
something like this--

72
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,530
each of those elements are then
captured individually and

73
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,650
layered up and composited
to build that image.

74
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,860
If you go to some of those
YouTube videos or, in

75
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,510
particular, the Lynda.com
resource that we've talked

76
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,760
about last week, you'll see some
of those videos on how to

77
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,799
layer and composite imaging in
the way that you might need to

78
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,360
help you explore something
like this.

79
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,460
Now, some of the ideas in this
constructed narrative might

80
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,760
seem slightly awkward.

81
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,489
Just simply the idea of creating
a whole story using

82
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,200
one single frame, it's
a bit challenging.

83
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,119
And it certainly expands the
notion of what we think about

84
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,100
when we think about
photography.

85
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,190
But I'll tell you a brief story
about Robert Frank,

86
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,750
again, my favourite artist,
and how he dealt with

87
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,060
something like this.

88
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,150
He spent all that time
photographing The Americans

89
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,859
series and constructing this
multi-imaged picture of

90
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,010
American culture and society.

91
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:33,599
And at some point in his career,
he decided that single

92
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,940
frame photography was not enough
and that he couldn't do

93
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,190
the sorts of things that
he wanted to do.

94
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,690
So he left photography.

95
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,550
He proclaimed that he would
never again shoot a

96
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,810
photographic image.

97
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,600
And he moved on to video and
made some--well, there's some

98
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,420
interesting video art out there
that he made and some

99
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,430
interesting narratives
that he explored.

100
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,700
But something happened in his
life that led him back to

101
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,010
photography.

102
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,200
And he started looking at ways
of constructing multiple

103
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,530
framed narratives within
single images.

104
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,809
And he used some very
interesting methods and ideas

105
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,220
about what constitutes a
photographic image to do

106
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,600
something like this.

107
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,820
So again, if you searched for
Robert Frank, The Lines of My

108
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,550
Hand or Moving Out, you'll see
what I mean when I talk about

109
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,860
the way that he explored
photography and that

110
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,320
multi-framed narrative as a way
of looking at constructing

111
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,790
storytelling.

112
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,990
Australian artist Bronek Kozka
uses this constructed

113
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,800
narrative in a certain way and
adds an additional element of

114
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,450
memory and how we might remember
or think about the

115
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,250
kinds of things that we
experienced in our youth and

116
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,780
the way that then determines how
we picture ourselves now.

117
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,799
Some of his images definitely
construct that narrative.

118
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,200
For example, Chinese Restaurant
that he did

119
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,409
recently looked at how we might
have experienced as

120
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:03,550
children growing up in the
'70s the iconic Cantonese

121
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,800
Chinese restaurants
in Australia.

122
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,540
And he explores that narrative
and uses the lighting and the

123
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,210
studio setups and the
construction as a way of

124
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,419
dealing with memory and how we
have those relationships to

125
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,080
past events.

126
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,919
In the next topic, Bronek
is going to come in.

127
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,950
And we're going to have a bit
of a talk about the way that

128
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,729
he makes his images.

129
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,980
And he's got some nice diagrams
to show us about

130
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,620
where he sets the lighting up.

131
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,520
And he'll talk a lot about that
relationship between what

132
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,789
he's thinking, what he's trying
to construct, and how

133
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,040
he actually does it.

134
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,070
