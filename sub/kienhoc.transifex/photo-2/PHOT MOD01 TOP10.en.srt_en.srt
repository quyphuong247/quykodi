2
00:00:09,803 --> 00:00:12,600
One of the great things we can
do with our photography is we

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,420
can share it, and we can show
it to other people.

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,940
And we can look at other
people's work and develop that

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,800
sense of community around the
sorts of things that we like

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,480
photographing, but also
just as photographers.

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,920
It's really important
that we do this.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,600
I don't think you can really
improve your photography

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,360
without looking at other
people's work and without

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,170
having other people look
at and even comment on

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,000
your work as well.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,280
One of the really important
things about doing this course

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,260
is that you engage in that idea
of sharing your work.

14
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,330
So we've set up that Google+
account, and I can't emphasise

15
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,980
enough that you really need to
start looking at, putting your

16
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,120
work out there, and hoping and
letting other people comment

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,140
on that as well.

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,920
But don't just put
your work up.

19
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,760
Every time you put an image
up, I think it's important

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,830
that you look for and comment
on someone else's image so

21
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,710
that you get that sense of
ongoing dialogue about how it

22
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,809
is that you're all learning
the sorts of things that

23
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,100
you're learning, but also how
you want to comment on

24
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,280
photography.

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,790
Now, I don't want to impose
rules on this, but I think

26
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,320
there's a couple of things that
are really important.

27
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,619
Praise is nice.

28
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,610
It's great to have people
praise at work, but

29
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,960
ultimately, it's not
very critical.

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,169
And I'd be more interested in
you being critical of how you

31
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,250
respond to the work that
people are putting up.

32
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,310
It doesn't mean they
have to be harsh.

33
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,710
It doesn't mean that you have
to be insulting or any of

34
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,789
those things, but be critical
about the sorts of things that

35
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,180
you're looking at.

36
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,190
The rise of social networking in
the last decade means that,

37
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,830
more than any other time in our
history, we have access to

38
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,600
more images and lots of
photography that will help us

39
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,020
to navigate our own
experiences of

40
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,509
this wonderful medium.

41
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,710
So have a look at some
of these sites.

42
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,399
They're in your list
of resources at

43
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,730
the end of this topic.

44
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,600
And check out the sorts
of things that you

45
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,668
want to check out.

46
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,630
You'll notice that lots of
things are keyworded and

47
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,620
categorised into certain
types of photography.

48
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,880
It will help you to develop the
way that you want to look

49
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,380
and respond through your own
photography and help you to

50
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,730
see how other people are
doing the same thing.

51
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,820
When you feel that you've got
better at your photography, or

52
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,660
when you feel more confident
about the kinds of images that

53
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,579
you're taking, you can even
start to enter competitions.

54
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,950
You can start to get your work
out there and see how other

55
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,119
people, who are probably more
used to responding to

56
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,940
photographs and looking for
certain things, how they can

57
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,500
respond and what they think
about your images.

58
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,680
Now, the other thing that I
think is really important is

59
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,690
that you can look at all those
social networking sites, and I

60
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,210
would encourage it.

61
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,390
But there are other locations
that you can visit and other

62
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,070
websites and physical locations,
like galleries,

63
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,530
that will help you to see the
way that other people using

64
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,750
photography.

65
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,700
Galleries are a particularly
interesting perspective

66
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,239
because they condense.

67
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,490
And they have some kind of
review process, so they really

68
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,660
only put up the best kind of
work that they consider to be

69
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,530
in relation to the sorts of
things they're looking for.

70
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,950
Most capital cities around the
world will have some kind of

71
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,679
photography gallery.

72
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,050
I know in Australia that at
least four of our major cities

73
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,810
have a photography gallery
that is of a really high

74
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,590
calibre and that shows
amazing work.

75
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,410
New York, London, Paris, most
of the major cities do the

76
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,480
same thing.

77
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,670
A lot of the cities in
America as well.

78
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,959
So I suggest that you start
looking at more professional

79
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,450
locations as well as the social
networking locations,

80
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,149
and get a real sense of what
photography is and how you can

81
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,400
engage with it.

82
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,280
