https://youtu.be/qfTyEagML3I

2
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:12,500
So photography is really
a visual language.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,420
And the way that we use our
devices, the way that we think

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,660
about the world, the way that
we frame it, that's all

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,490
reliant on how we engage with
that visual language.

6
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,320
There are lots of things
to consider.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,160
There are lots of types
of photography

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,570
that you can explore.

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,400
There are lots of subjects that
you can engage in, lots

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,300
of genres to position yourself
into, but the visual language

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,110
is the key thing.

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,220
I can't emphasise this enough.

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,320
The more you understand that
language, the more you will be

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,030
able to expand your photography,
and the more

15
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,480
you'll be able to take the sorts
of images that you see

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,769
others take and that you
might aspire to.

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,950
There's one other thing about
that visual language that's

18
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,630
really important, and that's
how we see the image.

19
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,030
I've talked a lot about looking
through viewfinders.

20
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,110
I've talked a lot about lenses,
and the way they frame

21
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,090
and compose our image, whether
they're long, whether they're

22
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,540
short, the sorts of things that
you see, how you might be

23
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,500
seeing them.

24
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,330
But really, the way that you
look through your camera,

25
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,630
that's the first part of
that visual language.

26
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,630
I've talked about the idea of
this, looking at lenses and

27
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,619
looking at screens.

28
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,640
I don't know that that's
necessarily the best way to do

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,840
it, and sometimes I think it's
worth just remembering and

30
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,270
thinking about the way that you
frame and view that frame.

31
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,610
I'm a fan of these
kind of cameras.

32
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,380
The reason I like these sorts
of cameras is because I can

33
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:43,630
look through the camera like
this, and I can compose and

34
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,300
frame my image.

35
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,410
I'm not looking at the
image like this.

36
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,610
I'm actually looking
through the device.

37
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,110
It blacks out the rest
of the world.

38
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,630
It lets me see the thing that
I'm looking at through the

39
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,160
lens itself.

40
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,580
I think that's worth
remembering, and I'm not

41
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,550
advocating that you purchase
a certain type of camera.

42
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,460
Some of us have different
resources.

43
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,490
Some of us have different
preferences.

44
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,760
But I think it's worth realising
and taking note that

45
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,690
a visual language means that
you need to concentrate and

46
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,340
that you need to focus on the
way that you engage with that

47
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,930
visual language.

48
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,870
We all have our own way of
experiencing the world, and we

49
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,830
all have our own way of thinking
about photography.

50
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,270
The idea of the visual language
is an important part

51
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,320
of that process, and it might
even be worth thinking about

52
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,239
that in terms of who you are
and how that relates to the

53
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,220
sorts of things that you're
interested in.

54
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,980
We've talked a lot
about subject.

55
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,239
We've talked a lot about the
things that matter to you.

56
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,320
There's no real right or wrong
way to approach your type of

57
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,260
photography other than to engage
and think about that

58
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,870
visual language.

59
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,700
There is this idea that the best
camera is the one that

60
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,209
you have with you,
and that's fine.

61
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,250
I certainly don't disagree
with that.

62
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,840
But sometimes, being more
engaged with our camera and

63
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,490
having the kind of camera that
can allow us to control the

64
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,310
certain things that we've been
looking at will certainly

65
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,930
expand the way that you're
engaging with photography.

66
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,000
Now, there's a bit of an idea
that digital photography is

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,390
the wrong way to do things,
and that it's having a

68
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,619
negative impact on the tradition
and history of

69
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,960
photography.

70
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,490
Don't be fooled by this.

71
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,450
I don't think that's
the case at all.

72
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,380
I think photography's just
photography, and its about

73
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,799
capturing light.

74
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,560
How you do that is entirely
dependent on the sorts of

75
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,470
things that you want
to think about.

76
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,090
Lots of forums have all sorts
of different arguments about

77
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,190
whether this camera's better
than that one, or whatever it

78
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,700
is that you want to use, or the
Leica traditionalists that

79
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,480
only shoot film and
only manual focus.

80
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,239
That's fine.

81
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,130
Whatever it is that you need to
do to take the photographs

82
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,109
that you want to take about,
that's how we engage with

83
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,300
photography.

84
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,530
Don't forget to look at
other photographers.

85
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,200
We've spent a lot of time
looking at the sorts of work

86
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,790
that other people make in
relationship to their own

87
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,370
perceptions and their own
interests, whether it's the

88
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,020
landscapes of Ansel Adams, the
self-portraiture of Cindy

89
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,640
Sherman, the documentary
photography of Robert Frank or

90
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,810
Ed Ruscha or any of
those people.

91
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,140
And don't forget to look at all
the resources at the end

92
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,200
of those sections, because they
will give you links to

93
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,190
really interesting sites that
explore their work and allow

94
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,800
you to take notice and even
analyse their work with the

95
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,670
new language that you have
around photography.

96
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,260
In one of the earlier topics,
we looked at the work of

97
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,770
Australian photographer
Matthew Sleeth.

98
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,320
Now, he's a good friend of mine,
and we often talk about

99
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,340
photography.

100
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,150
And he's come up with this idea
that, for him, everything

101
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,130
is photography all
of the time.

102
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,620
He thinks about that in
relationship to all the other

103
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,120
mediums that exist in the world,
that capture moments,

104
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,100
that frame our lives, and that
respond to the things that are

105
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,310
happening as we go about
our daily existence.

106
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,140
And he seems to believe that,
for him, it's all photography.

107
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,940
And I think that's an
interesting attitude to have

108
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,610
in relationship to that
visual language.

109
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,360
The lens is such a powerful
medium today, and it captures

110
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,580
things in such an interesting
way, that we really need to

111
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,270
have a good, accurate
understanding of what that

112
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,120
means for us and how that
might make us be better

113
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,350
photographers.

114
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,300
Photography is always challenged
by the truth.

115
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,380
Photography is always capturing
a certain moment at

116
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,830
a certain time.

117
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,150
Photography is always history.

118
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,640
So thank you for coming along
on what has been a really

119
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,960
interesting course.

120
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,580
I think photography's
an amazing medium.

121
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,500
I couldn't live without it.

122
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,470
Just remember, the way that you
photograph is unique to

123
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,380
you, and you can make the sorts
of choices that you want

124
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,570
to make to take the sorts
of photographs

125
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,990
that you want to take.

126
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,770
Now, we've had a look at lots
of different resources

127
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,109
throughout this course.

128
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,590
You've seen the Google+
image site.

129
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,900
I've asked you to respond to as
many images as you can and

130
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,789
to post your own images.

131
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,850
The sorts of feedback that you
get will be invaluable to you,

132
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,120
so that other people can
also help and learn

133
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,960
through that process.

134
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,299
That site will stay open, and
as other people join this

135
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,320
course and do that in the
future, you can engage with

136
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,659
potentially thousands of other
people from around the world

137
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,430
as you all share and explore
the art of photography.

138
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,797
