So let's get started.

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,990
So what is a stock?

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,880
It's another form of financing.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,470
That's a very simple
way of thinking about.

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,920
What do I mean by that?

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,140
Suppose you have a great idea,
you have two primary ways of financing.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,130
One is borrowing and the other is stocks.

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,549
But that's a very limited view of stocks.

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,970
Who is it issued by?

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,489
This is one of those things where
stocks are issued by companies,

11
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,70
by entities and we need to know that.

12
00:00:38,70 --> 00:00:41,800
And it's a very unique and complex thing.

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,52
Some background for you.

14
00:00:43,52 --> 00:00:48,10
I would encourage you to look
at the slide over there.

15
00:00:48,10 --> 00:00:50,80
This is my favorite chart, as I said.

16
00:00:50,80 --> 00:00:53,800
You have some real assets and
on the right-hand side, there's equity and

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,510
debt and we're gonna put closure to
the course by covering all three items.

18
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,739
We talked about real assets as the source
of that value creation last time.

19
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:08,643
We already know debt and you'll
recognize equity when you see it but

20
00:01:08,643 --> 00:01:14,310
let's talk about the important
features of it and how does it matter.

21
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,110
The typical story's the following,
you come up with an idea and

22
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,780
you think about how do finance it.

23
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,759
You finance it initially
by some of your own money,

24
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,930
you test the idea and
if it works out and looks good,

25
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,280
what you do is, you think about
ways of raising more money.

26
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,570
Now, you'll see later that nobody's
going to give you money until

27
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,320
you put some of your own.

28
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:48,740
Basically, you ask for
money through either stocks or bonds.

29
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,270
In initial parts of most projects,
it's usually stocks.

30
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,167
You'll understand in a second but

31
00:01:55,168 --> 00:01:59,360
I wanted you to give you this
big picture of what's going on.

32
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,730
Stocks don't exist in isolation.

33
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:07,520
They exist because entities that
want to create value issue them.

34
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,710
Does that mean that all entities
create value all the time?

35
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,480
Absolutely not.
