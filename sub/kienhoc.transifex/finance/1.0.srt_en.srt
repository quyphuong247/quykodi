00:00:04,843 --> 00:00:10,965
https://youtu.be/rXKYWeneGJM
Welcome, we talk about time value
of money basics in this module.

2
00:00:10,965 --> 00:00:15,094
[COUGH] Module will last
as long as it needs to, but

3
00:00:15,094 --> 00:00:19,952
what I'll do is I'll break it
up into bite sized pieces.

4
00:00:19,952 --> 00:00:25,694
The other thing I want to emphasize in
every module is I do a lot of problems,

5
00:00:25,694 --> 00:00:29,590
that's anything I do in
finance is very applied.

6
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,456
So, I do start out with problems.

7
00:00:31,456 --> 00:00:38,740
Having said that, I would encourage you to
take advantage of technology and pause.

8
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:44,470
And if I show you a problem, try to do it
quickly and then we'll do it together.

9
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:49,370
But what I don't want to happen is take so
many pauses that every two minutes,

10
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,220
we are kind of taking a pause just so
that.

11
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,782
We can get synced or something like that.

12
00:00:55,782 --> 00:00:57,759
Remember, I'll play it along.

13
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,317
I'll flow naturally.

14
00:00:59,317 --> 00:01:01,630
And hopefully, that's helpful to you.

15
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,780
But practice, practice, practice.

16
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,200
Second thing,
do assessments and assignments.

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,649
But remember,
you don't have to do them right away.

18
00:01:11,649 --> 00:01:13,870
Do them when you are comfortable.

19
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:18,336
They'll challenge you a bit and
they are sink to what I do in class.

20
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:22,280
In other words, as I'm doing a module,
the problem sets are related,

21
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,810
assessments are related.

22
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,113
On the other hand, what you could do
is you could do the whole course and

23
00:01:29,113 --> 00:01:30,702
then do the segment still.

24
00:01:30,702 --> 00:01:32,090
It's entirely up to you.

25
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,308
Sometimes I encourage you to do them as
we are going along, because it's useful.

26
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:40,672
But it's up to you, as I said.

27
00:01:40,672 --> 00:01:46,410
If you feel like you need to go to the
next chapter or module to help you, do so.

28
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,771
So, let's get started.

29
00:01:47,771 --> 00:01:52,930
The essence of decision-making is
what this course is all about.

30
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:57,263
Pitch to anyone who wants to
learn from us the first time.

31
00:01:57,263 --> 00:02:01,651
So as I said in the introductory
videos to this class,

32
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:06,510
that every decision we make
effects us in the future.

33
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,830
It's almost always the case that
you'd make a decision today,

34
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,712
it has consequences for you in the future.

35
00:02:13,712 --> 00:02:18,830
Please keep that in mind, because it's
intimately related to decision-making,

36
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,590
time value of money and so on.

37
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:27,160
Second, I also believe that
important decisions tend to

38
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,060
effect us more significantly and
potentially for longer.

39
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,870
So, one example to think about
it is I think it was a great

40
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,630
innovation that we had the internet.

41
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,877
It took a lot of resources to create,
a lot of ingenuity, but

42
00:02:41,877 --> 00:02:44,390
it'll stay with us for a long time.

43
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,190
So, important decisions.

44
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,716
Investment is costly, but
they also stay with you longer.

45
00:02:50,716 --> 00:02:53,693
So understanding time value
of money is actually a very,

46
00:02:53,693 --> 00:02:56,490
very important thing to any decision,
small or big.

47
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,224
Therefore, just be patient and
what I'll do is I'll go slowly and build

48
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:08,428
the Legos you need to understand what
happens with just the passage of time.

49
00:03:08,428 --> 00:03:10,490
I do want to emphasize one thing.

50
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,105
In this course,
I will not explicitly do risk, but

51
00:03:16,105 --> 00:03:20,010
risk will be everywhere
as we talk about it.

52
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,394
Why don't I do explicitly risk?

53
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:24,936
Because risk is a whole
topic on its own and

54
00:03:24,936 --> 00:03:29,601
I think it requires a lot of knowledge
of statistics and so on, and so forth.

55
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:34,541
Remember, I told you I've done a MOOC,
which is pretty advanced for

56
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:39,225
most people and part of the reason
it was advanced was because risk

57
00:03:39,225 --> 00:03:42,481
takes a whole new set
of tools to understand.

58
00:03:42,481 --> 00:03:46,658
So in this course, our main thing is
to focus on time value of money and

59
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:48,762
you'll be surprise how far we go.

60
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:55,520
We'll internalize it with the explicit
goal of making good decisions.

61
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,715
And what I'll do all the time is examples,
examples, examples and

62
00:03:59,715 --> 00:04:02,816
the way I'll pull you in
is through the examples.

63
00:04:02,816 --> 00:04:04,460
So, why is it for everyone?

64
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,865
Because I guarantee you,
there'll be some problem that you'll

65
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:12,720
relate to very well if not most and
that'll bring you in.

66
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,650
Remember, learning happens when you
want to learn not when I want to teach.

67
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:22,565
So, that's another thing that's very cool
about technology is you don't have to

68
00:04:22,565 --> 00:04:23,417
listen to me.

69
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:25,780
You can fast forward and so on.

70
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,738
If you're sitting in my class, you're
kind of suffering for two hours or so and

71
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:33,772
it's kind of rude to walk
out of class suddenly.

72
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:35,182
But here, you are on your own.

73
00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:38,240
Sipping a cup of coffee,
learning at the same time.

74
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,436
I think that's wonderful.

75
00:04:39,436 --> 00:04:43,685
So, the first thing I would like
to do before we get started

76
00:04:43,685 --> 00:04:48,410
on the tools is the importance
of timelines and you know what?

77
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,392
I must admit to you that I don't think
my handwriting is very good, but

78
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:58,120
I will write a lot and that's my
way of expressing my enthusiasm and

79
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,240
also showing what I am doing.

80
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,696
But remember, you always can listen
to me and you can always redo stuff,

81
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:11,242
but the first thing I want to do is to
make sure you understand timelines and

82
00:05:11,242 --> 00:05:13,590
a very important convention.

83
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,626
So, the timeline issue is the following.

84
00:05:16,626 --> 00:05:17,930
You make a decision.

85
00:05:22,101 --> 00:05:26,291
At time 0 and for
simplicity in the beginning,

86
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:31,757
we'll assume the decision effects you,
it will be a time 1.

87
00:05:31,757 --> 00:05:33,250
Of course, that's not true.

88
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,980
So what we'll do is we'll break this
timeline up into pieces that are one,

89
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,170
two, three, four, five, six.

90
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,896
But in the beginning, we'll start off
with one and then we'll make them more.

91
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:49,894
Some conventions to remember that
whenever we say, be that one.

92
00:05:49,894 --> 00:05:53,240
It usually in finance,
means end of the period.

93
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,150
So if something is happening at the end
of the period, it'll show up here.

94
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,707
What is the point in time?

95
00:05:59,707 --> 00:06:05,646
1 and 0, but
the period of time is going to 0 to 1.

96
00:06:05,646 --> 00:06:11,130
These simple things are very important and
the reason, again is decision-making.

97
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:15,760
You make a decision today and
it affects you in the future.

98
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,982
For now, I'll keep it just one period.

99
00:06:18,982 --> 00:06:22,732
But as we go along, you'll see,
there will be multiple periods.

100
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:26,598
In fact, the richness of
decision-making is as I said,

101
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:29,030
you want to have impact forever.

102
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:33,440
That's a very human feeling that
you want to change the world,

103
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,720
but you want to change it,
so that it matters forever.

104
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:43,220
What I want to now talk briefly about
is some terminology, which is very,

105
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,280
very important and
the terminology is some lingo of finance.

106
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:55,010
The nice thing is the same terminology
will be used often across different media.

107
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:59,366
So I'll talk about it now, but it'll
also be prevalent in Excel and so on.

108
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:01,990
The first thing, remember,
timeline was today.

109
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:09,501
And at point zero, which is today,
we use a term called PV, Present Value.

110
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:11,650
So, PV stands for?

111
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:17,931
Present Value and because it's appoint
in time, it's measures in some currency.

112
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:21,717
It's a language of business,
a language of life.

113
00:07:21,717 --> 00:07:24,993
So I will use dollars and
I apologize for that,

114
00:07:24,993 --> 00:07:30,124
because I'm used to that, but
you can use any currency you're used to.

115
00:07:30,124 --> 00:07:32,143
You can use cows, if you want.

116
00:07:32,143 --> 00:07:37,740
But I'm just teasing, but
Present Value is a at time zero.

117
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,279
The next term we want to use, remember,
we started from timeline zero and one.

118
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:46,020
So, let's just stick with one period for
the time being.

119
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,484
So at time zero, we call it PV.

120
00:07:48,484 --> 00:07:54,270
At time one, we'll call it FV,
future value.

121
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,902
Remember, at both points in time,
we'll measure it in dollars.

122
00:07:57,902 --> 00:08:01,230
So one is PV, one is FV.

123
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,728
The third term we'll use often is n.

124
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:08,609
Many times people use t, as well.

125
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:10,280
What does n mean?

126
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:16,277
It means the number of periods and
it does measure in numbers.

127
00:08:16,277 --> 00:08:18,843
So, you define the period.

128
00:08:18,843 --> 00:08:20,387
So typically we'll say, one period.

129
00:08:20,387 --> 00:08:22,342
But you define whether it's a year,

130
00:08:22,342 --> 00:08:25,460
a month,
according to the nature of the problem.

131
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,777
And when we do problems,
you'll understand what I mean.

132
00:08:27,777 --> 00:08:31,640
So for the time being,
we're taking a very simple approach.

133
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,889
There is zero, there is one.

134
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:40,510
PV is a time zero,
FV is a time one and what is n?

135
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,036
One.

136
00:08:41,036 --> 00:08:42,654
N is the number of periods.

137
00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:44,355
This will, of course, change very soon.

138
00:08:45,645 --> 00:08:49,425
Finally, there's a concept that
I could teach a whole class on

139
00:08:49,425 --> 00:08:50,505
called Interest Rate.

140
00:08:51,545 --> 00:08:54,475
This also captures the value of time.

141
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:55,847
So, what is Interest Rate?

142
00:08:55,847 --> 00:09:00,879
Interest Rate, I'll spend a little
more time on it is a rate of return.

143
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,050
It's a percentage.

144
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,140
It's neither in dollars,
nor in number of periods.

145
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:12,470
It's a percentage and we will assume
that there is a strong assumption, but

146
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:17,220
not as strong as others assumptions is we
will assume that it is positive typically.

147
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,860
So the Interest Rate will be positive,
it's an assumption we will use throughout.

148
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,492
There are times when interest
rates have been negative.

149
00:09:26,492 --> 00:09:30,152
And as I said, this could be
a whole topic of discussion and

150
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:34,870
we can go on forever, but let's assume
that Interest Rates are positive.

151
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,000
Remember, there is no uncertainty.

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,810
So we will not talk about statistics,
risk and so

153
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:45,440
on, but we'll talk about risk implicitly.

154
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,262
Let me ask you this.

155
00:09:46,262 --> 00:09:52,000
Suppose you invest in something very risky
versus something that's not so risky.

156
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,409
So, take a bank account.

157
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:58,468
You put your money in the bank account as
a deposit versus you put your money in

158
00:09:58,468 --> 00:10:03,870
a brand new initiative, it's also called
the new venture and so on and so forth.

159
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,929
Where is there more risk typically?

160
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:09,440
Obviously, in something that's
more uncertain and so on.

161
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,929
So, how do you get attracted to it
by being expecting a higher return?

162
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:18,570
So high-risk,
high-return tend to go together.

163
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:23,094
