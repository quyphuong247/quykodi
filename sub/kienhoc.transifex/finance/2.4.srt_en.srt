We are still with annuities and I did some
examples with you, with Future

2
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:15,000
Values, but yes, there's some structure
provided by annuities,

3
00:00:15,10 --> 00:00:18,120
but when I saw them first I said what is this?

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:24,540
How will it work? But that´s... it's very
useful, even the assumption that you are putting

5
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:30,180
away fixed amounts every year or
paying fixed amounts is very realistic,

6
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:35,780
because people want to invest in ways
that are understandable, simple,

7
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,530
not changing every period and then when you think about

8
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:46,650
PMT, it derives we will see in a second from
loans and you take a loan and then pay cash

9
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,120
flows in the future and typically
they're fixed in quantities, so

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,19
that's where the word PMT comes from. So let's get started. Now I'm going to shift a little

11
00:00:55,19 --> 00:01:01,680
bit and first do the concept of Present
Value of annuities, so please stare at

12
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,790
the screen and what you´ll see is, the same
structure of an annuity, where three

13
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:14,20
things are happening. You need to know R
and we'll introduce it, you need to know N

14
00:01:14,20 --> 00:01:19,850
which in this case is, conceptual case is,
three and you need to know cash flow C,

15
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,820
Right? So what I'm going to do is go a little bit quickly because you've seen this

16
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:33,550
before, so the cash flow at time 0, is zero, years left to discount, now it's the opposite, right?

17
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,550
So you're going

18
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:40,890
discounting, you´re not carrying forward, you
don't need to discount zero, any number

19
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,520
of years, because it's today. So remember,
this is a timeline you can write it out

20
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:56,570
like 1,2,3; C, C, C and now where are
you looking for the value? Here,

21
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:06,500
not at Future Value. So you're looking at PV, not FV, Okay?

22
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:11,130
So how much do you have to discount the
first, no cash flow, no discounting?

23
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:21,850
This one year; this two years; this three years. Let's do it, because we know how to do one period.

24
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:31,180
This will be what? 0. This will be C, not
multiplied by one plus R, but divided

25
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:36,730
by one plus R. I'm putting it in parentheses because if you were to do this kind

26
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:42,510
of mathematical operation in say Excel, you need stuff that belongs

27
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,660
together in divisions and all in
parentheses, most of you probably

28
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:53,120
know that. So this will be divided by one
plus R, square, so if you didn't put

29
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,190
1 plus R in parentheses, it'll think R is being squared only but that's not the case.

30
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:06,810
This divided by 1 plus R cube. You see how simple this is? In spite of my bad writing you know,

31
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:13,190
you have a very clear idea what's going
on. What I'm going to do is, take a little

32
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,230
time, write it out as a formula, and
explain one more time, before we do

33
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:35,600
examples. So the PV of an annuity
is what? C over 1 plus R

34
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:46,329
Sometimes I'll write cap R, small case R, don't worry about it. C over 1 plus R square, plus C over

35
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,550
1 plus R cube.

36
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:54,990
Right? So this is what the formula is. Again when you notice, you can take C

37
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:59,260
outside. And what do you get?

38
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:08,140
1 over (1+R), plus 1 over (1+R) square,

39
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:17,760
plus 1 over (1+R) cube. My writing is getting better as we go along. I'm very impressed with myself.

40
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,330
So this is called Present Value Annuity
Factor. Symbols used maybe different even

41
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:35,370
by me, but you know it's an annuity, not a, and
it´s a function of what? R and N, right?

42
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,710
What's cool about it is, it has 3 things
in it, because how many cash flows are

43
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,150
there? Three, but they are very simple. They are additive.

44
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:51,49
First cashflow discounted, second cashflow discounted, third cashflow discounted.

45
00:04:51,50 --> 00:05:00,530
Just stare at this, these numbers are at the back of textbooks still, but you should be

46
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:08,549
using Excel. So if I asked you what is
the value getting 1 buck a 100 times in the

47
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:14,230
future, with an interest rate of say 2%, you
should be able to do this very quickly

48
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:20,980
not in your head, because then you're being insane. I can say that to you because we are talking to

49
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,110
each other. However, Excel is
wonderful, it does it very quickly.
