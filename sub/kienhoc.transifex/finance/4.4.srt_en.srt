00:00:04,808 --> 00:00:09,750
https://youtu.be/sFam50PtXcM
We will talk about three things for
a zero coupon bond.

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,721
The face value, because there's no coupon,
the interest rate

3
00:00:14,721 --> 00:00:19,518
5%, in the previous example,
and then we figured out price.

4
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:23,537
As I said,
if Time Value of Money is positive, and

5
00:00:23,537 --> 00:00:29,955
another cool thing about treasury bills
like a zero-coupon bond, there are so

6
00:00:29,955 --> 00:00:36,910
many cool things about it, is that, it is
the most fundamental security out there.

7
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,290
In other words,

8
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:43,339
if you hold it till maturity,
you are going to get $100,000, why?

9
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,680
Because as we'll see later,

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,140
we believe that any other entity
except the government will pay up.

11
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,570
The governments are unique in many
ways that they tend not to default.

12
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:01,90
Having said that, I have to be careful,
because default can happen to anybody.

13
00:01:01,90 --> 00:01:05,250
But if you were to ask anybody which
is the safest security in the world,

14
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,270
they'd probably say a zero coupon bond
because if you hold it till maturity,

15
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,339
you will get the money
that you were promised.

16
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,830
Of course, there's inflation risk, and
there are instruments to take care of

17
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:22,920
that, but
let's stick with the basic security.

18
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,720
So, what is yield to maturity?

19
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,210
Remember there are three things.

20
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:34,210
One is the face value, the second is
the price, the third is, built in,

21
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:38,250
between the price and the face value,
is something called yield to maturity.

22
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,984
So let's talk about it a sec,
and we'll see a lot

23
00:01:42,984 --> 00:01:47,539
in the real world about yield to maturity.

24
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,310
And therefore I want to capture it.

25
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,300
The return built into the pricing of
a bond is called yield to maturity and

26
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,820
so let's think about it.

27
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,913
And in an example,
suppose for simplicity,

28
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:06,710
we have a 5-year zero-coupon bond,
and the simplicity is the following.

29
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,639
Compounding is happening every year,
not every six months.

30
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,679
We'll change that in a second,
we'll go back and forth on that small issue.

31
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,750
But fully agree,

32
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:21,300
that is nothing compared to
the complexity we just did in module two.

33
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,490
So for now, five years means five years.

34
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,980
Five years means five periods.

35
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,555
If you look up it's a zero coupon bond
that the face value of $100,000 and

36
00:02:31,555 --> 00:02:35,417
the current price is $74,726.

37
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:37,430
So what happened?

38
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:43,385
So imagine, there is a auctioneer,
I love that, saying, I'm the government,

39
00:02:43,385 --> 00:02:48,484
I'm promising to pay you back $100,000,
so people bid with each other and

40
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:53,855
go back and forth and they decide that
the price is 74,726, and it clears at that.

41
00:02:56,985 --> 00:03:00,610
That clearing price also determines

42
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,170
the yield to maturity built into the bond,
okay?

43
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,640
So that's what we're
trying to do right now.

44
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,260
So let's draw a timeline as always and
try to solve the problem.

45
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,870
And I'll tell you how to do
it using a function in Excel.

46
00:03:19,80 --> 00:03:21,80
I'm looking down to get hold of the pen.

47
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:27,671
Okay so you have five years, and
we are assuming five distinct

48
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:31,690
compounding intervals.

49
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,656
And you're going to be
paid 100,000 over here.

50
00:03:37,898 --> 00:03:40,399
This is in your... think about it,
what will it be?

51
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:41,898
Future Value or Present Value?

52
00:03:41,898 --> 00:03:43,999
It'll be Future Value.

53
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:48,385
We also know the PV and

54
00:03:48,385 --> 00:03:55,420
it is $74,726, okay?

55
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,780
So this is what we know, and
I'm not putting commas simply because I'm

56
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,120
trying to think ahead, and
I know I don't put commas in Excel.

57
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,310
How much coupon?

58
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,166
Coupon is zero.

59
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:09,820
It's a zero-coupon bond.

60
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,245
So, the question here is,
what is the per year rate of return

61
00:04:14,245 --> 00:04:19,160
built-into it, if I hold
the bond till maturity.

62
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,370
What is the rate of return built into
it if I hold the bond till maturity?

63
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,552
So I know this.

64
00:04:25,552 --> 00:04:32,834
I know that 74,726, I put a comma,

65
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:39,104
is equal to 100,000/1+,

66
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:44,768
I'll call it yield to maturity,

67
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,440
power five.

68
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,80
Remember what we are trying to calculate.

69
00:04:50,80 --> 00:04:56,78
We're trying to calculate that rate of
return that's built into the bond pricing.

70
00:04:56,78 --> 00:04:57,558
Remembering what?

71
00:04:57,558 --> 00:04:59,200
Two important things.

72
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,380
One is that I'm going to hold till maturity,
yield to maturity.

73
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,40
The second is what's
the compounding interval?

74
00:05:06,40 --> 00:05:09,40
By the nature of the formula
that I had wrote,

75
00:05:09,40 --> 00:05:11,300
what do you think is
the compounding interval?

76
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,10
The compounding interval is a year.

77
00:05:15,10 --> 00:05:17,510
As I said, I'll change that in a second.

78
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:22,890
Now if you look at the five, that creates
the problem because it's raised to power

79
00:05:24,10 --> 00:05:31,250
five because of compounding, and we are
quoting a number that's on a yearly basis.

80
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,610
So now you have problem because
it's a one equation, one unknown.

81
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,660
But raise to power five is very,
very tough to figure out.

82
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:44,10
Turns out that there's another name for
yield to maturity, we'll do later.

83
00:05:44,10 --> 00:05:49,610
It's called internal rate of return built
into this, which makes sense again, right?

84
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,800
Internal to the cash flows.

85
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,650
So let's try to do it using Excel,
and I'm going to do that with you.

86
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,984
But I'll introduce a function,
and that function,

87
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:07,876
if you think about is, and look up,
please look up a function called rate.

88
00:06:13,48 --> 00:06:16,470
Say =RATE(

89
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,370
And if you open parentheses, you will
see the following symbols jump at you.

90
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,730
The first one won't be R.

91
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:26,780
Why?

92
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,849
Because you're figuring out R, right? the reverse, so
this is the slight twist.

93
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,180
The first one will be number of and
I'm going to write it as n.

94
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,700
The second number that
will jump at you is PMT.

95
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,80
The third number that
will jump at you is PV.

96
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,678
And the fourth, you'll see (FV).

97
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,938
And what have I done to the FV?

98
00:06:54,938 --> 00:06:57,238
I've put it in parenthesis.

99
00:06:57,238 --> 00:07:02,273
Now, the key here is, that both PV and
FV can't be positive,

100
00:07:02,273 --> 00:07:07,930
because if they are,
you're assuming you have a money machine.

101
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,430
You're getting money, you're getting
money, you're getting money.

102
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,10
One of them has to be negative in
order to figure out rate of return.

103
00:07:14,10 --> 00:07:14,950
So be very careful.

104
00:07:16,60 --> 00:07:17,380
What is N?

105
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,520
N is the number of periods,
so let's figure it out.

106
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,933
How much will you put?

107
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:24,528
5, then the comma?

108
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,308
How much will you put for PMT?

109
00:07:29,768 --> 00:07:33,277
Because it's a zero-coupon bond.

110
00:07:33,278 --> 00:07:35,248
How much will you put for PV?

111
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:38,65
We know the number, and I'm looking here.

112
00:07:38,65 --> 00:07:39,265
It's 74,726

113
00:07:42,54 --> 00:07:46,722
but I've put in a positive number, so

114
00:07:46,723 --> 00:07:49,723
what does the FV have to be?

115
00:07:49,723 --> 00:07:55,212
Negative, so negative is -100,000,

116
00:07:55,212 --> 00:08:00,152
you know? I was going to put a parenthesis,
but...

117
00:08:00,152 --> 00:08:08,80
So, this what I'll do, for each number, Right?

118
00:08:08,80 --> 00:08:11,407
Match it and when you press enter,
what will you find?

119
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:20,469
You'll find 0.06 or 6%.

120
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:22,301
You'll find this, okay?

121
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:27,39
So, very easy to execute, but

122
00:08:27,40 --> 00:08:32,770
if you have Excel and
the culprit here is the five.

123
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:37,289
And imagine,
this could be actually greater than five,

124
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:42,439
can be in fractional terms, and
let's talk, do a real world twist.

125
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,918
What do I mean by that?

126
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:46,598
Typically the compounding interval.

127
00:08:51,516 --> 00:08:59,478
Interval is determined, is six months.

128
00:08:59,478 --> 00:09:01,218
What do I mean by that?

129
00:09:01,218 --> 00:09:04,836
Is built into all pricing
of government bonds,

130
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:08,440
the interval for
compounding is six months.

131
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,650
So when we go to a government
bond that pays coupon,

132
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:15,209
it pays coupon every six months.

133
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:19,740
That is just a technicality that will make
your life a little bit miserable, but

134
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,20
not too miserable, right?

135
00:09:22,20 --> 00:09:24,150
So what do I have to do here?

136
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,590
As soon as I know the compounding
interval is six months,

137
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:32,438
I will do five years.

138
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:36,560
I'll change it to 10 periods.

139
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,920
And that's a real world twist I want
you to think about, okay? And

140
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,860
when you are doing it in real time data.

141
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,990
And at the end of this module, we'll
go to actually finance.yahoo.com, and

142
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:54,510
I'll do that even for stocks to show
you how common all of this is and

143
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,110
across the world you can do this.

144
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,110
So I'll replace this by 10.

145
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:06,40
So I'll do, rate 10,
comma, coupon's are zero.

146
00:10:06,40 --> 00:10:11,219
Suppose the price is still the same, which
it won't be, but suppose that's the price.

147
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,970
But we are making it realistic,
-100,000.

148
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:21,390
Quick question, what will this number be?

149
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,540
And this is a quiz for you.

150
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,10
Think about it.

151
00:10:25,10 --> 00:10:26,790
Let me ask you the following.

152
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,719
Most people will be inclined to take 6%,

153
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,420
which they've already calculated,
and divide by 2.

154
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:40,189
That answer can't be right
because of? Compounding.

155
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,930
So the answer is,
because interest earns interest,

156
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:48,178
the number will be less than
half of what we've calculated.

157
00:10:48,178 --> 00:10:55,515
And I think it'll turn out to be 2.96%.

158
00:10:55,515 --> 00:10:57,630
One last comment.

159
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:02,10
If and when we see payment,
which is coupon,

160
00:11:02,10 --> 00:11:08,740
we will also divide the coupon by two,
because the coupons are stated annually.

161
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,170
And so, when you take a coupon, and

162
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,790
it's being split up every six months,
we'll have to divide that by two.

163
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,160
More on that later.
