Ok, what I'm going to do now is, do a little set of
examples which will kind of make you think

2
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:17,20
a little bit about the power of
compounding, and by the way, I also say

3
00:00:17,20 --> 00:00:21,580
this often, is that if you understand
compounding, you have arrived, because it's

4
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:26,28
mind-bogglingly complex. It's very
nonlinear, and very difficult to

5
00:00:26,29 --> 00:00:31,800
understand. And, this is where IÂ´ll also
introduce Excel, so let's do a problem.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,830
It's up there. Suppose you invest $1000
in the bank at an interest rate of 10%.

7
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:44,70
We will stick with the round numbers just for
convenience. We have done one period. We have done two periods.

8
00:00:44,70 --> 00:00:48,30
The one period is very easy. You can do
it in your head.

9
00:00:48,30 --> 00:00:53,50
The two periods started becoming a
little bit complex. Right? So, what did we

10
00:00:53,50 --> 00:00:58,99
have? Two period we had to worry about what?
Not just the 100 bucks a year that was

11
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,210
being earned on the original 1000, but
what happens to the 100 bucks after

12
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:08,180
one year. It should also earn money. It didn't
do anything wrong. Right? Money is money.

13
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:16,310
Here! Let's have 10 periods. So, let me draw the
timeline. I'm asking the following question.

14
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:23,420
You put 1000 bucks in the bank, and
what do you have after 10 years, and how

15
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:33,860
many periods have passed? 10. So, I'm asking
what is the Future Value of this? Right?

16
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:44,820
So, let's write out our numbers. We'll take P,
times one, plus R. Raised to power how much?

17
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:55,630
Not two, but ten. Let's, let's fill in the
numbers. So, our P was a thousand. Our 1 + 0.1

18
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:01,560
Remember, the rate of return is
always with decimals in it. Right? You

19
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,330
don't wanna be content writing ten
directly. That can be a pain, and raised to

20
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:12,590
power ten. Now, if you stare at it and if you
could do this in your head, there's

21
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,700
something seriously wrong

22
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,549
about you. You know? I mean you shouldn't
be doing such problems in your head

23
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:23,910
because you have better things to do in
life. So, what I want to do next is, when

24
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:29,650
we come back, we'll introduce you to
excel, but remember the functions we use

25
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,280
will be very similar to the terminology we
used before.

26
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,790
Ok? So, be prepared. I would ask you to
spend some time, try to figure out

27
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,190
where Excel is. Pull out the spreadsheet if
you haven't done it before. And, we'll do

28
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,750
it together.
