We are talking about

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:10,440
comparing things over time and the first
thing we need to understand is, because

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:17,970
time has value, you cannot compare time
0 with time 1 directly, even in very

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,779
sophisticated circles we approximate this
all the time, that means we are violating

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,350
the assumption that time has value and
this is not an assumption that's theoretical, it's

6
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:32,320
actually very practical so let's talk
about the concept of Future Value, right? We

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,879
used Future Values to show that Plan
A was better than Plan B. So what

8
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:43,480
is Future Value? Turns out, Future Value has two components: the first component

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,269
is the initial payment: how much was it?
The initial payment, IÂ´m writing again

10
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:57,700
was a $1000, but at which point did you
receive that? At point zero. But Future

11
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:03,770
Value is being measured at which point?
Point 1. So this initial payment can stay

12
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:10,549
1000 and nothing changes is only if
interest rates are zero, but then to this

13
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:15,840
initial amount for Plan A, to compare it
to plan B which is already 1000 but in

14
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,200
which period? Period 2, so it doesn't
have to be taken forward, right? You take it

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,530
plan A forward. The initial payment
was 1000 plus accumulated interest

16
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:34,549
and we calculated it, how much was that? 100 bucks. I'm not going to write out why 100,

17
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:40,460
because it's 10 percent of 1000, how
is 10% chosen? As I said I'm choosing

18
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:45,979
round numbers so that we can move on and do numbers in our head. In real life, it

19
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:51,850
will be determined by what I said was
competitive markets and not by 1%

20
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:57,189
squeezing you. This happens unfortunately and that's why the field of Microfinance

21
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:02,679
emerged, sorry I take detours, but it's
important to understand that competitive

22
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:09,619
markets are crucial to being, having
rates that are reasonable, right? So

23
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:16,19
accumulated interest, 100, so the
total becomes, what, 1100? Let's keep

24
00:02:16,19 --> 00:02:20,540
going with the formality of it a little
bit, so let's write out the formula so

25
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,19
the Future Value, if you look the
formulas right there, I will give you a

26
00:02:25,19 --> 00:02:29,950
sheet with some formulas but if you look up the Future Value has two components,

27
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:35,819
the many times people call it the amount, the
principal, this was 1000 dollars

28
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:45,899
and this was 10% of and this sign by the
way, the star is multiplication, is

29
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:52,739
multiplied by 1000, how much did
we get when we multiplied 10% by a 1000

30
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,200
we got 100 bucks, but you can write
it as this: notice there's something

31
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,738
common to the initial amount and the
interest which is the initial amount

32
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:09,200
which we call P, so it turns out to be
1 + R taking multiplied by P

33
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:18,899
because if you expand it, it becomes P + R P, now this little guy is behind every

34
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:26,200
Finance textbook, it's called Future
Value Factor. Writing again,

35
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:37,549
Future Value Factor.

36
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:47,120
And what do you think it is? It's simply the value of one buck, 1 dollar, how many periods from now? One period from

37
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,50
now, so if you know the Future Value Factor, and it's the value of one buck in the

38
00:03:53,50 --> 00:03:58,120
future, what do I need to figure out if
it's $ 1000 Future Value, I just

39
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,190
multiply it by 1000. So the
Future Value factor is an important thing

40
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,990
which was printed behind textbooks, still
is, because we didn't used to have

41
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:11,130
calculators and it was very difficult to
calculate very complex problems, remember

42
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:16,000
we are in a one period world, so the problem is extremely simple. I hope this is

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,260
helpful to you, when we come back in the
next short clip, I'll show you how powerful

44
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:30,849
Future Value can be and we will talk a
little bit about it, okay?
