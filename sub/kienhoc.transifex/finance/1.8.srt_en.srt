Welcome back. What I'm going to do now is
I'm going

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,730
to show you the real power of compounding.
We did ten periods. That is ok. Let me

3
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:17,500
show you the real power of compounding.
So, the question here is, and please write it

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,690
out,

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:24,970
what are the Future Values of investing
1000 dollars at 5 percent versus

6
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:31,460
15% for 90 years. Why am I asking this question? There's an
interesting background. Turns out that

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:38,160
data on US stock markets became really
available, very reliable data starting in

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,110
about,

9
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:44,239
beginning of 1926, and my alma mater,
University of Chicago was very deeply

10
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,430
involved in creating one of the most used
data sets. So, it started... So, 90 years have

11
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,300
passed. So, the interesting question people
always wonder about is, what would have

12
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,530
happened if I had invested in a low
risk? I told I'll talk about risk and

13
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:04,339
personal investing throughout this class.
Suppose you had put your 1000 bucks, your

14
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:10,940
great grandparents or grandparents had
put away for you, in a relatively low risk

15
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,860
investment, like buying a government bond,
which government bond is where they take

16
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:20,420
a loan, and we'll talk about this later in
the class. On the other hand, suppose they

17
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:27,259
had invested in stocks and that too,
invested in companies and that too, more

18
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:35,49
risky companies. Turns out, this is kind
of approximately what rate of return you

19
00:01:35,49 --> 00:01:39,789
could have made over the last 90 years
in the US context, right? So, that's why I'm

20
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:45,479
throwing out these numbers, and when I throw these
numbers out and you do it, it's pretty

21
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:52,469
shocking what you get. So, use Excel and I
will stay with you and do it. What is the

22
00:01:52,469 --> 00:02:02,219
Future Value of a $1000 at 5 percent or a
$1000 at 15%? And, after how many years? 90

23
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:07,839
years. So, what I'm going to do is, instead of go back
and forth with Excel, I'm going to use a

24
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,69
pen to write out what you should write
in a cell. So, pick the first cell.

25
00:02:14,69 --> 00:02:20,720
call it A1 and go up to the function
area, which like I showed you, and write

26
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,220
this.

27
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:26,880
So here you go. So, you put ¨=¨ sign in the
function thing ,and then what did I tell

28
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:35,470
you? Write "FV" And, let's do it at 5
percent. Do this with me, with an Excel

29
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:41,50
open. Then, write how much? The first is
the rate of return, and what is the rate

30
00:02:41,50 --> 00:02:47,940
of return? The first option we have is
0.05. Please remember you have to

31
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:54,320
be very careful entering the rate of return. It should be 0.05, not 5. Not in

32
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,920
percentage terms. Okay? I know we write it in
percentage terms, but what I'm saying in

33
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:08,920
reality, you want to write 0.05. How many periods? Well, I picked 90 because now is

34
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:17,350
2015, about 90 years have passed.
Right? 90, then what was PMT? PMT

35
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,799
remember is...something that you're getting
every year, but right now we're only

36
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,670
getting what? Putting money today, and
figuring its Future Value. So, the PMT will

37
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,988
be 0. Apologize for that we come to PMT in a minute. And then, PV is how

38
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:40,959
much? A thousand. You don't need to write
signs, dollars, or stuff like that. So,

39
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:47,959
no percentages, no signs of dollars
and so on, and then, press return. I will

40
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:52,590
write what you should get, and I'm going
to cheat a little bit. I've done it

41
00:03:52,590 --> 00:04:00,840
already. So, I'll write out the number.
It's 80730 dollars

42
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:09,989
and I'm going to be
painful, 37 cents. So, if you put a thousand

43
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:14,900
bucks in, somebody on your behalf put a
thousand bucks, 90 years ago at a 5%

44
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:22,300
interest rate, how much would you have? You should
get about 80730. This is a fair

45
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,970
amount of money, right? Suppose instead, you 
had invested in a less risky thing, which

46
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,400
number would have changed in this whole
setup? Only one number, and that's the beauty of

47
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,90
Excel, you go back and change that

48
00:04:34,90 --> 00:04:40,10
one number, and that one number is 0.05, you can change it. But, let's go up instead of going down.

49
00:04:40,10 --> 00:04:45,780
So now, I'm doing the second part of the
question which will be mind-boggling for

50
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:53,760
you. What is the future value instead of
5%, a relatively low-risk investment not

51
00:04:53,760 --> 00:05:01,130
zero risk, but as opposed to that, we are
investing in stocks of small companies?

52
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,20
Or smallish companies which tend to
have a high risk and high, higher

53
00:05:05,20 --> 00:05:09,900
expected return, and these are by the way
approximately ballpark numbers in the

54
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,929
US experience. So, the only number you
really need to change but I'll write it

55
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:21,410
out is the 0.05. I hope you're
doing this with me, otherwise I'll get upset.

56
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:28,610
And, you know somehow I'll know, regardless
of where you are, okay? So, you do this, the only

57
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:34,919
number that has changed is which one? But now
when you press Enter,

58
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:39,400
it will blow your mind because I'm going to
write only the approximate number

59
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:56,810
without decimals, it´s 290272 and 325. It is 0.21 after that, but see

60
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:04,360
what happens? Doesn't that kind of
make you pause? If somebody had put 1000 dollars

61
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:15,280
in a small portfolio of stocks, you could, I mean
technically, this is just after the fact.

62
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,840
But, you could have 290 Million dollars in the bank.

63
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,840
Look at my face. I mean it's like orders of magnitude.
So, the interest rate is only three

64
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,270
times larger, but look at the amount of
money. So, what does this tell you? That

65
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:35,490
Future Value and compounding are very
powerful. It'll work in reverse

66
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,639
when you are doing

67
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,830
Present Value and we´ll

68
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,550
do that. But, I want you to think about it,
stare at it, and tell me, what are the

69
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:47,70
two things that are driving this number
to be phenomenally high? The first thing

70
00:06:47,70 --> 00:06:53,310
obviously is the Time Value of Money,
which is 15%. In fact, the 5% was pretty

71
00:06:53,310 --> 00:07:00,350
high already. But, the other thing which
is acting like interest and helping

72
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:05,220
compounding is the number of periods.
Here, we have had how many years? Not one, not two

73
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:12,310
not ten, but ninety. And, it is the
combination of the two, that creates

74
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:19,230
huge amount of effects of compounding.
Stare at this. It's just mind-boggling. As I

75
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,70
said even Einstein said, "Man, I don't know
what's going on."

76
00:07:22,70 --> 00:07:23,90
See you soon.
