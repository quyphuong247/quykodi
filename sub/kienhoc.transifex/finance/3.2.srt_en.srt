Welcome back. We are on

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,519
application one. I call it mega

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:14,29
and particularly useful to understand Finance, because it has all the components,

4
00:00:14,29 --> 00:00:20,779
it has Time Value of Money, it has moving forward, moving backwards, and then you'll see very cool

5
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:26,649
stuff now. So what are the patterns we have observed in what we call the amortization table, which

6
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:31,110
by the way a bank can print out and should
print out for you, if you´re so desired.

7
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:38,50
If, if not, you can ask for it, right? So, it
basically shows you how a loan works.

8
00:00:38,50 --> 00:00:42,919
So, quickly let's capture the main
elements. How many components of a

9
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:51,980
payment?  So, our payment was about $23,739 and the answer is two. Right? One is what?

10
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:58,910
Interest, which you pay on the beginning
of the period balance, not the end. Right? Pay

11
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:04,629
interest for the usage of time and money. And,
the second is whatever remains goes and

12
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,420
pays off part of the principal. Which
component decreases over time? If you're

13
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,859
paying off part of the principal, the
component that is decreasing given that

14
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:22,679
your payment is fixed has to be
interest. Right? So, interest drops and

15
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:27,450
which one increases? The repayment
increases such that the last repayment

16
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,569
is exactly equal to the beginning of the
period balance. Because if that's not the

17
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:36,630
case, you're still keeping on paying some
interest and so on so forth. So, what I'm

18
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,499
going to do next is, ask you some simple
questions to show you the power of Finance.

19
00:01:41,499 --> 00:01:49,298
So, how would you figure out, for example, the outstanding balance after the second

20
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:55,90
payment? So, let me just...let me just ask
the following question. So here's the

21
00:01:55,90 --> 00:01:58,189
pen. And, I'm asking you this.

22
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:05,869
You have 1...5. The payment you're
making every year is 23,739.64.

23
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:14,599
I'm asking you the following
question: at time 2, after you've made the

24
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:19,329
second payment, how much do you still owe?

25
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:25,800
As I said, these are snippets I'm doing with you in complex problems and I'm keep going because you´ve

26
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,640
become a genius now. You know Finance. Now, you could do it the long way, which we just did.

27
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,929
You could start at time 0, and work
your way forwards, but this is the

28
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:43,200
awesomeness of Finance. Finance, one of
the main elements of Finance is, it looks

29
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,489
forward, it doesn't look back. It makes
life very simple by recognizing the

30
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:54,400
value of anything is the Present Value
of the future. Value of anything today is the

31
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,250
Present Value of the future. So, watch
Matrix, time travel to time 2, and ask

32
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,30
yourself: how much do you owe? That's the question, given you made two payments.

33
00:03:05,30 --> 00:03:08,600
Think for a second. The answer is pretty

34
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,489
straightforward, but very complex if you
don't know Finance. And it is,

35
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:21,840
it has to be the Present Value of what you
owe the bank. So, how do you do PV? You

36
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:37,550
know that interest is 0.06. You know the
payment is 23,739.64. But, you

37
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:46,440
want to know N now. How many N are left? Three. When you do this, you'll get the answer of

38
00:03:46,440 --> 00:04:02,109
63,456.34. Isn't that cool? Right? So,
you...the one thing I've told you now is a very

39
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:08,320
deep lesson of Finance or of thinking of
value. Value comes from the future and

40
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,549
looking forward, and then, remember you´ve gotta discount because of Time Value of

41
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:17,859
Money. But, where you look forward from is dictated by the problem you're trying to

42
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:23,640
solve. Trick question. If you were
standing at time 0, and I asked

43
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,000
you: what is the Present Value? what would

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:36,50
change here? This 3 would become 5. But, what answer should you get, and this is one of

45
00:04:36,50 --> 00:04:42,810
the most profound realizations of people when they figure it out. You don't need to

46
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,840
do this. You should know the answer. It has to be 100,000. So, one of the things we´ll realize down

47
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,299
the road is that Finance itself cannot
add value, in Present Value terms

48
00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:01,130
because it's just an exchange of money. Value creation, where you make more than what

49
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:07,570
you put in, comes from real ideas. Right? It comes from producing something like

50
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,930
an iPhone, which is very popular and people
seem to value a lot, rather than just

51
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,620
exchanging money. Ok? So, let´s do one more question, and then, what I'll do is, I'll

52
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,550
keep taking breaks within the first
mega problem because as I said, it's

53
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,520
pretty complex. I may do it in other mega
problems too, but I will do one more

54
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,599
question before we take a break. How would
you figure out the interest component of

55
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:37,120
the third payment? So now, I'm asking you a very simple question. So, you made a third payment, how

56
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,800
do you figure out the interest component?
Now, if you remember your basics, that the

57
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,690
interest you pay in any period is a function
of two things:

58
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:54,300
the dollar in amount, the interest rate and the
amount you owe at the beginning of the

59
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:54,950
period.

60
00:05:54,950 --> 00:06:01,719
Do we know the amount we owe at the
beginning of the third period, which is also, time

61
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:11,780
period two after you´ve made. Yes, we just
calculated it. It was 63,456.34. Right?

62
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:19,39
So, I'm asking you: what is the third
payment's interest component? We know the third

63
00:06:19,40 --> 00:06:29,229
payment was what? Also 23,739.64.
I'm asking, what is the interest

64
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:37,570
component of this? Very simple. Multiply it by 0.06, and I think the answer works

65
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,529
out to be

66
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:51,49
3,807.38. You see how simple
this is? So, you can basically do anything

67
00:06:51,49 --> 00:06:56,318
you want even if there are gazillion periods
to pay off the loan. So, if you took a 30

68
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,249
year mortgage. Right? Mortgage is a loan
against a house. And, you paid monthly

69
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:07,639
payments, how many periods do you have? 360.You would go nuts figuring out the amortization

70
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,999
table. We're going to take a break, and
kind of go in that direction to show you

71
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:14,359
the real power the first mega problem.
