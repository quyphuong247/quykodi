00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:09,374
https://youtu.be/NJSwZm-pWOs
Welcome, today we are doing
module three which I view as

2
00:00:09,374 --> 00:00:13,450
just a continuation of what
we were talking about.

3
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,880
Actually, with a huge overlap that
something we spent a lot of time on.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,169
Remember application one was on loans.

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,780
This whole module is on
something called bonds.

6
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:33,450
Now when I was discussing this with my
colleagues as to how to do finance for

7
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,900
everyone, many wondered that I should
use things like bonds and stocks.

8
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,250
Turns out,
the cool thing about finance is that

9
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,340
the importance of
fundamentals to everything.

10
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:51,128
Now bonds and stocks are words that
if you're 16 doing this course

11
00:00:51,128 --> 00:00:54,908
you may not relate to, but
if I pitch it the right way,

12
00:00:54,908 --> 00:01:00,660
it will make a lot of sense, regardless
of age, regardless of experience.

13
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,900
And I would encourage you among all
things to not only do the problem,

14
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,620
but to read the popular press.

15
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,420
Whichever language you find,
you find things like this everywhere.

16
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,279
Okay, so it's bonds.

17
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,810
So let's first start off clarifying lingo,
and

18
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,860
I'll go very slow in this whole course,
simply because there's a lot of lingo,

19
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,930
a lot of complexity, but
I want to not avoid all complexity.

20
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,780
I'm gonna hold your hand a little bit
more than otherwise because I think it's

21
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,300
important for you to basically
figure out how cool finance is.

22
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,789
So as the name suggest,
what a bond is something

23
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:48,700
that binds two people or two institutions.

24
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:56,42
And basically it's a contract
between a borrower and a lender.

25
00:01:56,42 --> 00:01:58,675
And one of the coolest things about it is,

26
00:01:58,675 --> 00:02:02,967
the borrower is the person who needs
the money for whatever reason,

27
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:07,860
doesn't have enough of it and the lender
is the person who happens to have more

28
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,760
than they need at that point in time and
is willing to trade over time.

29
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,100
Remember, time value of money.

30
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,329
It'll be inherent to
everything we talk about.

31
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,580
So a bond is a contract between
a borrower and a lender.

32
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,600
The word contract is very important
because we'll see it later.

33
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,900
And as you do more and more finance,
you'll understand what this is all about.

34
00:02:32,30 --> 00:02:34,230
It's an explicit IOU.

35
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:39,194
So contract or IOU is what I owe you,
a promise to pay money

36
00:02:39,194 --> 00:02:43,546
in the future in return for
money borrowed today.

37
00:02:43,546 --> 00:02:45,150
That's another way to think about a bond.

38
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,810
And the word bond can be classified
even simpler, we have seen it before.

39
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:55,100
So when you go take a loan for
whatever purpose we took loans for, for

40
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:01,220
buying an iPhone, I believe, or
going to school or buying a car,

41
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:06,940
whenever you take a loan,
what it ends up being it is a bond.

42
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,935
So we are going to talk about different
kinds of loans in this module,

43
00:03:11,935 --> 00:03:16,930
but the essentially nature of beast
is identical and becomes more and

44
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,446
more interesting, that's all.

45
00:03:19,446 --> 00:03:23,170
A loan is in the eye of the beholder.

46
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,382
So go back to Excel whenever we figure out
future value, present value and so on.

47
00:03:27,383 --> 00:03:33,984
If you plug in a positive number,
out comes a negative number.

48
00:03:33,984 --> 00:03:37,240
So the issue of eye of the beholder
is extremely important.

49
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,720
So if you have a positive
sign on a timeline,

50
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,980
that means a person is getting money.

51
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,769
If there is negative sign on the timeline,
the person is spending money.

52
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:52,230
But because there are two parties
in every financial contract, you

53
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:58,530
will be responsible to figure out whether
the money's flowing out or flowing in.

54
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:05,489
Bonds are extremely important
because loans are the primary way,

55
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,600
in spite of all the buzz
about stock markets and so

56
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:14,329
on, loans are the primary way
in which people who need money

57
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:20,20
get money and then people who have
extra money give money to others.

58
00:04:20,19 --> 00:04:24,30
And one of the reasons perhaps
is that bonds tend to be

59
00:04:24,30 --> 00:04:28,690
less risky than stocks so
that could be one of the reasons.

60
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,310
But on the other hand
there's another reason,

61
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:36,90
which is bonds can span all kinds of risk,
right.

62
00:04:36,90 --> 00:04:39,000
So for example,
if you take a very safe loan for

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,240
a safe activity,
the interest rate will be low.

64
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,20
On the other hand, we will talk
about loans based on credit cards,

65
00:04:47,20 --> 00:04:48,620
which are unfortunate, right?

66
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,580
Because a person using a credit card
to finance themselves in the US

67
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,900
is a person who doesn't have enough
money to even buy daily things.

68
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,260
I think that's unfortunate and

69
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,762
the interest rates on those are very
high partly because the default rate,

70
00:05:06,762 --> 00:05:13,337
the chances that the person won't pay back
are higher, but partly maybe artificially.

71
00:05:13,337 --> 00:05:18,175
So I'm not going to get into that
issue but I'm going to just talk about

72
00:05:18,175 --> 00:05:23,40
different types of bonds and
how risk going up means return goes up.

73
00:05:23,40 --> 00:05:27,820
So the complexity covered by
bonds is very, very rich,

74
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,500
so we could talk about bonds forever,
right.

75
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:38,950
So financing an iPhone, you need
a loan if you don't have money and

76
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,979
if you want to finance a home, you need
loans and those are called mortgages.

77
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:50,70
And if you notice, it's closely related
to all of the stuff and the crisis we

78
00:05:50,70 --> 00:05:53,760
went through, especially in the US
with housing prices falling and so on.

79
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:00,780
Activities of governments are financed
by what is called fiscal policy and

80
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,130
what does that mean?

81
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:08,110
Governments issue bonds in large
quantities to finance their activities.

82
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:14,240
Again, hopefully, for stuff that we
collectively need and believe in, right?

83
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,750
So one of the passions that I
have is that government should

84
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:24,70
fund education all over the world.

85
00:06:24,70 --> 00:06:28,290
And one of the concerns
in higher education is,

86
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:33,70
that maybe perhaps pressures
of different kinds of expenses

87
00:06:33,70 --> 00:06:37,760
have led governments to not support
higher education as much as before.

88
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:43,247
And this is extremely important
because I believe education probably

89
00:06:43,247 --> 00:06:48,459
is next only to health in terms of
empowering and enabling people.

90
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:54,595
Finally, turns out that indirectly,
but very powerfully,

91
00:06:54,595 --> 00:06:58,961
financier bonds are used
to create value and

92
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:02,740
that's where I will get into stocks.

93
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:08,350
Because stocks are issued by companies,
by entities, and when they borrow,

94
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:14,970
they borrow to create hopefully what
we call positive value creation,

95
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,890
by ideas that are better and better and
better, and we'll talk about those.

96
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,719
Those are called corporate bonds.

97
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,710
One small caveat, that corporate bonds are
bonds that are traded in the marketplace.

98
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,953
On the other hand, many companies,
all of them borrow, but

99
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:40,30
they borrow directly and privately from
banks and those loans don't trade.

100
00:07:40,30 --> 00:07:46,147
What's interesting is that there's
something called securitization that I'll

101
00:07:46,147 --> 00:07:52,000
talk about later which happened in the
mortgage business where loans issued but

102
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,349
private banks are then combined and
created into tradable securities.

103
00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:02,203
Okay, it has huge potential, but
of course, a lot of risks as well as

104
00:08:02,203 --> 00:08:07,90
we've seen in recent times,
especially if not executed with care.
