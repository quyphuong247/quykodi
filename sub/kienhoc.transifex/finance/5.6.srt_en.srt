1
00:00:04,935 --> 00:00:06,861
https://youtu.be/wGbgQEmmTv4
So we'll do special cases.

2
00:00:06,861 --> 00:00:12,250
But these two special cases I tell to
everybody is basically life as finance.

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,579
If you understand them deeply,
you can go so far it's amazing.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,650
These formulas we'll do are the basis of
multiples which is used in valuation.

5
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,439
The basis of valuing stocks,
the basis of valuing companies.

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,190
And when you put things in spreadsheet,
they look very complicated.

7
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,590
But essentially this is what's going on.

8
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:33,449
So let's start of.

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,250
Suppose dividends are expected to
remain approximately constant.

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,20
Remember, what is the value of a stock
the present value of all future?

11
00:00:42,20 --> 00:00:43,160
Dividends.

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,769
Supposed the dividends
are approximately constant.

13
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,270
Do you know the formula for this?

14
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,919
When you are a little and
we met first, we talked about it.

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,170
So you can actually show very
easily that the present value for

16
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:01,640
something called the perpetuity is
the cash flow over the discount rate r.

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,370
So what does the formula become?

18
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:09,777
The formula becomes, and
I'm going to write it,

19
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:15,116
the price of a stock
today will be D over r,

20
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:22,920
assuming that D is approximately
equals to D1 = D2 = D3.

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,920
And set stocks that
are dividend paying stocks.

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,740
Isn't this school,
this is so straightforward.

23
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,880
So in life, we use spreadsheets
because these are changing.

24
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,184
Think about it that way.

25
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:35,390
But you can always do that.

26
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,990
But if it's approximately constant,
why not just approximate.

27
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,850
So let's do an example and
you will see how cool this is.

28
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,660
So suppose you expect a Dividend, Inc.

29
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,60
How creative by me.

30
00:01:50,60 --> 00:01:53,000
Anyway, is expected to
pay 1 buck per share for

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,423
the foreseeable future and
the return on it's business is about 5%.

32
00:01:57,423 --> 00:02:01,990
So how does 5% and
the dividend is expected to be 1 buck.

33
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,520
What should be the price?

34
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,113
Now, you can get easier than this.

35
00:02:05,113 --> 00:02:06,685
So what do you do?

36
00:02:06,685 --> 00:02:11,761
If you noticed you write P knot =

37
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:16,840
to 1 buck divided by 0.05.

38
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,350
And the answer should be 20 bucks.

39
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:26,620
So stock valuation can be very
simple if you are kind of approx,

40
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,530
you want an approximate value.

41
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,260
So simple that it's just funny.

42
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,540
So this is going to what
does the start going to do?

43
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,829
It expect you to last pretty much forever.

44
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:42,160
Now, you miss a lot, that's impossible so

45
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,20
let's just put some kind
of finite life on it.

46
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,571
So suppose, you actually think
it last only 50 years and

47
00:02:49,571 --> 00:02:51,480
here's the beauty of that formula.

48
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,936
That 50 years because of compounding or

49
00:02:54,937 --> 00:03:00,580
the reimburse of the discounting,
what will be the value of this?

50
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,550
And I would encourage
you to figure this out.

51
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,390
This is what kind of problem?

52
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,840
This is a PV problem, with an r of what?

53
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:16,410
0.05, and the number of PV is 50.

54
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,35
And what is PMT?

55
00:03:18,35 --> 00:03:22,340
1, close bracket.

56
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,988
Took a long time to do.

57
00:03:23,988 --> 00:03:29,967
[LAUGH] Do it in Excel,
this approximately will be 18.26.

58
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:31,269
What does this mean?

59
00:03:33,556 --> 00:03:34,569
Stare at it.

60
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:35,880
So let me ask you this.

61
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:43,700
The value we got for a perpetuity was 20,
so 20 minus this is what?

62
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,601
$1.74.

63
00:03:45,602 --> 00:03:48,612
And do you know what that
is the present value of?

64
00:03:48,612 --> 00:03:52,490
Getting 1 bucks starting
in year 51 forever.

65
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,660
I mean, that's all it's worth today.

66
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,450
You are getting 1 buck
repeatedly every year forever.

67
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,260
So on the other hand, now,
let me change the example and

68
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,170
try if you increase the interest rate to
10%, what will happen to this number?

69
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,50
This number will become lesser and lesser.

70
00:04:13,50 --> 00:04:15,590
So how the interest rate,

71
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:20,647
the more the discounting effect and
the closer you're seal with

72
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:25,390
r formula is to what you would need to do
even with the spreadsheet, pretty cool.

73
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,560
Let's do the second special
case before we take a break,

74
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,190
we'll do an example of it, too.

75
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,180
So what happens if it's a growth stock?

76
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,450
So what is a growth stock?

77
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,729
Growth stock says, I will pay D1, and

78
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:45,657
what will D2,
we have done stuff like this,

79
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:50,84
D2 will be D1 over (1+g) and so on.

80
00:04:50,84 --> 00:04:54,622
So suppose this is the kind
of stock you expect to buy.

81
00:04:54,622 --> 00:04:55,905
How will you value it?

82
00:04:55,905 --> 00:04:57,125
It's pretty straightforward.

83
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,351
Remember?

84
00:04:58,351 --> 00:05:04,10
P knot over = D1 over r -g.

85
00:05:04,10 --> 00:05:06,940
You can, of course,
use it only if r is greater than g.

86
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:12,190
So many times what happens is in
the context of valuing a company,

87
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,960
it may or may not be paying dividends.

88
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,950
But you'll see later,
dividends come from cash flows.

89
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,120
And then, you decide to pay a dividend,
as I said.

90
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,420
You could not pay a dividend
if you're growing.

91
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,190
So suppose you're getting
a dividend every year.

92
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,640
This problem is pretty straightforward.

93
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,650
But if g is greater than r then you use
a spreadsheet until r becomes less than g

94
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:37,460
and it won't take you long to figure out
that r can't be less than g forever.

95
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,810
I mean it's just not possible.

96
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,600
So just think about this.

97
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,450
Let's do an example,
and see how easy it is.

98
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,340
So suppose Growth, Inc.,
now I'm getting really creative,

99
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,590
is expected to pay tomorrow's
dividend of 2 bucks per share.

100
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,349
Everything is per share because shares
trade the whole company doesn't trade

101
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,670
meaning there's no one share for
the whole company, multiple shares.

102
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,780
And private companies have shares and

103
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,349
more than one held by a very
small group of people.

104
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,990
Actually, yesterday I was
doing a case in class on

105
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,640
a very famous company called Kohler.

106
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,200
It makes kitchen stuff and
all, and is a private company.

107
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:25,700
And it had about 400 shares at the time
the case was situated, all held privately.

108
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,940
Some trading went on between people, but

109
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,690
this is a publicly held company worth
2 bucks per share, expected next year.

110
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,514
But after that, it'll grow at 2.50%.

111
00:06:36,514 --> 00:06:42,125
So D1 is 2 and

112
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:49,149
g is 2.50%.

113
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:51,433
And to make life a little simple,

114
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:57,239
r is greater than g which is when you want
to use this formula, otherwise you don't.

115
00:06:57,239 --> 00:06:58,748
What is P knot?

116
00:07:01,706 --> 00:07:10,363
P knot is 2 over 0.05 which is $40.

117
00:07:12,30 --> 00:07:13,940
And you see how simple this is, right?

118
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:20,380
So both the propagate formulas with or
without growth are pretty straightforward.

119
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,440
If there is no growth,
this formula would be what?

120
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,380
This was what?

121
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:30,365
D over r minus g,
where r was 7.5 and g was 2.5.

122
00:07:30,365 --> 00:07:34,564
If g is 0, then of course
the value of the firm drops.

123
00:07:34,564 --> 00:07:35,416
Why?

124
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:40,62
Because a growth firm is more
valuable all instruments

125
00:07:40,62 --> 00:07:43,196
remain the same getting more money.

126
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,230
But the discount rate hasn't changed.

127
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,950
So growth thinks price will be 40 bucks.
