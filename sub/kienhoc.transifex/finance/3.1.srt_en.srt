Welcome.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,780
This is a little bit of a transition

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,950
though I, as you must have realized by now, I think

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:20,860
that finance is so applicable that everything
we have done, even up to this point

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:26,570
simple though it is, is highly applicable. But now I'm going to do something that I

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:32,119
don't do with advanced students or advanced programs. Because this is finance for

7
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:38,500
everyone. I'm going to do some really,
really interesting applications which will

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:45,980
show you how to problem-solve. I hope
you've started doing assignments, already.

9
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:51,980
There was an assignment linked to every
module there is, it's good to practice

10
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:57,419
but it's entirely up to you when you're
comfortable doing that right? So it's no

11
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,50
that's the one thing I like about
digital education is that, you are in

12
00:01:03,50 --> 00:01:07,689
control, right? So what I'm going to do is
complicated problems, the one thing that

13
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:16,779
will change probably is, I will not stick
to 4 or 5 minutes videos if the situation so

14
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,920
demands. In fact I have a joke which I'd like to share with you is that, one of the

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,869
best practices of online education is to have short videos,

16
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:32,289
six minutes or so, but many times I don't remember my name and takes me about 2 minutes to figure it out,

17
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:36,549
if you wake up in the morning, who are
you? And I'm wondering that's just too

18
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:42,740
deep for me to answer, so I'll keep going
according to the dictate of the issue...

19
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,658
dictates of the issue, right? So just be
patient. You can always pause, move

20
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:51,850
forward, watch in twice the speed and so on. So let's start, I call these mega

21
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,749
problems.

22
00:01:52,749 --> 00:01:58,609
So mega problem number one. It's an application that you've seen before, but I'm going to

23
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:06,568
kind of show you the beauty of finance and beauty of the complex world. It's a loan and

24
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:12,220
a loan I will pick up is for college,
you've done it before, and then I will

25
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:17,40
expand on it, so if you look at the
screen, you'll see a very familiar

26
00:02:17,40 --> 00:02:23,819
problem. You're planning to go to college
and your parents and you get together

27
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,959
and figure out you need $100,000

28
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:35,60
and at time zero and you're going
to take that loan and it's required to be

29
00:02:35,60 --> 00:02:49,380
paid over five years, right? R is 6%, n is
five years and PV is $100,000.  I put a

30
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:54,500
comma here but don't put it in Excel
right, so just keep reminding you. So what

31
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:02,320
I'm trying to solve for here is, how much will you owe every period starting 1..5 times?

32
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:15,000
Okay? The thing I will retain is the yearly, so let's
redo this in some senses very quickly. So

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,590
you'll do equal sign, PMT, right? And
then you'll enter, sorry 0.06

34
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:34,850
n is five and PV is $100,000 and the answer you will get is, I'm just looking over to

35
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:39,60
make sure, 23,794

36
00:03:39,60 --> 00:03:53,310
oh sorry, $23,739.64, okay.
So $23,739.64 we did this problem before, what I'm going

37
00:03:53,310 --> 00:04:01,950
to do is retain the ease of calculating
this, by that I mean yearly payments even

38
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,609
though we'll make it more complex, so let's
see one of my most nifty ways of

39
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:11,240
teaching finance. Stare at the screen and
you'll find something called an

40
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:17,480
amortization table. Now this'll sound really complex but it's not and I will walk

41
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:23,80
through this with you, with this problem
to teach you how a loan works. So what is

42
00:04:23,80 --> 00:04:31,430
beginning balance? Just let me explain, so
year is 1,2,3,4,5. Following

43
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,380
convention, everything is happening at the
end of the period. So when we say yearly

44
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,600
payment, it's not happening at time 0,
it's happening at a time

45
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:49,910
1,2,3,4,5 yeah? But, it's very important to
remember that it's the beginning of the

46
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:55,360
period too. So the beginning balance that
you notice on top, what will it be in the

47
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:04,450
first year? That's the amount you start
off with. So let's write it out, $100,000. What I'm going

48
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:11,849
to do now here is work through how the
loan works and you... if you have... if you

49
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,750
have the desire, start doing this in
Excel, because you can set it up very well

50
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:23,960
in Excel. Question is 100,000
beginning. Now what is the yearly payment?

51
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:31,729
We already know it. Another word for this is PMT and remember we solved that number

52
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:45,220
to be 23,739.64. Again, if I make
some errors I'm going to try to catch

53
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,470
them, if not just say Gautam is a bozo, I know
how to do this, So just write it out.

54
00:05:50,470 --> 00:06:02,610
23,739.64. What I like about the amortization table is not the table in itself, but how

55
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,150
it works gives you a sense of how things
are working in real life, now every

56
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:12,770
payment, virtually every payment has two components and sometimes one of the

57
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,49
components is 0, we talk about that later.

58
00:06:16,50 --> 00:06:20,620
So what are the two components? The first component is interest, the second

59
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:26,30
component of this yearly payment is
principal repayment, because that's how it

60
00:06:26,30 --> 00:06:29,719
works, you pay interest for the use of
money, but then you also pay some of the

61
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,520
money you borrowed 100,000
because if you don't do that, you'll be

62
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,430
in what is called an interest-only loan

63
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:42,270
and the loan will stay forever. There are
things like that, but let's stick with the most

64
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:48,710
normal stuff. So how much is interest? So
the way to work this out is, you know the

65
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:55,419
annual interest is 0.06, right?
Interest rate, but how much is the

66
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:01,470
interest you're playing in terms of
dollars? This times the beginning balance.

67
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:06,680
So interest is how much is the percentage rate determined by the market place,

68
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,890
given to you by the bank and how much
did you borrow at the beginning of the

69
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:16,520
period, right? Because the interest is for
the use of the money. So how much is this?

70
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:27,909
0.06 times 100,000 is 6000.
Very simple, but please remember that

71
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:33,750
interest is a function that you pay at
the end of the year, the cash flow is a

72
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,780
function of what you borrow at the
beginning, then how much is principal

73
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:44,289
repayment? Very simple. Take this yearly amount and subtract 6,000 from it. So how

74
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,410
much is left?

75
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:57,270
17,739.64. So now what's the next
step? So you've done one payment at the

76
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:02,760
end of the first year, you know you
paid an interest of 6,000, but 17,739

77
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,810
is what you paid on the beginning

78
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,920
balance. So what's the beginning balance
at the beginning of the year two?

79
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:19,900
Beginning of year two beginning balance
sounds pretty mouthful. It is this number

80
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:34,299
subtract repayment from it, how much are
you left with? 82,260.36, I'm going to

81
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:40,140
be a little painful. As I said, I'm going to
do these problems with you, so 82. How

82
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,410
much are you paying at the end of the
second year? Same amount.

83
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:52,199
So think of this amount as a contract, think
of this amount as a contract you're paying. Now

84
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:59,339
question is, how much interest is the
component of this 23,000? Has it gone up

85
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:04,970
or down? It's gone down because 6 percent of 100,000 is more than 6 percent

86
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,110
of 82,260. How will you figure out the interest

87
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,839
component? Again, simple. Take 6 percent
interest and multiply the beginning

88
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,480
period balance and I'm going to write
it out because it's little bit more

89
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:29,80
difficult than multiplying 6% with the 1000. 935.62, right?
 I'm in the right

90
00:09:29,80 --> 00:09:35,150
direction because the number is going down, right? How
much is...am I repaying now? Think about it, I'm

91
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:40,250
repaying more or less? I am repaying more
because the payment I'm making is fixed

92
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:45,540
and the interest has gone down. So the amount
I'm repaying is

93
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:54,899
18,804.42, right? As I

94
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,529
said, you can do this by yourself, you can
now set up, I've done enough. You can set

95
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:04,860
up a spreadsheet which actually models
all of this, right? It's

96
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,279
very very simple. You start off with a
payment that's fixed, so let me just write all

97
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:27,420
these down, right? So you've got all the
payments that you're paying, fixed amount

98
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,219
every year, what's changing is everything
in the table, but in a very systematic

99
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,850
way, right? That is the interest is going
down and the principal is going, repayment

100
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:41,619
is going up till what's happened at the end of year 5,
you paid off everything. So let me

101
00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:52,249
quickly enter these numbers. 63,456.34, how did I get that? I took

102
00:10:52,249 --> 00:10:58,339
82,000 and subtracted 18,800 from
it, right? What will this be? This will be a

103
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:07,790
number less, it's about 3807.38 and I'll have a number here that's

104
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:14,529
higher than 18 and it's 19,932.

105
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:22,59
26. I'm talking so that you can
compensate for my bad handwriting, sorry

106
00:11:22,59 --> 00:11:36,689
I'm laughing but it's kind of funny to me.
This is 43,524.08, this is

107
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:48,379
2611.44 and this is 21,128.20.

108
00:11:48,379 --> 00:12:04,870
This number is, this number minus the
repayment, which is 22,395.89, you paid

109
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:21,200
this, interest is 1343.75 and 22,395.89. What is the cool thing about

110
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,730
it? This amount and this amount are equal which means what? The beginning of

111
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:35,680
balance at the beginning of year 6, which is end of year 5, how
much we owe the bank? Nothing, so the

112
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,630
thing to remember here is, please use Excel
and create this. Take the time to do  that.

113
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:47,550
You'll feel very cool. This is one
application where, I will now take a

114
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:52,400
break, because I want you to work on this,
create the Excel spreadsheet, we will come

115
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,140
back and then have some fun with this
and I'll show you how beautiful finance

116
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,640
can be.
