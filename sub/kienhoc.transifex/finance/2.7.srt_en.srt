Now for

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,430
one of the most

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:14,399
perplexing concepts which I thought couldn't possibly be useful, but is more useful than

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,730
anything I apply. You know you can be
very naive and this is the concept of

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:28,580
perpetuity and I have a very complex
accent, so I say perpetuity other people

6
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,689
say perpetuity so differently

7
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:35,420
its a tongue twister for me but anyway, what's a
perpetuity? Think about perpetual,

8
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,760
it's forever. So I said how could anything be forever? So turns out, a perpetuity is

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:48,790
this. It is a multiple payment that goes
on forever. So let me just draw the

10
00:00:48,790 --> 00:01:03,879
timeline, you have one, two and some period n, C, C, C.  if you notice, it can be with

11
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:09,000
or without growth. Growth in what? We will soon do more complex problems. In an

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,940
annuity, it stops at n and the C's were
fixed, but the C's could grow,

13
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:24,950
I'll explain that in a second but a perpetuity doesn't stop at n, it keeps going on, C,C,C,C,C

14
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:33,930
forever and
turns out it looks very complex right?

15
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:45,540
What is the Present Value of a
perpetuity? It's C over 1+r, C over 1+r,

16
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,570
square. How many times? A gazillion times, this by the way, this curly little

17
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:59,789
monster is my way of writing infinity, so
if you look at this, this looks like a

18
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,579
mind-boggling, even excel couldn't do it. If you have
the patience and the time and you are nerdy enough,

19
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,728
this is actually very easy to solve.

20
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:14,879
And it's because it's geometric progression
right? So you can do it and the answer

21
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:22,40
will turn out to be, C over r, so if a perpetuity is fixed forever actually the formula is

22
00:02:22,40 --> 00:02:28,798
very simple, it's C over r, and why is
this useful? Turns out that there's

23
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:34,110
something called a console in England
which pays one pound of whatever forever

24
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:42,660
and you can buy. But that's not the only use, its a very powerful basis of almost all

25
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:51,269
valuation of things called, stocks. So
think of this: an annuity is applicable to

26
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:57,379
something that has a fixed life and
that's why we did things like loans, but

27
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:02,629
a perpetuity is applicable to things
like stocks, where, what a stock is and we'll

28
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:08,429
see this late in the class, people thought
why teach stocks to an introductory class?

29
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:15,599
Because it's so beautiful and it's so
applicable to thinking that I'm using

30
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,839
stocks as a concept that will pull you in
many ways. So what is a stock? When you

31
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,370
buy a stock in a company, there's
no contract between you and them. You buy a

32
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:32,419
share and what you give some money and
hope to get in return, money not just

33
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:37,690
once if you hold it for a long time but
forever and that payment is called

34
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:43,380
dividend. So the C becomes a D that's
all. But the neat thing about stocks is

35
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:51,129
that, it's not a contract, but it wants to
live forever and therefore all valuation

36
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:56,239
of stocks and long-term companies like
companies are also long term, fit together very

37
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,000
well. I'll get into that. We wouldn't want
to get too excited right now but the

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,129
thing I wanted to tell you is that if
cash flow lasts approximately forever and

39
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:11,220
a C,C,C, the formula is pretty
straightforward. So very quickly, if I get

40
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,910
10 bucks every year for the rest of
eternity

41
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,630
and interest rate is 10%, what's the Present
Value? You can do it in your head then

42
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:29,340
divide it by 0.1 point, don't divide it by 10, 0.1. It's $100, you see how simple it is? So a lot of really

43
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:35,140
really thoughtful people who know all the
details of finance use such shortcut

44
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,280
formulas in a context which is
applicable right? Not in a very short

45
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:47,30
term loan but in the long term context. 
Examples of perpetuities: So the first

46
00:04:47,30 --> 00:04:53,590
example of perpetuity is a stock, you can
think of

47
00:04:53,590 --> 00:05:04,310
company, you can think of any long term
stuff because it's very powerful. So for

48
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:16,800
example, if I gave you 10 bucks forever
at, and the r was 10%,  you'd

49
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,900
have ,because

50
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:33,388
it's 10 over 0.1. The beauty of it is, yes
companies want to last forever, stocks want

51
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:38,840
to last forever but suppose you have a
very long term horizon and suppose

52
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:50,429
n was 30, you can approximate a
perpetuity. So do it for yourself please.

53
00:05:50,430 --> 00:06:03,350
So do, equals PV and by the way I haven't
done it. I am just...Take time, 0.10 and

54
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,720
instead of infinity, what you're trying
to do is PV of a payment, right?

55
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:22,810
How many times? Thirty times. What is the PMT? 10 bucks. If you press return,

56
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:30,550
this you'll find to be a very, very close
approximation of this and the reason is

57
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,380
very simple.

58
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:38,800
First, the longer your horizon, 30 is
much longer than 5, and the higher

59
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,630
your interest,

60
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:52,419
the closer the applicability of
perpetuity formula. I was looking for it, C over r

61
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:57,680
And the reason is very simple. Because of the  power of discounting, anything happening

62
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:07,50
beyond year 30, year 31 is what? Its impact to today's PV of the whole perpetuity

63
00:07:07,50 --> 00:07:13,419
is very low, so the Present Value of the
31st year's cash flow is very, very low

64
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:17,609
most of the value is coming from the
earlier cash flows and that's true

65
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:25,120
especially if 0.1 is a pretty high
interest rate if that's the case. I want

66
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,389
to do

67
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:31,910
couple more things and then take a
break right?

68
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:37,60
Because we're coming towards the end of
what I would call simple applications

69
00:07:37,60 --> 00:07:41,350
and I want to show you the power of
perpetuity, simply because it seems

70
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:46,500
like the simplest application and it's
applicable to very complex things like the

71
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,890
long term stuff, stocks and bonds, so
there's one more thing about perpetuities and

72
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:59,990
that is suppose the first number was C,
but the second one was C times 1+G

73
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:15,810
and the third was C times 1+G squared and this went on

74
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:23,30
forever. There is a name for some animal like this, and it's 
called a growth stock. So if you buy a

75
00:08:23,30 --> 00:08:28,500
company that's growing very fast or growing period for a while as opposed to a

76
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,490
company that's not growing and is paying
out dividend fixed amount cash flow every

77
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:41,279
year, this kind of company is like a really aggressive growth technology company. The

78
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,830
formula of the perpetuity turns out to
be C1 because now you have to write C1

79
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:54,480
right? Because C1 is not equal to
see C2. So what is C2? C2 is growing at rate

80
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,130
G, and suppose this is 2%, that will
give you a sense of what I'm talking

81
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:05,50
about, right? So if you say inflation is
2% you would hope that your cash flow grows at

82
00:09:05,50 --> 00:09:09,930
2% but suppose inflation is
close to zero, which is the environment

83
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:15,89
in many places today. You still want your cash flows to
grow if you're genuinely growing.

84
00:09:15,89 --> 00:09:23,830
So it'll be C1 over R-G. Many people say but this formula doesn't make any sense if G is

85
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:28,610
equal to R or greater than R, point is
yes, it doesn't make any sense. So don't

86
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:35,80
use it, you know? So use what? The long formula and use the short formula when it's applicable and

87
00:09:35,80 --> 00:09:39,610
that's what we'll see later is that exactly
what we'll do, but this again is so

88
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:45,720
powerful, I actually believe if you
understand this, this, and this  you know all of finance,

89
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,760
because that's the beauty. These
capture the power of compounding, the

90
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,430
power of valuation, especially of
long-term complex things and the notion

91
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:05,319
is the more complex the thing, the less
valuable it is and in the future is to try to

92
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,690
be very precise about C1, C2, C3 because you're going to be wrong anyways

93
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:14,240
right? So you are making a decision today, that's impacting you forever.

94
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,40
Investing in a company, starting a
company, whatever. The more uncertain you

95
00:10:19,40 --> 00:10:25,240
are actually, the more shortcuts like
this really help you think through the problem.

96
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,810
But you have to know discounted cash
flow, the details, to make sense of it. So

97
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:36,530
before I end the segment, I wanted to
highlight one thing. I will put all the

98
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:41,870
formulas and I'm clicking through so if
you stare at the screen for a little bit

99
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,339
there are two pages with the formulas here. I don't want you to worry about them, because

100
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:50,810
they are lots and we have talked about
most of them. Some others we'll talk about

101
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:56,949
as we do more complex problems. I'm going to post for you as notes. I'm doing that

102
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:02,860
because it's very tedious to keep writing these formulas. I also am doing that

103
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:08,300
because I think you will probably not use the formulas by hand

104
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:14,000
you'll use Excel but Excel needs to know the formulas right? So they're built into Excel for the most

105
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
part and whenever the formulas are not built in, I will work with Excel to

106
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,400
make you understand what's going on.
