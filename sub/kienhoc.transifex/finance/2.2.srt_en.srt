I would encourage you to now

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,450
see the beauty of applications and as I

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,229
said we'll build applications slowly but
then we'll do some pretty complicated

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,90
stuff, and we´ll spread it out in the first two
modules because, I want the first two

5
00:00:19,90 --> 00:00:24,830
modules of this course to give you
concepts applied, but then really applied

6
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:31,820
to more complex situations, same concepts.
So let's start off with this. Please read it.

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,590
What will be the value of your bank
account if you deposit thousand dollars

8
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:42,800
every year in a bank. You plan to leave
home in five years and expect to earn 5%

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,110
in your bank account. So you're in
college, you´ve started investing every year

10
00:00:47,110 --> 00:01:03,629
$1,000 in the bank, so the key thing is,
it's an annuity, of how many years? 1...2, I

11
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,290
won´t right out all the numbers, so you
are going to put it at

12
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:20,960
five, so you know N is 5. What is the other secret?
The secret is, what is R? It's equal to

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:29,288
5 percent. Now in Excel when you put this number,
N will be 5, but R will not be in

14
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:35,819
percentage terms, sometimes in calculators, it is, HP
calculators especially, as far as I know, or most

15
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:42,29
calculators. Here you'll enter 0.05,
please remember that. But the final thing

16
00:01:42,29 --> 00:01:52,209
to remember is, if you are putting in a
thousand bucks, how many times are you

17
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:57,759
putting it in? Thousand times. Now the
little bit tricky-ness to this is,

18
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:04,840
convention is that, a normal annuity
doesn't start at time zero, it starts at

19
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,440
time 1, as I said, you can change it and
then the future you can start some

20
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,470
payment at time zero, you can start
saving. All it does is, it shifts the timeline,

21
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:19,700
but a standard formula assumes the first
payment is at the end of the first year

22
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,839
and the last one end

23
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,959
at the 5th year, ok? So we'll stick with that
for the time being. When you become

24
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,470
proficient with moving money over time
and that's what... that's why I say watch

25
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:35,349
Star Wars, Matrix and you'll be cool in
Finance. You have five payments at the

26
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:41,470
end of each period. So the question is, in
Excel, this is what you'll do. You´ll do

27
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:46,510
equals and what are you trying to figure
out? Remember, you're trying to figure out

28
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,179
the Future Value and this is a very cool
problem, because everybody's thinking

29
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:57,310
about this, ok I need money in the future.
I´ll save now, I´ll save every year, if possible and

30
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:04,150
how much will I have when I go to college? So
Future Value, you want, but the first

31
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:10,260
number in Future Value is which one? 
Rate, you´ll press, I would encourage you

32
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,170
to open your Excel and do this with

33
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:22,480
me. Put Cell A1, equal sign, FV, 0.05, what
next?

34
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:32,130
5, which is for N, yes? And the next number
remember, the convention will look for a

35
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:40,590
PMT, so now you're ok, you can put 
1000. But is there any PV or anything

36
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,560
going on? No.

37
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:48,670
So you´ll close the parenthesis and you'll hit
return and if you hit return, you... as I

38
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,929
said, because you put a positive number
here you'll get a negative number here. If you

39
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,410
want to make this negative, all you can
do is put a negative sign or put a

40
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:03,190
negative sign in front of FV and in this
context it makes sense because you're

41
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,30
investing for the future,

42
00:04:05,30 --> 00:04:09,750
you are losing $1000, you get it in the
future. So you may want the final number

43
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,200
to be positive but that's just kind of
in your head, so if you want to be really

44
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,849
painful, looking at it from your
perspective, not the bank´s, you may want

45
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:25,669
to make all these numbers negative.
That's just up to the problem. So what

46
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:32,8
will this turn out to be? I think this
will turn out to be five thousand

47
00:04:32,9 --> 00:04:40,589
five hundred and twenty five dollars 63 cents. I would
encourage you, every time I do a problem

48
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:46,789
I'll do right now very focused problems.
First of all, isn't this cool? So let's

49
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:50,498
try to undo this and I'll do that a lot in
this class.

50
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:58,419
Okay, suppose interest rates were zero,
how much would you have? Very simple 5,000.

51
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:04,659
Because why? You are putting thousand every
year, five times. However, you are getting

52
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:11,370
525 bucks more than
the 5,000. Why are you  getting that? Because of? As I

53
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,710
said, all answers are compounding.
