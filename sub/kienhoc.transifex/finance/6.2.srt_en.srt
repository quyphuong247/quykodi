00:00:05,331 --> 00:00:11,746
https://youtu.be/btwyWeyjL8w
So hopefully you've had the time to think
about the 10 companies and the S&P 500.

2
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:13,542
So what's going on?

3
00:00:13,542 --> 00:00:16,698
The first thing that jumps out at you,
hopefully,

4
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:20,110
is that, all the stocks have
higher standard deviations

5
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,720
than the S&P 500.

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,710
And the probability of this
happening is very, very high.

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,125
In fact, the lowest one next to it is 16%.

8
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:32,206
So one of the things that's
pretty amazing is, and

9
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:36,216
this is one of the fundamentals of
diversification is, if you took

10
00:00:36,216 --> 00:00:41,87
the average standard deviation of the ten
stocks, if you just average them, and

11
00:00:41,87 --> 00:00:46,630
I'm eyeballing them, I didn't average,
because I just wanted you to have fun.

12
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:53,916
Chances are, they're about 30% or
at least greater than 25% is the average, right?

13
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:54,992
Just stare at it.

14
00:00:54,993 --> 00:01:01,64
The highest is 40, the lowest is 16, and
they're hovering between those numbers.

15
00:01:01,64 --> 00:01:05,994
So turns out substantially greater
volatility, on average, for

16
00:01:05,994 --> 00:01:09,612
individual stocks, as opposed to S&P 500.

17
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:12,735
And they're representative
of many industries, right?

18
00:01:12,736 --> 00:01:15,825
They're not all in tech or
something like that.

19
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:21,501
[COUGH] So what this tells you is, the
notion of a portfolio makes so much sense,

20
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:26,489
because what happens is as soon as
you combine stocks in a portfolio,

21
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:32,530
standard deviation starts going down,
volatility starts going down.

22
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,210
And the reason is very simple.

23
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:37,210
There are two kinds of risk,

24
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:42,320
broadly speaking, in each stock,
and one is called, some

25
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,509
risk that changes with the whole world, with the whole economy, with the global economy, right?

26
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,184
So if the economy goes
up, the stock goes up.

27
00:01:50,184 --> 00:01:52,470
If the economy goes down,
the, stock goes down.

28
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,830
So one source of risk is market risk.
The other source of

29
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,700
risk is the stock has
something specific to it.

30
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,670
It's called idiosyncratic.

31
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:05,400
Long word, or specific,
or peculiar to a company.

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,170
Could that happen?

33
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,90
Sure, the company's stock
may be jumping up and

34
00:02:10,90 --> 00:02:12,540
down regardless of what's
happening to the

35
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,70
marketplace, right?

36
00:02:14,70 --> 00:02:16,49
That's called specific risk.

37
00:02:16,50 --> 00:02:18,900
So what happens when you combine
a bunch of stocks together?

38
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,380
Which of these two risks
actually cancels each other out?

39
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,510
And if you have done a little bit of math,
or statistics, or

40
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:31,269
use your intuition,
it becomes obvious that it's the specific

41
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,290
risk that cancels because
it's not related to each other, right?

42
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,579
The market is related.

43
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:42,410
So the reason why, say, IBM's price goes
up related to the market is the market

44
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:48,500
is common to IBM but it's also common
to Xerox or it's also common to Intel.

45
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,840
So that risk stays, but

46
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,450
the risk that's peculiar to
the three of them tends to cancel.

47
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,530
And you can show very quickly,

48
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,446
you can show that, if you select stocks
across the entire spectrum possible,

49
00:03:01,446 --> 00:03:07,600
like the S&P 500, it'll pretty much
get rid of idiosyncratic risk.

50
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,640
And that's what's going on.

51
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,799
That's why people love portfolios,

52
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,730
because that's the same as not
putting all your eggs in one basket.

53
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,299
So what are the bottom lines of investing?

54
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,960
You know bonds, you know stocks,
you know what I just said.

55
00:03:23,60 --> 00:03:28,690
Even without doing risk in detail,
if we are risk averse and

56
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,558
seek to minimize risk,
we should hold portfolios, not stocks.

57
00:03:33,558 --> 00:03:35,890
That's as simple.

58
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,529
I just showed you that.

59
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,450
Why take on volatility that's unnecessary?

60
00:03:42,60 --> 00:03:46,630
If markets work,
we may want to just hold portfolios.

61
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,40
What I mean by that is
existing portfolios.

62
00:03:49,40 --> 00:03:54,642
So if markets are working and you have an
existing portfolio stocks called S&P 500,

63
00:03:54,642 --> 00:03:58,397
you now can just hold that portfolio,
the whole portfolio by itself.

64
00:03:58,397 --> 00:03:59,960
It's pre-constructed,

65
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:02,30
you're not buying individual stocks.

66
00:04:02,30 --> 00:04:03,290
So what's happening?

67
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,120
You're holding portfolios or you're not only diversifying,

68
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,460
you're not picking individual
stocks to put in your portfolio.

69
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:17,620
So pre-existing portfolios are mutual
funds have become unbelievably popular.

70
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,640
In fact, and the main reason is,
they reduce transaction cost.

71
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,604
So why would you create your
own portfolio and spend money?

72
00:04:25,605 --> 00:04:29,340
Because every time you buy and
sell a stock, there's one person that makes money.

73
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,900
And that person is the broker.

74
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,440
So why don't you buy and hold?

75
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,320
That is the reason why
mutual funds have taken off.

76
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,750
Mutual funds are existing
stocks in a portfolio.

77
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,290
Now, of course,
there are many such portfolios available.

78
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,310
So why?

79
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,102
Because even the risk of each
one of them is different.

80
00:04:51,102 --> 00:04:55,284
So for example,
if I want a more risky portfolio,

81
00:04:55,284 --> 00:04:59,370
I could just create it and
it's just so cool.

82
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:05,100
I can buy the market, invest in the S&P
500, and borrow and invest in the S&P 500.

83
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,340
And automatically increase my risk.

84
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,60
Why would I do that?

85
00:05:10,60 --> 00:05:14,170
I'll do that only because I like
more risk because I like more return, right?

86
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:21,690
So if I'm risk averse, doesn't mean all of
us have the same level of risk tolerance.

87
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,640
But all of us would want a reward
on average for taking on risk.

88
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:32,370
So I want to pause here and
say one last thing about risk and return,

89
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,220
is that you are much more in control
of your investment strategy.

90
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,880
So figure out what your
tolerance for risk is.

91
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,969
So suppose you are a person who is
only investing in government bonds

92
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,500
as supposed to stocks,
nothing wrong with it.

93
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,440
Risk and return come in pairs.

94
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,351
You're neither a good person nor
a bad person for it.

95
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:57,390
You just have a lower tolerance for risk.

96
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,150
On the other hand, the more and

97
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,469
more you go towards stock,
you're revealing your preference for risk.

98
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:08,730
And these days, you can buy portfolios
with an array of different risk

99
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:12,190
profiles and
they'll come with, on average,

100
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:17,460
an array of different returns which
match high risk, high return.

101
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,110
This is such a simple 101 of
finance that it's unbelievable

102
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,690
how few people actually practice it.

103
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,690
There are many people who think
they can beat the market, but

104
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:32,190
there are others who are so
uninformed that they think that

105
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:36,580
somehow creating a portfolio
requires some kind of a genius.

106
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,859
No, it doesn't.

107
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,660
In fact, a lot of portfolios
are available currently that

108
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,680
are very low transaction costs, and
basically they make the whole market.

109
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,400
With different mixes of risk of course,
therefore there are many, now you can also

110
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,989
be diversified within an industry if
you want to take that chance, and

111
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,880
then you have industry portfolios and
so on.

112
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,229
We'll take a little break.

113
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,830
I'm going to now move
on to the next clip and

114
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:10,609
talk about what next in the course and
what after the course.

115
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:17,370
So this is true wrap up time, so that
you get a sense of where you could head.

116
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:22,129
And where I would love you to head if you
were to choose to go in that direction,

117
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:22,726
of course.
