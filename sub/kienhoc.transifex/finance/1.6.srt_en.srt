If you notice now, and
you look at the screen,

2
00:00:07,672 --> 00:00:10,990
I will talk, and you watch what I'm doing.

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,620
But please remember that
I could make mistakes.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,930
So I have notes created for
you of how to use Excel.

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,550
And if I make a silly mistake,
we can fix it.

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,510
So what was the problem
we are talking about?

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:28,830
The problem we were talking about was,
what is the future value

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,800
of a thousand bucks after how many years,
10 years and interest rate was 10%?

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:40,860
Now, if you notice on the function button,
I should write equal first.

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,500
Put that, and follow it by what
you're trying to calculate,

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,720
which is future value.

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,870
As soon as you press future value and

13
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:53,780
open the parenthesis,
you'll notice that it asks you for input.

14
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,450
And the input is pretty easy to
understand, barring one term,

15
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,980
which I will talk about very briefly,
and then we'll get to later.

16
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,680
So the first term is rate.

17
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,330
What does the rate mean?

18
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:09,620
Rate is the interest rate,
and please put it in

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,850
the form it's supposed to be,
which is 0.1, right?

20
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,539
Don't put it in percentage terms.

21
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,750
Some calculators allow you to do that,
but Excel, you put it as 0.1 not 10.

22
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,400
Then put a comma.

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,190
And if you notice, the next thing
it asks for is number of periods.

24
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,740
Now, you know how many periods, right?

25
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,520
Excel does.

26
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,896
So the problem dictates, as I said,
number of periods, so you see.

27
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:43,290
If you put ten, and
then you put a comma again,

28
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,860
now comes a little bit tricky thing,
which we haven't covered until now.

29
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,590
We are looking at one payment
carried ten years forward.

30
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:56,80
What PMT stands for,
you could get payments every year, right?

31
00:01:56,80 --> 00:01:59,808
So for now, you're not getting
anything beyond point zero.

32
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:06,280
So for PMT, which is a term for payment,
we'll see very soon, you'll put zero.

33
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,690
Because if you saw the timeline,
nothing is happening between zero and ten.

34
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:15,178
At zero, you put in 1000 bucks, and you're
not putting in more at time one, two,

35
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:16,667
three, four, five, six.

36
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:19,995
If you were,
this PMT would come into play.

37
00:02:19,995 --> 00:02:25,748
So put zero for PMT and
then it asks you PV.

38
00:02:25,748 --> 00:02:27,745
And we know what the PV is.

39
00:02:27,745 --> 00:02:31,818
PV was thousand bucks, so

40
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:36,75
the answer turns out to be,

41
00:02:36,75 --> 00:02:40,518
it should be staring at you,

42
00:02:40,518 --> 00:02:44,237
$2,593.74.

43
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:48,490
And you know, sometimes I tease,
let's drop the cents, and so on.

44
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:52,47
But sometimes if the billions
of dollars are involved,

45
00:02:52,47 --> 00:02:54,627
you don't want to approximate things.

46
00:02:54,627 --> 00:02:58,635
So here, what happened to the $1000?

47
00:02:58,635 --> 00:03:05,70
$1000 became $2,593, almost $2,600.

48
00:03:05,70 --> 00:03:08,230
Just pause for a second, and
think about what's going on.

49
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,280
So suppose there was no compounding,
how much will you have after ten years?

50
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,810
And as I said,
you can pause and think, but

51
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,870
I will keep talking about simple things.

52
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:23,280
If there was only simple interest,
you will get 100 bucks every year,

53
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,830
which is 10% of the thousand.

54
00:03:26,20 --> 00:03:27,790
And so how much will you have?

55
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,799
A thousand bucks,
hundred multiplied by ten.

56
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,915
Add that to the original amount,
how much do you have?

57
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:42,284
2,000, but you now are getting
2,600 almost, 2,593.74.

58
00:03:42,284 --> 00:03:45,640
You're getting that extra amount

59
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,640
entirely because of the fact
that interest earns interest.

60
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,730
I hope you found this useful.

61
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,310
I would encourage you to pull
up the Excel spreadsheet.

62
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:01,360
And I know I'm doing very sharp
clips right now but with a purpose.

63
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,370
I want you to not only understand the
concept, I want you to be able to do it

64
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,970
with me, because right now,
we are in very simple territory.

65
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,518
I made it very complex intellectually but

66
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:15,660
very simple to execute if
you know how to use Excel.
