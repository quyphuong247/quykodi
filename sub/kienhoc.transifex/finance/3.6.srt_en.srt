00:00:05,60 --> 00:00:11,629
https://youtu.be/YuXpXw21W0k
Mega example or application number three,
and I call it financial planning.

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,90
I would draw your attention to the problem
and take a few minutes to write it down.

3
00:00:16,90 --> 00:00:17,210
I'll read it out for you.

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,990
Abebi, who has just
celebrated her 25th birthday,

5
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,439
plans to retire on her 55th birthday.

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,270
So what should you be doing right away?

7
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,189
Drawing a timeline.

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,790
She has just set up a retirement fund

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:35,60
to pay her an annual income
starting on her retirement day.

10
00:00:35,60 --> 00:00:36,93
When does she retire?

11
00:00:36,93 --> 00:00:37,590
Age 55.

12
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,990
And to continue paying for 20 more years.

13
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:47,510
Now, sometimes the wording of a problem
becomes complex by just writing it.

14
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,870
So let me ask you, how many retirement
incomes does she want annual?

15
00:00:53,50 --> 00:00:57,930
She wants the first on her 55th
birthday and 20 more, so 21.

16
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,490
Remember, n is important
in all our calculation.

17
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:06,499
Abebi's goal is to receive $50,000 for
each of these 20 years.

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,780
So the good news is, that you know
exactly what planning you've done.

19
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,290
And how much you'll need every year,
based on looking forward,

20
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,20
figuring out how much money you want.

21
00:01:18,20 --> 00:01:23,130
This is again your decision,
based on your needs, right?

22
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,820
Abebi has committed to set aside equal
investments at the end of each year for

23
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:32,740
the next 29 years,
starting on her 26th birthday.

24
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,50
And I'm laying this all out for
you in a way that makes it easy for

25
00:01:37,50 --> 00:01:38,950
you to use standard formulas.

26
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,100
But when you get into Excel and feel
very comfortable, you can just rock and

27
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,119
roll over time.

28
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,800
But right now,
I'm making sure you understand.

29
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,54
The annual interest rate is 5%.

30
00:01:52,55 --> 00:01:54,698
And the question says,

31
00:01:54,698 --> 00:02:00,122
how much does she need to save every year,
okay? So,

32
00:02:03,699 --> 00:02:08,50
this problem is a little bit complex,
because it's similar to the previous one,

33
00:02:08,50 --> 00:02:11,620
but in my book,
with a different kind of perspective.

34
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,20
The perspective of the previous
one was tuition for college.

35
00:02:16,20 --> 00:02:19,190
This is the perspective for retirement.

36
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:24,390
And I said I'll try very hard to
bring you into the course, based on

37
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,339
what you wanna do and
what is appealing to you.

38
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,121
So this is kind of a different mindset of a person than the person going to college.

39
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:37,370
Okay, so let's draw the timeline first.

40
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,10
And that'll help us break up the problem.

41
00:02:40,10 --> 00:02:42,344
So the timeline is this.

42
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:54,316
And I'm going to interpret the problem,
which will make it simpler for

43
00:02:54,316 --> 00:02:55,710
you, okay?

44
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:00,802
So your timeline is this, 0,
which in this case happens to be what?

45
00:03:00,802 --> 00:03:02,930
Age 25.

46
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,550
So I'm writing the age of the person so

47
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,220
that it becomes easy,
but time 0 means today, right?

48
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,740
So that's the 1.

49
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,640
What's the next age that's important?

50
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,450
55.

51
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,10
Why is it important?

52
00:03:20,10 --> 00:03:23,320
Because that's the decision
point at which things will,

53
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,420
that's a point in the future which
is a life event, they call it,

54
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,839
where you'll suddenly become from the saver
to spender because you're retiring.

55
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,90
You're of course spending too while
you're up to age 55, but you know things.

56
00:03:38,90 --> 00:03:42,310
So starting at the retirement,
what does it say?

57
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,610
That she has just set up a retirement
fund to pay her annual income

58
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,410
on her retirement day,

59
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:52,809
and to continue paying for 20 years.

60
00:03:52,809 --> 00:04:02,293
So the first payment is 50,000... 50,000.

61
00:04:02,294 --> 00:04:04,580
How many times?

62
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,480
n is 21,

63
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,700
where this n is for what?

64
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,660
Retirement income.

65
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,440
Remember there are two Ns.

66
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,817
One is for how do you solve the problem
of what you need in the future?

67
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:20,530
The other n is how many
times will you save, okay?

68
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:25,450
So this is fine, and
you know you need this 21 times,

69
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,180
and you need it in the future.

70
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,360
So 75 will go on, I mean,
25 will go on till 75, okay?

71
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,409
We know now what the problem looks like,
but what don't we know?

72
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:46,180
We don't know the saving every year needed
which is also a PMT problem, all right?

73
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,420
I could make it complex like last time,
by making the saving grow every year.

74
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,490
But I'm not going to do it,
because this is already pretty complex.

75
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:01,120
So given this timeline, can you now
break it up into bite size pieces?

76
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,180
Let's do that.

77
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,803
And let's try to solve the problem, okay?

78
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:09,806
So the first solving the problem

79
00:05:09,806 --> 00:05:15,000
issue is, what is the PV of return?

80
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,140
So think about it.

81
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:22,902
The interest rate turns out to be,

82
00:05:22,903 --> 00:05:29,80
is, I'm just looking at 0.05.

83
00:05:29,80 --> 00:05:32,852
And how many years will you
need retirement income?

84
00:05:32,852 --> 00:05:34,799
21.

85
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,40
And what will be the retirement income you
need annually, is it a PMT or a FV?

86
00:05:41,40 --> 00:05:43,74
It's a PMT of 50,000.

87
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,310
This is very straightforward, but
remember, the key here is to remember,

88
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:56,470
the first payment is year 55,
second one is year 56.

89
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,520
Remember, you are going forward in time.

90
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,349
So when you do this PV,
in which year will this PV be?

91
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,440
It'll be in year 54.

92
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,60
I almost feel like apologizing but
that's the convention.

93
00:06:09,60 --> 00:06:12,700
The convention is, the first
payment is one year from now, and

94
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,80
you will slip up on this, everybody does.

95
00:06:16,80 --> 00:06:20,308
So this PV turns out to be,

96
00:06:20,308 --> 00:06:25,883
if I calculate it, it will turn out

97
00:06:25,883 --> 00:06:30,902
to be 641,057.64.

98
00:06:30,902 --> 00:06:33,549
So, what do I know?

99
00:06:33,549 --> 00:06:38,7
I know in year 54, I need to have

100
00:06:38,7 --> 00:06:43,510
$641,057.64 to do what?

101
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,930
To be able to finance
$50,000 how many times?

102
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,270
51 times.

103
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:52,560
That's based on me, Abebi's projection.

104
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,197
Now what's the next step?

105
00:06:54,197 --> 00:06:59,910
Figure out PMT.

106
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,80
Think about it for a minute,
can you, answer is yes.

107
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,530
But you have to recognize
the nature of the beast so

108
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,609
when are you starting to save?

109
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,570
And when are you ending to save?

110
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:19,701
You're starting to save pretty much in
the year 26, you're starting at year 25.

111
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:23,380
26 will be your first payment, and
the last one will be in year 54.

112
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,289
So you have 29 payments.

113
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:32,200
26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33 and
so on and so forth, right?

114
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,222
So this n turns out to be 29.

115
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:42,260
And you've clarified that and
I did it with you on the timeline.

116
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,890
Now in the real world,
this will become much easier.

117
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,507
Because when you're doing your own
problem, you know your timeline,

118
00:07:48,507 --> 00:07:49,925
whatever that is, and so on.

119
00:07:49,925 --> 00:07:51,360
So this is a key number.

120
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:59,700
We are assuming r is 5%, okay?

121
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,630
Now what do I need to do?

122
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:06,310
I know n, I know r,
do I need to solve a PV problem?

123
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,210
An FV problem?

124
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,820
PMT problem?

125
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,10
What combination do I need?

126
00:08:12,10 --> 00:08:17,920
Well, I know, I know my number that
I need at year 54.

127
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,850
So I have to be thinking Future Value.

128
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,450
I cannot be thinking PV.

129
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:28,580
I could do PV by bringing this back to
year 25, but that is an unnecessary step.

130
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,680
Why?
Because I know how to solve for

131
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,390
PMT with Future Value too.

132
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:39,199
So, I do PMT, 0.05, what is n?

133
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,980
I've done it, so these two numbers I know.

134
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,505
And then finally,
I know that the first function is 0,

135
00:08:47,505 --> 00:08:50,794
because it's PV, so you put a 0 there.

136
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:52,326
And then put what?

137
00:08:52,326 --> 00:09:00,150
641057.64.

138
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,170
So what do I get?

139
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:08,98
I get all the numbers in, and if I press
Enter, you should get an answer of,

140
00:09:10,728 --> 00:09:16,679
required saving is 10,286.10.

141
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:21,516
So if you save $10,286,

142
00:09:21,516 --> 00:09:26,000
you will save how many times?

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,190
29 times.

144
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,723
How much will you have after 54,
at age 54?

145
00:09:30,723 --> 00:09:36,579
641,000, which is a lot of money, right?

146
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,390
So if you were saving $10,000,
approximately, and

147
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,856
there was no interest,
the amount would be what after 29 years?

148
00:09:44,856 --> 00:09:47,970
Little less than 300,000.

149
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,380
How did I get that?

150
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,890
I multiplied 10,000 by 30.

151
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,550
I had 300,000.

152
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,776
Now you get a lot more money,
you get 641,000.

153
00:09:55,777 --> 00:09:59,377
Because the interest rate is 5%,
reasonably high, but

154
00:09:59,377 --> 00:10:01,880
what's important is, you're working.

155
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,40
The money is working for you and
you're repeatedly putting money.

156
00:10:05,40 --> 00:10:06,490
29, over 29 years.

157
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,630
So this solves the problem.

158
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,496
Let's take a break before we
do the next mega problem.

159
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:18,703
And then we'll be done with
the application phase, for

160
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:23,714
the first component of this course,
which I call the basics of Time

161
00:10:23,715 --> 00:10:28,480
Value of Money, applied to more and
more complex situations.
