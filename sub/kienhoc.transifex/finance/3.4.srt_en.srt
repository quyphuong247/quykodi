00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:11,180
https://youtu.be/C9R3maDPt8g
Welcome. We are doing applications
and I call them mega problems.

2
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:17,220
They are mega for the context, right?So, what I want you to know is that, they're not mega mega as we go

3
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:22,210
more and more advanced, word problems become more
and more complicated.

4
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:29,850
The first one we did was, very detailed and I hope
to do this one very detailed as well.

5
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:35,420
The next two, I will let you do a lot of stuff on
your own and guide you, but the first two

6
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:41,879
capture a lot of complexity for this
level. So up there on your screen, you

7
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,89
should be able to read the problem and I´ll
read it slowly with you.

8
00:00:45,90 --> 00:00:50,690
College tuition has been rising at a
rate of 2.5% per year and this is

9
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:56,290
typically inflation, that has been
happening, at least in the US and I'm

10
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:03,710
sure elsewhere too unfortunately because, tuition going up is not very good for families, right?

11
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,869
Currently the average tuition of a
state college is $10,000. So State College

12
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:14,930
meaning, a college that a person is going
within their state in the US and I use

13
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:19,119
a lot of examples from the US but, I'm
sure there´re similar setup elsewhere.

14
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,899
Emilia's daughter Jessica will begin
college in five years. So notice the

15
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:28,679
first complexity, I've taken you to the
future and that's why I keep teasing

16
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:34,539
watch Matrix and you´ll get it, you get
Finance. So five years in the future.

17
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:41,110
Emilia's portfolio of savings is making five percent annually. So what Emilia, the mom has done, has

18
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:47,390
been saving for Jessica to go to college
among other things. How much does

19
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,610
Emilia need to have set aside today, to
pay for four years of college for

20
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:58,489
Jessica? Now, what happens in word
problems that are written up in the

21
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:04,330
context of how we are learning today is
that, they can only go so far in making

22
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,929
the world real. So there can be sources of
confusion. That's part of the reason why

23
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:16,80
I'm doing the problems is that, to clarify
to see how the wording gets translated into

24
00:02:16,80 --> 00:02:20,709
reality. In real life things can be
simpler in a way, right? Because you know

25
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:24,400
when you're going to save money, what for

26
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,790
and so on. So, let me first do what I
recommend everybody to do, is to draw a

27
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:37,70
timeline and that really helps. I'm
going to go slow in this segment.

28
00:02:37,70 --> 00:02:50,369
We start at time 0 which is now and then
you keep going forward. So, time 1, 2.

29
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:56,649
The next time that I will enter is 5.
The reason I'm entering 5 is because

30
00:02:56,649 --> 00:03:01,260
5 years from now is when Emilia is going
to go to college, right? So that's when

31
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:09,729
the first tuition will be paid. Then 6,7,8.

32
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:12,580
Another interesting thing about tuition

33
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,879
and you'll see this in later problems as
well or I will call it the investment tends

34
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:24,298
to happen one year before the cash flows
occur later, so for example, if you start

35
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:29,599
a company, you tend to spend money buying
equipment and stuff like that before, you

36
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,599
actually start making money, right? This
is the nature of the beast, so you pay tuition,

37
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:41,668
in this case in years 5,6,7 and 8 and typically those will be at the beginning of

38
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,60
the years of her starting college, right?
That's the nature of the beast.

39
00:03:47,60 --> 00:03:51,640
I'm just highlighting what the real world looks
like, okay? So what will I do with this

40
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:58,700
problem is, first of all recognize the
important elements, here and then you'll

41
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:07,310
have cash flows here, here and here. These
will typically be negative numbers, right?

42
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,599
You'll have some negative number going out here
and we call that tuition, but the

43
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,238
problem that we are trying to solve is
over here. So, the first thing you have to

44
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:23,18
recognize is, there is a gap of five years
and how do you deal with it, right?

45
00:04:23,20 --> 00:04:28,198
Things like that you should be very aware of.
The first step in doing this is, first

46
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,460
draw the timeline and I'm going to
highlight a few things when I solve this

47
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,969
problem, because I'll use Excel to do it
without using Excel, so that you open up

48
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:41,599
Excel and you follow what I'm talking and it
will be useful.

49
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:47,349
You have a handout about how to execute
Excel and my goal is to make you go

50
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:53,409
there, but not do it for you kind of thing, right?
First understand what the problem is.

51
00:04:53,410 --> 00:05:01,10
So the question: the one thing I need to know
which I can know is what is the amount of

52
00:05:01,10 --> 00:05:04,650
tuition I will be paying and in which year in the future?

53
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,549
The problem is tricky because, the amount
of tuition is changing every year

54
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:15,90
because of inflation and in that little
reality makes this problem

55
00:05:15,90 --> 00:05:22,450
complex too for our level. So, let's keep going, we break
up the problem, solve the problem in

56
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:42,200
pieces using financial tools. So let's
start. I will call this A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, right?

57
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,20
I'm writing all these out and if
you notice, how many are there?

58
00:05:47,20 --> 00:05:54,700
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Open up your spreadsheet and
you'll see these are the natural

59
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:04,250
timeline that Excel provides you, Okay? So
what I'll do here is, I'll write 10,000

60
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:15,180
as the tuition today. What will it be at time
0? So that's the natural timeline.

61
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:24,160
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8

62
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,260
I'm sorry I am going slowly, but I think once you
get this one example, it'll useful doing

63
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:34,680
everything else. So what will the cash
flow be at this time, the tuition.

64
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:44,620
It's pretty simple. I'll just write it out. It´ll be 10,250. So I already know this, how do I know this?

65
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:54,700
Because I will take 10,000 and
multiply it by 1.025. You can do it in

66
00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:04,700
Excel very simply, by taking item B as
item A times 1.025 and if you keep doing it

67
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:11,140
you will get numbers for each row,
but which is the number I'm really

68
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,950
interested in? I'm really interested in
and I'm going to write that one out is,

69
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:29,140
11314.08. That's the first number I'm
really interested in. How do I know that?

70
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:36,560
Because it´s in number five corresponding to
year five and how would you get that number?

71
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,610
Notice what I've done on top, if this is
for 1, this is for 2,

72
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:48,830
this is for 3, I just keep changing
the number, this is for 4 and this is for 5.

73
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:55,280
So, this effectively becomes the Future
Value five years from now, but Future

74
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,909
Value of what? You have to be very careful.
Future Value of the tuition, because the

75
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:07,40
inflation rate is not necessarily and
hopefully not identical to the discount rate, right?

76
00:08:07,40 --> 00:08:12,980
So, the discount rate in our
problem is, let me write out, is 5%.

77
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:18,260
Those are two distinct things, right? One captures the first one,

78
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:24,920
discount rate is supposed to capture
inflation plus more, right? So 113,

79
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:32,570
11596.93

80
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:49,60
11886.86 and 12184.03. If I
make a mistake, please figure it out and

81
00:08:49,60 --> 00:08:54,689
correct it. Hopefully I have not made a
mistake, right? So the first step is to

82
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,850
figure out the tuition and it seems to be
okay, why? Because it's not a flat number.

83
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:05,150
The important thing to recognize is even
though, she will not go to college

84
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:11,500
till year 5, inflation doesn't wait for her, right? So
inflation is happening. Sorry, I laugh

85
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:17,230
at my own jokes as usual. So now that I've gotten
the first piece, first bite sized piece

86
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,880
is these four tuitions that I will pay
and remember they'll be typically at the

87
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:28,320
beginning of the year, right? Even though she's doing college and so on. She'll end college in year 9.

88
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,260
That's of interest, but the tuition
will happen in year 8. That's the nature

89
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:39,949
of the beast, Okay? You've gotten the first number. I would recommend very strongly is,

90
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:47,590
trying to populate all these cells in
Excel, Okay? We are in which row? We are in

91
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:55,260
row number one. We could be in any row but
I'm waiting for you to put all these down.

92
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:02,60
Now comes the second step, step number two.
This was step number one.

93
00:10:02,60 --> 00:10:08,540
Step two is to figure out the value of these
cash flows. Now the natural instinct is

94
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:16,189
to come directly to today, right? But more
sensibly you can do using Excel or

95
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:23,40
using the formula. The trick here though is, you
want to use the PV formula, right?

96
00:10:23,40 --> 00:10:27,630
If you did a PV formula, when would
it tell you the value? It would tell you the

97
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:32,880
value at point 4. It would be at point
4, because remember the one convention

98
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:39,630
built into all formulas unless you want to change them is that, the first cash flow happens one

99
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,580
year or one period ahead.

100
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:48,860
So, if it's happening in 5, the formula
will give you a number of... at time 4.

101
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,000
This is very important to remember, but
there's another thing you want to know,

102
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,150
is if you use the PV function, you will not be able

103
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:05,850
to execute this and the reason is, the
PV function allows for a FV or a PMT

104
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:11,260
and PMT by nature, cannot be used here
because it's typically assumed to be a

105
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:18,540
fixed number. So, here's another thing I
will introduce. Do NPV and I'm

106
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:25,250
reminding myself that it will be in
year 4. Why? Because if the first cash

107
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:32,560
flow is in year 5, if I simply use NPV, that's
what will happen. So do equals NPV, the

108
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,930
4 remind myself, in Excel will be equal NPV
and you'll notice the first

109
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:50,150
number is the rate. Press 0.05, Okay?
We'll get later in the course, we'll see

110
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:56,130
what the N stands for, but Excel is kind
of not able to distinguish between PV

111
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:01,70
and NPV. So, I use NPV as a way of doing
cash flows that are changing over time.

112
00:12:01,70 --> 00:12:05,890
That's what I remind myself, okay? So 0.05. Now, here's the trick.

113
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:19,590
The first number is sitting in which?
F1, right? And the last number sitting in which one?

114
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:25,420
This is why I like Excel. Excel just wants to know where
the numbers are sitting. So if the first number is

115
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:37,780
sitting in column F, row 1, I plug F1 and 
the last one F, G, H, I. I have done this and

116
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,939
what do I get? I hit return and I'm
staring here.

117
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:50,580
I will get 41,586.22,

118
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:59,150
Okay? So this is basically the Present
Value, but in which year? In year 4, Okay?

119
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:05,680
We have done step 2, but there's another
step left. I didn't ask you how much will the

120
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:12,699
mom need, Emilia need to have in her
trust fund, a year before her daughter

121
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:21,590
starts college. I'm asking you now. So step 3 is, what is the value at time 0? And

122
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:32,60
this, you should be able to do pretty
easily. Say equals PV, what is the first

123
00:13:32,60 --> 00:13:41,260
number you press in PV? Rate 0.05. Now, you
need to press N and the N is 4.

124
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:47,200
Again, please remember, I explained that and did it very slowly. Why is it 4? Because of

125
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:54,840
the nature of how formulas are typically
set up, Okay? So 4, but then PMT is nothing and then

126
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:05,850
the Future Value is 41,586.22.
The cool thing about Excel is, if this

127
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:12,100
number is sitting in some cell, right?You
can just reference that cell instead of

128
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,980
writing out the whole number here. Turns
out, when you press Enter,

129
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:30,160
you will get a number equal to 34,213.09. Please take your time, pause this video,

130
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,420
redo this problem. When I come
back, I'll do something that I won't do in

131
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:40,400
as much detail later, but like the first
application, I want to take this

132
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,199
application and squeeze out all the
learning from it.

133
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,40
We´ll be back in a second. Please look at it again.
