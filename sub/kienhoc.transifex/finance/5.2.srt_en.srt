00:00:04,924 --> 00:00:07,690
https://youtu.be/Neyu727UbPY
So let us try to understand
stocks a little bit better.

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,210
I give you an overall context about them.

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,630
So let's get going.

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,700
We know what bonds are.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,290
How is a stock different from a bond?

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:22,99
And the one characteristic that's very
different is, a bond is a contract and

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,580
a stock is not.

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,729
In other words,

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,170
remember when we did a bond, it was
like a loan, that's another name.

10
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:35,390
You never get a loan if you go to raise
money, whether it is you personally or

11
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,810
it's a corporation, or
the government, or name it.

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,680
You will never go get
a loan unless you say,

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,669
commit to how much will you
pay back in the future.

14
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,720
And we saw last time that paying
back in the future is determined

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,949
first before you can even figure
out the value of the loan.

16
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,120
So, it's pretty straight forward.

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,640
But between a stock and a bond,
when you go raising money,

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,90
stock is not contract.

19
00:01:05,90 --> 00:01:06,590
So which comes first?

20
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:13,140
Typically, it's always bonds come
first when you're about to pay them.

21
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,250
In other words when you have
raised money from bonds and

22
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,740
stocks, the person who gets paid
first are the bond holders.

23
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,350
And in some senses they
are less interesting people but

24
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:29,000
when you initially start a firm,
if you don't have any equity or

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,240
any stocks in the firm, no money,
nobody's going to give it.

26
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,869
So, for example,
when you raise money against a house,

27
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,550
it's called a down payment.

28
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,789
You have to have some stake.

29
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,710
So therefore, you start off with equity,
you then borrow money, and let's assume

30
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:50,679
a realistic world where you have both,
and you are an entity.

31
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,630
So there, bonds get paid first,
after you've constructed.

32
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,460
So after you've taken the loan and equity,

33
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:02,479
equity always comes last in
the line in terms of payment.

34
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,640
And therefore, what I like about it is,
everything else

35
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,290
is a contract in a firm and
equity gets paid the crumbs at the end.

36
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:12,799
Right?

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,520
The trouble though,

38
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,750
is sometimes, what happens is
that stockholders are the people.

39
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,450
Who either run the firm,
like if you're the owner, original owner.

40
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,429
And, private companies
are run like that still.

41
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,420
Or you hire, if you become very big,
you hire professional managers.

42
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,549
But they are working on your behalf.

43
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,430
It is their obligation legal
to pay bond holders first.

44
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:41,520
But because they run the company and no more,
there are now unfortunately many instances

45
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,360
in which there's a conflict of interest
between the bond holder payment and

46
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,450
the stockholder.

47
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:51,40
This is very interesting stuff
that I wanted, you to know.

48
00:02:51,40 --> 00:02:55,60
So when a bond gets paid,
we know how it gets paid.

49
00:02:55,60 --> 00:02:57,106
It gets paid in the form of interest.

50
00:02:57,106 --> 00:03:01,100
Or coupon, or right?

51
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,780
Or, if you repay it which you do slowly,

52
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,720
then are the second component is,
the Principal repayment.

53
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,120
We went through it multiple times, right?

54
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,40
How does a stock get paid?

55
00:03:16,40 --> 00:03:21,429
Well, after you paid off bond holders, or
think of them as all contracted

56
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,150
payments that you make for
financing your project or your firm,

57
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,320
you then pay stockholders.

58
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,120
And the stockholders are paid
something called dividends.

59
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,30
And dividends are payment per share.

60
00:03:35,30 --> 00:03:38,80
Remember stocks are per share,
we get into all of that.

61
00:03:38,80 --> 00:03:42,890
So if the company is worth one million
dollars and suppose there is half

62
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:48,149
a million dollars worth of debt, and
other half of million is stocks,

63
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,380
there won't be one stock, there'll
be a bunch of shares of the stock.

64
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,579
So it's divided up among
what's called shares and

65
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,940
each share gets a small payment.

66
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,140
And as we do examples later I'll have
a lot of decimals floating around so

67
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,720
I'll go very carefully.

68
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,800
I don't want to create a problem that's so
unrealistic.

69
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,520
That it has got big numbers per share.

70
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,960
That happens sometimes but
that's not frequent.

71
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,740
Does a firm have to pay dividend?

72
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,320
Now this is the key difference, right?

73
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,579
Between a bond and a stock.

74
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,510
So bond is a contract.

75
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,39
If you cannot pay the promised payment
every six months you had agreed to pay

76
00:04:25,40 --> 00:04:27,910
the bond holders or the bank or whatever,

77
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,130
you're in default, effectively.

78
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,765
Now, you may renegotiate and
you may make it possible for

79
00:04:33,765 --> 00:04:38,839
you to restructure the loan, so that you
don't have to pay the interest today,

80
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:42,10
but you are technically in default.

81
00:04:42,10 --> 00:04:43,659
What about dividend?

82
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,60
Well, turns out the stock never
promised to pay you anything.

83
00:04:48,60 --> 00:04:52,590
And that's what I find so,
I'm so enamored by it.

84
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,989
All my research is in stock pricing,
because there's nothing promised, however,

85
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,990
you do expect something.

86
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,330
So the dividend is paid.

87
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,600
At the end after everybody
else is paid off.

88
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,148
But it doesn't have to pay dividend,
right?

89
00:05:08,148 --> 00:05:11,460
Even then, even if you have money
you don't have to pay it out.

90
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,950
And the reason is you'll see later and
you must be guessing right now.

91
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,680
You may choose to,

92
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,770
you the firm, put some of that money
back into the firm in forms of new ideas.

93
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,940
And many, very famous firms
haven't paid dividends.

94
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,719
And the reason is they're famous
because they're very successful, and

95
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,700
we do not, as shareholders,
want them to pay us dividends.

96
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,979
Because a sad part about life is
rich people hold stocks, right?

97
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,710
This is true about the world.

98
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,840
They do not hold stocks, so

99
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,909
that they can finance the consumption,
or food and so on.

100
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:52,590
They have money, so the problem with getting dividends paid is one,

101
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,929
you have to pay taxes but second,
what do you do with it, right?

102
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,700
You have to reinvest it
in something, typically.

103
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,330
Not always, but
typically that's what you do.

104
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,880
So one reinvestment is have the firm
reinvest it for you and do very well.

105
00:06:07,50 --> 00:06:09,110
Does equity have a life?

106
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,900
Again, I'm highlighting everything
that's distinct from bonds.

107
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,330
Does equity have a life?

108
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:22,50
Bonds always have lives except, very
rarely like a consol issued in the UK.

109
00:06:22,50 --> 00:06:25,600
Which lasts forever, one pound,
one pound, one pound.

110
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,520
Another key distinction between stocks and
bonds is, stocks last forever or want to.

111
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,820
I know of no one who starts a firm and
saying, you know what? I need money but

112
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,10
I'm only going to last only for five years.

113
00:06:38,10 --> 00:06:40,300
That, nobody's gonna give you that money.

114
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:45,290
Mostly, money comes to you because
you want to last forever, and

115
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,900
so it's not a contract, and
it's kind of goes on in perpetuity.

116
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,909
So one of the things I always want you
to think about is stock really an IOU?

117
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:03,142
It's not an IOU in the technical legal
sense, it's an IOU in an expectation sense.

118
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:05,610
So you can't legally sue yourself for

119
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,130
not paying yourself because you never
promised to yourself anything, right?

120
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,750
You may have an expectation again very,
very fascinating.

121
00:07:14,60 --> 00:07:18,190
Final thought before we
take a little break,

122
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,300
is think about what is riskier,
a stock or a bond?

123
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,667
At the background I've always said
there'll always be risk and I'm gonna push

124
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:31,400
the envelope a little bit with stocks because there's
no such thing as a risk free stock.

125
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,770
I mean, you gotta create one, right?

126
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,990
[LAUGH] So, which is riskier, a
stock or a bond?

127
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,930
And if you think about it,

128
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:44,750
if every company that has a loan
has to pay the loan first,

129
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,540
before they get to pay the shareholders,
or if you're the owner as a shareholder.

130
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,650
It's gotta be the case that
a contract is less risky, right?

131
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,900
That doesn't mean it's risk less, right?

132
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,409
Remember zero coupon bonds?

133
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,930
We think they are risk less,

134
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,450
but they're too, if you sell them
before maturity, you have price risk.

135
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,590
Of course coupon paying bonds, default risk.

136
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:11,400
So there is risk, but
stocks of a company in the long run should

137
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,989
have more risk and therefore should pay a higher rate of return on average.
