00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,950

We'll talk about the more commonly issued
bonds across governments and companies.

2
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:15,610
And I'm focused on the government because it borrows the most,

3
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,680
it has the most interesting types of bonds,
and

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,259
also because the difference between a government bond and

5
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:31,599
a corporate bond is complex, but not dramatic.
In other words the structure of coupon paying

6
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,200
bonds is the same
with corporate bonds.

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,940
Okay, so what is a coupon paying bond?
Very simple, you should know that by now.

8
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:46,660
It not only pays face value, but it also pays coupon.

9
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:54,159
And so the nature of the bond
is again explicit IOU between this time government

10
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:59,719
and you.
So let's just be a little bit crisp here and

11
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:03,710
draw the timeline.
I'm going to draw the timeline and

12
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,370
what I'm going to do is I'm going to make
sure you understand what's going on.

13
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:13,590
You get face value here, but I'm going to
make it real world now.

14
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:21,000
Because coupons are paid every six months,
you will do face plus C over 2.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,170
And every six months, so this is six months long.

16
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:34,670
Every six months you paid a coupon and I'm writing it as C over 2.

17
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,950
And you'll see in a second, when we do example
why.

18
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,540
Fundamental reason, and we'll see it, is that coupons are stated annually.

19
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,480
Interest rates are stated annually.
Interest rates are determined by whom?

20
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,840
The market.
Coupon is determined by whom?

21
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,420
The issue of the bond.
So the coupon is stated annually, and as a

22
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,280
percentage of face value.
So let's get to an example and then we'll

23
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,729
do some number crunching.
So the example is the following, pay attention,

24
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,810
write it down.
Suppose a government bond has a 3% coupon

25
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,959
and a face value of $100,000.
Immediately, what should you think?

26
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,249
What is the payment being made?
What is the coupon, 3% of 100 thousand.

27
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:32,69
You do that calculation and it's $3000, right?
Then you keep going and you realize that the

28
00:02:32,69 --> 00:02:38,230
maturity is six years, right?
So you know now that six will be multiplied

29
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,459
by two because actual life of the bond.

30
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:45,769
In terms of compounding intervals, the actual life,

31
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:50,420
the real life is six years but in terms of
number of periods it's 12.

32
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:56,510
What is the price of this bond, given that
similar bonds yield a annual return of 4%.

33
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:03,679
So as soon as you see 4% remember all interest
rates are coded stated.

34
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:11,40
So you'll take the 4% and you'll divide it
by 2 to apply to a two-year bond.

35
00:03:11,40 --> 00:03:15,769
That's what we are focused on and we'll write
out the formula.

36
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:26,889
The formula will be like this.
The formula will be C over 2.

37
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:30,90
How many times c over 2.
12 times.

38
00:03:30,90 --> 00:03:36,400
How did I get 12?
6 times 2.

39
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:44,689
One and then face value
is 100 thousand.

40
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:50,719
Now the formula is pretty straightforward
but it's pretty cool.

41
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:59,870
The price will be equal to the PV
and in the function I'll just talk through it,

42
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,379
and then when we use numbers we'll do it with

43
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:07,659
Excel So
if you look at this, the price will be present

44
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:11,659
value, but
they're three components to that present value

45
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:15,200
right now.
So the first component you will figure out

46
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:22,840
is rate, yeah?
The rate has to be what?

47
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:31,638
We know that comparable bonds are paying 4%.
But you'll think 2%.

48
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,460
Okay so what do you do?
You take rate and divide it by two.

49
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,549
You can do it while doing Excel right, so
you don't have to do it outside.

50
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,780
Then you press comma.
What else do you want to put in next?

51
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,758
You want to put an n, but you know the stated
n is 6,

52
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,699
so you take n and multiply it by 2.
So where n is the stated number of years,

53
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:00,620
right?
So you make the number of periods a function

54
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,80
of twice as much.
If the compounding was every three months,

55
00:05:05,80 --> 00:05:08,229
what would n be?
N multiplied by four.

56
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:16,68
If every 12 months, remember the loan example
I did in module two.

57
00:05:16,69 --> 00:05:20,580
Is I made compounding every month because
that's how you pay it back loan.

58
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,580
So this is this.
And then what is the third thing you enter

59
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,419
in the formula?
You enter payment, but

60
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:35,139
the payment is happening as a function of,
so this is what you'll do.

61
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:43,830
You'll take 3,000,
but divide it by 2, why?

62
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:49,198
Because you're paying coupon every six months,
which is half a year.

63
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,960
You have to match with the timeline and
the formula, otherwise, you're not gonna get

64
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,688
much out of it, right?
So if now I'm left with one last thing to

65
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:08,509
enter, 800 thousand.
Please remember, if you put a positive number here,

66
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:12,680
you'll get a negative answer here.

67
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:19,490
So you may want to enter a negative number
because prices are never [LAUGH] never negative,

68
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,740
right?
So anyway, so that's something that we know

69
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,889
how to do and so on.
So let's do it in Excel and calculate it.

70
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:35,810
So let's write out the formula.
It's PV.

71
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:44,830
So you do it with me.
I'm going to do 0.04 divided by 2.

72
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:52,960
Then I'm going to take n as 6 multiplied by
2, then I'll do what?

73
00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:01,688
3,000 divided by 2.
You can actually say 0.03 multipled by 100,000

74
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:13,409
right here in Excel, divided by 2.
And then, I will enter a -100,000.

75
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:16,20
So I've covered everything.
Look that's the whole thing.

76
00:07:16,20 --> 00:07:19,770
In one form of PV I can enter the PMT and
the face value.

77
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:24,859
This challenge is, if the face value was in
the middle of the period,

78
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:31,319
which it doesn't happen for a bond.
So suppose the bond was paying 100,000 suddenly

79
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,650
in the middle.
Then you can't use this formula because when

80
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:40,169
you enter 100,000, it assumes
that the future values at the end of your

81
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:44,280
lifecycle of the bond.
Okay and this, I believe, will work out to be

82
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,99
$94,712.33.

83
00:07:49,99 --> 00:07:59,50
Okay, please do this because it's slightly
different than what we did earlier.

84
00:07:59,50 --> 00:08:07,340
But now once you have this setup in your Excel,
I'm going to ask you to try to do something

85
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:07,919
fun with it.
