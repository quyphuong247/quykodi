Hi.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:12,180
we were talking about terminology, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the concept of a rate of return

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,450
because remember, and let me draw a

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:23,970
timeline for you. So if you draw timeline

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:35,940
We will have fun together. So we will draw a timeline 0...1. Remember they are points in time, 0 and 1, but there is also a period of time, so a one period has elapsed

6
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,879
between 0 and 1. Again, the nature of
the problem will define whether this is a

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,510
year, a month, a day, right? There are people called daily traders, right? They trade on

8
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,620
every day trying to make money, so it
depends on the nature of the beast and

9
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,570
the nature of the problem, or the eye of the beholder.
So let's define what the rate of

10
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,630
return is. Unlike PV and FV which are at points
in time

11
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:04,250
rate of return is over time so I suppose
I have $100

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:19,299
at time 1 and I put it in the bank and after one period the money becomes 102.

13
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:25,340
Ok? So what has happened, I´ve put money in
the bank at 100 and then you... bank

14
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,609
says you have 102 after one year has passed. The important thing is

15
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:33,380
it can't be 102 today
because somebody's making money for

16
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,670
nothing, it's called a free lunch. If you
give 100 and get 102

17
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:43,310
right back somebody's being silly and
believe me a bank won't be silly like that, so

18
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:50,770
time has passed and you get 102 back. What is the return? A return is a very intuitive concept,

19
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:55,798
in fact when I say it in class almost
everybody nods and says of course it's that. Turns out

20
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:05,139
return is 102 which is what?
The value in the future

21
00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:14,709
minus 100, which is the value when you, what you've invested divided by the

22
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:22,90
initial amount, and it turns out to be 2 percent.

23
00:02:22,90 --> 00:02:29,19
So that's the notion of a return, I want to
emphasize it, because we are a beginners

24
00:02:29,19 --> 00:02:33,359
class, right? So I don't want to presume
anything. I hope this has helped you.

25
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:40,680
Right now we´ve kept it only to one period, and we'll stick with that simply because I want things

26
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,870
to build on themselves rather than
frustrate you with too much complexity, okay?

27
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,989
Whenever complexity comes, it will be due to
the real world not because I'm trying to

28
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:55,99
do is make it complex for you, so let me
share an insight with you and then we'll

29
00:02:55,99 --> 00:03:03,420
talk about it. The main insight is a dollar today is
worth more than a dollar tomorrow and this

30
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,000
will be seen everywhere. What's the point I'm making here is that if I were to

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,640
give you say $1 today and then I said,
wait a second actually I won't give you a

32
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:20,488
dollar today I'll give you a dollar one
year from now, which one would you prefer and

33
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:25,129
let's go through this very simple
exercise together but think about it for

34
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:27,388
a minute and we'll come and do it together.
