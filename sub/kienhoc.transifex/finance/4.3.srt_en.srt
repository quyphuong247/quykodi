00:00:04,873 --> 00:00:12,53
https://youtu.be/Avk4VIk2l40
We are going to talk about entities that
issue bonds or entities that borrow.

2
00:00:12,53 --> 00:00:17,460
And we are focused on the most important
entity, I guess, in the following sense,

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,733
that it borrows a lot, and it's in every
country and it's called a government.

4
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:29,13
And governments borrow issuing bonds and
we're gonna focus on those.

5
00:00:29,13 --> 00:00:31,917
They finance a ton of activity as I said,
and

6
00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:35,540
fiscal policy is very,
very common across the world.

7
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:42,305
They issue bonds that are very complex,
but have also been involved in market

8
00:00:42,305 --> 00:00:47,333
backed securities in America and
other countries that are pretty complex.

9
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,492
This is all just fine.

10
00:00:49,493 --> 00:00:54,797
It's just that the level of complexity
of the bonds can be so much,

11
00:00:54,797 --> 00:00:59,913
that at some point,
technical assistance in understanding how

12
00:00:59,914 --> 00:01:06,568
bonds work is critical to every company,
every institution, every government.

13
00:01:06,568 --> 00:01:10,353
So I don't want you to think that we're
going to approach all that complexity.

14
00:01:10,353 --> 00:01:15,11
But do enough for you to understand how
thing could be dramatically different in

15
00:01:15,11 --> 00:01:16,479
different situations.

16
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,50
We'll start with the simplest,
most traded bond in the world, probably.

17
00:01:23,50 --> 00:01:27,130
It's called a treasury security,
and the interesting thing about

18
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,199
a treasury security, you'll see today,
is it's a zero coupon bond.

19
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,640
What does that mean?

20
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,330
Remember, a bond pays in two ways.

21
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,630
So when the issuer of the bond,
the borrower says, I need money,

22
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,210
they specify two things.

23
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,660
What is the periodic payment, called
coupon, and what is the final payment,

24
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,442
called face value?

25
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:52,460
Zero coupon bond actually
does not pay any coupons, and

26
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,479
it's issued with up to one year maturity.

27
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,940
Remember, there's a finite life,
bonds tend to have finite lives,

28
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,700
they're contracts.

29
00:02:01,60 --> 00:02:03,120
And it's issued up to one year maturity.

30
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,952
And I'll give you a very interesting
episode of the beginning of,

31
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,160
I mean, not episode,

32
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,710
example of the beginning of something
called securitization when we get to it.

33
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,13
So what does it say?

34
00:02:14,13 --> 00:02:21,41
It typically says that, I'll pay
you $100,000 or $1,000 or whatever.

35
00:02:21,41 --> 00:02:27,820
Where I is the US government,
one year from now is the maximum maturity.

36
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,850
But actually let me just introduce
the complexity I just spoke about.

37
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,730
Because we'll use it in examples
as well as I'm thinking.

38
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,959
So we're doing this ahead of time.

39
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,530
They are either treasury bills or strips.

40
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,950
What is the distinction between
a treasury bill and a strip?

41
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:50,265
For the time being, the distinction
is, a strip is a treasury bill,

42
00:02:50,265 --> 00:02:54,684
zero coupon bond with maturity
greater than one year.

43
00:02:54,685 --> 00:02:56,178
So think like that.

44
00:02:56,178 --> 00:02:59,875
It, of course, could have maturity
less than one, we'll get to later.

45
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:04,105
But treasury bills originally were
issued with up to one year maturity.

46
00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:08,744
But you can buy government bonds
with greater than one year maturity,

47
00:03:08,745 --> 00:03:10,602
that are also zero coupon, okay?

48
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,760
This is a very, very interesting example.

49
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,60
It looks very simple and it is in pricing,
but it's the most traded type of loan.

50
00:03:22,60 --> 00:03:23,580
So what does it have?

51
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,860
It has face value, that's it.

52
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,880
So let's take an example.

53
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,49
Let's try to price the bond.

54
00:03:31,50 --> 00:03:34,810
The bond price will be very simple,
it'll be what?

55
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:40,150
It'll be equal to the Present Value of
only one thing, and that's the face value.

56
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,652
So I'm going to just,
instead of writing it all out,

57
00:03:42,652 --> 00:03:48,829
I will just show you in the slide up on
the page, and please write it out.

58
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:53,910
So what you'll see is the price of
the bond is equal to face value

59
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:59,770
times our old friend,
Present Value factor.

60
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,913
And sometimes I say PVF,
sometimes I say FPF, what is it?

61
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:09,915
It is the Present Value Factor
means how much is the Present Value

62
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:15,114
of one buck, given an interest rate
of r and number of periods away n?

63
00:04:15,115 --> 00:04:23,570
Or, in this case, it's the face value
divided by 1 + r raised to power n.

64
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,920
Remember, it's one shot.

65
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,220
It's like the first kind of example
we did in the first module,

66
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,420
seems like we met many, many moons ago.

67
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,680
In the first module,

68
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,350
the first thing we considered was one shot
payments gathered over multiple periods.

69
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,483
We did the Future Value,
we did the Present Value.

70
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:47,452
So this is the Present Value of
getting one shot payment n

71
00:04:47,452 --> 00:04:50,370
years from now, where n can be any number.

72
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,700
So let's do an example,

73
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,200
suppose there is a zero coupon bond
that pays $100,000 in exactly one year.

74
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,810
And let us assume that
the compounding interval is one year.

75
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,610
You'll understand what I'm
talking about in a second.

76
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,820
Because in the real world,
the compounding interval for

77
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,770
government bonds is about six months.

78
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,320
So let's assume, for
simplicity, it's one year.

79
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,300
What is the price or value of the bond?

80
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,190
The two are the same.

81
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,320
How much will it sell for today?

82
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,330
In other words,
if all other bonds of similar majority

83
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,950
are earning about 5% and
issued by the government, right?

84
00:05:35,30 --> 00:05:39,54
The neat thing about government
bonds is they're traded a lot and

85
00:05:39,54 --> 00:05:41,183
their information is available.

86
00:05:41,183 --> 00:05:42,844
So the discount rate is what?

87
00:05:42,845 --> 00:05:45,140
5%.
So let's try to do this.

88
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:52,190
This is so simple that I'm kind of
a little bit, it feels odd doing this.

89
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,560
So let's write it down.

90
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,890
Equals, what will the price be equal to?

91
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,39
So you do equal sign in Excel.

92
00:06:00,40 --> 00:06:04,660
And we'll introduce some other
Excel parameters or functions.

93
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,263
So it'll be what?

94
00:06:07,263 --> 00:06:10,416
The PV function, and
what will be the interest rate?

95
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:14,736
0.05.

96
00:06:14,736 --> 00:06:16,409
How much is n?

97
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,670
Remember, we are saying the compounding
interval is the same as

98
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:25,560
the maturity of this, which is one year, right?

99
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,846
And what is the PMT?

100
00:06:29,846 --> 00:06:34,766
0, look how I wrote 0, it's style.

101
00:06:34,766 --> 00:06:38,140
And finally, 100000 remember,
don't put commas.

102
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,390
And when you press Enter,

103
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:52,385
you should get a number 95,238.10.

104
00:06:52,386 --> 00:06:56,839
The nice thing about a zero
coupon bond is, under

105
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:02,280
the assumption that interest
rates are positive.

106
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,619
And by the way, in recent times even,
we have seen this not to be true.

107
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,960
But anyways, most of the time
the interest rate is positive.

108
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,919
Right now, the interest rate on such
bonds will be very low in the US, but

109
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,489
suppose it's 5% because
we want round numbers.

110
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:24,808
The price of a zero coupon
bond under the assumption that

111
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:30,816
Time Value of Money is
inherently positive is $95,238,

112
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:34,503
meaning less than $100,000.

113
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:38,872
So one thing that it's also called,
a zero coupon bond,

114
00:07:38,872 --> 00:07:42,50
is also called a discount bond, why?

115
00:07:42,50 --> 00:07:46,460
Not because it's being sold at a discount,
meaning it's not a sale.

116
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,306
But the Present Value has
to be less than face value.

117
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:52,825
But that is under the assumption
that interest rates are positive.

118
00:07:52,826 --> 00:07:58,860
So let's think about the next concept.

119
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,990
What we're going to do next is,
do a little clip on what I call

120
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:09,000
yield to maturity,
which is related to what we just did.

121
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,880
In our example right now,
if you think about it a little bit,

122
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,130
I gave you two numbers and
I asked you to calculate the third,

123
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,960
which we said, was the price of the bond.

124
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,830
Now, think about it in the real world.

125
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,229
What will happen?

126
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:29,16
Trading is happening and
somebody is saying, you know what?

127
00:08:29,16 --> 00:08:34,630
I'm going to give $100,000 one year
from now, how much will you pay me?

128
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:39,590
So it's very likely that what
you know is the price and

129
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,500
built in the price is the rate of return.

130
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,100
So we'll talk about that in a second.
