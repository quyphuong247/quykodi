We just used Excel

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,700
and we are going to use it
a lot, you more than me, because what I

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,530
want to focus on, in the videos is not so
much Excel, but the thinking behind

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:22,689
problem-solving. Excel is just a tool, but a
very useful one. So let me just go

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:29,180
back and clarify a confusion that could
occur. So when you do...we did a FV

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:37,170
problem. We went to the function and we
looked for the function FV. The first

7
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:45,610
number we put in was R, the second
number we put in, it's called Rate. The second

8
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:51,510
number we put in was N, which is number
of periods, the third number which we

9
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,10
haven't talked about and we will talk
about pretty soon

10
00:00:56,10 --> 00:01:04,218
is called PMT in the FV function,
and then, obviously if there's this is

11
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:10,260
FV we had a PV. What you'll notice is,
something little bit silly. When you

12
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:17,60
press enter, you'll get a negative number,
and many people wonder why is Excel giving me...

13
00:01:17,60 --> 00:01:22,520
giving me a negative number? So, in our
case it was negative

14
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:31,548
2593 something something, decimals.
And think about it a little bit. All

15
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:39,510
financial transactions have somebody
who's gaining money and somebody who's

16
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,350
losing money. In fact, the really
remarkable thing about financial

17
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,710
transactions is, you go borrow money from a bank, at that point

18
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,589
somebody's getting an outflow and
somebody's getting an inflow and it

19
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:59,799
balances out, it's zero sum. So the bank gives you money,
theyÂ´ll lose 100 bucks or whatever and

20
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:05,200
you get money, you gain, so the negative is
coming because we put a positive number

21
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,949
here. It depends on the eye of the
beholder. So basically if you put a

22
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:14,399
positive number in the PV you'll get a negative number in the

23
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,829
FV. And so you cannot basically count...Excel knows you can't be a money machine so you

24
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:26,269
can't have positive positive positive forever, because then
we'll all be very rich. You gotta give up

25
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:30,629
something, get something in return. So
don't get confused by that. That's why

26
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:36,149
timelines are critical, and Excel is like
what you will see later as well, if you

27
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,940
don't know, is one timeline. It makes
timeline problems very easy. However, when

28
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,40
you're pressing numbers you have a sense
of whether you're losing money or gaining

29
00:02:46,40 --> 00:02:51,659
money. So this negative, positive is in
the eye of the beholder, and is not a big

30
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:57,608
deal, but it does throw people off and I
wanted to just focus on that a little bit

31
00:02:57,609 --> 00:02:59,730
without getting too carried away with Excel.
