https://youtu.be/vP8SzUtnIjU
Welcome back to the first mega

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:11,860
problem. I just love this problem, yea! Ok!
So, stare at the

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,518
problem definition. I've changed the
previous one slightly, to

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:22,369
show you the real world twist, and the
fact how beautiful our thinking can lead us

5
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:27,340
to solve very complex, seemingly complex problems. So you plan to a attend in-state

6
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,809
college. You're borrowing $100,000, your parents on your behalf, the interest rate is 6%.

7
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:38,719
But, here's a real world twist. The
monthly payments are needed. In other

8
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:45,170
words, the bank wants you to pay money
every month. This will expose you to the real

9
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:50,579
world, to a lot of twists, to the beauty of
Finance and making your problem look as

10
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,720
simple as before, but how do you do this?
So, the first thing I would do is, I would

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:09,60
draw a timeline and 1 to 5. Right? But, actually what you want to if you are

12
00:01:09,60 --> 00:01:16,140
really cool about it is, make your life very
simple. If there are five years, how many

13
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:28,499
months are there? So, number of months, N, becomes 5 times 12, so make this one through 60.

14
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:35,658
This is probably the most important step,
which has nothing to do with Finance, but

15
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:41,609
has to do with problem-solving. So, your
period is up to you, and dictated by the

16
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:45,169
nature of the beast. So, if it's
monthly payments, periods are actually

17
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:52,159
60. This will simplify the problem very
easily. Ok? I mean simplify easily is kind of

18
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,810
redundant, but who cares? Right?

19
00:01:53,810 --> 00:02:04,659
Okay, now here's a trick. The R given
to you is called a stated rate or APR. And, it

20
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:10,470
is stated yearly. Almost all
interest rates are stated yearly. But if

21
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:16,739
the payment is monthly, then you divide
this by 12. So, the monthly interest rate

22
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:25,440
becomes not 6 percent but 0.005. Right? Because you are dividing 0.06 by 12.

23
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,430
Ok? So, what have you done? You´ve
matched these. So, it makes a lot of sense

24
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:41,810
to have the interest rate match the
period. So if this is one month, R is equal to

25
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:47,760
0.06 divided by 12. So, you've figured out

26
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:55,620
N is 60, R is 0.06 divided by 12, and I will write out how to do

27
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,770
this. And, we won't go to Excel because I'll
do it with you. So, let's figure out what

28
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,980
the monthly payment is.

29
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:13,940
Let's do it! So, I'm going to stick here and say this: 0 PMT. Do this, do 5 multiplied

30
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:23,210
by 12, comma. So, you've covered. I mean sorry. Let's just...I made a boo-boo, so let's keep

31
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:34,000
the boo-boo because boo-boo is important. 0.06 divided by twelve is the interest rate. The

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,980
second number is what? N. But, the N is
5 times 12. You've got to be consistent right?

33
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,859
Because if the interest rate is per
month,

34
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,680
the number of months should be in the
next, thing. And now, what do you wanna

35
00:03:48,680 --> 00:04:00,820
press? PV. Question: When we were paying annual, you are paying about $23,739,

36
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:06,310
what will you have answer here? I think
if you press enter, your PMT will be much

37
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,50
less because you're paying monthly and it will work out to be, if I

38
00:04:10,50 --> 00:04:19,269
have the number right, 1933.28. So, what is 1933.28?

39
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:25,150
1933.28 is the monthly payment you'll have to pay in order to pay off the loan

40
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:32,429
fully, in five years, which is also equal
to 60 months. So, you see, I made a little

41
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:37,289
boo-boo up there. You've gotta be careful
how you enter it in Excel, but you know.

42
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:43,89
Ok? So, fundamentally what has changed
here is the timeline has changed, and

43
00:04:43,89 --> 00:04:47,819
therefore, I would encourage you to kind
of think about changing the timeline

44
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:58,619
first and the most important piece is to
make N sixty and to make R, 0.06 divided by 12

45
00:04:58,619 --> 00:05:03,89
And, you can do that in Excel, you don't have to do this beforehand. Excel will

46
00:05:03,89 --> 00:05:08,80
understand what you're doing. Okay? Now, let's do one thing. Let's try to do the amoritzation

47
00:05:08,80 --> 00:05:16,279
table. I will leave it up
to you to do. But I'll start off. Ok? So, I'm

48
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:28,39
going to write big balance, and then, PMT
payment, interest and repayment. I'm going

49
00:05:28,39 --> 00:05:35,99
to write quickly. But, if you want to have
fun and want to learn this, do this yourself, first

50
00:05:35,99 --> 00:05:41,459
of all will this be five years, 5 rows, or will it be 60 rows? 60 rows, right? So, let's start up. The beginning

51
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:47,860
balance in month one turns out to be
100,000, how much are you paying?

52
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:57,899
1933.28. And, I'm going to write a
little faster. Right? So, interest rate

53
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:07,649
is how much now? Interest rate is much lower than 6. So you have 0.06 divided by 12. Right? So, how

54
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:11,639
much will you owe as an interest
component of it? If you see this, this is

55
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:19,89
about half a percent, right? So this'll become 500, and how much is

56
00:06:19,89 --> 00:06:20,409
left?

57
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:31,789
1433.28. Look. Now, I go to period 2
which is month, again. How much do I still owe?

58
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:43,949
I owe 98,566.72. How did I
get this number? Very simple. I'm writing

59
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:46,50
it quickly, but the idea is very simple.

60
00:06:46,50 --> 00:06:47,910
Take this and

61
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:56,500
subtract it from this guy. Right? How much is the payment I'm paying still? 1993.28. What will

62
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:07,460
happen to the interest? It'll drop to 492.83 and
how much are you left to pay, more or less?

63
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:21,150
More. 1440.45. I've written two rows. Please make
sure you can do the rest.

64
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,599
And I'm not hurrying for hurrying sake. I'm
just doing it simply because you need to

65
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:31,370
understand that the mechanics and the
thinking are both the same. Let's go to a

66
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:36,440
couple of interesting questions, and we'll
be then done with the real mega application one.

67
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,830
And, the first question is the following:
How much will you owe the bank after the

68
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:52,130
18th month's payment? Right? So, instead of doing the amortization table along,

69
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:56,750
if you can answer this question you've arrived because, you basically can fill in the amortization table by then.

70
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:04,490
So, think about this, what am I
asking you? I'm saying, now you have a 60 N,

71
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:09,500
and I'm asking you´ve made the 18th payment,

72
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:15,910
how much do you think you owe the bank? So, many people will start here, and I tease

73
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:20,240
people who´ve done a lot of accounting and they work their way forward, the

74
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,300
amortization table. It'll take a lifetime, and then, you die. You know, it's not too much

75
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,680
fun. Here´s what Finance is. Finance is the value of anything after you made the 18

76
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:39,299
payments is what remains. So this is what you´ll do. You'll do PV equals, what is the

77
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:47,649
first number you press in PV? Remember, I did a little boo-boo earlier. So, you do 0.06, but you won't stop

78
00:08:47,649 --> 00:09:00,430
there. You'll divide by 12. Right? Now, how much N is left? It is 60, not quite. You´ve

79
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:07,719
paid 18, so how much are left? 42. But if you write it this way, it is pretty

80
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:17,790
obvious. Now! Right? So, you have 0.06, PV, how many payments? 42, and what was the

81
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,329
payment? We know the payment already, because we already know what the bank is

82
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:30,240
charging us every month. What is the answer of this? The beauty is, the answer is, and I will

83
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:46,970
just figure it out and write it for you. The answer is $73,074.70. This should be the answer. The interesting thing

84
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:55,120
is, even though you´ve made 18 payments, you still owe a lot, you still, you paid back only about $27,000

85
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,930
of the principal, and the reason is, in
the initial periods, what are you mostly

86
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:06,140
paying? Given that you have 60 periods, you're mostly paying interest, but as you pay off more

87
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:13,449
and more of your loan, what ends up
happening is, you gradually pay off your whole loan,

88
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:18,470
over time. So, let's go a little bit
further and ask the following question:

89
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:25,300
What is the interest component of the 37th month's payment? As, I said you can pause

90
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,540
do it yourself, do it in Excel, or do it
with me, it's your choice. I would

91
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,360
encourage you very strongly

92
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,290
of every time you want to get intrigued by a problem to take a break and do it

93
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:44,980
yourself. So, this is two steps. Step one is, when you know that you have to figure

94
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:51,519
out some PV, because the interest
component is very easily calculated if

95
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:58,540
you know the beginning of period balance.
So, PV at what time, after paying 36

96
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,189
because 37th is the next one.

97
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:12,630
So, this is what you do, 0.06 divided by 12. This is the amount you owe after 36 payments. So,

98
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:20,930
how much N left? 60 minus 36 which is 24, and you know your payment is

99
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:33,189
how much? 1933.28. This amount, if you press Enter,

100
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:41,300
is the amount you after you've paid how many? 36, and it works out to be 43,620.34

101
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:52,130
This is the beginning balance of
the 37th month. Now, I'm asking

102
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,750
you what is the interest component of
the next payment? How much is the next

103
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:05,130
payment? How much is the 37th PMT? We know,
it is 1933.28 because the amount

104
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:09,779
I'm paying every year...every month is
fixed. How do I figure out the interest

105
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:22,110
component of this? The interest component of the
payment is 43,620.34 multiplied by

106
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:37,510
0.06 divided by 12. And this answer works out to be $218.10. So, what do you notice? That the

107
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:40,490
interest component of this has

108
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:45,500
dropped quite a bit. Right? Because what has happened is, your beginning balance

109
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:52,60
is going down, now you've paid off 36 payments. One more step and I

110
00:12:52,60 --> 00:12:57,180
promise I'll take a break, but as you said, you can always take a break. And, the

111
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,890
reason I want to do that is we've been on
this problem for a long, long time, and the

112
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:16,890
thing that I want to raise here is the
concept of Effective Annual Interest. What

113
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:21,500
does that mean? That means, what is the actual interest rate with compounding

114
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:32,330
that you are actually paying annually.
Remember the stated rate is 6%.

115
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:38,890
Turns out, if your compounding interval is one year, the six percent is also effective. But, if your

116
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:44,29
compounding interval is one month, the
actual interest you're paying over the

117
00:13:44,29 --> 00:13:52,890
year is more or less than 6%. Remember
compounding. It's more than 6 percent.

118
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:58,29
Right? So, let's write out the formula, and let's do it in our example. The

119
00:13:58,29 --> 00:14:08,40
Effective Annual Rate turns out to be, and you'll see this in a second, 1 + 0.06

120
00:14:08,40 --> 00:14:15,449
but that's annual. The monthly rate is 12, so I'm writing out what would one

121
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:22,89
buck become after 12 months. It would
become buck 6 cents, if there was no

122
00:14:22,89 --> 00:14:28,279
compounding within the year, but this semi, I mean monthly compounding. I'll raise

123
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:33,890
it to power 12. So, what is this this?
This is the Future Value of one buck with monthly

124
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:42,50
interest rates and compounding. But, I'll subtract out the I, sorry not the I, the 1 to get you

125
00:14:42,50 --> 00:14:46,899
to the place where you want to be, which
is: What is the interest rate that's

126
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:51,450
effective? And, the formula, generic
formula,

127
00:14:51,450 --> 00:15:02,170
is, one plus R divided by K raised to power K minus one, where what is K? K is the

128
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:11,199
compounding interval. This is very easy to figure out, right? What the compounding interval is?

129
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,690
Because, it'll be stated or in the
case when you're taking a loan, it'll be

130
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:23,350
determined by how often are you paying
the PMT, if it's annual, K is one, if its

131
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:27,910
monthly K is 12, if it's semi-annual, K is 2.
