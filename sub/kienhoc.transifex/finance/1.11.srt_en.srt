Welcome back, now let me show you
power of discounting

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,59
which is kind of power of compounding in
reverse, right? So let´s

3
00:00:16,59 --> 00:00:22,169
stare at what I'm asking you to do.
Remember? I asked you to figure out

4
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:29,29
changing N, N is very important, but
the combination of N and interest rate is

5
00:00:29,29 --> 00:00:30,560
what it's all about.

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,900
So the lower the N and the lower the
interest rate, less you´ll see the power of

7
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,720
compounding and discounting, right? So
let's do power of discounting. What are

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,239
the Present Values of receiving a
billion dollars, remember billion dollars,

9
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,800
it´s a lot of money,

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,89
nine zeros, I always forget how many
zeros in a million, billion, but you can always

11
00:00:52,89 --> 00:00:58,920
google. So at 5 percent versus 15, remember
where I'm pulling these 5 and 15, I'm

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:06,180
pulling them from historical data
admittedly peculiar to the US, but I'm

13
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,270
choosing 50 years from today instead
of 90, just to see what happens. So

14
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:22,579
formulaically, it's very tough and I'm
going to talk and write as I talk, Okay? So what

15
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:27,8
is the first one, let's write down the
formula, so you take the first at 5 percent

16
00:01:27,9 --> 00:01:37,960
will be, you´ll be taking a billion dollars
and

17
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:48,149
dividing by 1.05 raised to power, how much? 50.
This is the calculation you're doing

18
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:53,220
and the second one is figure out the
Present Value at which interest rate? At

19
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:59,600
15 percent, so you´ll just replace this
0.05 or 1.05, this whole

20
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:08,609
thing by 1.15, of course raised to power what? 50.
So these are the two different

21
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,800
calculations I'm asking you to do. Now if you stare at this and if you can do it in

22
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,360
your head, as I said earlier, there's
something really bizarre about you, but

23
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,60
we'll assume that you're not going to
do it in your head and so we´re going to use Excel, so what

24
00:02:22,60 --> 00:02:29,370
I'm going to do is, show you what Excel
will do a little bit, so that you can figure

25
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:35,930
out. So going to Excel, we still
have our old buddy over there and we´re going to

26
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:43,160
delete it, we're going to now write the
numbers. So let's write equals, but now after

27
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:51,820
pressing equals, what will you enter?
You´ll enter not FV, but PV and then open

28
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:57,140
parenthesis. When you open the parenthesis, you´ll
clearly identify what all you're looking

29
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:05,268
at, right? So the first number is rate, so
let's put 0.05 and let's

30
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:09,150
put number of periods, how much...how much
did we have in our problem? I think we

31
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:18,850
had 50 years. Did we have any payments
in between? Answer is no, so you gotta put 0, you know, when I

32
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,420
do this many times, I am just doing it
quickly and I forget that PMT isn´t

33
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,958
there, just be careful, because you're
taking advantage of Excel, but Excel has

34
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,950
rules to follow too, right? So how much are you
getting paid? Now here, enter a bunch of zeros,

35
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:44,649
1 000 000 000 and then press ENTER, you
should get and I'm just looking over to

36
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,210
make sure, we have the right numbers. You
should get,

37
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:56,140
let me just make sure I'm getting all
this. You should get I think, at 5

38
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:02,760
percent, 50 years one billion dollars,
you should get 87 million, two hundred

39
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:11,730
and three, seven twenty six, or almost seven twenty seven, 87,203,727

40
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:19,820
dollars. That's gone down,
but not drastically. Now what I'm going

41
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:25,610
to do? I'm going to keep this Excel spreadsheet open and going to press 0.15

42
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:31,80
and what do you think is going to happen?

43
00:04:31,80 --> 00:04:38,219
You´re left with how much? Only nine hundred and
twenty-two thousand dollars, eight hundred.

44
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:50,260
922,800 dollars, eight hundred and one, so the number should be
922800.84. What I´m going to do is, I´m going to

45
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,000
let you take a break, do this on your own  and when
we come back, I´ll

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,500
pick up where we left, give you the two
numbers and move on to more, more

47
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,830
exciting stuff. See you soon. Bye.
