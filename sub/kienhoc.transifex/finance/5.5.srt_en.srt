00:00:04,952 --> 00:00:09,400

So hopefully you took my challenge, and
let me just start, now, having fun.

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:18,584
Okay, so I'm going to write
that the price of a stock,

3
00:00:18,584 --> 00:00:23,736
and we have red today, P1 has to be

4
00:00:23,736 --> 00:00:28,950
equal to D1 + P1 / (1 + r).

5
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,790
You see how simple this is.

6
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:38,360
The key here though is that we have
very little idea of what P1 is.

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,570
Why?
Because we know P naught but

8
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,590
P1 will happen only tomorrow.

9
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,880
And everybody thinks they can predict it,
and everybody's kinda wrong.

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:54,270
For simplicity, or for once, I'm going to
put expectation in c and bulk expectation.

11
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,910
So the fact that we don't know it,
we usually have an expectation sign.

12
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,629
And I'm not going to
write all of that out.

13
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,390
Okay, so this is the formula.

14
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,500
However, let's think
a little bit more about it.

15
00:01:08,40 --> 00:01:13,310
This is relatively, perhaps easy to
say what it's likely to be, right?

16
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,450
Because you know the pattern of the past,
and there are patterns sometimes.

17
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,490
If a stock hasn't paid dividend ever,

18
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,850
chances of it paying dividend next month,
low, and so on.

19
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,820
However, this animal here,
expected P1, is very tough.

20
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:35,619
So let's think about if P1 were a person,
what does he or she think?

21
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,950
What is she thinking I am?

22
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,790
It's like Shakespeare, to be or not to be.

23
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,20
So P1 is thinking, who am I?

24
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,180
It's got to be the case, and
let's start working on this,

25
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,600
it's got to be the case that P1 go
1 period of time, has to be what?

26
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,820
D2, I'm dropping the expectation sign,

27
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,804
plus P2 divided by (1 + r).

28
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:09,235
The assumption of course I made, which
we make very often because we don't know

29
00:02:09,235 --> 00:02:11,655
the future, is that 1 + r is not changing.

30
00:02:11,655 --> 00:02:13,825
If it were changing,
you would know about it first, and

31
00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:16,674
therefore stock markets would adjust,
and so on and so forth.

32
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,381
So now substitute.

33
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:20,821
What do you get?

34
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:23,234
You get D1 by itself.

35
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,770
Plus, and write this with me, and

36
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:31,430
what would be even better is just
pause and do it on your own.

37
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,982
So let's substitute for P1.

38
00:02:33,982 --> 00:02:41,482
It will be D2 + P2 over (1 + r).

39
00:02:41,482 --> 00:02:45,920
And this whole thing will
be divided by (1+ r).

40
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,60
I'm going to keep going, and

41
00:02:50,60 --> 00:02:53,50
we'll take a break only after
we've done the whole formula.

42
00:02:53,50 --> 00:02:57,180
So even if this is a little bit
tedious and slow let's do it.

43
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,720
So let's rewrite this.

44
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,280
It will be D1 over (1

45
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,80
+ r) + D2 over what?

46
00:03:08,80 --> 00:03:13,210
(1 + r) by (1 + r), so (1 + r)

47
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:19,277
squared + P2 over (1 + r) square as well.

48
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,610
So this is going to make a lot of sense,
and that's why I'm in love with finance,

49
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,140
is that it basically makes sense, right?

50
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,315
Because if you're holding it for

51
00:03:29,315 --> 00:03:33,70
2 period, the first dividend
is discounted at 1 plus r.

52
00:03:33,70 --> 00:03:37,150
The second dividend at 1 plus r squared,
and imagine you're selling the stock.

53
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,600
It'll be 1 plus r squared divided by 2,

54
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,480
exactly what time value
of money tells you.

55
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,429
Okay, so let keep going.

56
00:03:44,429 --> 00:03:46,935
Can you substitute for P2?

57
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:50,391
And I'm going to say yes you can,
and I will do that one time, and

58
00:03:50,391 --> 00:03:53,30
then we'll kinda try to
see what the formula is.

59
00:03:53,31 --> 00:03:57,887
So substitute for P2, so

60
00:03:57,887 --> 00:04:03,626
it will become D1 over (1 +r

61
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:09,142
) + D2 over 1 + r squared +

62
00:04:09,142 --> 00:04:14,218
D3 over (1 + r) cubed +

63
00:04:14,218 --> 00:04:19,327
P3 over (1 + r) cubed.

64
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,438
And that is because I'm
repeatedly now substituting.

65
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:25,340
So, first I substituted for
P1, then P2 and so on.

66
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,159
Let's keep going.

67
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,230
Nothing to stop.

68
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,340
Why?
Because I said initially,

69
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,950
a stock doesn't have a life.

70
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,20
In fact, it doesn't promise you anything.

71
00:04:35,20 --> 00:04:39,159
You buy it for love, and
you expect something of course, right?

72
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,190
And also, I call it love and fresh air,
it's the most fascinating thing ever.

73
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:47,530
It reflects our belief in the future,
right?

74
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,599
I mean, right?

75
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,712
It's cool.

76
00:04:49,712 --> 00:04:54,147
So, let's keep writing, and I'm going
to do it a little bit faster now.

77
00:04:54,147 --> 00:04:59,772
(1 + r) + D2, (1+r) squared + D3,

78
00:04:59,772 --> 00:05:04,819
(1 + r) cubed + I'm going to write dot

79
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:09,448
dot dot, which means on and on and on.

80
00:05:09,448 --> 00:05:11,3
Similar terms.

81
00:05:11,3 --> 00:05:18,15
Plus DN, (1 + r) raised to power n.

82
00:05:18,16 --> 00:05:22,338
N stands for
some number far into the future,

83
00:05:22,338 --> 00:05:26,216
but could be ten, could be for, right.

84
00:05:26,216 --> 00:05:32,485
+ Pn over (1 + r) n.

85
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:38,615
Now, to make life simple,
let me ask you this.

86
00:05:38,615 --> 00:05:43,400
As n goes to a very large number,

87
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,553
infinity, what happens to this?

88
00:05:48,553 --> 00:05:53,450
If you take a price,
even if it is hugely high.

89
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,877
Remember when I said
the power of compounding and

90
00:05:56,877 --> 00:06:00,61
the reverse of that is
power of discounting?

91
00:06:00,61 --> 00:06:05,185
So if a stock wants to live forever,
the price way into the future,

92
00:06:05,185 --> 00:06:08,768
it's present value is
going to be close to 0.

93
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:13,457
Of course, some of these very
last dividends also will be, but

94
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:17,640
making the 0 makes you
get rid of that P part.

95
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,510
And this is one of the most
famous formulas of finance.

96
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,61
It says the following.

97
00:06:23,61 --> 00:06:31,157
I going from 1 to n Di OVer
(1 + r) raised to power.

98
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:33,966
I.

99
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:35,180
So what is this?

100
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,875
This is called dividend discount model.

101
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,661
This is the present value of dividends.

102
00:06:44,5 --> 00:06:48,70
What I'm going to do is I'm going
to pause here and come back and

103
00:06:48,71 --> 00:06:52,335
do some good examples, but
I want you to just think through this.

104
00:06:52,335 --> 00:06:55,15
Let's think through this together and
you can come back.

105
00:06:55,16 --> 00:07:01,285
If I substitute i through n,
it means the first i has to be?

106
00:07:01,285 --> 00:07:06,341
Mr.Gothom, explained, i = 1,
when you substitute 1

107
00:07:06,341 --> 00:07:13,373
you have D1 over 1 + r raised to power 1
which is substitute two, you get this.

108
00:07:13,373 --> 00:07:15,347
Substitute three, you get this.

109
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:22,436
So this thingy over here, is a short form
of writing something that's very long,

110
00:07:22,436 --> 00:07:26,852
and turns out it's a geometric
kind of series, and

111
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:33,610
it's very cool to show what it look
like in the certain circumstances.

112
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,30
And it's a very, very powerful thing.

113
00:07:36,30 --> 00:07:38,250
Remember we talked about and

114
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,170
I say like differently than most people,
and so be it.

115
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,340
When we come back, we'll do some examples.

116
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,760
We'll do some formulas and
examples with them.

117
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,500
Initially, simply.

118
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,200
But I want to do a mega
problem at the end to show you

119
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,780
the beauty of what value
creation can look like.

120
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,890
It'll have to be set up properly, but
I'll do it in ways that hopefully you can

121
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:07,719
relate to, and you can see how
fascinating it is to study stocks.
