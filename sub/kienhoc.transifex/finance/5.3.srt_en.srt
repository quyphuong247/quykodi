00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:05,737

I love data.

2
00:00:05,737 --> 00:00:09,460
As I said, most of my research
has been in stock markets.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:14,440
So I will show some data and
it is from the US from the period 1926,

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,460
I think I've mentioned before, yes I did
a problem with you remember? How much

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,200
does 1000 bucks invested in 1926,
worth today?

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,988
In 1926, of course is a very famous time.

7
00:00:27,988 --> 00:00:30,243
It's during the depression and all that.

8
00:00:30,243 --> 00:00:36,120
But it's important for US data because
very good data became available,

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,40
starting in 1926.

10
00:00:38,40 --> 00:00:42,525
So this data is 1926 to 2008,
and I'm going to keep it up for

11
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:44,760
you to kind of look at.

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,50
What I'm going to do in module five
also is come back to stuff like this.

13
00:00:49,50 --> 00:00:51,669
Because module six, sorry, next one.

14
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,210
I'll come back to this data stuff and
talk about

15
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,720
how personal investment decisions
are actually pretty straightforward.

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,000
What I also plan to do is as I said,

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,210
give you some notes, and
things like this I will provide.

18
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,119
But most of the thinking and writing you
should do, you should make your own notes,

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,570
as I've said so often.

20
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,449
Of course,
practice all the assignments too.

21
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,740
So if you look at this data, you have
portfolios available of small stocks,

22
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,195
that means companies that
are relatively small.

23
00:01:22,195 --> 00:01:26,470
S&P 500, which is a portfolio in itself.

24
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:32,539
It is Standard & Poor's 500 plus stocks,
a little bit, probably more now.

25
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,000
Corporate Bonds, which are bonds issued
by corporations, we have studied them.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,940
Government bonds, we have studied them.

27
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,149
And the most simple government bond,
treasury bills.

28
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:49,858
So these are average annual rates
of return since for 1926 to 2008.

29
00:01:49,858 --> 00:01:51,504
What do you notice?

30
00:01:51,504 --> 00:01:56,270
You notice that the second column
is the average rate of return.

31
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,130
So the first clarification.

32
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,110
Then, the next column is called
average risk premium, and

33
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,710
as I'm talking, I'll keep this slide up,

34
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,750
go back and forth.

35
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,850
It'll also be available to you otherwise.

36
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,540
So I'm going to go slow.

37
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,709
What is the next column.

38
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,800
It's called Average Risk Premium.

39
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,550
Now, this is a pretty commonly
used word in finance.

40
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,290
And what does it mean?
Remember we are risk-averse.

41
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:28,989
And therefore whenever we want something
risky, the market has to pay us more, and

42
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,830
that's one of the themes of this slide, is
that it's pretty remarkable how the data

43
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,830
matches or confirms that we
actually are risk-averse.

44
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,255
So what is 17%?

45
00:02:39,255 --> 00:02:46,000
So for small stocks, the average return
is 21%, the average risk premium is 17%.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,400
All it's saying is, how much
more are you getting for

47
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,751
the small stocks because they
are riskier than treasury bills and

48
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:57,250
treasury bills we treat as
kind of a risk free asset?

49
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,880
And the difference is 21% minus 4%.

50
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,970
Remember, this is not a particular
year's rate of return,

51
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,800
this is the average over many years.

52
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,180
Another strong caution.

53
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,420
This is probably the best stock
market data you'll ever see.

54
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,760
By that, I mean is, this is another
big issue in finance that's

55
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,959
got Nobel Prizes will get more probably
is called equity risk premium.

56
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,830
The difference between say S&P 500 and
say the treasury bill,

57
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,780
which as you notice is 12% minus 4 is 8%.

58
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,980
So people have been struggling to
explain why that number is so high.

59
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,390
And the reason they're struggling is
because if you look at other stock

60
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,172
markets which have existed in the past,
even the U.S.

61
00:03:45,172 --> 00:03:49,200
before then, the average
premium has not been that high.

62
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,980
Anyway, it's a very cool
thing to think about.

63
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:59,118
And moving forward, most people when
you talk to them, experts believe that,

64
00:03:59,118 --> 00:04:04,563
that risk premium of 6 to 8%, or whatever,
6 to 7% that was there historically

65
00:04:04,563 --> 00:04:09,805
cannot be possible in the future, again,
based on studying more and more data.

66
00:04:09,806 --> 00:04:13,374
Government Bonds have
a risk premium of 2%,

67
00:04:13,374 --> 00:04:17,469
Corporate Bonds have a risk premium of 3%.

68
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,610
Final column is standard deviation.

69
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:23,20
You see how much time I am spending on
this, it's because it's so fascinating and

70
00:04:23,20 --> 00:04:24,390
so relevant to everybody.

71
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,850
So if you look at small stocks, it also
has the highest standard deviation.

72
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,360
I know we haven't done statistics,
but you should know enough,

73
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,410
and be able to figure it out on your own

74
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,340
that average return is simply,
on average, what you get.

75
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,549
Standard deviation is
how much variability.

76
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,200
It's the measure of
variability around the mean, right?

77
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,20
So standard deviation is
kind of a measure of a risk.

78
00:04:51,20 --> 00:04:53,859
And if you notice all of these
are kind of portfolios and

79
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,480
the reason is we'll see later,
because we are is risk averse,

80
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,260
almost everybody holds portfolios.

81
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:04,830
There's...I'll actually show you some data on
stocks in the final module and

82
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,510
it will be really fascinating.

83
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,534
So small stocks have a
standard deviation of 42%,

84
00:05:12,534 --> 00:05:16,694
then S&P 21%, this is on the yearly data,

85
00:05:16,694 --> 00:05:21,90
corporate bonds 7%, government bonds 9%.

86
00:05:21,90 --> 00:05:25,30
So there is pretty much
a pattern that emerges.

87
00:05:25,30 --> 00:05:26,940
Of course, this is statistics and so on.

88
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,120
And the pattern that
emerges is the following.

89
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,450
High risk, high return.

90
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,575
And, this kind of confirms.

91
00:05:35,575 --> 00:05:39,219
Of course,
you can do this hypothesis that high risk,

92
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,706
high return, does it work or
not, has been tested so

93
00:05:42,706 --> 00:05:47,970
often, it may be the most tested
hypothesis with more structure on it.

94
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,740
We are just giving you some casual data.

95
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,760
So what it shows is the following.

96
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:59,630
High risk, high return, it seems to be
confirmed by real data from the US.

97
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:05,140
Now, one last caution, the US
levels relative to the treasury bill

98
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:10,460
may be too high, but
this pattern probably is held forever,

99
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,669
on for reasonably long data points.

100
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,900
That doesn't mean in a particular year,
returns on a government

101
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,830
bond can't be different, or
higher than a small stock, or whatever.

102
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,90
This is what you expect on average.
