Welcome, I'm wearing my glasses because
I'm going to take you to a website.

2
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:15,689
So what I've done already is
I'm at finance.yahoo.com.

3
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:21,365
If you stare the box above,
it says finance.yahoo.com.

4
00:00:21,365 --> 00:00:22,808
You can go to any site.

5
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:28,45
I go here because it's very easy to go to,
and the data is readily available,

6
00:00:28,45 --> 00:00:31,187
and you'll see that
it's showing some data,

7
00:00:31,187 --> 00:00:35,30
the stock market data and
all right up front.

8
00:00:35,30 --> 00:00:39,680
Today, we are talking about bonds,
and I don't wanna get caught up

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,980
in these stories, actually, I was just
reading them, and it's fascinating.

10
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,920
What I'm going to do is, if you're
on the left panel, if you notice,

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,431
you'll see Market Data,

12
00:00:52,431 --> 00:00:57,320
and when you go to Market Data,
you'll see Bonds.

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,860
It'll take me to a page which
you should be able to see.

14
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,546
Do it with me.

15
00:01:02,546 --> 00:01:07,268
So if you have your laptop open,
say, finance.yahoo.com.

16
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:12,555
You go up, and when you'll see
something called the Bond Center.

17
00:01:12,555 --> 00:01:16,937
Now this is, sorry for
my joke, but it's as in James.

18
00:01:16,937 --> 00:01:18,655
[LAUGH] I had to say that.

19
00:01:18,656 --> 00:01:20,432
It's so silly, but I had to.

20
00:01:20,432 --> 00:01:25,390
If you notice, the first column is
maturity, so 3 month, 6 month, 2 year,

21
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,63
3 year, 5 year, 10 year, 30 year.

22
00:01:28,63 --> 00:01:29,900
What do you see?

23
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,121
You see the pattern that I had
mentioned to you before, and

24
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:35,568
we did numbers with, which is pretty cool.

25
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:40,335
So the yield to maturity is 0.19, 0.39,

26
00:01:40,335 --> 00:01:46,14
0.92, 1.21, 1.61, 2.25, 2.99.

27
00:01:46,14 --> 00:01:49,365
I'm sure you can find
this fascinating data for

28
00:01:49,365 --> 00:01:53,320
your own country wherever you are and
just play with it.

29
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,779
It may or may not go up to 30 years,
but pretty it's fascinating.

30
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,436
So what we spoke about is right there,

31
00:02:00,436 --> 00:02:03,681
I hope you can go from
the yields to the prices.

32
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:07,536
Remember though,
that the yields are quoted annually, so

33
00:02:07,536 --> 00:02:10,79
remember the rate we divided by 2, and

34
00:02:10,79 --> 00:02:15,970
everything including zero coupon bonds are
valued on a six month basis compounded.

35
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,865
We sometimes assume the year for
simplicity.

36
00:02:18,865 --> 00:02:23,389
So that's one thing, the second thing
I would like to show you is I'm

37
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:26,901
going to press the link here,
Composite Bond Rates.

38
00:02:26,901 --> 00:02:31,847
The composite bond rates are interesting
because although we focused

39
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:36,453
a lot on US Treasuries, and
that's the first panel you'll see,

40
00:02:36,453 --> 00:02:38,994
you'll also see municipal bonds.

41
00:02:38,994 --> 00:02:44,43
And this site is for America and
the municipal bonds, you'll see yields

42
00:02:44,43 --> 00:02:49,700
also increasing with maturity, but there's
a little bit of a curve ball there.

43
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:54,744
Because municipal bonds tend to have
more risk, these are state bonds,

44
00:02:54,745 --> 00:02:56,560
than federal government,

45
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,122
which assume to have the basic risk free
structure, you'll see the rating show up.

46
00:03:02,122 --> 00:03:06,860
So AA, AAA and typically,
what you'll find is that the lower

47
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:11,970
the rating of the bond,
the higher the yield of maturity.

48
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,285
Now that doesn't have to
be every single time.

49
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:18,864
Remember this is at one point in time,
at one instant in time,

50
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:22,667
and what we expect to happen
is on average, right.

51
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:30,408
So many times people will say, the stock
price fell, and the bond price went up.

52
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:33,119
Isn't that the opposite
of what you would expect?

53
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:34,333
No.
On average,

54
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,710
riskier things are expected to pay more.

55
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,836
Not always, not every time, okay.

56
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:44,302
If you go down and
I'm going to go to the lowest panel,

57
00:03:44,302 --> 00:03:48,572
what you also see are corporate bonds,
and again,

58
00:03:48,572 --> 00:03:53,755
you see a whole yield curve going
from 2 year AA to 20 year A.

59
00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:58,257
So clearly, AAA is the highest quality.

60
00:03:58,258 --> 00:04:00,303
AA is the next and so on, so forth.

61
00:04:00,303 --> 00:04:04,434
Again, I think you notice two patterns,
again, not perfectly.

62
00:04:04,434 --> 00:04:10,718
The two patterns are the following, as
time goes up, yield to maturity goes up.

63
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:15,989
This is not always the case,

64
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,445
but tends to be the case
because we are risk adverse.

65
00:04:19,445 --> 00:04:24,180
Long-term bonds, prices fluctuate
a lot more given everything else.

66
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,105
Therefore, we are not
willing to pay as much for

67
00:04:28,105 --> 00:04:32,820
them as the otherwise
similar short-term bonds.

68
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,950
But there is also AAA, AA going on and
the way they are listed is,

69
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:43,229
that the rates of return on a high
quality bond should tend to be

70
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,590
lower than the rates of return
on a lower quality bond.

71
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,34
So just mess around, look around.

72
00:04:50,35 --> 00:04:55,256
The reason I wanted to spend
about a few minutes on this

73
00:04:55,256 --> 00:05:00,953
is to show you why I love finance
is that it is not just talk.

74
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:04,434
Many things in life,
we talk about things, but

75
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:08,436
to find a real world match of
what we are talking about,

76
00:05:08,436 --> 00:05:12,620
to have almost a perfect match
is just fascinating to me.

77
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,539
And that's one of the reasons why I am so

78
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:20,149
excited about teaching the fundamentals or
advanced stuff.

79
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:23,990
All of that can be done with
images of real world applications.
