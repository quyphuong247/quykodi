00:00:04,881 --> 00:00:12,730
https://youtu.be/CnABWqgNUnE
Welcome. This is the last module of
this course, Finance For Everyone.

2
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,240
And what I wanted to do is what
I've done before in my MOOCs and so

3
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,919
on, is that I give you a lot of
content for a six week course.

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,720
I give you a lot of homework for
a six week course. And

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,29
So what I tend to do is, I try to
make five weeks of it very heavy,

6
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,540
and the sixth week is
a reflection on issues.

7
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,748
And here it will be more substantive,
because we are trying to just wrap up

8
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:44,390
things and
connect a few things here and there.

9
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:49,210
But also, the other aspect is, that for
each week I've an assignment, and for

10
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,620
the final week, we have a final.

11
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,110
So I've set it up so that it makes sense.

12
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,710
That's the way it's done usually.

13
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:02,100
You, of course, are in control of when and
what you do, right?

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,560
So, think of the final module as wrap up,
takeaways, and what's next.

15
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:15,500
So, let's talk a little bit
about what about finance I like.

16
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,80
What are the lessons.

17
00:01:17,80 --> 00:01:21,140
So, the first lesson of finance
that you hopefully have taken

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,780
is, and I hopefully have convinced you,

19
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,380
that's my responsibility,
is that it's a way of thinking.

20
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,119
It's not memorization,

21
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:38,190
it's not about no real world applications.

22
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:42,577
It's just a powerful way of thinking
to help you in the real world. Right?

23
00:01:42,577 --> 00:01:47,687
So I want you to recognize that and
then to reflect on that.

24
00:01:47,687 --> 00:01:51,991
Another way to think about finance,
which has been useful for

25
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:55,480
me, is I find that the real
world is very complex.

26
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,590
The more I studied, the more difficult

27
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:05,530
things seemed to be because you start
doing more and more complex stuff.

28
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,729
What finance helped me do was
make the complex world easier.

29
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,739
I think Einstein once said that
something to the effect that, you know

30
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,180
you should make complex things simpler,
but not more so.

31
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,150
So finance makes it simple enough,
but keeps it

32
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,710
challenging enough that you are always
on your toes when you're applying it.

33
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,360
The key aspect of finance which I like
is they are just a few legos if you know

34
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,310
really well.

35
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,660
And I, in this course, have tried to
expose you to the most important one,

36
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,840
which is Time Value of Money.

37
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,799
One aspect of finance, because of what I
just said about, because it's a way of

38
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,70
thinking, and because it's very
applicable, I see it everywhere.

39
00:02:50,70 --> 00:02:52,220
I don't go home and
open up spreadsheets and

40
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,540
figure out what is the value of X, Y, Z.

41
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,650
And that would be very nerdy.

42
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,620
What it is is, it's everywhere, and you can
kind of think in broad, big picture ways,

43
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,660
and then do detailed analysis
wherever they are applicable.

44
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,170
And finance is for everyone.

45
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,510
I really mean this, and

46
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,840
I have created this class because
I see finance everywhere.

47
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,20
And I see finance for everyone.

48
00:03:15,20 --> 00:03:19,420
And I hope the lessons that I'm
talking about are making sense to you,

49
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,130
regardless of your age, your gender,
your ethnicity, where you are growing up.

50
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,760
And one of the passions of my life is to
make education accessible to everybody.

51
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,399
Of course, you have to want to listen and
participate and engage with each other.

52
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,710
Okay?
So, that's what.

53
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:44,120
The second thing I wanted to cover today
is, more specific, equally powerful though.

54
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,570
And that, what have we learned
with Time Value of Money?

55
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:55,320
I hope you've realized that Time Value Money is a 
simple concept, but it can be applied

56
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,51
to a lot of issues that you confront,
from loans, to valuing businesses,

57
00:04:00,51 --> 00:04:06,429
to looking at a small decision like do
I buy an iPad with a loan, take money.

58
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,190
What is the value proposition?

59
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,30
To make very smart decisions
that are more complicated.

60
00:04:13,30 --> 00:04:16,660
You can go from everyday to
very complicated decisions and

61
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,630
Time Value of Money is inherent to everyday. Right?

62
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,130
To create value for an organization,

63
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,659
imagine if you are instead
working full time and

64
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:33,990
you want to learn simple finance and
apply to everything around you, you can.

65
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,290
Because the same decisions that you make
personally, have the same set of tools and

66
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:42,920
perspective and timelines and
value creation issues, organizationally.

67
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,910
The only thing that has really
changed is the eye of the beholder.

68
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,850
And I think obviously that
makes it more and more complex,

69
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,430
but the tools and
the way of thinking remains the same.

70
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,90
Time value money is amazingly powerful.

71
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,20
I want to talk in this
segment a little bit about

72
00:05:02,20 --> 00:05:05,530
what I think the value is
of Time Value of Money.

73
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,130
Also to personal investing.

74
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,980
I've talked about it
as we have gone along.

75
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,550
In fact, personal saving decisions,
loan decisions, and

76
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,60
all were the beginning of the course and
the focus of the first two modules.

77
00:05:18,60 --> 00:05:23,200
Then we shifted to bonds a little
bit which are issued by entities.

78
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,510
Then we went back and
talk about value of decision making and

79
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:32,10
then stocks which tend to be
mostly corporate or entity based.

80
00:05:32,10 --> 00:05:34,690
Let's talk about savings and investments.

81
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:41,10
One of the reasons it's kind of... I've left it to
the end to wrap this issue up was because

82
00:05:41,10 --> 00:05:46,840
it kind of connects to the next important
Lego of finance, which is risk and return.

83
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,203
And we're not going to talk about it,
because it requires a whole set of tools,

84
00:05:50,204 --> 00:05:52,90
especially statistics.

85
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,631
So personal investing.

86
00:05:55,631 --> 00:06:02,265
The main thing I want to do is make it
look as simple as possible, because it is.

87
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:06,944
I think most humans, given a choice
between a low return and a high return,

88
00:06:06,944 --> 00:06:11,781
and remember a return is what? You put
in money in hope of getting something.

89
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:13,627
They will mostly look for what?

90
00:06:13,627 --> 00:06:14,500
More return.

91
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,920
There's no, I haven't met anybody
who doesn't want more return.

92
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,790
And even if it's not monetary, it could
be non-monetary return, recognition.

93
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,730
You want ,like more of something you like.

94
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,280
So if this is the only
thing you cared about, and

95
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,246
go back to a financial mind frame.

96
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,210
Where would you put all your money?

97
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:41,310
So suppose you have money and
you would like maximizing your return.

98
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,450
Where would you put all of it,
given what we have talked about?

99
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,180
So let's go back to bonds and stocks,

100
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,200
the two things that you really
must understand fully by now.

101
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,260
To the extent, I mean adjusting for

102
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,688
the fact that I'm making it available for
everyone.

103
00:06:55,688 --> 00:06:59,110
And where will you put all your money?

104
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,480
In a bond or a stock?

105
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,480
You'll put it in the highest return
because all you care about is high return.

106
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,160
So you would invest in lot of stuff, but

107
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,770
suppose these are the opportunities
available to you.

108
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,690
And I'm going to let this stay up.

109
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:19,490
And it's also few of the data decks are,
actually it's not a deck,

110
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,30
it's a slide, that I have provided and
shown you earlier.

111
00:07:23,30 --> 00:07:27,109
And it shows, again,
the average return on small stocks,

112
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:32,17
S&P 500, corporate bonds,
government bonds, treasury bills.

113
00:07:32,17 --> 00:07:33,981
And suppose this is the only five,

114
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:37,440
six possible investment
opportunities available to you.

115
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,270
In the real world, there are millions.

116
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:45,880
Which one would you pick, if you were
only looking for high rate of returns?

117
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,210
It's a no brainer.

118
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,440
You pick investing in small stocks.

119
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,370
Heck, even within those, you'd pick one with
the highest rate of return in the past,

120
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,260
assuming that you expect it to happen.

121
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,10
That's what your expectation is.

122
00:08:01,10 --> 00:08:04,390
Life would be very simple if
all you liked was return,

123
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,195
you would invest in high return.

124
00:08:06,196 --> 00:08:10,529
However, turns out,

125
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:14,409
we do not like risk.

126
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,180
What is our attitude towards risk?

127
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,460
And remember what is return?

128
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,909
Return, think about it,
you don't know it in the future, but

129
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,740
you can kind of estimate average.

130
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,200
On average, how much more stocks pay and

131
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,480
they are likely to pay more again,
at least in the long run, in the future.

132
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,970
But what comes with small stocks is what?

133
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,950
High risk, too.

134
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,840
And you dislike that.

135
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,000
And that issue is a little
bit hypocritical, right?

136
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,560
because you want high return but
you dislike risk.

137
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,670
Well, where is the risk the highest
among the things that I showed you?

138
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,160
Among the small stocks or treasury bill?

139
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,420
Small stocks had the highest volatility,
or standard deviation,

140
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,280
among all the possibilities
I just showed you.

141
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,860
So what is the lesson of all of this?

142
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:09,780
The lesson of this is, that high risk and
high return go together.

143
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,970
And one way to think about it is,
it's driven by our

144
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,635
love for risk, but with,
I mean, our love for return.

145
00:09:17,635 --> 00:09:19,890
[LAUGH] I got excited there.

146
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,939
But we always have an eye on risk.

147
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,470
And in the risk we don't like,
up is okay, down, we don't.

148
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,260
And it comes, life is tough.

149
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,860
You get, risk comes double sided, right?

150
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,280
Many times.

151
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,920
So what do you do?

152
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,110
You like return, but you dislike risk.

153
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,640
Would you ever invest in
an individual stocks?

154
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,650
And this is the 101 of
investment that can take you so

155
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,236
far in life that you won't believe.

156
00:09:49,236 --> 00:09:51,357
It's called portfolio theory.

157
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:56,850
It's the basis of almost the entire
development of investment.

158
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:01,140
And recent actions by companies
like Vanguard would show you that

159
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:05,930
probably your best bet is not to
create your own investment strategy.

160
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:10,859
I mean, portfolio, but
to pick ones that already exist.

161
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,90
So why portfolio?

162
00:10:12,90 --> 00:10:14,900
I keep coming back to portfolio and
not individual securities.

163
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,510
If you're risk averse,
we knew it in the cave,

164
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:24,60
that the one thing you do is don't
put all your eggs in one basket.

165
00:10:24,60 --> 00:10:26,550
You want to diversify.

166
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:31,260
And diversification, by definition,
means if I have hundred bucks,

167
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,670
I will not put all hundred
even in the company I love.

168
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,439
Why?

169
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,540
Because I'll go down with it and
I'll go up with it.

170
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,290
The volatility will be much more for
an individual company.

171
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,370
And how do I get rid of that volatility?

172
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,540
I like return.

173
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,510
I get rid of that volatility
by combining stocks.

174
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:55,000
And what is the most important
portfolios I've shown you again?

175
00:10:56,80 --> 00:11:01,000
I've shown you portfolios of small stocks
and big stocks and S&P 500, and so

176
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,470
on and so forth.

177
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,880
Now let me leave you with one picture
here before we take a break, and

178
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,870
this is in some senses the essence
of diversification investing.

179
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:18,130
And this also will be a slide
that I have given to you.

180
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:22,760
It's based on publicly
available data - 1989 to 2008.

181
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:28,439
Some stocks, the standard deviation or
variance of them or

182
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,430
change in them, but remember,
you don't like risk, and the S&P 500.

183
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:36,140
So, I'll just talk about them,
but they're up there.

184
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,230
You can make notes or

185
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:42,830
you can just open up your little
slide that I have posted for you.

186
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:46,900
So, this time you have stocks and
only one portfolio.

187
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:52,978
And the stocks I have picked are Disney,
AT&T, Pfizer, General Motors, Alcoa,

188
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:58,910
Home Depot, General Electric, Exxon,
Intel, Citibank, Proctor & Gamble.

189
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:03,50
I apologize that these are all U.S.
based stocks.

190
00:12:03,50 --> 00:12:07,430
But the purpose of this is not U.S.
or China or India.

191
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:12,106
The purpose is to show you something that
will be true regardless of the country

192
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,880
you are picking.

193
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,128
Globally, this will be true.

194
00:12:15,128 --> 00:12:20,420
So stare at it,
I have listed the standard deviations.

195
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,260
I think, I encourage you to look up
the definition of standard deviation.

196
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,900
The standard deviation of something
will be zero if it never changes.

197
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,419
And there is nothing in life like that.

198
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,280
So standard deviation is how much
around the average do you bounce.

199
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,110
So for a stock price, what is it?

200
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:43,230
If the rate of return is 10%, but
if it's bouncing between 15 and 25,

201
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,240
that's one thing.

202
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,520
Or it could be bouncing between,
say, 10, I mean it's 10 on average,

203
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,590
bouncing between 12 And 15.

204
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,30
That's another thing.

205
00:12:53,30 --> 00:12:58,189
If it's bouncing between, I mean 8 and
15, because it has to be lower than 10.

206
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:03,320
So how much it bounces around,
around the average value is what's listed.

207
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,805
So just as an example, if you stare at it,

208
00:13:06,805 --> 00:13:11,298
and hopefully... this is
the slide with individual stocks.

209
00:13:11,298 --> 00:13:16,890
What you'll notice first thing is that, there
are some stocks with very high volatility,

210
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,819
and the highest one here is Intel, 40%.

211
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:24,400
The next highest is General Motors, 33%.

212
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,680
Then there are a few 30%, right?

213
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,593
No, there's a 31%, Citibank, and

214
00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:36,69
this is the volatility of the return
on the stock of these companies, right?

215
00:13:36,70 --> 00:13:39,350
So you have various companies listed.

216
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,670
Please stare at them.

217
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:46,530
But when you come back, I want you
to also stare at the S&P 500 and

218
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:50,770
tell me what is so
remarkable about these numbers.

219
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,360
So the first ten are stocks.

220
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,30
Famous names so that you can relate to
them, and the final one is a portfolio,

221
00:13:59,30 --> 00:14:01,839
not a stock, a portfolio of 500 of them.

222
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,140
I could have chosen a bunch
of other portfolios, but

223
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,380
I chose this one because it has
got all kinds of stocks in them.

224
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,140
Think about it.

225
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:17,620
It is the 101 of diversification and
can take you so far, you won't believe.
