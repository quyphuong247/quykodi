00:00:04,927 --> 00:00:07,60

So how do bonds work?

2
00:00:07,60 --> 00:00:10,399
And remember I'm going to show
you the structure of bonds.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,340
And now I'm going from...more towards

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,800
entities borrowing than personal
people borrowing on personal behalf.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,440
We have done the loans at the personal
level, so you can call them bonds as well.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,70
But the distinction between
what we are talking now is,

7
00:00:28,70 --> 00:00:34,410
we are talking about institutions that
we give money to, by buying their bonds.

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,230
And we'll start off with institutions
that are everywhere in the world, and

9
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,50
they're called governments.

10
00:00:40,50 --> 00:00:41,290
So, and by the way,

11
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:46,410
state governments also issue bonds, and
they're called municipal bonds in the US.

12
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,739
So we are going to entities, and
as we go to entities, in many...in many

13
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:58,860
instances, especially in the US,
these entities do such thing publicly.

14
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,760
So I think that's mostly good news.

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,710
Why?

16
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,850
Because if the bonds
are available publicly,

17
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,520
they're priced,
then markets come into play.

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,800
And one of the biggest
functions of markets or

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,60
trading is to provide
information to everybody.

20
00:01:15,60 --> 00:01:18,70
Anyway, so
I'm going to go to the structure.

21
00:01:18,70 --> 00:01:21,300
So there are two sources
of payment from a bond.

22
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:27,990
So if you buy a bond issued, say, by
the government, they pay you in two ways.

23
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,970
Remember, you pay them by buying the bond,
but they pay you back in two ways.

24
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,600
And the two ways,
the first is called coupon.

25
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,546
So what is a coupon?

26
00:01:37,546 --> 00:01:42,840
Coupon is a payment that's
paid by the borrower,

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,530
and it's paid periodically, meaning,
every year, every six months typically.

28
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,570
And we'll talk about that.

29
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,699
So the first kind of payment is a coupon.

30
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,580
And who determines the coupon?

31
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:00,9
The coupon is determined by the issuer
of the bond, or the borrower.

32
00:02:00,10 --> 00:02:02,480
I know there's a lot of words in there.

33
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,400
But the person who's borrowing
the money says look,

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,640
I'll pay you coupons,
every six months or so.

35
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,989
And finally, I will also pay you
something called face value.

36
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:20,251
In other words that's the contract that
I'll pay you typically smaller amounts

37
00:02:20,252 --> 00:02:24,975
every six months and then kind of a
balloon payment at the end of face value.

38
00:02:24,975 --> 00:02:27,640
And we'll see what it
all means in a second.

39
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,230
The reason I'm highlighting
this is because

40
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,60
you'll see the nature of the beast right
away in terms of what does that mean?

41
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,930
The other thing that's extremely important
about a bond is, it's called a bond

42
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,119
partly because it has a lifetime,
it has a maturity.

43
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,160
It doesn't go on forever, though there
are very rare exceptions of that.

44
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,700
I think I already talked about
a perpetuity in England called a console.

45
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,850
So they have limited lifetime maturity,
and

46
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,900
that's another distinction from what we'll
study later, which are called shares and

47
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:11,170
stocks that companies issue
to create a value as well.

48
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,329
Okay? As I said before, finally,
the structure of bonds can be such that,

49
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:22,122
depending on the issuer and the nature
of the bond, the risks can be very,

50
00:03:22,122 --> 00:03:26,250
very, very different across
different kinds of bonds.

51
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,570
In fact,
I don't know if you've heard about this,

52
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,30
but the riskiest bonds
are called junk bonds, you know?

53
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:38,120
It's kind of funny they're called junk
bonds, because they're are kinda junky,

54
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,714
but not in the sense of trashy, but in
the sense of very high risk, high return.

55
00:03:42,714 --> 00:03:47,158
And one of the things about humans is,
we like the upside, but

56
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:52,204
we dislike the risk, you know, which I tease
is that's hypocritical, right?

57
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:56,674
Because volatility doesn't
care about upside or downside.

58
00:03:56,674 --> 00:04:00,134
Risk is double-sided, and
humans want only the upside.

59
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:03,440
And there's in life very few such things.

60
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,79
So let me draw the timeline for you, and

61
00:04:06,80 --> 00:04:08,960
I think let's get a little
bit practical now.

62
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,190
I do a lot of examples but not without
showing you the structure, right?

63
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,40
So here's the timeline.

64
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,275
So what happens typically?

65
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:24,380
1, 2, 3, and let's make it 10 periods.

66
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,840
We'll define what a period is, but for
the time being assume it as one year,

67
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,380
or whatever.

68
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,965
So what happens?

69
00:04:31,965 --> 00:04:37,561
There's a C, there's a C, there's a C.

70
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:39,729
This is called the coupon.

71
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:43,230
Again, remember, we use C for
many different things.

72
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,230
In the context of bonds, it's a coupon.

73
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:53,40
And in the final year, you also get
something called face value, right?

74
00:04:53,40 --> 00:05:00,290
Again, please, remember,
all these are determined by the, borrower.

75
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,120
So what does the lender determine?

76
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,10
The lender looks at who is
issuing the bond, first thing.

77
00:05:11,10 --> 00:05:17,90
Second, looks at the cash flows promised
by the bond, typically in two forms,

78
00:05:17,90 --> 00:05:22,169
not necessarily always, but typically
in two forms, coupon and face value.

79
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:27,230
And then says, okay I'll give
you X amount of money today, and

80
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,940
that X is called price of a bond.

81
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,846
And take a guess what that is.

82
00:05:32,846 --> 00:05:38,351
That is equal to the PV of the Cs and

83
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:41,110
the face value.

84
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,195
As you know it's Time Value
of Money all over again.

85
00:05:44,195 --> 00:05:49,210
And what we are going to do now is
we're going to start doing problems and

86
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,145
applications.

87
00:05:50,145 --> 00:05:55,409
And if you know Time Value of Money
very well, you'll, in some ways,

88
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,690
find this segment as very easy to do.

89
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,659
There are two reasons for this.

90
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,910
I'm pitching it at a level where you
understand fundamental bonds and

91
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:11,460
the borrowing done by all kinds of
institutions, particularly the government,

92
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,680
because they are one of
the biggest players.

93
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,535
And the simplicity is because
of the nature of the beast,

94
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:20,650
i.e., coupons are known and
face value is known.

95
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,299
But as we get more and more risky,
it becomes quite complicated, and

96
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,450
I'm gonna stop at that point.

97
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,99
And then we'll take a break and
talk about stocks later.

98
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,476
But you could go and

99
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:37,70
do very sophisticated analysis with bonds
that have all kinds of risks in it.

100
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:43,540
We won't do that in this course, but
we'll take you close enough that you

101
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,360
understand a lot more than
you can actually execute.

102
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,171
Having said that, you can execute and

103
00:06:49,171 --> 00:06:51,667
actually calculate a lot
of stuff yourself as well.
