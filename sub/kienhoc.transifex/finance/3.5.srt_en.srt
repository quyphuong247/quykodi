Welcome back.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,890
We are doing
Mega Problem, application two and

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,970
what I'm going to do
now is something cool.

4
00:00:12,10 --> 00:00:14,410
Because I want to,
like in application one,

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,962
get as much value out of this problem.

6
00:00:16,962 --> 00:00:22,338
Because it'll kinda enable you to
run on your own and empower you.

7
00:00:22,338 --> 00:00:27,10
And finance is for everyone is this
course, I keep reminding myself.

8
00:00:27,10 --> 00:00:31,680
It's important that I give you some
tools to work with problems, right?

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,90
So what I'm going to do is I'm gonna
confirm that my calculations are right.

10
00:00:36,90 --> 00:00:36,960
How do you do that?

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,80
And that's one of the beautiful
things about finance,

12
00:00:39,80 --> 00:00:43,980
is that you can play things out in real
time, and see if all of it makes sense.

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,669
So what does that mean?

14
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:50,147
I'm going to start with
the amount that we decided

15
00:00:50,147 --> 00:00:54,423
Emilia needed in the bank today,
in her fund.

16
00:00:54,423 --> 00:00:59,818
And it was 34,000, at time zero,

17
00:00:59,818 --> 00:01:04,750
it was 34,213.09, yeah?

18
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,490
We needed that money in the bank and
I'm going to play it out in real time.

19
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:14,180
And then later, I'll do an application
which will make you do things smarter and

20
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,970
quicker, but
right now I want to go stepwise.

21
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:22,371
So here's the timeline and

22
00:01:22,371 --> 00:01:28,125
I'm interested in years 5

23
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:32,190
6, 7, 8.

24
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,970
She will, of course, graduate in year
nine, okay, if things go as planned.

25
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,720
So the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to tell you the value or

26
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,80
work with the value of the fund.

27
00:01:43,80 --> 00:01:47,190
Then from this, I will
subtract tuition every year.

28
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:55,823
And the fund, please remember, increases
at 5% and this increases at 2.5%.

29
00:01:55,823 --> 00:02:00,207
We have calculated these numbers already,
the tuition that is, and

30
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:01,880
it's a negative number.

31
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,200
So what I'm going to do is, I'm
going to take fund to each year

32
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,720
after figuring out the net value,
net fund.

33
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,959
And at the end, what should you..if you've saved enough and

34
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,770
things work out, you would have
come up with zero at the end.

35
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,540
So I'm going to put a zero right here.

36
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,310
That's what I want to get, right?

37
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,600
Because you would have
paid off everything.

38
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,90
You wouldn't be left with either
positive or negative, right?

39
00:02:31,90 --> 00:02:31,980
So let's start off.

40
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,980
The first issue is, what is
the value of the fund in year five?

41
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,320
Very simple, how would you do it?

42
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,760
It's a Future Value problem, very simple,

43
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,355
where the interest rate is what?

44
00:02:44,355 --> 00:02:49,79
5% and number of years is five.

45
00:02:49,80 --> 00:02:52,813
And the PV is 34,213.

46
00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:59,616
So I'm going to write out that number.

47
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:03,614
It's 43,665.53.

48
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,844
This is the amount of money in my fund.

49
00:03:06,844 --> 00:03:09,802
However, at the end of five years,

50
00:03:09,802 --> 00:03:14,743
I'll have to make a withdrawal
from this fund for tuition.

51
00:03:14,743 --> 00:03:21,463
And the withdrawal amount
will be 11,314.08.

52
00:03:21,463 --> 00:03:26,480
We have already calculated it,
but you can redo it.

53
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,519
What is this number?

54
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,693
How would I get it?

55
00:03:28,693 --> 00:03:32,368
It'll be 10,000,
today's value of the tuition,

56
00:03:32,368 --> 00:03:35,850
carried forward for
five years, but now at 2.5%.

57
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,666
What am I left with?

58
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:45,389
I am left with 32,351.45.

59
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:48,887
This is the first step, but
we have got to keep going and

60
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:51,260
that's what makes it interesting.

61
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,320
So the question is, in year six,

62
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,660
what's the value of the fund,
after having paid one tuition?

63
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,204
And the answer is, it's got to be
greater than 32, but at which rate?

64
00:04:02,205 --> 00:04:05,82
5%.
It's a Future Value problem,

65
00:04:05,82 --> 00:04:06,665
where N equals one.

66
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:10,840
33,969.02, but now I have to

67
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:15,690
subtract the second
tuition in year six and

68
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:22,330
that second tuition has to
be greater than 11,314.

69
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,359
Why?

70
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,446
Because of inflation of 2.5%.

71
00:04:27,446 --> 00:04:35,549
So it turns out, 11,596.93 and

72
00:04:35,549 --> 00:04:44,150
you're left with 22,372.09.

73
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,969
Because there's a lot of numbers
I'm kind of going a little slow.

74
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,560
So that I don't make a silly mistake.

75
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,216
It is making sense, right?
Because the tuition is pretty hefty.

76
00:04:55,216 --> 00:04:57,70
So you go from 33 to about 22.

77
00:04:57,70 --> 00:04:59,368
How do I get this top number now?

78
00:04:59,368 --> 00:05:03,576
Again, take 22,000 forward,
but at which rate?

79
00:05:03,576 --> 00:05:07,666
5%.
So this is 23,409.

80
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,826
Sorry, 490.

81
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:11,203
23,490.69.

82
00:05:20,968 --> 00:05:25,903
And I want to now subtract the tuition
that's increased again, one more time,

83
00:05:25,903 --> 00:05:26,844
for one year.

84
00:05:26,844 --> 00:05:35,41
And that is 11,886.86.

85
00:05:35,41 --> 00:05:37,180
And what am I left with?

86
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:44,60
I'm left with 11,603.84

87
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,381
I should carry this forward, but

88
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,650
the number I should get here
is the same as the tuition.

89
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,229
And it seems like I'm on the right track,
right?

90
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,820
But I carry this forward at 5%.

91
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,928
I get 12,184.03 and

92
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:06,915
that's exactly the tuition.

93
00:06:06,915 --> 00:06:10,256
12,184.03.

94
00:06:10,256 --> 00:06:11,340
Isn't this cool?

95
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,400
So what I have done is, I have
worked on two mega problems,

96
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:23,90
which I promise you will not only empower
you to do these in your own time,

97
00:06:23,90 --> 00:06:25,669
which I will recommend very strongly.

98
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:29,20
But will empower you to do
the problems in the assignments,

99
00:06:29,20 --> 00:06:34,609
which in turn will help you run with
things even beyond the assignments.

100
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,560
I purposely make some of the questions
on the assignments tough.

101
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,250
So that you have to think.

102
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,480
But in this course,
I'm doing a lot of stuff applied and

103
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:49,630
more so to problems that you'll encounter
in different aspects of your life.

104
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,270
Obviously, I can't cover every aspect.

105
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:56,140
But hopefully,
the flavor of the problems is such and

106
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:01,906
the mixes between them across problems
are such, that it'll cover most issues.
