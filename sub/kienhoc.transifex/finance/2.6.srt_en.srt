Now for probably one of

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:11,480
my favorite problems in finance, which is
very, very powerful. We will do it in a

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,760
simple way first and then we'll shred it

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,890
to bits and try to understand how
finances is so awesome. This little problem

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,810
reflects so much, that we can squeeze out
so much value out of it. But in the beginning

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:31,349
I just want you to understand how things
work, so read the problem it says, again

7
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:37,850
kind of a PV problem. You plan to attend an
in-state college and for those of

8
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:44,190
you who are not in the US and most of you
probably are not in the US, in-state, it

9
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,510
means when you are studying in a
university like Michigan, you have a

10
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,580
lower tuition because we are a public
university if you are from Michigan and

11
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:59,720
there are certain rules that apply for
you to qualify like you're born here, you

12
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,830
are a resident. Then your tuition is
less but still it's a lot and higher

13
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:11,610
education is really worried about how
the cost of education cannot just keep, I

14
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,450
mean, the tuition we charge cannot keep
going up. Even in-state tuition is pretty

15
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:22,520
high. So here a student coming to
Michigan is saying, "Okay my parents will

16
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:28,330
have to take a loan of about $100,000 at 6% and choosing an interest rate

17
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,380
pretty much randomly but I'm changing
them over time hopefully the interest

18
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:37,770
rate is lower. So you're taking a loan and
you're taking a loan today. You will make

19
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,580
yearly payments and you'll have five
years to pay back the loan. Starting

20
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:47,300
pretty much in year 1, now this could change and we'll do more complicated stuff where you

21
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,970
take a loan today and you could have two
years of no payments and then starting

22
00:01:51,970 --> 00:02:01,280
later but we're taking a simple loan. So let's write out the timeline of this again.

23
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:08,759
This time we have red and we'll have fun with it.
Zero, five, so we figured out N is equal to

24
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:22,470
to 5. 1..2. So this is a PV problem but
unlike the previous problem we are given

25
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:29,859
the PV. So the PV is $100,000 right? And we are going

26
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:38,380
to now trying to figure out the PMT, so
we're trying to figure out what are the

27
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:44,850
yearly. And if you notice, if you looked at
the problem first, please start doing it

28
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:50,859
on your own. You can pause, but I'll keep
going because we can't take too many

29
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:56,70
mini breaks, right? So this problem is, we now get a feel of it, we should be able to do it.

30
00:02:56,70 --> 00:03:01,549
Do it with Excel or do it on your own and come
back and see what it's like, right?

31
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:06,430
The thing I wanted to emphasize is the thing in bold; I say
yearly payment, this is simplifying

32
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:12,320
things. Why? Because typically, payments
will be monthly, but we'll come back to

33
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,440
that in a second, in a more complicated
problem. Okay, so for now let's stick with

34
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,780
five years now.

35
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,280
Ok it's actually not very complicated if
you are using Excel to make it monthly.

36
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,510
Five years, so the question is what is
that question mark? And the question mark

37
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:37,70
is the PMT. Before we start let's again
do the simple exercise. Suppose

38
00:03:37,70 --> 00:03:46,250
you borrow $100,000 and the interest rate is 6%, how much will you pay every year if, interest

39
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:53,740
rates were zero? First of all, the 100,000 will be positive for you today but negative for

40
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,830
the bank. I'm just repeating what Excel
is going to do, you put a positive get a

41
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:03,790
negative. You put a negative, you get a positive.

42
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:08,160
For the bank its negative, for you, I'm laughing

43
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,170
because I am also like, what the heck going on? $100,000 you get
positive, but then you have to put a

44
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:17,849
bunch of negatives five times. So if there
was no interest at all how much would

45
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,30
you pay every year?

46
00:04:19,29 --> 00:04:25,590
$20,000. So think of the interest as the
use for money, so I'll let you do that but,

47
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:33,380
this time let's start with PMT, as soon
as you do that in Excel and I hope you

48
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:40,300
you have Excel open next to you. You can actually use the formalus too. And for those who are

49
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,790
geeks like I used to be

50
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,700
use the formula to double check but
Excel is useful. Once you know what

51
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,210
you're doing

52
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:57,570
Put rate 0.06. N is how much? 5 years.
And I believe and if I said something wrong

53
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:01,640
like this it's a silly wrong because you can
always check. I think the next number is

54
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:07,680
PV and the final number you can enter
is an FV. So the PV turns out to be,

55
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:17,590
don't enter commas where they are not
applicable in the excel formula, right? because

56
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,260
otherwise It'll get confused, it'll think
if you put a comma here, it'll think it's PV

57
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,270
is only hundred, so just write out the
hundred thousand, if I by mistake but a

58
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,130
comma, say

59
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:38,60
Gautham is a bozo, which I am, and move
on. So PMT, the answer will be what? Twenty three thousand, seven hundred

60
00:05:38,60 --> 00:05:56,450
and thirty nine point six four. $23,739.64. It is 3,739
dollars more per year than the if interest

61
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,990
rate was zero. Does that make sense?

62
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:06,940
Sure, here it's hurting you. Why? Because you're paying. So if you put this as a positive,

63
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,860
this will come out as a negative. So if
this was a positive, this will be a

64
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,440
negative, which in this sense makes sense from your perspective. From the banks

65
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,670
perspective, this was a negative
outflow, they'll get a positive

66
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:29,30
of these. Again, isn't this cool? It's so simple, so powerful, let me again repeat one thing

67
00:06:29,40 --> 00:06:34,960
though, how much control you or your
parents have over the decision making?

68
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,340
You decide based on whatever your needs are,
that you need a $100,000 over

69
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,20
five years

70
00:06:42,20 --> 00:06:46,950
collectively with your parents and then
you take a loan, after that you choose

71
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,810
how many years you want to take to pay it
back.

72
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:55,640
Typically you will have a choice over that a
little bit and then the interest rate,

73
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,969
everybody thinks that you know is under
your control, its not, that's why markets

74
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,880
are so beautiful.

75
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:08,770
Nobody in this marketplace really
individually control 6%, it's

76
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:16,650
determined collectively by all of us. Do
this problem and you see how easy Excel

77
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,739
makes life for you. You can make N 500 too and it'll get an answer.
