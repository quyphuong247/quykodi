Ok, let's now

2
00:00:07,20 --> 00:00:11,680
change the one thing that was very
simple and retain one thing that was

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,860
simple but we don't want to change two
things at the same time, especially

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:20,800
because we're trying to just grapple with legos, so the one thing we´ll keep is, we´ll

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,000
give you payment once, in the future but
unlike the previous problem, where you got

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,509
1100 one year from now and figured out its
Present Value, what I'm going to do is,

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,20
read what problem is. I'm going to give
you 1210 dollars and

8
00:00:36,20 --> 00:00:39,720
most of you are probably smiling because you
already can figure out what the

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,470
heck I´m doing. Suppose you will inherit 1210 dollars two years

10
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:49,230
from now and the interest rate in the
marketplace is 10%, what is the value of

11
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,860
this to you today? It's a Present Value
problem, so let's first draw the timeline,

12
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,730
sorry, I'm getting a little carried away

13
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:08,570
0...2, you're standing here figuring out the
PV, by the way, as I said, probably I´ll say this

14
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,199
over and over again, if you know how
to draw a timeline, then you can put money at

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:19,469
the right spots or whatever figuring out value and
doing stuff is very easy, you know?

16
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:24,399
Future Value, Present Value, It´s all about
time, see Matrix and you'll understand

17
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:27,139
Finance, you know what I mean, Star Wars all

18
00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:33,439
futuristic stuff is very easy once you
know that stuff, Finance becomes very easy. So you

19
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,880
now have $1,210 here, you know why I picked
1,210, but let's do it, so what is

20
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,589
the value today of it? The good news is,
you know how to do the Present Value of

21
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:52,679
1 period, so time travel and imagine
you are sitting here, at time one. Can you tell

22
00:01:52,679 --> 00:02:00,869
me what is the Present Value of $1,210, I
hope so. So let's do it, you will take $1,210

23
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:09,20
and divide it by 1 plus R, which in our

24
00:02:09,20 --> 00:02:16,150
case is what? 1.10,  that will bring
you to which point? That´ll bring you to

25
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,130
this point, but you're not done yet. I'm
not asking you what is the value of 1,210

26
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:26,630
two years from now in period one, I mean
that you could do that and what would you

27
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:32,680
substitute for R? 10%. I'm asking you little bit more difficult question, which is, what is

28
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,280
the Present Value today? So what do you
do to this? You have to then do another

29
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,350
PV of this, remember? The way I did
Future Value, per period, it´s very cool,

30
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:51,190
very cool stuff. So what will you do to this?
You´ll divide it again, ignore this 2, assume

31
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:58,359
it´s there, you´ll divide the circled number
again by 1+R, let's put this in parenthesis,

32
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:09,960
So what will you get? You will get FV
which is, over 1+R what? Not two times,

33
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:16,740
but square, so this is very intuitive,
right? It´s kind of mirror imaging, what is PV?

34
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:22,80
It´s the inverse of FV, kind of the
opposite of FV, but what's happening

35
00:03:22,80 --> 00:03:24,590
now? If you start noticing on it,

36
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:29,610
what will the value be? If you put 1+R
square, turns out, it'll turn out to be

37
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:36,520
1,000 dollars, ok? Please do this. What
I'm going to do next is, go to Excel with

38
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,900
more complex problems, but I wanted you
to understand the concept and the

39
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,990
formula, and now we´ll do more examples
where I´ll show you the power of

40
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:53,880
compounding in reverse and it´ll hurt, you know. You get
excited what your Future Value will be, but

41
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,120
Future Values will be discounted now, going back.
