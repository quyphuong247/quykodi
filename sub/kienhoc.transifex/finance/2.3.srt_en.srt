Let's do the power of saving regularly,
the same simple idea.

2
00:00:10,40 --> 00:00:13,669
On the deck which you should be
able to see now on the camera,

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,410
you'll see a problem which says how much
will you have in your bank account 50

4
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:26,80
years from now if you save $1,000
every year at either 5% or 15%?

5
00:00:26,80 --> 00:00:31,639
You remember I did this in the past
in a one period, one cash flow problem.

6
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,650
And here,
the previous problem that we just did

7
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,310
was you wanting to go to college and
saving $1,000.

8
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,860
This is a more long-term problem
where you're trying to save, say,

9
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,460
for retirement.

10
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,590
And you're starting as
soon as you start working.

11
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,690
So think you're about 25,

12
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,699
and you're saving and wanting to know
how much you'll have when you're 75.

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:01:00,250
First of all, saving is a good thing,
of course, if you have cash flows.

14
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,470
And what that does is, this
also shows you the power.

15
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:09,908
So this is what's going on, let's quickly
take a second to see what's going on.

16
00:01:09,908 --> 00:01:17,477
I'm going to draw the time line with you,
zero, one, how many years?

17
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:18,200
Fifty years.

18
00:01:20,90 --> 00:01:21,60
Now what are you doing?

19
00:01:21,60 --> 00:01:23,796
You're saving $1,000.

20
00:01:23,796 --> 00:01:25,750
How many times?

21
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,690
50 times.

22
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,610
And the question you are asking is,

23
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,350
N is 50, PMT.

24
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,670
I promised you my handwriting
was terrible, is 1,000.

25
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:49,430
But I'm giving you r of either 5% or 15%.

26
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,680
So I'm really showing you
the power of two things.

27
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,330
One is time and
the other is the interest rate combined.

28
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,160
And time is more powerful
here because you're

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,259
making investments over and over again.

30
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,449
Before we start this, and I'm going
to go to Excel to do this with you,

31
00:02:05,449 --> 00:02:10,220
though it's not too complicated, you
know what to look for, the FV function.

32
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,460
Before we go there,
let me ask you a simple question.

33
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,883
Think about how much would you have
if there was no Time Value of Money.

34
00:02:16,883 --> 00:02:21,830
Life would be very simple in terms of
calculating, because you'll take 50 and

35
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,698
multiply it by 1,000.

36
00:02:23,698 --> 00:02:26,624
So you'll have 50,000, right?

37
00:02:26,624 --> 00:02:30,704
But life becomes very interesting,
and I'm going to go over to

38
00:02:30,705 --> 00:02:36,500
Excel, And do it with you, one shot.

39
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,790
So if you go to Excel,
let's go to cell A1, and

40
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:48,929
I'm going to stick there and
try to do the problem with you.

41
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:55,3
So you press equal sign, you press FV,
and then you press what?

42
00:02:55,3 --> 00:03:00,519
0.05, then I press

43
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,900
50, and
I then press how much? Thousand.

44
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,520
If you notice,
I don't need to press anything in PV or

45
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,840
FV that comes, then I hit it.

46
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,870
Return, how much do you get?

47
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,916
We should get about $209,348.

48
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:23,49
I think we do get that.

49
00:03:23,49 --> 00:03:27,248
So, that was the first part,
now the cool thing is if you look at it,

50
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:31,269
how much did yo have if you didn't
have any Time Value of Money?

51
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,430
You had five $1,000 50 times, $50,000.

52
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,980
You already have at 5%, 4 times that.

53
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,516
And the difference between 50 and
$209,000,

54
00:03:42,516 --> 00:03:44,296
about $159,000

55
00:03:44,296 --> 00:03:50,720
is because of compounding, right? Interest with compounding,
obviously.

56
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,990
So I'm going to now change
this a little bit right here.

57
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:59,940
The other thing was,
take a guess how much will it be at 15%.

58
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:06,859
Many people will think, look, you know,
5%, 15% should be about 3 times.

59
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,480
What are they ignoring?

60
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,200
They're ignoring the fact,
that actually there is compounding,

61
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,484
which is highly non-linear.

62
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,170
So I've changed the 0.05
to 0.15 right there.

63
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,680
I hit enter and I am just double
checking with my numbers so

64
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,800
that, because this is online and we don't
want to keep typing small mistakes even

65
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,690
though I'll make them, I do the numbers
a little bit ahead of time.

66
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,883
Turns out it's $7 million.

67
00:04:31,883 --> 00:04:37,311
And plus $217,716, so actually,

68
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:43,15
it's about $7 million more
than what we found at 5%.

69
00:04:43,16 --> 00:04:46,350
So, I mean, think about it.

70
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,490
Isn't that cool?

71
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:47,990
First.

72
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,500
Second, it shows you
that life can get very,

73
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,440
very complicated when we do non-linear
stuff, and as I said earlier,

74
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:03,920
many people are surprised, including me,
to see, how powerful compounding can be.

75
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,320
It looks very cool moving forward.

76
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,870
But it can be devastating,
when you go do PVs.

77
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:17,220
And, incredibly valuable things in the
future, could look, of very little value

78
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,510
today if you use high interest rates,
which may or may not be justified.

79
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,490
That's a whole debate.

80
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,570
In very long term investments,
right? For future generations.
