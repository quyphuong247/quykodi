00:00:04,918 --> 00:00:09,100
https://youtu.be/YJdQFizBYeE
I have gone deliberately slow
trying to explain what stocks are.

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,870
Shown you some data,
because it's fascinating, but

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:17,790
also because it is probably
new to most of you.

4
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:22,540
Not necessarily all of you obviously,
and it's also little bit complex.

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,200
So you need to understand what it means,
it's a vehicle of investment.

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,785
It also is a vehicle of
borrowing by firms, by entities.

7
00:00:32,785 --> 00:00:34,995
So individuals don't issue stock, so

8
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:38,684
that's another reason why I just
wanted to give you some sense.

9
00:00:38,685 --> 00:00:41,425
So let's now start thinking
about the price of a stock, and

10
00:00:41,425 --> 00:00:44,195
it's just mind bogglingly cool.

11
00:00:44,195 --> 00:00:45,275
So make an assumption.

12
00:00:45,275 --> 00:00:48,785
Let us assume that a company
has only stock, no debt.

13
00:00:48,785 --> 00:00:50,339
Is this possible?

14
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:50,850
Of course.

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,820
As I said, you start off with stock, but

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,930
once you take on debt,
that gets paid first.

17
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,960
For simplicity,
let's assume that there's no debt.

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,810
And you'll see why.

19
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,840
It makes life a little bit simple.

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,480
Is this possible?

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,729
Yes, it is.

22
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,600
In fact,
a lot of companies don't have debt

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,640
because debt has some positives,
very strong positives.

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,920
But it also has some downsides.

25
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,840
And one of the downsides is,
if you're growing very fast and

26
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,110
you've got to pay your debt holders and
you can't default,

27
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,10
you don't have money to
reinvest necessarily.

28
00:01:24,10 --> 00:01:25,470
So that's one of the issues.

29
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,50
One of the main advantages is
interest on debt is tax deductible,

30
00:01:31,50 --> 00:01:32,350
whereas dividend is not.

31
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,229
Remember interest is the way
you get money on debt.

32
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,720
How do you get money on stocks?

33
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,289
Dividends, and
of course you can sell the stock anytime.

34
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,649
So yes, you can have zero debt and
for simplicity be both.

35
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,420
Can you have zero stock?

36
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,160
No.

37
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,410
I mean, as I said, no company should give
you any money if you don't have any skin

38
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,820
in the game because you'll be
incentivized to take too much risk.

39
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,960
What will be the value of the company,
if indeed, it had only stocks?

40
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,339
And this is so cool.

41
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,780
So imagine you have a company where
there are a million shares trading.

42
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,370
That means your company stock is at
least trading in the stock markets.

43
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,170
And the good news is stock
markets are everywhere.

44
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,980
Of course, sometimes they're manipulated,
they're controlled by insiders and so

45
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,299
on, but in a competitive market,
it's great.

46
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,900
Stocks trade all the time.

47
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,650
It's fascinating.

48
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,510
So what will be the value of the company?

49
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,49
Very simple.

50
00:02:32,50 --> 00:02:33,960
You have 1 million shares trading, and

51
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,400
you look up finance.yahoo.com and
we'll do that in the end.

52
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,270
And you see price per share is $5,

53
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:46,400
you just take five times number of shares
and you know the value of the company.

54
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,270
That's why I think markets and
finance are so powerful.

55
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,890
As I said, earlier at some point and

56
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,450
I repeat right now,
financing itself is not value creating.

57
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,10
Real ideas are.

58
00:02:59,10 --> 00:03:00,959
But if financing weren't available so

59
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,260
freely, money wouldn't go to
the best ideas of the world, okay?

60
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,150
And that's the purpose of today's class,
so

61
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,275
let's start thinking about
the price of a stock.

62
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:13,780
So how is a stock priced?

63
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,680
Let me throw up some jargon first,
some symbols, and

64
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,810
then we'll come back and
start pricing the stock.

65
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:26,230
So let's call P naught,
P subzero, today's price.

66
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,160
P subzero.

67
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,590
I'm not going to write right now but
I'll soon start writing.

68
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,250
What is P1?

69
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,360
P1 is the expected stock price next year.

70
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,430
What is P2?

71
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,210
Expected stock price two years from now,
and so on.

72
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,860
Okay, you can call them years,
months, whatever.

73
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,540
You typically will say a year, okay?

74
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,290
Assume that the expected dividend at
the end of the year is called D1.

75
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:58,510
Okay, many times you'll see in textbooks
it's called dividends, div, div cap 1.

76
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:03,239
So why am I calling expected stock price,
expected dividends?

77
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,970
Why in bold especially?

78
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,730
And the notion is very simple.

79
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,960
You do not know what these are.

80
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,440
So for example, if I asked you what is the
stock price of IBM one year from now and

81
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,550
you know it.

82
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,560
Well, good luck to you.

83
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,180
I mean you just don't even need
to take this class, all right.

84
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,400
That is the challenge you
know today's price, but

85
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,750
you have no clue about tomorrow's price.

86
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,780
In fact, there is a whole concept
of market efficiency which says

87
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,609
nobody should be able to predict it in a
good market, because the value of today's

88
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,164
price is based on everything
you know about the future.

89
00:04:42,245 --> 00:04:46,45
And so if you knew that tomorrow's
price was higher or lower,

90
00:04:46,45 --> 00:04:49,675
today's price would adjust accordingly and
you'll see that why.

91
00:04:49,675 --> 00:04:51,185
I think that's just awesome.

92
00:04:51,185 --> 00:04:53,155
It's called market efficiency.

93
00:04:53,155 --> 00:04:57,315
You can read, you can Google
something called Random Vock.

94
00:04:57,315 --> 00:04:59,965
It's a very famous concept.

95
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:03,659
It says that stock prices
move like randomly.

96
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,620
You cannot predict them.

97
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,400
Okay, so today's price be naught.

98
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,370
Tomorrow's expected price, P1 and many
times if you have e in parenthesis P1.

99
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,140
I'm not going to do that.

100
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,860
It just makes it messy.

101
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,330
Assume that the expected
dividend is called D1.

102
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,720
And here's the key.

103
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,810
Remember I told you,

104
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,810
you can't value something without
having a bench mark, a relative.

105
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,820
Even NPV is based on that.

106
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,280
And an idea of evaluation
is based on that, right?

107
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,919
So for a stock,
the dividends are the payment.

108
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,230
But how do you value a stock?

109
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:44,110
You will be clueless unless there's
a similar stock trading, and

110
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,550
you know its expected return.

111
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,190
Again I'm not calling it r.

112
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:53,880
I mean I use the symbol r, but it's
expected because nobody knows what it is.

113
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,110
Let's assume that the return on a similar
stock, similar risk stock, is r.

114
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,20
Because there's no point comparing
a high risk stock with a low risk stock.

115
00:06:03,20 --> 00:06:03,789
What will be true?

116
00:06:05,50 --> 00:06:07,850
We just saw, high risk stock
will have a high return, so

117
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:12,220
it's unfair to evaluate Kroger,
I mean sorry, I'm saying Kroger.

118
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,880
Turns out it's a store
that you go to in the U.S.

119
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,250
and where I live to buy grocery,
to buy food.

120
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,210
So, he fooled everybody by it,
so it's a low risk business.

121
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:29,210
You can't compare it to say jets or
flying in luxury airlines

122
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,789
which are a much higher rate of return
because they're riskier businesses, okay?

123
00:06:35,80 --> 00:06:40,310
Since a stock is very long lived,
what we are going to do now,

124
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,530
now that you know all the terminology.

125
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,109
You know P naught, P1, D1.

126
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,260
I'm going to go one period at a time.

127
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:53,570
So, I would mean by last
challenge you to do the following.

128
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:59,730
Try to tell me what the price today will
be given the information I've given you.

129
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,330
Given that I've told you tomorrow's
expected price is P1 and

130
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,20
tomorrow's expected dividend is D1.

131
00:07:06,20 --> 00:07:08,150
And a stock with a similar risk,

132
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,919
people can see in the stock
market on Yahoo Finance.

133
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:16,440
So suppose you want to start Moogle,
who looks like Google, right?

134
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,100
You figure out Google's rate of return.

135
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,000
Suppose that's called r.

136
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,10
Let's come back in a minute and
you tell me what that formula is for

137
00:07:26,10 --> 00:07:29,440
the price today given tomorrow's P1 and
D1.
