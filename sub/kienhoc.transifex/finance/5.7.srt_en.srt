1
00:00:05,413 --> 00:00:06,980
So welcome to some data.

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,980
As I said I could stay here forever, but

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,230
I want to quickly show you
some kind of statistics.

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,710
Go to Yahoo!, finance.yahoo.com.

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,760
You can go to your own home sites.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,990
I'll stay with the US one, so
that we're on the same page for everyone.

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,909
Because I can't go to yours,
I don't know where you are.

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,990
May the force be with you but
I don't know where you are.

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,870
So the first thing that jumps out at you
is the fact that stocks are talked about

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,669
all the time and
the chain as the graph is up there.

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,830
So right now I'm seeing
a S&P 500 Dow NASDAQ.

12
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,690
What is that S&P 500?

13
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,253
S&P 500 is a combination
of 500 stocks valuated.

14
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:50,590
Meaning that you're gonna combine things,
you could rate them equally.

15
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:55,70
But it S&P weights them
according to their equity value.

16
00:00:55,70 --> 00:00:59,30
So Microsoft,
Google will get more weight, right?

17
00:00:59,30 --> 00:01:00,130
Makes sense.

18
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,160
Then there's Dow.

19
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,289
And Dow is a bunch of 30 stocks.

20
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,573
And I'll show you some data
in module six more so.

21
00:01:07,573 --> 00:01:10,440
And it's around 17,565.

22
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,670
I look at it every day,
simply because it shows up.

23
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,20
But it's an indicator of what the largest
30 stocks as a portfolio are doing.

24
00:01:20,20 --> 00:01:25,530
And so, depending on where you invest it,
you look at various indices.

25
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,360
And portfolios are good to look at.

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,260
Because portfolios are what you [COUGH]
invest in if you're risk averse,

27
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,980
and I haven't seen anybody who's not.

28
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,929
NASDAQ is an exchange on which
many famous companies are traded,

29
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:43,90
and it's value right now is 5,098.51,
it's changing as we talk.

30
00:01:43,90 --> 00:01:45,280
So it's fascinating.

31
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,270
So you see collections of
stocks on the very first page.

32
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,630
But then there is a tab on
the left which says My Portfolio.

33
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,580
You can create your own and
you can track it.

34
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,29
Quotes you can do.

35
00:01:59,30 --> 00:02:02,640
I'll just press market data and
see where it takes me.

36
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,550
And it takes you again
to market performance.

37
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,770
But then it lists some companies,
Bank of America is there,

38
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,470
stock price is there, and so on, so forth.

39
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,290
So I will go to AAPL,
just to see what's going on.

40
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,850
And AAPL is one of the biggest companies,

41
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:26,60
one of the most known to
be innovative companies.

42
00:02:26,60 --> 00:02:30,770
So it is trading right now
at $118 per share, okay?

43
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:35,880
And you may obviously you'll be
looking at it at a different time,

44
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,790
and it'll be different.

45
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,120
But that's not the point.

46
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,470
The point is,
what kind of data is given here.

47
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,430
So the data I'll stay on is big picture.

48
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:50,860
So this previous closed,
that has been the market closed yesterday.

49
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,390
Then the open, meaning when the market
opened, what the price was.

50
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,89
The previous closed was 118.

51
00:02:56,90 --> 00:02:57,480
Now it's about 117.5.

52
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:04,359
Then the bid and ask are prices at which
you either buy or sell, from whom?

53
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,170
The broker who's willing
to make the market.

54
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,359
So the broker is saying I can sell you
at x and I'll buy from you at y and

55
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,60
so on so forth.

56
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,540
First year target estimate, 148.

57
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,760
This is some kind of an estimate.

58
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,640
The next number is very cool but
we haven't talked about it.

59
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,179
Remember I told you high risk high return?

60
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,110
What modern finance theory has
come up with the concept of beta.

61
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:35,80
And beta is that component of risk
that remains once you are diversified.

62
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,430
So think of Apple.

63
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,780
If you're only holding Apple by itself,
which you'll never do

64
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,660
because you're risk averse,
then the measure of risk is the variance.

65
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:49,230
How much it's bouncing around, and you can
see on the graph, roughly get a sense.

66
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,790
But if you put in a portfolio,
the measure of risk changes completely.

67
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,440
Because it's always in the context
of a larger portfolio.

68
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,829
And turns out that its risk is
about as much as the market,

69
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,880
because the market's risk is one.

70
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,660
This is beautiful measure, beta.

71
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,156
It's got a Nobel Prize, effectively.

72
00:04:06,157 --> 00:04:10,600
So it's about .9937 right now.

73
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,790
Now this number, by the way, is estimated.

74
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,700
So, unlike the other numbers, it could
vary depend on how you estimate it.

75
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,680
And typically you use a fair amount
of data, you do it pretty rigorously.

76
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,790
On Yahoo Finance it's probably two
years worth of data is used and

77
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,595
that's not sufficient but at least
the reports give you a sense of risk.

78
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:35,990
Days range is given in prices,
52 week range.

79
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,970
Volume, is number of shares traded.

80
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,470
Actually that number's
extremely interesting to me.

81
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,910
Is because I don't worry
when the stock price falls.

82
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,230
I get very worried when the volume
falls to zero, which has happened.

83
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,710
And there has been extreme price movement,
right?

84
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,530
So black Monday or a crash.

85
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,729
Why is that bothersome?

86
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,490
Because if trading is not happening
that means people don't have faith in

87
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,80
the market and
that in some sense is more bothersome.

88
00:05:02,80 --> 00:05:04,150
Prices keep going up and down.

89
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,200
This market cap, what does that mean?

90
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,740
Market cap means price
times number of shares.

91
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,840
So, it's a very simple.

92
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,674
And right now it's a big, big number.

93
00:05:13,675 --> 00:05:15,435
$658 billion.

94
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:18,460
[LAUGH] Lot of money.

95
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,599
Okay, PE ratio is price over earnings.

96
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,380
Now, we know both, we have talked about
earnings per share, we know price.

97
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,790
However, the number reported here is
affected by accounting ways of measuring

98
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,290
earnings, which as I said,
not the ways that we have talked about.

99
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:39,650
To understand more of that, you'll have to
do accounting, do more finance classes.

100
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,169
And then you have dividend,
how much dividend is being paid?

101
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,969
So this is interesting too.

102
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,546
We just talked about dividends.

103
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:54,99
And the dividend is $2.08 per share.

104
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,480
And a dividend yield is how
many dividend divided by price?

105
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,440
You see what I'm saying?

106
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,660
So it's trying to get a sense of
what the yield is, dividend yield.

107
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:09,570
And thus, such data is reported all
the time and available everywhere.

108
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,320
I will do one more thing and
then we'll stop.

109
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,90
You can press key Statistics,
which is on the left panel.

110
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,610
And I think I pressed it and
it's going to come up in a second.

111
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,340
What that report is even more
information about a company.

112
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:29,549
The balance sheet, all kinds of
financial ratios, all kinds of

113
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:35,830
mode information about volume, about price
movements over the past year and so on.

114
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,392
But most importantly, which is different,

115
00:06:38,392 --> 00:06:41,230
is it give you both
information about the business.

116
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,360
What are revenues?

117
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,710
What are profits?

118
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,969
They're listed.

119
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,690
But they also give you information
about the balance sheet.

120
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:53,660
And balance sheet has basically as you,
saw both the equity and the debt.

121
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,990
The one reality about debt is that
it doesn't trade as often as equity.

122
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:02,360
So the debt numbers you see on Yahoo
Finance are trying to measure the book

123
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,440
value of debt, which is equal to market
value only the day of the issue.

124
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,685
And after that market value changes,
with interest rates,

125
00:07:09,685 --> 00:07:13,760
with probability of default, whatever,
but the book value doesn't change, right?

126
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,200
So that's a little bit problematic.

127
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,748
On the other hand, market value,
very easy to figure out, right?

128
00:07:20,748 --> 00:07:25,210
It is price times number of shares.

129
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,169
And it is listed right up there.

130
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:34,280
Right now, 657.83,
it's changing, billion dollars.

131
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,669
I hope you enjoyed this section.

132
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,440
Stocks are one of my favorite
things ever created.

133
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,190
They reflect the beauty of finance,
the beauty of life, and

134
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,930
the beauty of trust in the future.

135
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,570
Growth is good if it creates
value on a net basis.

136
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:54,110
And it's important to study growth very
carefully, because it can be good or bad.

137
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,469
May the force be with you and
we will end this module.

138
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:03,50
And you can please start doing
assignments if you haven't already.

139
00:08:03,50 --> 00:08:06,10
Of course its up to you when you do them.

140
00:08:06,10 --> 00:08:10,950
And they allow you to take as much
time as you want the assignments do.

141
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,854
But doing them almost is
a necessity to learn.

142
00:08:14,855 --> 00:08:18,440
Any amount of number crunching or
problem solving I do,

143
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,640
will never teach you what you need to
learn, unless you do them yourselves.

144
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,462
See you next time.
