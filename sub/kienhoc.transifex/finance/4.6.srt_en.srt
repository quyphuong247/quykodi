Pay attention to the slide, I have written
the generic formula, but

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,290
with numbers in it.
I shouldn't call it generic,

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:16,350
with numbers in it of the pricing of a coupon
paying bond.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,070
Now if I were to make it zero coupon, what
would I do?

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,820
I just remove the PMT, that 3,000 make it
0.

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,369
What I'm going to do is something different.
I want you to understand the relationship

7
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:36,400
between the price of a bond and
the discount rate or the interest rate.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,850
This is not coupon, I'm talking about coupon
as in dollars,

9
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:45,940
I'm talking about the rate of return.
So if you stare up, it started off with an

10
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:58,010
interest rate of 4%.
What I would like you to do with me is change.

11
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:07,790
This interest rate from 1% to 8%.
What will this tell you?

12
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,590
It will show you the sensitivity of the price
of the bond

13
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:18,200
as you change the interest rate.
Before we even do that, this is one of the

14
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:24,530
ones you'll read over and
over in the press, if interest rates go up,

15
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:30,140
bond prices have to go down.
And, therefore, the relationship between interest

16
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,420
rates and
bond prices is one of the given of life are

17
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,560
inverse.
But more interesting is when you do this calculation,

18
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,799
so let's do it.
You do it on Excel, I'll write out the numbers,

19
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,439
and
hopefully all you're doing is changing this

20
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,649
number, making it 0.01, return.
0.02, return.

21
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:55,750
0.03, return.
You'll find something like this.

22
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:06,409
At 1%, you'll find a price
of 111,168.93.

23
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:13,269
At 2%, what will happen?
The price of the bond will drop.

24
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:22,910
105 627.54.
Okay, at 3%, what will you find?

25
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,800
This is very interesting.
Before even doing it, what should you find?

26
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:37,870
You should find face value, should be 100,000.
In other words, the bond should be selling

27
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:44,480
at par, that's the terminology.
Why, because think about it, if your coupon

28
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,060
rate is 3% and
your interest rate happens to be 3%, the denominator

29
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,170
and numerator
with compounding kinda cancel each other out

30
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:58,190
and you're left with just face value.
It's very intuitive.

31
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:05,989
At 4%, how much?
It'll be 94,712.

32
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:18,370
Sorry, 742.24.
Or actually, back up.

33
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,640
712.33.
I jumped ahead to 5%.

34
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:33,989
So, last one to reconnect with you is 94,712.33.
Please keep doing these,

35
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:37,200
what it will do is it will give you a familiarity
with doing present value.

36
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,590
But also what you'll see is,
I challenge you to now figure out why did

37
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,439
I make you do it?
And I made you do it because if you look at

38
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:54,700
the relationship between price and
interest rates, I'm going to draw this,

39
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:01,970
you'll find a downward sloping but what is
called a convex curve.

40
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:06,750
It's not straight.
So the percentage change is happening.

41
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,269
Right?
Or different.

42
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:18,470
If it were a straight line, a change
in interest rate would lead to the same percentage

43
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,330
change in price.
But that's not the case.

44
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:29,410
So what you'll find is, it's called convexity.
You have a downward sloping curve, but

45
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,540
the change in price is relative to change
in

46
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:44,700
1% interest rate, as where this is P and
this is R as marked straight line, right.

47
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,910
It's not the same, okay.
Enjoy this, and this is also something that

48
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:54,000
you'll read and depress all the time.
And you'll be able to figure out why is it

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,610
that a longer term barn
versus a shorter term barn behaves differently

50
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:04,340
and so on and so forth.
So, we'll take a little break here.

51
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,570
Think about this.
We'll come back and talk some more.
