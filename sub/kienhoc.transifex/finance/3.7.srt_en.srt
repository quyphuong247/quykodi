00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:10,890
https://youtu.be/LP1mByqT4Ls
Welcome back, this is mega problem or
mega application number four.

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:20,560
And the reason I want to do this one is to
show you how you can do things smarter.

3
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,460
And, I hope you enjoy this one.

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,940
It looks simple, but

5
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,540
can get very complicated if you
start worrying about how to do it.

6
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,420
You can do it in a very simple way or
a very complicated way.

7
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,330
And by the way all the problems I'm
using now, should help you with

8
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:43,210
solving the assignments, because
the assignments can get tricky, and

9
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,825
if you work through these, it will
really help you do the assignments.

10
00:00:46,825 --> 00:00:47,610
Okay?

11
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,897
So let's get started,
please stare at the screen.

12
00:00:49,898 --> 00:00:56,840
You've invested $75,000 in a trust fund
at 7.5% for your child's education.

13
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,630
Your child will draw $12,000
per year from this fund for

14
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,940
four years starting at
the end of year seven.

15
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,539
What will be the amount that
will be left over in this fund

16
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,900
at end of year ten, after the child
has withdrawn the fourth time?

17
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,610
This sounds similar to the first problem,
I'm taking away a little bit of

18
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:27,30
the complexity to show you a way of going
quickly in solving problems, right?

19
00:01:27,30 --> 00:01:33,250
So the complexity I've removed is that
tuition is not changing with inflation,

20
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,460
but what I've thrown in is, I'm
asking you a question where,

21
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,449
your trust fund will have some
money left after ten years.

22
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,460
Rather than taking a loan and
paying it all off, right?

23
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,900
Let's see,
whether you have money left, or not.

24
00:01:49,50 --> 00:01:51,820
So let's draw the timeline as always.

25
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,378
So how many points in time?

26
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:57,408
You start off with zero and then ten more.

27
00:02:01,923 --> 00:02:03,750
What do we know?

28
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,590
And let's place that on the board.

29
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,800
We know you have $75,000 at this point,
plus.

30
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,70
However, we know starting in year seven

31
00:02:16,70 --> 00:02:20,200
in some senses we did a more
complex problem first, right?

32
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,200
Because of the complexity of inflation.

33
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,160
You start withdrawing 12k.

34
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:33,961
Yeah?

35
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,820
So the question is, this.

36
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,890
How much is left at the end of 10 years?

37
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,279
Now you can do a very simple
way of thinking about it.

38
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,885
And the simple way is, ignore
all Time Value on Money and

39
00:02:49,885 --> 00:02:52,595
make me feel very sad about it.

40
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:57,765
But remember, the interest Time Value of Money is 7.5%,
so ignoring it is much more

41
00:02:57,765 --> 00:03:03,964
drastic than if it was close to 0% which
is basically no Time Value of Money.

42
00:03:03,965 --> 00:03:08,533
So the simplistic way of saying
this would be, I have 75 and

43
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:13,640
then let's subtract 12,000
four times which is about 48,

44
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,70
yeah? 12 times 4 is 48.

45
00:03:16,70 --> 00:03:18,560
So you're left with what?

46
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,970
75 minus 48,000 is $27,000.

47
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,890
That's the very simplistic naive way,
but let's do it smarter way.

48
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:32,700
Many people start doing it one step at a
time, so they'll take this to year seven,

49
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,690
then take this to year eight,
and start subtracting.

50
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:40,810
We did something like that to show you
the confirmation of the result, right?

51
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:45,460
Let's do it in a way that's pretty simple.

52
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,860
Break up the problem into two pieces.

53
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:53,590
And the two pieces is, don't mix
the value of the trust fund

54
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,160
with the payments being made annually,
starting in year seven, right?

55
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,770
Even if they will be made starting
in year one, it would be complex.

56
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,610
Do what?

57
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,370
Separate the negatives from the positive.

58
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,330
Let's break it up into two pieces.

59
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,60
The positive piece,

60
00:04:13,60 --> 00:04:18,860
which I'll call positive is 75K
carried forward how many years?

61
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,890
Ten years, can you do this?

62
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,789
Answer is yes,
it's a Future Value problem.

63
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,888
What is the interest rate?

64
00:04:26,888 --> 00:04:30,138
0.075.

65
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:32,210
What is n?

66
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,440
10.

67
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,430
What is PMT?

68
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,433
Zero.

69
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:38,647
What is PV?

70
00:04:38,648 --> 00:04:41,88
75,000.

71
00:04:41,88 --> 00:04:44,570
And how much does this work out to be?

72
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:50,710
If my numbers are right, press Enter.

73
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,866
You get 154,577.37.

74
00:04:53,866 --> 00:04:58,30
This is the amount of money you will have.

75
00:04:58,30 --> 00:05:01,140
Now clearly, more than double and

76
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:05,419
the reason is quite simple,
actually there are two reasons.

77
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:11,400
One is the interest rate is high, the
second is that ten is not a small number, it's....

78
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:17,10
Ten years is a fairly long time for
the money to work, right?

79
00:05:17,10 --> 00:05:20,920
Now this one, then do the negative,
what is the negative?

80
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,30
Negative is draw the timeline.

81
00:05:25,30 --> 00:05:26,969
Negative first one is 12 k.

82
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,200
Second one is time period 12 k,

83
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:37,219
12 k, negative 12 k.

84
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,520
Okay?

85
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,930
So what are you seeing over here is,

86
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,230
if you mix the two it might
become very very complex.

87
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,510
Right you can do that for fun.

88
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,440
Like I did it earlier to see how
you can confirm your results.

89
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,530
And we'll do a little bit of that here.

90
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,469
But this is pretty straight forward.

91
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,885
Do the Future Value of what?

92
00:06:01,885 --> 00:06:07,243
It's not a one time,
it's a annuity.

93
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:11,375
So, what is the interest rate?

94
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:15,870
0.075, and remember I'm gonna
press in a positive number, but

95
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,804
I know it's negative
that I'm paying right?

96
00:06:18,804 --> 00:06:22,159
So 0.075, what is n?

97
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,170
N is four.

98
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:27,10
Remember I'm doing Future Value
because I want to be in time 10.

99
00:06:27,10 --> 00:06:29,140
N is four.

100
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,800
PMT is how much?

101
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,220
Now, here you can press the negative 12,000 but

102
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,770
I'm not going to as I said, worry about it.

103
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,370
And why did I close the parenthesis?

104
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,850
Because there's nothing else.

105
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,610
Right?

106
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,610
There's nothing else.

107
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:49,790
You can make it more interesting but
I won't right now.

108
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,653
And it turns out to be

109
00:06:53,653 --> 00:06:59,350
$53,675.06.

110
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,60
So you now know the two pieces.

111
00:07:01,60 --> 00:07:04,840
One piece is 154,577.37.The
other piece is negative and

112
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,349
now I'll make it negative
because I know I am paying.

113
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:20,26
So what is the net fund balance?

114
00:07:20,26 --> 00:07:25,350
In which year? Year ten.

115
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,80
It turns out to be take
154,577.37 subtract 53,675.06 and

116
00:07:30,80 --> 00:07:34,680
And, I think the answer

117
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,790
will work out to be $100,000.

118
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,480
902.

119
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:48,390
I'm a bozo, I keep laughing at myself.

120
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,80
And 30 cents.

121
00:07:49,80 --> 00:07:51,140
So how much will you have?

122
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:55,849
You'll have $100,000, almost $101,000,
even after you've paid off 12K four times.

123
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:00,640
And this shows you
the power of compounding.

124
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,900
Because you had a reasonable
amount of money.

125
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,50
Stick with me for a minute,
and we'll be done for today.

126
00:08:07,50 --> 00:08:08,660
Do this for me.

127
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,110
Now let's confirm that
this is indeed true.

128
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,280
So do this for me, and I'll be thrilled.

129
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:21,290
Let's start and
do it the more complicated way.

130
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:28,700
Let's start with $75,000 and carry it
forward to which year? Year seven.

131
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,80
Can you do that?

132
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:36,799
Let's call that x7.

133
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,569
Then from that, what will you subtract?

134
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,250
12K.

135
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,270
You're left with, net x7.

136
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,220
Don't you like that?

137
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:51,820
Net x7.

138
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,849
Then what will you do in year eight?

139
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,930
You will carry this forward, at 7.5%.

140
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,319
To get y7, which is

141
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:11,310
the amount in your bank or your trust fund

142
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:17,609
after you have paid off the first 12k and
you are left with whatever remains.

143
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,000
Then subtract what?

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,15
Another 12k.

145
00:09:20,15 --> 00:09:25,766
Keep going, and in year 10,
what should we have here?

146
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:27,99
Approximately 101K.

147
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:34,410
And I'm saying approximately,
because it's slightly less than that.

148
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,969
Please do this, and
the force will be with you.

149
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,790
We have done a lot of problems and
I have done them purposely.

150
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,770
Even with my bad handwriting and
not going to Excel on purpose, so

151
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,480
that you understand
the logic of timelines.

152
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,90
But remember,
go to Excel especially if what's true.

153
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,100
You know that your cash flows
are changing over time.

154
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,900
You know you have to use functions
different than PMT, PV, and so

155
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,670
on, for which there are simple formulas.

156
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,740
So when will that happen?

157
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,570
When the cash flows
are changing in nature.

158
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,10
So for example, the growth intuition,
if this were happening now.

159
00:10:15,10 --> 00:10:16,600
Try this out.

160
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,460
Assuming that the 12K is
increasing over time.

161
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:25,450
It's 12K today and
it'll increase at say, 3% a year.

162
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,500
You'll go back to the first
application and you can redo it all.

163
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,620
May the force be with you.

164
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,679
And next time, next module, what we'll do is,

165
00:10:36,20 --> 00:10:40,630
a real world application of this,
and it would be called bonds.

166
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,380
But don't worry about the name.

167
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,689
Bonds basically is a very
sophisticated name for loans.

168
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,336
And there are all kinds of loans,

169
00:10:48,336 --> 00:10:52,710
loans taken by governments,
