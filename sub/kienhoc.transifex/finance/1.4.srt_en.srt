So, we introduced you

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,609
to the

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:12,280
Future Value concept with a very simple problem. So, let me keep the problem

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,430
simple, in one dimension.

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:20,870
And that is, we'll give you a thousand bucks
today like plan A, but we´ll make it little

6
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,900
more complex and you´ll see how quickly
Finance becomes just fascinating.

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:32,870
So let's say, that we want to know what is
the value of $1,000 two years from now.

8
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,849
Remember, we first started with one
period, so let's draw a timeline. So what

9
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,559
I'm going to do is, I'm going to go very
slowly because, as I said I don't want

10
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:48,899
you to feel like you are, you're being short
changed on the basics, which are

11
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:55,680
extremely important. So where am I giving
you 1000 bucks. And what do you do

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,870
with it? I'm giving you a thousand bucks. You put it in
the bank and what is the interest rate,

13
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,340
a very healthy 10 percent. You ain't going to get anything like that these days, but let's

14
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:13,220
assume for simplicity. Now, I'm asking you:
How much will this be at which Future

15
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:18,990
Value? Time 2. So, two years have passed,
and this will make the problem very, very

16
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:26,470
interesting, and introduce you to the
concept of compounding. Ok, so thousand

17
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:33,250
dollars, two periods from now. Now, think about it. What will happen to your bank account,

18
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:41,860
imagine it's sitting in the bank, after one year? How
much will you have over and above the 1000?

19
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:49,369
Do you agree you´ll get 100 bucks? Why?
Because think of the 1000 working as...

20
00:01:49,369 --> 00:02:00,270
for you. You know? And the rate of
return is 10%. So, this is R times P. So you

21
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:07,179
get how many 1 R times P? And P is conveniently, how much? 1000 bucks. Right? But then, what

22
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:15,250
will happen period two? You'll also get another
100 bucks, which is another R times P.

23
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,470
Right?

24
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:24,640
So remember R is always per period. I think I
try to make this very clear. P is at a

25
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,750
point in time, but R is per period and
that's the way it's quoted in the Financial

26
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:39,570
press and everywhere. So, you now have at
least 1,200 Future Value. Is at least

27
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:52,570
$1,200. Yeah! 1000 plus 100 plus 100. But if
this were the case, it would be called

28
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:57,70
Simple Interest, and that's almost
unheard of.

29
00:02:57,70 --> 00:03:02,200
So, the question you all have to ask yourself:
what does this poor guy do? Why is he not

30
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:08,170
getting interest? The only problem is he
or she cannot get interest for 2 periods. But now,

31
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:15,850
your bank account has gone from 1000 to 1100
So, this hundred guy also needs to get

32
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:24,340
interest, but over which period? One
period. And how much is that money? Because,

33
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:31,670
100 at 10%, you get 10 bucks. So, the

34
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:44,160
amount becomes 1210. So basically, if you
look at this, it looks like 10 bucks. Ah, who cares? But,

35
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,470
you'll see as N, which is the number of
periods, becomes more and more and more,

36
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,400
the amount you're getting every year
just because of the interest that year is

37
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,860
fixed at hundred hundred hundred. But,
what's happening?

38
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:03,870
Compounding is going and the whole process
generates a lot more money than you

39
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:10,420
had visualized. And it, it becomes dynamic. So,
let me just formalize this very quickly,

40
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:18,940
and write up the formula. So the Future
Value formula, will become the Future

41
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:26,340
Value over two periods will become P

42
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:36,698
times 1 plus R. After how many
periods? After one period times 1 plus

43
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:42,260
R again. And this becomes P times

44
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:52,90
1 plus R, whole square. Let me spend a minute on this.
So, you started off at time zero, and it

45
00:04:52,90 --> 00:04:59,229
will give you another way to think about it,
with a thousand bucks. After one year,

46
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:13,740
how much is it? P times 1 plus R, Right?
And, that is 1100 bucks. But then, if you're

47
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,940
sitting in the bank, what will happen? You
now have more money than you invested

48
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,460
because, money earns money. So, you have

49
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:27,380
1100, but it needs to be carried forward for
one period till period two, so what

50
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:33,760
will you do to it? Multiple it, again, by
1 plus R. So, that's why the formula

51
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:45,229
becomes P times 1 plus R whole
square. Right? So suppose, I write it out in

52
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:52,330
terms of numbers it'll $1000 times 1.1

53
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:59,810
whole square, and it's the squaring not the adding, that's key here.
 So, how much will it become

54
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:09,639
if this becomes N, N periods. Meaning,
not two but N. What will change? It's quite

55
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,520
simple, but dramatic in its impact. So,
let me first introduce the concept and

56
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,370
then, do some examples. Let's do it in reverse
because then, you can go back and forth

57
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:27,340
and think about it. This number changes
from two to N, but remember its raised to the

58
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:32,880
power. So, when we come back, what I'm
going to do is I'm going to do

59
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,10
examples which will kind of blow you away
a little bit. And when Einstein saw this

60
00:06:39,10 --> 00:06:46,409
Einstein kinda said, "Wow! Compounding is
unbelievably powerful." And, I joke about

61
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:51,240
it in class because Einstein stopped
at square, right? He said, E equals MC

62
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,950
square. So, the silly joke, which I again repeat
often and laugh every time, myself.

63
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:02,719
Nobody else laughs with me, is that he didn't go
beyond 2. So, that's why it's so fascinating.

64
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:08,659
Take a little break. Think about it. Think
about what I've just said, and we'll come

65
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:09,159
back.
