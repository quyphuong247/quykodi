An application: remember very, very
similar to real world problems but here

2
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:20,360
we are thinking Present Value applications not Future Value. So, in this application, you

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,680
are starting college, how much money do
you need in the bank today so that you

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,950
can spend 3000 bucks every
year for the next four years? This

5
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:37,000
probably is something if your tuition is being paid by your parents or you

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,710
have worked, you need to worry about
having this money in place, right? And

7
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,370
this is over and above the tuition, so
what you're doing is you're figuring out

8
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:51,59
you want to be able to spend some money
every year, 3000 on things that you need

9
00:00:51,60 --> 00:00:57,410
other than tuition and boarding, and
suppose the interest rate in the bank is 5%.

10
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:01,898
So the question asking you is,
how much money do you need in the bank

11
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:08,729
today, so that you can spend 3000 every
year? As always, if you´re... the beauty of online is

12
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:14,140
you can just pause right now and
do the problem yourself. You don't need

13
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,630
to listen to me, in fact I would
encourage you to do that but I'm taking and

14
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:24,979
making shot clips and when the problems
are easy, I'm just doing...going ahead and

15
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:30,299
doing them. In more complicated problems,
we will have longer videos but I also

16
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,810
will try hard to stop, but at the same
time, remember, the beauty of this class

17
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:40,659
is not necessarily the videos, but the
assignments and they have been created

18
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:45,820
very carefully, so that they match the
real world and help you learn. So let's

19
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:57,619
draw a timeline here and I encourage you
to use Excel. So timeline, 0, how many years?

20
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:01,810
1...4

21
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:08,789
and you can spend 3000 every year for
the next four years, so

22
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:23,991
Put 3000. So let's think. Do we have all the ingredients here? We are not going here.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,660
It's saying how much do we need in the bank
now and now equates to PV

24
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:40,359
So we need to figure out PV. What are the ingredients of PV? Remember in PV function, you will say

25
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:47,440
equals PV. Do this with me on the
Excel, I think that's a good thing, I'm

26
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,170
doing Excel but without going to it, okay?

27
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,660
So PV, the first number is rate. So look in
the problem, what is the rate? Remember

28
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:02,859
don´t write 5%, write 0.05. What's the
other number Excel is looking for? How

29
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:13,570
many years and you found that they were,  you´re thinking 4, right? Who determines
this four? You do, right? You

30
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,858
almost determine everything and by the way
you have very little control of the

31
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:21,239
5% anyways, so you just take what you
get.

32
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,250
So...so what's amazing about most problems
in life is, you're far more in control than

33
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,269
you think you are, right? And things that
you can't control, don't worry about them.

34
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:40,590
Four right? And the next good news is the
natural next button in Excel is PMT

35
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:47,530
unlike when we were doing a FV. So PMT is how much? 3000.

36
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:52,830
So let's pause before that and see what
kind of number should we get, if there was no

37
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:58,900
Time Value of Money, you would get what? You are putting 3000 bucks

38
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,890
four times, you´ll get 12000. Now,
just think about it, before you press

39
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,880
return, do you want a number to show up that makes sense?

40
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:14,590
Answer is yes. Will it be greater than or less
than 12000? The answer is, because you are discounting

41
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,899
and because of compounding and because
Time Value of Money is not zero

42
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:26,49
you'll get a number less that 12,000 and I
think it turns out to be 10,637.

43
00:04:26,50 --> 00:04:33,40
So I'll write it out here, you see the design I can do

44
00:04:33,40 --> 00:04:46,350
Who said I can't write well? I guess, I did 637.64. Now again, if these numbers are

45
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:52,300
positive, this will show up negative, if
these numbers are negative, this will show up positive.

46
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,930
So you are in control of that, I'm just
doing how do you get to the numbers.

47
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:03,140
Now if you're saving...spending these in the
future you need them, right? So you need

48
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:03,979
to put away

49
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:09,830
$10,637 in the bank today and it will
finance it. When we go to real-world

50
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:17,680
problems, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to spend a lot... Real world problems meaning more complicated, this is real world too.

51
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,669
I will actually make you double check all your answers to make sure that you know you're getting

52
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:27,849
it and the way you double check is, you make
sure that you actually when you spent 3000

53
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:33,440
four times, how much will you have in the
bank at the end? If we start off at 10,637?

54
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,690
If you think about it, you´ll have zero and you can show it period by period.
