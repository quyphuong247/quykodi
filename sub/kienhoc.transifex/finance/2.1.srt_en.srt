We just

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:11,120
finished the power of discounting, we had
done power of compounding, power of

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:18,299
discounting and you found, how impactful the
passage of time is, right? So we got

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,630
something like 87 million
dollars. And I remind you that negative,

5
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,738
positive sign of Excel depends on whether
you are getting money or losing money, so

6
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:34,850
87 million at 5% and about less
than a million and nine hundred thousand or so,

7
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:42,90
if the interest rate is 15 percent, obviously
inverse of the Future Value, right? Now let us

8
00:00:42,90 --> 00:00:50,170
go into what I would call as more
realistic applications. We will go in a

9
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,850
stepwise manner. I will not include
everything that will confuse you in a

10
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:01,90
problem, but we´ll go stepwise but the
interesting thing is, even though I'm

11
00:01:01,90 --> 00:01:07,659
going stepwise, the power of each concept
I'm telling you is so remarkable,

12
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:13,999
that you can apply even the simplest of
applications in many contexts, right? So

13
00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:20,609
let's start off with the one thing which we
assumed till now, is not going to happen.

14
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:28,810
So we drew a timeline and remember in
the timeline, we did go from period one,

15
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:35,909
we went up to N, but the assumption we made till now was, either something was

16
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,619
happening here at time zero or something
was happening here, in other words we had

17
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:47,49
one-time payments, either today or in the
future. What I'm going to introduce now

18
00:01:47,49 --> 00:01:52,749
is the notion of multiple payments,
because most problems in life or most

19
00:01:52,749 --> 00:01:59,79
issues or most concepts or most
applications involve multiple payments,

20
00:01:59,79 --> 00:02:04,630
right? So we'll start off, as I said, in a
very structured way, with something called an

21
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:13,640
annuity. An annuity is some payment that you
get, we´ll call it cash flow, C which is

22
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,380
fixed in quantity typically and lasts for

23
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:22,930
N periods. So, here what's going on is,
instead of getting say, or paying

24
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,420
100 bucks once, you're doing it
multiple times and you'll see

25
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,829
applications of it as I do them, but
first, since you know Present Value and

26
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,130
Future Value now, let's just think about
it conceptually. So I'll go back and

27
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,480
forth between applications and concepts.
Once you know some concept, I'm going to

28
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,220
go to the concept next time and then
application and so on. So multiple payments,

29
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:51,410
let's talk about the concept a little bit. We´ll call
the payments C but on a... now this is related

30
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:56,140
to the Excel, in Excel, they don't call it
cash flows, right? They call it

31
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,380
PMT and it is a cash flow and it´s called
payment because, it's like a payment

32
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,990
every period and you'll see where all of
this is coming from. It´s coming from

33
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,190
basically, the structure of a loan.

34
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:15,700
Ok, so if you stare at the graph on top, what I
want to do is, as I said, conceptually lay

35
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:22,200
out what's going on. So the cash flow in
a typical annuity and here convention is

36
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,250
very important,

37
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,710
doesn't start at time zero and the
assumption is, the first cash flow is

38
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,910
occurring at the end of the first period,
now the period could be one year long, six

39
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,650
months long, whatever, depends on the
problem. So what we're going to do is,

40
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:47,100
we're going to have a simple annuity
which lasts N=3, which is

41
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,239
important because you want to know how
many periods and in each period you're

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,580
getting a PMT

43
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:02,30
of C. C will be a number in our problems obviously, right? And I would like again to

44
00:04:02,30 --> 00:04:05,620
start off with the concept of Future
Value because Future Value is quite

45
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,880
interesting, so in order to figure out
Future Value, now you have to

46
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:15,310
conceptually think of it this way.
How many years left from period 0 to the

47
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:22,200
future? Years left, 3

48
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:28,590
How many years left from the period 1 to
the future? Now the future remember, is

49
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,869
ending at time 3 and period one, whenever we say a period, we mean end of

50
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,920
the period. This causes a lot of anxiety among
people, that's why drawing timelines is

51
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:47,950
important. This is 1 and this is 0. What
this gives you a sense is, another way of

52
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:53,690
writing the timeline and I'm going to be a
little bit painfully slow here, because

53
00:04:53,690 --> 00:05:00,800
we are assuming we have beginners, not used
to doing this. So the C, C, C, this is

54
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,140
how it's working, right? So how many
periods from 0 to this, 3, how many

55
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:17,620
period from 1 to 3? 2. 2 to 3, 1. At 3, 0. So
that's the structure presumed about an annuity, of course

56
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,620
you can change that structure
depending on the nature of the problem,

57
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:26,930
but you can go very far with this kind of
structure, even though it's pretty... So

58
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,840
let's see what the Future Value will
look like and we'll do it slowly and

59
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,570
then we'll take a break and come back to
applications. This Future Value will be

60
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:42,219
0 and the reason is, at time 0
nothing's happening, in a standard

61
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:48,170
annuity. What is the Future Value of
the cash flow you are getting at time 1?

62
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:55,860
Remember time 1 means what? At this
time, at the end of the first year. It´ll be to C

63
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:10,240
times 1+R, how many? Squared, remember?
And the key is, this number, because you're

64
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,800
going...

65
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:19,500
carrying this C forward two periods. How much
are we carrying this C? One period, C(1+R)

66
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,510
and how much are you

67
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:28,840
carrying this last C? No amount, just C itself. So when you are doing a Future Value of an

68
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:34,570
annuity, you are essentially carrying forward
cash flows now, but the last one is in

69
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:40,530
period 3 and therefore it doesn't need to be
carried forward, much. So this gives you a

70
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:55,690
sense of the concept and the formula,
Future Value of an annuity becomes C

71
00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:08,390
1+R square plus C(1+R) plus C. Again, this is the one at the end of

72
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,659
the first period, Future Value of the one at
the end of the second period and finally

73
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:32,20
Future Value of the third one is in period 3. Notice that
you can take C,

74
00:07:32,20 --> 00:07:42,90
you can re-write this and this is the formula of an annuity and in the text books, what you'll find is, at
the back, this number is calculated and it's

75
00:07:42,90 --> 00:07:55,508
called Future Value Annuity Factor and it´s a
function of two things, R and N, number of

76
00:07:55,509 --> 00:08:03,680
periods. So, not surprisingly again, R
matters because it's Time Value of Money,

77
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,889
but time matters too and it´s 3 years. The
key difference between just simple

78
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:16,289
Future Value is that, you get payment
once today and you carried it forward or a

79
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:18,949
cash-flow once, here it's happening

80
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:19,449
three times.
