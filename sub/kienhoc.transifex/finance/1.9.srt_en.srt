Welcome back, we have talked about Future Value,

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,769
we have seen the power of compounding,

3
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:16,789
and, I would like to now

4
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:22,960
talk about Present Value, but we'll keep
one thing still simple, which is, we´ll have a

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,419
one-time payment or a one-time amount of
money at a point in time. So in the

6
00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:36,79
previous examples, we had Future Values
of what? A thousand dollars or whatever the money is, at

7
00:00:36,79 --> 00:00:41,129
point zero at different points in time
in the future, so we increased N from

8
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:42,690
one and so on.

9
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,59
Now what we are going to do is, we're going to do
the reverse of it and Present Value is

10
00:00:47,59 --> 00:00:50,830
more difficult to understand, but not if
you understand Future Value. So many

11
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,680
textbooks introduce Present Value first,
which I find little bit counterintuitive

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,299
and tough for people to understand,
especially with compounding, so let's do

13
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:03,939
Present Value. So the question I ask is
the following, and it's up on the screen

14
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:10,610
for you. What is the Present Value of
receiving $1100 one year from now? So

15
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:17,310
let's again, make sure we understand the
timing of it and draw the timeline. So you

16
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:25,909
are standing here, our question is, asking
what is PV? But I'm giving you money

17
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:31,110
in the future and for the beginning, time
being, we will keep the period only one year.

18
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:43,530
So I'm giving you 1100, right? So, can you
guess? Given what we've just done? Turns out,

19
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,750
that the Present Value is, think of it as
the reverse of Future Value. So, if somebody

20
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,740
gave me 1100 in the future,

21
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,820
will it be worth less or more today? Remember Future
Value increases, Present Value has to be

22
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:07,809
less, so what will you do? You´ll do 1100 and
you will do something called discounting,

23
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,319
and the word discounting is everywhere in
Finance and the reason is, we make

24
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,810
decisions today and calculate Present
Values of our actions, but our actions

25
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:23,159
affect the future, so we'll try to bring
this 1100 back today, because that's when

26
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:25,880
you make decisions and it´s good to think in
Present Value

27
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,930
terms, nothing wrong in thinking in the
future, but what's the point, if you´re

28
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:38,540
making the decision today? Turns out, what will you do?
You´ll divide this by 1+R and it'll

29
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:47,950
become $1000, so let me explain why do you divide,
because the good news is, you´ve

30
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,600
already know Future Value, that's why I
like Future Value a little bit better, in

31
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,400
terms of a beginning tool to understand and it
makes sense, you can relate to it and

32
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,460
easier to do, dividing is more
difficult than multiplying, though with

33
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:08,610
compounding we saw, we needed Excel as soon as
we went beyond one year essentially, ok? So

34
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:14,350
think about it, why do you have 1000. One way to think about it
is, suppose I put a thousand bucks here,

35
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:22,910
the Present Value. To check that my
answer is right, what do I need to do? To

36
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:27,240
calculate its Future Value, take its
Future Value to the future, how much will you

37
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:43,140
get? You´ll get 1100, which is equal to what? PV
times 1+R, Yeah?

38
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:55,109
We sometimes call PV P2, right? So what does FV become?
so FV is PV times 1+R, so

39
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:09,130
think about it. What is PV? PV is FV divided by is 1+R, and I kinda cheated and did the calculation right here.

40
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:17,79
So the reason it's difficult as you know,
dividing by R, 1+R and you dividing

41
00:04:17,79 --> 00:04:21,250
by 1+R and this is a simple
scenario and the reason you're dividing

42
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,150
1+R is because, you get the
original amount in the future

43
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:31,760
plus an interest rate, ok? So let's just keep
going a little bit and talk a little bit

44
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:38,360
about the Present Value concept which you
already have. So PV concept is, you

45
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:48,560
take something in the Future Value and
you try to bring it back, right? And the

46
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:57,740
way you do it is, you divide it by a number
greater than 1. R, we´ll assume

47
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,440
throughout this course, is typically
greater than 1, so what happens to the

48
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,400
Future Value when you divide it by a number
greater than 1? It becomes discounted, it

49
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:13,780
becomes less than the Future Value. One
more time, let's write out the formula, Okay?

50
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:24,390
So the PV formula is equal to FV
over 1+R, sometimes

51
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:30,190
I write lower case, sometimes I write caps,
don't worry about it, you know what I'm

52
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:44,370
talking about. So in our example it was 1100 divided by 1.10, and it was a 1000 bucks, Okay? Let´s take

53
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,250
a break. We want to nail Present Value, we´ve nailed Future Value, at least for one payment,

54
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,870
and then we'll come back and do more
interesting stuff.
