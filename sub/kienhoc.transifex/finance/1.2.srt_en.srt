So what I'm going to do now is,

2
00:00:06,70 --> 00:00:10,770
as I promised use examples to show
you why that insight, that a dollar

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:17,20
today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow
works and we´ll use the terminology we just

4
00:00:17,20 --> 00:00:22,859
introduced FV, PV, and so on, so let's do an example, and please stare at the screen and

5
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:29,359
I'm using PowerPoint, make your notes. This
is very simple but let's do it together.

6
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:36,230
Suppose a bank pays a 10% interest rate
per year and you are given a choice of

7
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:42,269
two plans: the first plan is I give you
$1000 today. The second plan is I'll

8
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:50,570
give you $1000 one year from now. Okay? So remember what the two choices are: A is I

9
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:56,859
give you 1000 at point zero, B is
what? I give you 1000 one year

10
00:00:56,859 --> 00:01:03,430
from now at point 1. Let me again, I know I'm going to be painfully slow about

11
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:12,130
this, so, the question is, which one would you prefer? And in our example, let's draw the timeline.

12
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:33,350
A is 0, 1, A is 1000 here. B is where? If you draw the timeline for B

13
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,980
For B, you're getting a thousand dollars here,

14
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:47,210
so it's a very simple example but it is
really powerful. Why? Because most people

15
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,529
say a thousand versus thousand who cares?

16
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:55,829
The point is, the key thing, difference
between them is, and I say this often in class

17
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:03,210
never forget the passage of time, because the... because time has passed and we have

18
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,960
assumed what, the interest rate is
positive, that the Time Value of Money is

19
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,840
positive because typically that's what
we see in the real world, again,

20
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,160
complex issue, more complex than most people believe, but let's assume that's

21
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:24,280
the case. Turns out, that you will
prefer plan A or B? Think about it and

22
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,100
we'll do it together, but I'm going to do
it using the concept of Future Value, you

23
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,239
can do it using Future Value or you can
do it Present Value, and we'll do it

24
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:39,390
Future Value. So, think about it, as I said
you can pause right now but because it's

25
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,230
so simple, I´m going to keep going.

26
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:47,988
So what was the interest rate? 10% and what was the comparison between A and B? The

27
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:54,850
key difference was the timing. So, again, let's see what happens to make them comparable,

28
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,358
I'm going to carry this to the future

29
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:05,100
remember Future Value is here, Present
Value is here, so I could either do

30
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,120
Present Value comparables or do Future Value comparable? I think Future Values are actually

31
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,410
easier to think about because you're
thinking about real-world investment,

32
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:19,150
right? So how much will this become?
People say it will become 1000

33
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:27,980
dollars, plus you'll get something in
addition to that, which will depend on

34
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,988
what? Two things,  how much time has passed which is one period and how much

35
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:37,970
interest rate are you making? Our interest rate was 10 percent, I'm using round numbers

36
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,810
so that we are easy to talk about, right? In real life, the numbers will change, but

37
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,50
the concept won't. So what is 10%

38
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,100
of 1000?

39
00:03:52,660 --> 00:04:03,180
It turns out to be 100 bucks, so the total of plan A is 1100 which is greater than

40
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:09,460
plan B thank, look at my sign, greater than sign, I'm writing sideways, so which one

41
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:14,150
will you prefer? You´ll prefer A, using the
concept of Future Value.

42
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,350
Let's take a little break, think about it,
it's very simple, but I'll do this, I'll

43
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,30
take breaks and we'll come back and
formalize this concept.
