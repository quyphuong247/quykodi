1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,850
Hey Vsauce, Michael here.

2
00:00:05,108 --> 00:00:09,320
I'm sorry. Look, I didn't name myself but
apparently

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,888
Michael is the ninth most disliked baby name

4
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,108
for a boy - 

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,339
according to a survey by BabyNameWizard.com

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,439
At least it didn't top the charts like the rhyming

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,359
 a 'den' names - Jayden, Brayden, Aiden.

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,259
The most disliked

9
00:00:28,268 --> 00:00:31,549
name for a baby girl, by the way, was

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:32,910
Nevaeh - 

11
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:35,059
'heaven' backwards.

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,140
Names can be more than just
controversial - they can also be

13
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,689
just plain wrong, or misleading.

14
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:44,088
MISNOMERS

15
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:46,679
And I'm not talking about the daughter of Mr. Nomer.

16
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:51,640
Over the summer I went to Singapore

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,869
and I saw many many things. I saw

18
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:59,488
an infinity pool, the world's largest
column-less glass house,

19
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:03,009
beautiful beautiful orchids, including

20
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:07,149
the laboratories where scientists
genetically design custom orchids

21
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,330
and very very

22
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:14,920
humid air that condensed all over my cool glasses.

23
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,960
But even after I cleaned my glasses off

24
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:21,099
I didn't see any Lions.

25
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:23,359
In fact, it's believed that no Lions have ever

26
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:24,840
naturally lived

27
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,100
in Singapore, even though Singapore comes from a Malay word for

28
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:32,599
Lion City.

29
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:37,079
It's believed that in 1299 when Sang Nila Utama named Singapore,

30
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,780
he mistakenly thought that a tiger he saw was a Lion.

31
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,400
It's a misnomer.

32
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,368
But here

33
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:47,700
is the biggest mystery of them all, did I

34
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,149
really go to Singapore?

35
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:51,808
I mean, look at these photos.

36
00:01:51,808 --> 00:01:53,808
That guy certainly looks like me

37
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:57,198
but he's not exactly like me.

38
00:01:57,198 --> 00:01:59,099
I have made a video about misnomers

39
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,340
and that guy hasn't.

40
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,799
This photo was from May,

41
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,429
and since May I have been to Australia, New Zealand.

42
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:08,929
The guy in these photos has never been there.

43
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:09,878
I am similar

44
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:13,139
to that guy but he's not exactly

45
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:14,679
me.

46
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,479
We can resolve this problem by realising

47
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:20,768
that oranges are apples

48
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,019
You see, in Old English the word 'apple' was used to describe

49
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:28,709
apples, but also any fruit in general.

50
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:32,628
For instance, dates were 'finger apples' and bananas

51
00:02:32,628 --> 00:02:35,878
were 'apples of paradise'. Cucumber's

52
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:37,679
were 'Earth apples'.

53
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:40,979
In French the word for 'apple' acted similarly,

54
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:43,919
giving us 'Earth apple' for the potato.

55
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,339
In the Middle Ages the old French word for

56
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,370
orange meant 'apple of the orange tree'.

57
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:54,159
And the Swedish word for orange still means 'apple'

58
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:58,939
from China because Orange's originated in the East.

59
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:02,560
But this leads us to an even bigger
question: what came first

60
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:05,909
orange, the fruit or orange, the colour?

61
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,120
Well, the answer is neither.

62
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,520
The tree came first.

63
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,240
The word 'orange' comes from the Sanskrit
word for the tree

64
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,159
that these fruits grow on.

65
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,560
Before being introduced

66
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,099
to these fruits the English-speaking
world called this colour

67
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,439
not orange, but yellow-red.

68
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:30,250
The first recorded use of the word
'orange' to refer to the colour,

69
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,400
instead of the fruit, wasn't until 1512.

70
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,680
So the colour was named after the fruit,

71
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,780
which was named after the tree that it came from.

72
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,640
But what's a fruit?

73
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,339
Well, botanically a fruit is a part of a
flowering plant that disseminates

74
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:52,120
seeds, like an apple or an orange or a lemon or a grape.

75
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,360
In cooking, because they're not sweet,
we tend to call things like wheat grains

76
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,319
and bean pods

77
00:03:57,318 --> 00:04:00,530
vegetables, even though they are actually fruits.

78
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,699
Vegetable is a culinary term for other
edible parts of a plant that

79
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:07,659
aren't fruit, like roots or leaves.

80
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:08,590
Corn on the cob

81
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,170
tastes like a vegetable but scientifically

82
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,969
corn kernels are fruits,

83
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:17,060
which means that corn on the cob is really just a bunch

84
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,040
of fruits

85
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,560
packed together.

86
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,079
One of the veggies we put on our pizza

87
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,509
is the mushroom.

88
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:25,449
Of course, mushrooms aren't really

89
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:28,149
vegetables because they aren't even plants.

90
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:29,849
They're fungi.

91
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,120
Names can also be confusing because of Stigler's Law -

92
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,379
our tendency to name things

93
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:40,909
not after who discovered them, or
originated them, but instead

94
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,890
to simply honour someone else.

95
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,080
Venn diagrams are cool.

96
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,979
They were named after John Venn in the 1880s,

97
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,960
although Leonhard Euler actually introduced them

98
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,779
in 1768.

99
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:56,979
And Avogadro's Constant?

100
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,310
Not actually discovered by Avogadro.

101
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,038
He proposed

102
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,659
that such a number could exist but it was a different guy

103
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,680
who discovered the exact figure.

104
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,509
Straight up misnomers

105
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,849
are my favorite.

106
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,570
French horns are not French

107
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,300
Your Funny bone is not a bone; it's a nerve.

108
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,460
The Ulnar nerve.

109
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:19,659
And this is not

110
00:05:19,668 --> 00:05:20,788
Big Ben.

111
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:23,978
Nothing about this is officially called Big Ben.

112
00:05:23,978 --> 00:05:27,139
Its real name is The Elizabeth Tower.

113
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,158
People often say that the bell inside is named Big Ben

114
00:05:31,158 --> 00:05:32,718
but even that's not true.

115
00:05:32,718 --> 00:05:35,098
The main bell inside Elizabeth Tower

116
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,110
is officially called The Great Bell.

117
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,310
The Great Bell's nickname is Big Ben

118
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,449
and we have since applied that nickname for a bell

119
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:45,930
to the entire tower.

120
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,168
Kosher salt isn't actually

121
00:05:48,168 --> 00:05:51,680
kosher, it's just used to make things kosher,

122
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,439
to draw blood out of meat.

123
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,240
So really it should be called Koshering salt.

124
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,919
The Rocky Mountain Oyster of course
is not

125
00:05:58,918 --> 00:05:59,758
seafood -

126
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,919
it's a fried bull testicle.

127
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:04,459
Arabic Numerals are not

128
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,479
Arabic, they were invented in India but introduced

129
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:10,459
to Europe by Arab mathematicians.

130
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:12,819
Haley's comet is named after Edmund Hayley

131
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:17,259
but had been witnessed by people at least as early as 240 BC.

132
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:19,699
Peanuts are not nuts, they're legumes,

133
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:22,800
and coconuts are not nuts, they're drupes -

134
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,520
stone fruit, like cherries, apricots, peaches, etc.

135
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,740
French fries,

136
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,600
as they are especially known in America,

137
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,680
are not from America

138
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,319
but were probably named by
British and American soldiers

139
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,569
during the First World War, who discovered
them where they were likely

140
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:39,469
invented... Belgium.

141
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,389
Now since French was the official language of the Belgian Army,

142
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:46,870
the soldiers may have mistakenly thought
they were in France.

143
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,660
Koala Bears are not bears, they just
kind of look like they are

144
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,680
and egg plants don't grow eggs.

145
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,480
Eighteenth-century cultivators

146
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,939
simply thought they kind of resembled eggs.

147
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:00,500
Dry cleaning isn't dry at all,

148
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,240
it involves lots of wet liquids but just not water.

149
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,900
And, silly guy, hamburgers are not
named after ham,

150
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:10,799
the pork product, they're named after
Hamburg, Germany.

151
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,810
Probably because at

152
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,439
Hamburg citizens who emigrated to the US

153
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:18,579
and brought their minced beef patty, a
Hamburg steak with them.

154
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:21,579
Guinea pigs are not pigs at all, they're just

155
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:24,589
similar looking to pigs - kind of.

156
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:25,209
And Greenland

157
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:29,638
isn't green land at all, it's believed
that about a thousand years ago

158
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,908
Erik the Red named it Greenland hoping that
the name would trick settlers

159
00:07:33,908 --> 00:07:35,329
into coming over.

160
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,759
We drive on parkways

161
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:40,859
and park on driveways not because

162
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,960
work makers want to confuse us but
because the park in parkways

163
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,408
refers not to stopping a car but to the
nature parks

164
00:07:48,408 --> 00:07:50,389
parkways often run along.

165
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:52,939
Skeuomorphs are design elements that

166
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,399
today are merely ornamental,

167
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,209
even though in the past originally

168
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:58,829
they had a purpose.

169
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:01,478
For instance, on a modern mobile phone

170
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:04,848
the icon for phone call is shaped like an

171
00:08:04,848 --> 00:08:06,608
old phone.

172
00:08:06,608 --> 00:08:07,930
The icon for e-mail

173
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,750
is shaped like an old snail mail envelope.

174
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,478
Or, when you take a camera phone picture,

175
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:16,839
you hear the sound of a mechanical shutter,

176
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:19,739
even if your phone doesn't have one that
makes that noise.

177
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,340
Older cameras did,

178
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:23,459
so the new ones do too.

179
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:24,899
It's a skeuomorph.

180
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,400
Your own name is a kind of skeuomorph.

181
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,399
Let's call it a skeuonom.

182
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,559
It was necessary at birth

183
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,419
your parents gave it to you but before
they knew exactly what you would be like

184
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:40,838
when you grew up.

185
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:43,399
You have changed since you were born

186
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:46,259
but your name has stayed the same.

187
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,778
When we called it

188
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:50,909
'The Moon', we didn't know that we would find

189
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:54,778
other moons in the solar system. When you
were named

190
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:59,889
no one knew how you would change, or what you would become, and you change

191
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:01,149
frequently.

192
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:03,659
You change many, many times

193
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:05,699
over the course of your life.

194
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,920
You learn things,

195
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:11,169
you forget things, you meet people, you stop
talking to people.

196
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:15,269
You experience things for the first time,
at a cellular level

197
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:19,039
millions of times a second you change
costume,

198
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,909
cells die and new ones are born.

199
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:27,100
And, at the atomic level, with the
exception of non-living

200
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,540
things, like tattoos and piercings,

201
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:30,899
every five years

202
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:34,958
pretty much every single atom in your
body is replaced.

203
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,159
So to what degree is the future or past

204
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,319
you, really you now.

205
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,670
Robert M Martin

206
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:46,269
puts this in a really cool perspective
in his book 'There Are Two

207
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:48,989
Errors in the the Title of This Book*'

208
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,000
"That person, who will have your name

209
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,720
in the very far future, will be connected
only very tenuously to the present you.

210
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,500
The person will remember very few of
your current experiences,

211
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:06,809
will be psychologically quite different,
will have a body that resembles your

212
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:08,289
present one only a bit,

213
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:11,829
and contains almost none of the same matter.

214
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,379
So it seems that this person is the
future you

215
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:17,639
only to a small degree.

216
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:20,840
In a way, in terms of memories and experiences in history,

217
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,290
you have more in common with a
stranger today

218
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:28,049
than you do with yourself 10 or 20
years ago."

219
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:32,109
Martin goes even further, saying why be afraid of death

220
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,919
if the future you who dies will resemble
you today

221
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,439
so little?

222
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,820
Well, to that I say

223
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,509
YOLO?

224
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:45,049
Well, it's probably more accurate
to say

225
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:47,649
YOLOBLOMLMTAASOSBTDPWKEOBOIODAW-

226
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:48,679
CHEOBOITOD.

227
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:52,449
You only live once, but living once means
living

228
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,700
many times, as a series of similar,

229
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,920
but technically different people, who
know each other, but only in one direction,

230
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,879
and who can help each other, but only in
the other direction.

231
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,468
And as always,

232
00:11:07,469 --> 00:11:09,069
 thanks for watching.
