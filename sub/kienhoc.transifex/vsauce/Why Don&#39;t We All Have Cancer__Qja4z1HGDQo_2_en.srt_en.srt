00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,599
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,330
Since this video began

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,769
more than a million of your cells have

4
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:10,789
died. It's natural, don't worry.

5
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:14,089
But you are literally covered with death

6
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:17,660
Dead stuff. Fingernails, your hair,

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,100
the outermost layer of your skin - all
made out of dead things.

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,170
And you are losing this dead stuff
constantly. Every week

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,070
about 5.5 grams of dead skin sheds off of your body.

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,149
Ohio State University found that 80%

11
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,520
of that material you see indoors,
beautifully dancing across sunbeams,

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,609
is dead human skin.

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,760
But for the most part, you are made out of

14
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,058
living stuff. You are a biological

15
00:00:47,058 --> 00:00:50,718
furnace, burning food energy to move and breathe and

16
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,079
think and stay warm. As you can see on
Grand-Illusions[.com], the heat from your own

17
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,009
hand while you sit still

18
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:00,589
is enough to run a Stirling engine.

19
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:05,140
Your cells are busy and active and dividing

20
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,049
millions and millions of times every day.
In fact, because of that, you shouldn't even

21
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,610
really be called a person.

22
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:15,090
You should be called a persON

23
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,380
and on and on and on and on and on and
on and on... But here's the really

24
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,298
mind-blowing

25
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:24,520
thing about the mind sustaining process of cell division,

26
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:28,728
the replication of instructions.
DNA for each daughter cell

27
00:01:28,728 --> 00:01:32,099
requires copying an exact sequence

28
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:36,908
of three billion nucleotides. That's a lot.

29
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:42,150
Luckily, our bodies are perfect-ly happy
to do it but they're not perfect.

30
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,250
Every time a single cell in your body
divides, the enzymes that synthesize

31
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,170
your DNA

32
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,540
make 120,000 mistakes.

33
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:53,780
Some of these mistakes

34
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,350
wind up being beneficial. Some of these
mistakes wind up being harmful and

35
00:01:58,349 --> 00:01:59,719
some are just neutral,

36
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,938
they don't make a difference.
But if a mistake,

37
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:07,789
a mutation in a cell's DNA, causes the
cell to behave abnormally

38
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:12,239
and stimulate its own growth, ignore signals to stop,

39
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,730
stimulate the body to give it its own
blood supply, potentially

40
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:20,250
multiply forever and unstick from
where it began to spread throughout the body,

41
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,530
it becomes a special type of cell.

42
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,180
We have found 200 diseases with various
origins and natures that

43
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,810
fit this description. Despite being
different, they often go by the same name:

44
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,879
cancer.

45
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,219
DNA mutations occur randomly in your body

46
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:41,889
but they can also be inherited or caused
by the environment.

47
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:45,889
For example, exposure to ultraviolet
radiation from the Sun

48
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:50,169
can cause all kinds of damage,
including genetic damage.

49
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:55,479
If little or no skin protection is
used, the accumulation of all these types of damage

50
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:59,169
can be quite dramatic. This man drove a truck

51
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:02,869
for years, exposing one side of his face to more sunlight

52
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,030
than the other.

53
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,199
And for 15 years this woman worked in a room

54
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,539
that had the same window. A window to her left.

55
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,079
Environmental damage to the body,

56
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,360
whether cancer-causing or not, is serious business.

57
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,980
In fact, giraffes have black tongues
because the dark pigmentation protects

58
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:22,829
their tongues

59
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,890
from solar radiation while they're hanging out all day.

60
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:29,829
Go back far enough, beyond where sunshine
hits, and their tongues are pink.

61
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,799
Given the sheer number of environmental
dangers to our DNA

62
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,200
and the sheer number of mistakes our own
bodies make with our DNA every day,

63
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:42,818
it is incredible that we all aren't
developing cancers constantly

64
00:03:42,818 --> 00:03:47,259
and immediately after being born.
One of the things we have to thank

65
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:50,359
is our body's own version of autocorrect.

66
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,030
Biological mechanisms, like proofreading
and mismatch repair,

67
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,030
catch and correct or stop more than 99% of errors.

68
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,680
We grow old and pass away for many,

69
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:05,250
many reasons.
But when it comes to cancers, our bodies'

70
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,989
own internal autocorrect is like the autocorrect

71
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:13,299
on your phone. It's pretty good, but it's
not perfect. Cancers

72
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:18,798
still develop, especially after the
accumulation of mistakes and mutations

73
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,938
over time. I'm incredibly grateful to
Cancer Research UK.

74
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:27,000
They helped me a lot with this
episode, and thanks to work by groups like them,

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,449
we are at an accelerating rate finding
ways to prevent and control cancer

76
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:36,250
beyond what our bodies can do alone.
I mean, after all, natural selection can

77
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,990
only see so much

78
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,689
because of the selection shadow.

79
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:46,079
We aren't all the same and if your genetic
variations make you and your children

80
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,609
more successful at reproducing,

81
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,810
well, what do you know, your
characteristics become more common.

82
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,810
But this phenomenon has a weak influence

83
00:04:55,819 --> 00:05:00,779
here. Later in life, after your role in
reproduction and raising offspring to

84
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:02,049
independence

85
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,430
has passed.

86
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:06,620
We have found evidence of the selection shadow

87
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,649
at work with mice and bats.

88
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:13,698
Raised under perfect conditions, with
veterinary medicine and safe lives,

89
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:17,030
mice only live about two to three years.

90
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:21,038
Whereas bats, with similar sizes and
metabolisms, can live for

91
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,860
thirty years or more. The significant
difference here is that

92
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,480
unlike mice, bats have had in the wild
for millions of years

93
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,780
fewer predators - a smaller chance of dying early

94
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:38,599
due to extrinsic mortality. They've, on
average, had more days for natural selection

95
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,729
to influence. This could be a very good
explanation for why diseases that affect

96
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:46,930
our complex multicellular selves

97
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,629
late in life are still with us.

98
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,900
But wait, why are humans living so long today?

99
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:57,399
I mean, in the past, but genetically recently, weren't

100
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,330
teenagers considered middle aged?

101
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:05,918
Not really. Well, it's true that in the
past life expectancies were quite

102
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:09,180
a bit lower, a life expectancy is merely an

103
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,879
average number of years a person was
expected to live as soon as they were born.

104
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:17,978
And in the past, infant mortality was so high

105
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:21,889
the average was brought down
significantly. It's true that in the

106
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:23,490
early 1600s, here

107
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,519
in England, life expectancy was only 35 years.

108
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:30,589
But if you made the age of 21... Well,

109
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:34,189
you could easily expect to live well into your 60s.

110
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:37,589
Lifespans that go beyond the age of reproduction have

111
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:41,379
always made sense for humans,
because we are intelligent

112
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:44,850
and social, useful to one another and our children

113
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:48,759
take a lot of time and guidance to gain independence.

114
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,979
But that just moves the selection shadow ahead. 
It's still there,

115
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:56,508
suggesting that, in the end, our bodies might just be

116
00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:00,069
tools our sex cells use to reproduce

117
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:04,870
and grow up to do it again. Nature and
time haven't helped our bodies battle

118
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,970
late acting diseases because a chicken

119
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:12,050
is just an egg's way of making another egg.

120
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,639
But maybe not for long. Our minds and
modern science technology engineering

121
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,199
and mathematics are making progress

122
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,699
against late acting diseases.
And when it comes to cancers,

123
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:26,360
Cancer Research UK points out that 40 years ago

124
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,990
only one in four people lived ten years or longer

125
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,090
after being diagnosed.
Today that number is 2 in 4.

126
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:38,949
And they believe that in only twenty years
that statistic could be as high as 3 in 4.

127
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,620
Refrigeration and sanitation are
tackling stomach cancers caused by infection,

128
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:48,129
vaccines are preventing cervical cancer,
anti-smoking campaigns and reductions

129
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:50,410
of obesity and diabetes and the elimination

130
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,780
of cancer-causing chemicals from our
everyday lives are giving us an edge.

131
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:58,269
We learn more every single day. The process

132
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,310
is slow, but steady. Because cancer is not just

133
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:06,329
one thing. It's unlikely there will ever
be a single cure for cancer because

134
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:08,568
there are two hundred different types

135
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:13,240
of cancers. But there will be cures and
better methods of prevention

136
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,610
and detection.
Advances are coming from all over.

137
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,639
For example, what we have learned about
controlling proton beams because of the

138
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,288
Large Hadron Collider

139
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:26,538
has reduced the need for special shields
during the removal of eye tumours.

140
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:30,878
The statistical surprise that cancers
aren't more common in our bodies

141
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,899
is a sign that we're involved in a relay race.

142
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:37,950
Natural selection already did some of the
work, now it's our turn.

143
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,550
When we talk about cancer
we often use the language of war:

144
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:44,719
it's a battle, it's a fight.
But the challenge

145
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,540
isn't so much a war with winners and
losers and surrender

146
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:53,939
as it is a mutiny.
We can't help the fact that we are all at sea.

147
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,500
Natural selection at least gave us boats

148
00:08:56,509 --> 00:09:00,088
but now we are making where those boats go

149
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:01,849
our decision.

150
00:09:01,849 --> 00:09:03,069
And as always,

151
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,879
thanks for watching.
