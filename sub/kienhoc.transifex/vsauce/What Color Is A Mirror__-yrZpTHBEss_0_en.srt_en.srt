00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,339
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And today we are going to talk about color.

2
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:09,958
(Green Green, Green Green).
"Gold" on, let me just "Pink" this up.

3
00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:10,689
"Yellow?"

4
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:13,849
"Michael, "Orange" you going to come to the
concert this evening?"

5
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:16,530
"I "Red" about that, there are going to be
a lot of "Purple" there."

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,670
"I didn't "Teal" you about this earlier?"

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,460
"Well, look, I have to go "Brown" town first,
but I'll be "White Black."

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,640
Colors...

9
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:32,479
Did you know that the human eye can differentiate
10 million different colors? But what color

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,199
is a mirror?

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,039
You might say "silver," because mirrors are
often illustrated that way, and, to be sure,

12
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:46,909
they are made out of silver or silvery things
like aluminium. But a mirror, in reality, is

13
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:49,069
whatever color you point it at.

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:56,179
In this Green Room, the mirror is green. And
if you look inside a mirror, it becomes "you-colored."

15
00:00:56,179 --> 00:01:02,039
An object is whatever color it doesn't absorb.
These sticky notes are orange because when

16
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,079
hit with typical white light, they absorb
every other wavelength of visible light, except

17
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,010
for orange, which they diffuse into your eye balls.

18
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:17,030
But a perfect mirror reflects all colors equally.
So, in a way, you could say that a mirror

19
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:23,170
is white, except a mirror doesn't reflect
colors in the same way that pigment does.

20
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:30,439
A mirror reflects incoming light in a single
outgoing direction - specular reflection, not

21
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,250
diffuse. This kind of reflection creates an
image of the very thing in front of the mirror.

22
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,820
So, as Bad Astronomy jokes,
a mirror is more of a "smart white."

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,219
But wait a second, that is a "perfect" mirror
and we live in the real world where there

24
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:51,380
are no perfect mirrors. Every mirror absorbs
a little bit of light, not enough that it

25
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:56,658
matters, I mean, it looks pretty clear to
me, but when you take a look at the spectrum

26
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:02,580
of light reflected by a typical mirror, you
will find that it best reflects light within

27
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:10,560
the 510 nanometer range, which we perceive
as green light. So, technically, a mirror

28
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,939
is a tiny, tiny, tiny bit green.

29
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,539
You may have noticed this yourself
when investigating a "Mirror Tunnel."

30
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:23,879
This happens when two mirrors face each other,
reflecting the same scene back and forth,

31
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:28,349
and back and forth, and back and forth. With
each new reflection, a little bit more visual

32
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:34,878
light is lost, but green least of all. That's
why the reflection way down the tunnel is

33
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:37,899
dimmer and greener.

34
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:42,778
So maybe real world mirrors aren't "smart
white," they're actually kind of green, but

35
00:02:42,778 --> 00:02:45,139
we should talk about white.

36
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:47,939
"En español, "white" es "blanco."

37
00:02:47,938 --> 00:02:51,310
"En français, "white" est dit "blanc."

38
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:57,408
And in English we have a word that comes
from the same route. Black, which is the opposite

39
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,968
of white. How did that happen?

40
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:05,729
Well, it turns out that all of those words
come from the same ancient Proto-Indo-European

41
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:13,769
root word "Bhleg," which meant "shine," "burn,"
"flash." Some languages took it to mean the

42
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:20,320
brightness of the flash: "white." While others
took it to mean what's left behind: the burned,

43
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:22,069
"black," darkness.

44
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:27,788
If you have blue eyes, your eyes aren't actually
blue, in the sense that the molecules inside

45
00:03:27,788 --> 00:03:32,628
them are absorbing all other wavelengths of
visible light and diffusing the blue. No,

46
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:39,879
no, no, instead, your eyes are blue for the
same reason that the sky is blue: interference.

47
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:44,979
In our sky, light from the Sun encounters
molecules of air and because of the size

48
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:51,069
of those molecules, light of longer wavelengths
can slip on by, but shorter wavelengths crash

49
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:56,149
into the particles, like blue light, and scatter,
which is why we see blue when we look at the

50
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:58,348
sky away from the Sun.

51
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:04,700
Without the air molecules, that space would
just be black. And when direct sunlight has

52
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:09,498
to travel through a lot of air, almost all
of the colors get scattered out except for

53
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:16,038
the longest wavelengths, the red, which is
what gives a sunrise and a sunset their color.

54
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:22,220
The iris of your eyeball contains a hazy layer
where light can be scattered just like the

55
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,830
sky. Through a similar, but slightly different
process, shorter wavelengths are scattered

56
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:32,870
more, making your eyes look blue, unless,
of course, you have some melonen in that iris,

57
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,329
in which case your eyes are going to be
green, hazel or brown.

58
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,459
Enjoy those colors.

59
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,000
And as always,

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,240
thanks for watching.
