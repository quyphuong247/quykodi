00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,200
Hey, Vsauce.
Michael here.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,379
And this strawberry weights about 50 grams, which
according to Russell Seitz also happens to

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:14,380
be the weight of the entire Internet.
What does that mean?

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:19,310
I mean, the Internet is a gigantic place and
how do you measure information?

5
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:22,768
Well, let's start a little bit smaller with
a Kindle.

6
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:27,178
Right now, I'm reading Gadsby, which is a
great novel that makes complete sense, except

7
00:00:27,178 --> 00:00:31,838
it was written without ever using the letter
"e," which is awesome.

8
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,719
But when I put Gadsby on my Kindle, did my
Kindle gain weight?

9
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:40,600
Well, theoretically, yes it did.
Information is stored on flash drives like

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,880
this and on my Kindle in binary.
And that binary physically exists because

11
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,679
electrons charge floating gate transistors.
And the thing about electrons is that they

12
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:55,240
have mass.
In fact, a professor at Berkeley estimated

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:00,700
that when a Kindle is completely full of books,
its weight increases by about 10 to the negative

14
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,549
18th grams.
That number is mind blowingly miniscule.

15
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:11,109
In fact, he says that when you fully charge
a Kindle's battery, it gains 100 million times

16
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:13,870
more mass than it does when you fill it with
books.

17
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,800
But even then the number is impossible to
measure.

18
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:22,530
The most specific scales we've ever created
only measure to about 10 to the negative 9th

19
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,299
grams.
So let's get bigger.

20
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:30,069
Russell Seitz came up with his measurement
because the Internet is composed of networks

21
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:36,559
of servers and they're about 75 to 100 million
servers operating to make the Internet work.

22
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,260
Combined, that many servers equal about 40
billion Watts of electricity and we know that

23
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,240
an Amp is about 10 to the 18th electrons per
second.

24
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,939
And since we know the weight of an electron
we can calculate that the entire Internet

25
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,710
is really just about 50 grams of electrons
in motion.

26
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:59,809
Now that number only includes servers.
And Seitz says that if you wanna include the

27
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:04,060
chips in personal computers as well, the number's
about 3 times larger.

28
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,120
But there's a weight of the Internet that
impresses me a little bit more.

29
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,780
It's a calculation not of the energy it takes
to serve the Internet, but the energy contained

30
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,439
in the actual information.
The videos, the pictures, the e-mails.

31
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:20,639
How much do they all collectively weigh when
stored?

32
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:26,348
Well, here's the thing.
It takes about 8 billion electrons to store

33
00:02:26,348 --> 00:02:29,788
one e-mail.
8 billion sounds like a lot, but electrons

34
00:02:29,788 --> 00:02:36,479
are tiny and so one e-mail only weighs about
two ten-thousandths of a quadrillionth of

35
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,699
an ounce.
But the Internet contains lots of e-mails

36
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:44,399
and it contains lots of video and images and
celebrity rumours, so how much does it weigh

37
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,659
altogether?
Well, the first question we have to ask is

38
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:53,319
how big is the Internet and that's difficult
to calculate, but Eric Schmidt, then-CEO of

39
00:02:53,319 --> 00:03:00,419
Google, once estimated that the entire Internet
contains about 5 million Terabytes of information,

40
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,730
of which, he said, Google has only indexed
0.004%.

41
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:10,879
Okay, so not counting the energy it takes
to deliver the Internet, the information itself

42
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:16,899
on the Internet is about 5 million Terabytes.
Now, we know how many electrons it takes to

43
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,289
form a single byte and we know the mass of
an electron and so with a little bit of math

44
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:26,919
you can figure out that the entire Internet,
everything on it, collectively only weighs

45
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:33,699
0.2 millionths of an ounce.
Think of it this way: every single video on

46
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:38,719
YouTube, every single video across the entire
web, every single image, every single website,

47
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,139
every e-mail you've sent, every love
letter you've written, every photo of your

48
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:47,848
grandkids you've received is collectively
held within an amount of mass about the size

49
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:54,878
of the smallest possible grain of sand.

I'm gonna share some more facts there that I didn't

51
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,980
include in this video around electricity in
general.
