00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,700
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,839
In 1934 Webster's dictionary gave birth to a new word

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,410
by mistake. Their chemistry editor

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,309
Austin N Paterson submitted a simple entry: "D 

5
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:18,390
or D abbreviation for density".

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,490
Nothing wrong with that, but the entry was misread

7
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,799
and 'dord' was added to the dictionary.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,560
'Dord' was an accidental word for
thirteen years before the mistake was

9
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:31,358
discovered

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,399
and its wordship revoked. Let's have fun
with words today,

11
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,549
but first, what's the deal with first?

12
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:44,949
Or for that matter, second? If you were in
position three

13
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,859
you're in third place. Position 5, fifth.

14
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:51,179
Position 197

15
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:54,259
one hundred and ninety-seventh. Pretty simple.

16
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:58,729
So why do positions 1 and 2 give us first and second?

17
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:01,890
Shouldn't they be 'oneth' and 'twoth'?

18
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,030
Well, maybe. But English loves

19
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:10,079
collateral adjectives. Adjectives derived
from different roots than the nouns

20
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,090
they describe. There are plenty of
derived adjectives, don't get me wrong.

21
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,140
A bunch of clouds

22
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,519
make the day cloudy, friends are friendly,

23
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:23,250
poets are poetic. Things with a lot of
smell to them are smelly

24
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,780
but the Moon is not Moonly.

25
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,060
The Moon is lunar.

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,740
Collateral adjectives are everywhere.

27
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:38,659
Mouth stuff is oral. Bees are apian.

28
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:41,739
Some nouns have both. Fathers can be

29
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,250
fatherly or paternal .

30
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:50,420
And a setting filled with fog can be foggy or brumous.

31
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,478
It's often said that no word

32
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,140
rhymes with orange. Is that true?

33
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,239
Well, rhyming can be controversial because
it often depends on pronunciation,

34
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,259
accent and can be forced. Especially if
you use multiple

35
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,009
words, you can force orange to rhyme with
door hinge,

36
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:11,909
if you want. But what we want is a perfect rhyme.

37
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:15,430
A perfect rhyme is what occurs between
two words

38
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:20,909
like tickle and pickle. They are perfect
rhymes because the final stressed

39
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:25,229
vowel sound and all the sounds
afterwards are identical.

40
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:29,259
Identical doesn't rhyme with pickle,
because even though they both

41
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:33,259
end with 'ickle', identical has it stress
in the wrong place.

42
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:36,899
We could rhyme them if we pronounced it
not identical

43
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,650
but instead identical. With that in mind,

44
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:46,250
orange does have perfect rhymes. They
just happen to be extremely obscure,

45
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,250
like 'Blorenge', a hill in Wales.

46
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:54,360
Silver also has a perfect rhyme: chilver, a female lamb.

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,319
Think Fact delineated even more words we
often say don't have rhymes but

48
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,068
actually do. Point is, orange does have

49
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:05,389
perfect rhymes, and even if it didn't, well,

50
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:09,408
that wouldn't make it special. Sure, monosyllabic words

51
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:13,840
tend to rhyme with other words. It's believed
there are only about 100 single syllable

52
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,219
words that have no rhyme.

53
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:20,000
For instance, wolf, sixth, depth and filmed.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,340
But considering words of all lengths,

55
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,450
it's been calculated that most English words

56
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:29,089
don't rhyme with anything. Don't believe me?

57
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,439
Well, leave a comment below. The word
'comment'

58
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:36,750
rhymes with nothing, nor does husband, sandwich,

59
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,739
liquid, penguin, chimney, empty,

60
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,230
and, of course, 'nothing' rhymes with nothing.

61
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:48,030
Identical rhymes are even more perfect

62
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,180
than perfect rhymes but they become so
identical at that point

63
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,819
it's a little obvious and not really
appreciated.

64
00:03:55,818 --> 00:04:00,000
Identical rhymes occur when the consonant
sound before the final stressed vowel

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,219
between two words are also identical.

66
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:07,180
Sun and gun are perfect rhymes. But gun

67
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,580
and begun are identical rhymes. So are

68
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,599
offend and defend, or homonyms like

69
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:19,048
son and sun. You could call the people
who watch over, and monitor, the police

70
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:22,659
'the police police'. Who watches over them? Well,

71
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,509
'the police police police', of course. You can
string together

72
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:30,240
any number of police's and always create
a sensible,

73
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,470
though clunky, title. You can even use

74
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,830
the word police by itself to create a
grammatical sentence. It takes

75
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:41,680
eight of them. Police police police police police police police

76
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,509
police. Here's what the sentence
means. Police police,

77
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:49,180
which police police police watch over,
police police.

78
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,400
Add any multiple of three more police to
this stream

79
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,918
and you preserve the grammar. The most
that fit on Twitter

80
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,629
is 20. If you say police enough times
it starts to sound like its not even a

81
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:01,680
real word.

82
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,360
That is called jamais vu, the reverse of deja vu,

83
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,689
when something familiar all of a sudden
feels new

84
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:12,089
and novel. I've covered it before but
let's be clear.

85
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:15,369
If you don't practice obediency to the police

86
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,649
you may wind up in J L. Escape, and you're an SKP.

87
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:22,829
Letters, whose names said together some
similar to words,

88
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:25,859
are called Gramograms. You can't hear

89
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,479
a pterodactyl urinate because it's
silent 'p'.

90
00:05:29,478 --> 00:05:33,508
But every letter in the alphabet is
silent sometimes.

91
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:37,259
And some letters are used more
frequently than other letters

92
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:41,759
in English words. Scrabble provides more
of those letters and people guess them more

93
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:46,899
often when playing hangman. Next time you play hangman you can take advantage of this.

94
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:50,888
People will guess more letters
incorrectly if you choose a short word

95
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:54,680
that has few different letters. John McLuhan

96
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,939
ran 15 million computer simulations of
hangman

97
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:01,269
and he found that the most difficult word for
people to guess

98
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:02,370
is jazz.

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,279
Phantonyms aren't ghostly undead words, they're words
that appear to mean one thing but

100
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,039
actually mean something completely different.

101
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,740
Enervate sounds like it means to fill with energy but it actually means to

102
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,319
drain of energy, to weaken.

103
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,519
Noisome appears to mean really noisy but it actually describes something that has an

104
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:27,419
extremely offensive smell.

105
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:32,960
In 2005, the New Oxford American Dictionary
published a new word:

106
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,840
esquivalience.

107
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:39,839
They said it meant the wilful avoidance of
one's official responsibilities.

108
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:42,579
But it didn't. They made it up

109
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:46,819
as a copyright trap. If anyone copied
their dictionary

110
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:51,399
the stealer wouldn't be able to explain
how esquivalience wound up in their dictionary

111
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:56,070
without admitting that they had copied it. Map makers often insert fake

112
00:06:56,069 --> 00:07:00,099
features for the same purposes. Streets and
towns that only exist

113
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,250
to trap copiers that only exist on paper,

114
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:09,569
Paper Streets & Paper Towns. The author of
The Trivia encyclopedia even placed a fake fact

115
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:12,649
in one of his books because he
was certain

116
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:15,819
that the Trivial Pursuit board game was
taking their questions

117
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:20,839
from his book. Sure enough, later the
board game included his fake fact

118
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:25,919
as a real question. Similarly, the esquivalinece trap was used to catch

119
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,800
Dictionary.com.

120
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,020
But here's the thing: authorities don't
tend to respect copyright traps

121
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,759
built out of fake facts.

122
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,639
Facts cannot be copyrighted. They belong to, and can be used by,

123
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,740
all of us. US federal courts have argued that

124
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,860
fake facts presented as real are not
protected, because if they were,

125
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,670
no one could share real true information
without fear

126
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,780
of sharing something protected by copyright. That said,

127
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:58,859
stylistic decisions like how the facts
are selected or arranged or articulated

128
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,060
can be copyrighted. When the automobile
association was caught mimicking

129
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,079
the stylistic features of ordnance
surveys, they were forced to pay up

130
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,680
twenty million pounds.

131
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,750
You cannot own a fact

132
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,800
and you cannot own a lie you made up, if
everyone believes it.

133
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,879
But you can own how you tell them.

134
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,740
Puns are great, and in 'The Pun Also Rises'

135
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,590
John Pollock relates a fantastic story.
Puns can be traced

136
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:29,589
all the way back to be epic of Gilgamesh,
where people are warned

137
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:34,370
of an upcoming giant flood. They are
told that the skies will soon rain

138
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,759
kibtu and kukku. Words that mean

139
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,080
corn and the sound corn makes when
falling on the ground.

140
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,169
But in the story, the words are actually
puns

141
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:48,220
on words for misery and suffering.

142
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,600
People who got the pun prepared and
saved their own lives,

143
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,940
but those who failed to recognise the pun
perished in the flood,

144
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,120
which means the very oldest pun on record

145
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:05,000
was literally corny. Is that ironic?

146
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,269
No. Irony is one of the most

147
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:12,679
debated figures of speech. The Oatmeal[.com]
famously lamented that if anyone refers

148
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,459
to anything as being

149
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:20,400
ironic, the hip thing to do right now is
to call it out as being not ironic.

150
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,889
Situational irony is what we
tend to mean when we say something is ironic.

151
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:30,460
The Oatmeal defines it as "when something
happens and a reversal of expectations occurs".

152
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,850
Dig.com's recent article on the
subject uses an even stricter definition,

153
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,149
saying "situational irony is a direct
result of an

154
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:41,649
action intended to produce the opposite effect".

155
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:44,980
Their example is really good. If the elevators

156
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,470
at in elevator repair school are out of order,

157
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,879
that's not really situational irony.
Instead,

158
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:54,990
what would be really ironic is that if the
elevators were out of order because the

159
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,620
experts at the school had done something to them

160
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,419
they believed would make them run forever
and never be

161
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:04,979
out of order. Alanis Morissette wrote a
song called

162
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,149
'Ironic', whose lyrics contain situations but

163
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,370
famously no situational irony.

164
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,629
People love pointing this out.

165
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:18,759
"A traffic jam when you're already late."
Not situational irony,

166
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:23,350
that's just a bummer or a sad
coincidence. Patrick Cassels cleverly

167
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,909
rewrote the song's lyrics to contain
situations that are actually

168
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:30,679
situationally ironic. For example, a traffic jam

169
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:34,229
when you're already late to receive an
award from the municipal planning board

170
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,289
for reducing the city's automobile
congestion

171
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:40,139
eighty percent, or a black fly in your
chardonnay

172
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:45,559
poured to celebrate the successful fumigation of your recently purchased vineyard in southern France.

173
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:48,039
Now that's what I call situational irony.

174
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:51,729
But regardless of what Alanis intended,

175
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,139
a close reading of the song's lyrics
reveals that irony

176
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:59,370
is occurring, just not the situational
kind it's hip to argue about.

177
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,379
Instead, her song is all about dramatic irony.

178
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:05,679
When someone is, often hilariously,

179
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,179
unaware of the significance of an event,
while other people are.

180
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:14,419
Take a look at the lyrics for 'Ironic'.
The situations she describes are never

181
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:15,860
explicitly labeled

182
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:21,580
ironic. At the most, they're simply
stories and similes and metaphors for it:

183
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,580
life.

184
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,500
And, she adds later, life is also

185
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:31,220
ironic. Dramatically ironic. These
things sound like cruddy scenarios, but they

186
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,649
actually figure, they actually make sense.

187
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:38,639
Ironic is not a list of examples of
situational irony.

188
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,080
Instead, it's a treatise on dramatic irony,

189
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,480
the difference between what life knows we need

190
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,200
and what we think we need.

191
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,259
What's ironic isn't 10,000 spoons when
all you need is at knife. It's the fact that,

192
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:56,470
as Alanis believes, you have all of
those spoons,

193
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,379
because unbeknownst to you, but known by life, what you really need right now

194
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:06,000
is only spoons. Or, the last thing you
need right now is a knife.

195
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,840
On the subject of overanalysing pop songs,

196
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,690
analysis of dog mitochondrial DNA
has revealed that

197
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,790
all dogs may be traceable to a localised event.

198
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:19,069
The species is believed to have resulted
from the domestication of

199
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,370
wolves about 11,000 to 16,000 years ago,

200
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,929
in what is now Southwestern China.

201
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:30,040
So, Baha Men, to answer your question, it was the Mesolithic Southwestern Chinese

202
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,729
who let the dogs out.

203
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:33,059
And as always,

204
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:34,899
thanks for watching
