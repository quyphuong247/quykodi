1
00:00:04,569 --> 00:00:05,500
Hey, Vsauce.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,269
Michael here.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau

3
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,419
right now, in America, there are 106

4
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:18,028
people named Harry Potter.
1 007

5
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:21,519
named James Bond and eight people

6
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,160
named Justin Bieber.
They're just

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,849
aren't enough names to go around.

8
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:31,960
There are more than 300 million people

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,359
in America but a hundred and fifty
thousand last names and five thousand

10
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:37,659
first names

11
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:41,229
is all you need to name 9 out of every

12
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:45,929
10 of them.
When are we gonna run out of names?

13
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:49,200
Perhaps it's already happened to you.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,690
If it hasn't, when?
Ten years, twenty years, a hundred, a thousand.

15
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:56,769
When will someone with your exact name

16
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,989
become famous?
So famous in fact that your legacy

17
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:04,628
changes forever to just being not

18
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,740
the person people think of when
they hear your name.

19
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:12,669
And for that matter, when will every reasonably
memorable pronounceable

20
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,978
band name or brand name be taken?

21
00:01:15,978 --> 00:01:20,549
When will authors have no choice but to
just start reusing book titles?

22
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,130
According to Rovi Corp, owner of AllMusic.com,

23
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:28,129
the most used band name is 'Bliss',

24
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:31,969
followed in order by 'Mirage', 'One',

25
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:35,709
'Gemini', 'Legacy', 'Paradox'

26
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:38,849
and 'Rain'.
In the past when

27
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:42,408
fewer bands had already been created and
you couldn't just Google up

28
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:46,240
every single band, overlap was easier to
get away with

29
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:52,368
and one word band names were plentiful.
But now, after years and years and years

30
00:01:52,368 --> 00:01:52,609
of

31
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:55,640
band formation, well, we have

32
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,539
'The Who', but we also have 'The What?',

33
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:03,530
'The Where', 'The When', 'The Why', 'The How'

34
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,780
and even 'The The'.

35
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,340
In order to stand out now,
and have your own unique name,

36
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,680
you have to be a bit more creative.

37
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,019
'O', 'Diarrhea Planet'

38
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:21,000
or 'Betty's Not a Vitamin', which, by the way,

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,860
is no longer true.
Betty became a vitamin in 1994.

40
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,920
What about Twitter handles or email addresses?

41
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:34,109
Have we already reached peak username?
We already find ourselves often having to

42
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,000
use abbreviations, initials, numbers or just

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,810
choosing something completely different.

44
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,479
Will our children or our children's children

45
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,289
live in a world where the only remaining
Gmail addresses is

46
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:53,000
are just random strings of alphanumeric characters?

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,650
Are we approaching a name crisis?

48
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,200
And if so, should we even call it a name crisis,

49
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,879
lest we use up yet another precious name?

50
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,189
Maybe you already share your name with
someone famous.

51
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,889
But if you don't, how long will it be until you

52
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:18,189
probably will?
I mean, new famous people are popping up all the time

53
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:22,490
faster now than ever before because of the
Internet and they are gobbling up

54
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,990
top Google search billing.
Maybe it won't happen until

55
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:29,710
long after you've been dead but
shouldn't the reservoir

56
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:34,260
names, not taken by notable people, eventually 

57
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:38,349
run out?
Computer scientist Samuel Arbesman approximated

58
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:41,560
how many famous people there are alive today

59
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,640
and I think his calculation will be
helpful. You see, he points out that if we

60
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,349
allow

61
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:52,039
"famous" to simply mean "being notable enough
to have your own Wikipedia page",

62
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:56,409
well, because there are 700,000 living people

63
00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:01,990
with Wikipedia pages right now,
that means one out of every 10,000 people on

64
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,930
earth today

65
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:08,620
are famous. Assuming at the least
that that proportion remains constant

66
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,349
since 255 people are born every minute,

67
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:16,459
that means every hour a future famous person

68
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,509
is born.
Their name destined to become primarily associated

69
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:24,649
with them, not everyone else who

70
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:28,679
shares their name.
All of those people will be relegated to

71
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,400
disambiguation or the post-nominal, 

72
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,449
not the famous one.
Luckily, if you do the math, you'll find that even at a rate

73
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:38,569
of one future

74
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:42,439
famous person born every hour, it would still take

75
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,250
dozens of millennia for most of us to expect

76
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,360
a future famous person with our exact name to emerge.

77
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,650
Plus names change.
New ones become popular,

78
00:04:54,649 --> 00:05:00,129
others obsolesce, but for fun, let's
not focus on names we popularly

79
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:03,399
use and instead look at how many possible names

80
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:09,199
there can be.
The Social Security Administration allows up to 36

81
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,029
letters

82
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:13,339
for a complete name.
Now, including spaces,

83
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:16,959
27 letters filling 36

84
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,759
spots, with repetition allowed,

85
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,089
means

86
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:25,509
3  sextillion possible combinations.

87
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:28,860
That's more than Earth has

88
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,439
atoms.
So let's refine

89
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:35,689
our limits.
How many pronounceable names

90
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:40,329
are possible?
For that, I say we look at what Randall Munroe,

91
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:44,810
the author of the fantastic 'What If?' did
when asked about naming

92
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,780
stars.
If you want to give every single star

93
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:52,179
in the observable universe a unique but
pronounceable

94
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,870
English name, how long would the names have to be?

95
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,959
His approximation is really
fascinating. If we define

96
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:04,079
unpronounceable word as a word that
contains consonant-vowel

97
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:09,099
pairs, we can roughly figure that there
are about 105 different

98
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,920
such pair possibilities.

99
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,270
105. That's not too much different from

100
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:20,139
99. So, funny enough,
there are about the same number of

101
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:23,819
consonant-vowel pairs possible as there are

102
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:25,430
two-digit numbers,

103
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,860
which means we could give every star in
the observable universe

104
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,139
a sayable unique name

105
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:39,060
with just 24 letters, the same number of
digits it would take to just

106
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,579
number all of them.
So, the bottom line is we may each have to give up

107
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:47,319
uniquely owning a word or name that's common

108
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:51,699
today, but the potential number of names
that can be made

109
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:56,550
is really hardy.
In fact, before we run out of those

110
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,689
our species will likely evolve to
communicate in a completely different

111
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:01,250
way.

112
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,870
Also, names aren't

113
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,990
just labels.

114
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,360
A name on a screen, a username,
a handle, a screen name

115
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,600
doesn't always act exactly like

116
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,360
its owner.
User names can travel

117
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,939
more quickly and more widely than
flesh-and-blood people

118
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:26,550
and do things that their puppeteers
wouldn't normally do

119
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,699
away from the keyboard.
It's called the

120
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,250
online disinhibition effect.
If you can't

121
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,220
see the people you're interacting with
and they can't see you,

122
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,590
you're all just online hiding behind
different names than usual,

123
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:45,669
why hold back?
I mean, clearly such a system can't be

124
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,930
serious business.
On the Internet

125
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,129
no one knows you're a dog.
Why be nice or

126
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:55,629
tell the truth?
The subreddit KarmaCourt

127
00:07:55,629 --> 00:08:00,879
investigates and uncovers people who may
think that the less face-to-face nature

128
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,449
of the Internet makes lies easier to get away with.

129
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:08,300
Like this person, who posted an image
suggesting that they've been single

130
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,770
for a year but had users found out posted

131
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:14,519
three months earlier a picture of

132
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:17,990
my girlfriend's cat.
These behaviors aren't

133
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,439
just what humans do when they can be anonymous

134
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:27,389
or can hide behind different names,
these behaviors can also be caused

135
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:32,729
by the names themselves.
Studies have found that the username you use

136
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,038
can impact how you behave.

137
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:40,278
Your own pre-existing stereotypes and
expectations of certain words,

138
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:44,200
shapes, colors can be confirmed by your behavior,

139
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,180
in the same way that studies have found
NFL and NHL players

140
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:51,899
play more aggressively when wearing black uniforms.

141
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,578
Studies have also found that the more sexualized

142
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:59,879
an avatar is you make someone use,
the more conscious they will be

143
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:04,559
of their own body image.
And the more an avatar resembles you,

144
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,309
the more correlated you watching it exercise

145
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:11,359
is with you being more likely

146
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,659
to exercise more.
It's called

147
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:17,870
the Proteus effect.
The features of a

148
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,759
cyberspace version of yourself,
a username and avatar

149
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:24,819
can actually change you, the

150
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:30,290
meat space "IRL" you.
Usernames and avatars then

151
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:33,879
aren't just handles attached to us.

152
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:37,000
Psychologically, we often interact with them

153
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,179
as if they're friends, distinct beings

154
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:44,338
we created. They help us out

155
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:48,170
but they also can influence us,

156
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:52,639
egg us on, dare us to do things we
wouldn't normally do because they offer

157
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,689
us protection,

158
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,290
entertainment.
Some make us feel safe,

159
00:09:57,289 --> 00:10:00,828
professional, funny, dangerous,

160
00:10:00,828 --> 00:10:04,269
attractive.
We want cool ones.

161
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:07,370
The cool ones make us look cool.

162
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,879
As we go about our daily lives and vie for

163
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:15,149
attention, we are more and more
frequently doing so

164
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:19,669
with another name and exclusively
through that name

165
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:23,399
only.
So, it becomes quite interesting that

166
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,759
we're not going to run out of them
anytime soon.

167
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,439
In fact, they might run out of us first and

168
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,490
may, in many ways, run

169
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,289
us.

170
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,740
And as always,

171
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,060
thanks for watching.
