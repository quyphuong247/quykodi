00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,390
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:10,320
Gravity is a property of matter, anything
with mass. This includes the Moon, Earth,

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:19,460
Jupiter, the Sun, and even you - your body.
In fact, if you kinda like somebody, have

4
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:27,129
them stand 3/4 of a millimeter away from you.
At that distance, cumulatively, every atom

5
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:33,339
in your body and every atom in their body
will draw you two together with the same gravitational

6
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:38,500
force that the Sun is exerting on you right now.

7
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:44,030
Of course, we don't feel either of those forces
because compared to the gravitational influence

8
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,789
of the Earth, they are basically nothing.
You don't need to concern yourself with the gravitational

9
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:55,329
attraction between you and someone you're
hugging, or, your individual body and the

10
00:00:55,329 --> 00:01:00,649
Sun, 150 million kilometres away.
In fact, the Sun may as well not exist.

11
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,439
What if the Sun disappeared?

12
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:11,679
Well, to be sure, it's not going to happen.
The Sun will die billions of years from now

13
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,430
by expanding, boiling off our oceans
and swallowing the Earth whole.

14
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:22,210
The Sun is not going to simply disappear.
Matter and energy don't vanish. Of course,

15
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:28,158
matter can quantum tunnel to different locations,
but on the scale of the Sun there is not

16
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,030
enough time in the lifetime of millions and
billions of universes for such a probability

17
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,899
to even be worth discussing.

18
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:41,099
But let's discuss it anyway, as a thought
experiment to determine how the Earth would

19
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:48,349
get along with no Sun.
What will the Earth do and what can it do alone?

20
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:55,140
At the exact moment that the Sun disappeared,
we would have no idea. Because it takes light

21
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:01,439
from the Sun 8 minutes and 20 seconds to
reach Earth. So, for a little over 8 minutes

22
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:08,149
after the Sun disappeared, we would have no
idea. Once we did, confusion and mass panic

23
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:10,009
would, most likely, ensue.

24
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:15,939
The Sun's gravitational grasp on our planet
would also take 8 minutes and 20 seconds to

25
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:21,500
end. This is because gravity waves propagate
at the speed of light. So, the very moment

26
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,909
we saw our Sun disappear, we would also lose
its gravitational influence and Earth would

27
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:32,729
fly out in a straight line,
tangent to wherever it was in its orbit.

28
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:39,229
The finite speed of light and gravity mean
that as panic and fear spread across the Earth

29
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:45,609
at the loss of our Sun, we could still, for
a while, look up into the sky and see our planetary

30
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:50,430
buddies, further out, continuing to operate
as if nothing had happened.

31
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:56,849
For instance, Jupiter would continue orbiting
and reflecting light from a Sun that no longer

32
00:02:56,848 --> 00:03:02,419
existed for about 30 minutes after the Earth
already knew the Sun was gone. And, depending

33
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:06,780
on where Jupiter was in its orbit, it would
take another 30 minutes to an hour for us

34
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,830
to watch the reflected light of Jupiter snuff out.

35
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:17,379
With no moonlight or sunlight, the universe
itself would be our only source of visible

36
00:03:17,378 --> 00:03:18,658
light from space.

37
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:26,758
In 2004, Abdul Ahad calculated that the Milky
Way contributes about as much light as 1/300th

38
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:31,739
of a full Moon. So there would be enough light
from space for us to see around a bit. But,

39
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:37,280
of course, electricity and fossil fuels would
still be usable for a while. So, cities and

40
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,628
towns could continue to be lit by manmade
sources, just like a typical night; except,

41
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:46,188
it would be night everywhere.

42
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:53,628
Photosynthesis would stop immediately, and
this is huge. I had a great discussion about

43
00:03:53,628 --> 00:03:58,128
this video with Henry from MinutePhysics,
and the new channel MinuteEarth. If you're

44
00:03:58,128 --> 00:04:01,739
not subscribed to MinuteEarth, you definitely should be.

45
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:08,450
In one of his episodes there, he mentions
that 99.9% of the natural productivity on

46
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:15,109
Earth is done by photosynthesis, which requires
the Sun. Without the Sun, plants would no

47
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:21,550
longer be able to inhale carbon dioxide and
exhale life-sustaining oxygen.

48
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:28,879
But, don't worry. Collectively, all of us
humans, all 7 billion of us, breathe in about

49
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:37,100
6 trillion kilos of oxygen every year.
But our atmosphere contains a whopping quintillion

50
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:43,200
kilos of oxygen. So, even without photosynthesis,
and, including all the other animals, and

51
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,000
insects, and microorganisms that consume oxygen,
it would take us thousands of years to run

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,839
out.

53
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:55,199
The poor plants themselves would be much
worse off. Without the Sun, most of them would

54
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,920
die within days or weeks. Except for large
plants. Giants trees, for instance, contain

55
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:08,600
enough sugar for energy that they could technically
live in the dark for years. Their problem

56
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,370
is going to be that the Earth will get quite
cold. In fact, mighty trees would freeze to

57
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:21,129
death. Their blood, the water and sap inside
of them, solidify way before they died of starvation.

58
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:27,810
Right now, with our Sun, the average surface
temperature on Earth, hot places and cold

59
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:33,769
places, and different seasons all considered,
is an arguably comfortable 14 to 15 degrees

60
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:35,219
Celsius.

61
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,760
Without the Sun to add energy, the Earth would
radiate away heat exponentially, meaning

62
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:47,060
it would go fast at first and then happen
more and more slowly. By the end of the first

63
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:53,120
week without the Sun, the average surface
temperature across Earth would be freezing.

64
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,399
Zero Celsius, 32 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Now, temperature's like this happen all the time

65
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,899
on Earth, we're used to it. Panic and fear 
and looters and anarchy aside, for the first

66
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:06,769
few days or months, we could get by.

67
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:13,589
But by the end of the first year without
the Sun, the average global surface temperature

68
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:18,659
would be -73 degrees Celsius, -100 Fahrenheit.

69
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:24,760
The best option, really, would be to move
to geothermal areas like Yellowstone or Iceland.

70
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:31,180
These places would be the few safe havens
for human life after the Sun. Nearly all life

71
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:39,840
on Earth exists because of, and is dependent
upon, extraterrestrial energy: the Sun. But

72
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:46,350
the Earth produces its own heat. Despite floating
in the coldness of space for billions of years,

73
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,750
down below the crust the Earth is quite warm.

74
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:55,470
20% of this warmth came from the fact that
when the Earth formed, mass crushed so tightly

75
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:01,140
in the middle that the pressure liquified rock.
The other 80% of Earth's internal heat

76
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:06,099
comes from that fact that deep in its core,
radioactive elements decay, providing the

77
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:11,379
energy needed to keep the Earth's core at
5,000 degrees Celsius.

78
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:16,600
Anyone who failed to secure a position within
one of these bastions of warmth, or, perhaps,

79
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,550
underground in a community warmed and powered
by nuclear fuel, would likely be dead within

80
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,410
the first year of no Sun.

81
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:33,510
In the next 10 or 20 years things would start
to get wet with dew. But not with glorious

82
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:40,990
water droplets. Instead, droplets of liquid air.
The air would literally become cold enough

83
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:47,500
for the gasses that make it up to condense,
or form clouds and precipitate, first as rain,

84
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,899
and then as it got colder and colder,
eventually, as snow.

85
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:58,250
In Fritz Leiber's famous science-fiction short
story "A Pail of Air," this has already happened.

86
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:03,459
The Earth was ripped away from the Sun, and,
in order to survive, a family must go outdoors

87
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:09,909
in a special suit and scoop up a pale of just
the oxygen snow, bring it back in, and place

88
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,100
it over a fire to warm and allow them to breathe.

89
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:20,790
A year or so after the sun disappeared, Earth's
oceans will have frozen over. Ice all the

90
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:28,840
way across. But ice is less dense than liquid
water, which means that ice floats. And ice

91
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:37,360
is a pretty decent insulator.
So, for billions of years after the Sun disappeared, liquid

92
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,830
water could still exist at the bottom of our
oceans, protected and insulated from space

93
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:49,520
by miles of ice above it, and warmed by vents
on the ocean floor that spew water out, super

94
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,269
heated by Earth's interior.

95
00:08:52,269 --> 00:09:00,889
This would continue on Earth for a very, very
long time - Sun or no Sun. Instead of becoming

96
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:07,889
frozen and lifeless, extremophiles, like microbes,
that live around hydrothermal vents deep in

97
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:13,199
the ocean, would be fine. They live deep in
the ocean, far below the point where sunlight

98
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:20,210
can penetrate, and they make energy not through
photosynthesis, but via chemosynthesis - converting

99
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:25,430
heat and methane and sulphur into the energy
they need. They are then eaten by clams and

100
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:26,250
tubeworms.

101
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:32,279
Extremophiles deposit minerals back into the
vents, meaning that their food chain is complete.

102
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:40,120
It's a circle. It's independent of the Sun.
Earthlings like them would thrive if the Sun

103
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,149
were to disappear. They would live just fine
without every knowing that the Sun was gone.

104
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:51,199
Or, honestly, without ever even knowing it
existed in the first place.

105
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:58,980
It's amazing to think that life, here on Earth,
all alone, flying through space with no Sun,

106
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:07,340
would kind of be fine. Far from becoming a
frozen dead rock, or a boring dormant seed,

107
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:14,440
the Earth would be a spaceship, carrying living
passengers with enough geothermal heat for

108
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,430
billions of years of life.

109
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:22,239
If the Sun disappeared, spaceship Earth would
fly out in a straight line covering about

110
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:31,210
30 kilometres every single second. After just 1 billion
years, it will have covered 900 quadrillion

111
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:38,870
kilometres or about 100,000 lightyears - a trip that
could potentially take it all the way across

112
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:46,730
our galaxy, near thousands of stars.
And nothing's to say it couldn't fall into orbit around one,

113
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:55,840
thaw out, and allow its still-living extremophiles
to proliferate life on Earth all over again;

114
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:01,660
maybe one day developing life intelligent
enough to uncover whatever is left of our

115
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:05,480
lives.
Maybe they could even find this very video.

116
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,620
In which case, hi, uh, you're welcome

117
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,399
for this video about your planet's history and journey.

118
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:18,500
And, um, as always,

119
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:19,819
 thanks for watching.
