00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,980
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. This is a completely still

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,990
image but as your eye reads well I'm
saying and jumps from word to word,

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,150
the paragraph will appear to slightly, just

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,339
subtly, wave and boil. The allusion is called anomalous

5
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:20,820
motion. It's neat. But to say it's fun

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,089
is tautology because the word

7
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:27,410
illusion literally means to have fun,

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,050
to mock, to play with. But illusions aren't

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,239
just fun and games. They also teach us

10
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,820
about our brains. Anomalous motion,

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,859
for instance, demonstrates that our brains process

12
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:44,308
things at different rates and piece by piece.

13
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:48,699
After a saccade, a quick eye movement, higher contrast

14
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,000
elements are perceived sooner than lower contrast

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,119
ones. When arranged in just the right way,
this delay is exploited

16
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:59,119
and your visual system only has one explanation.

17
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,608
Low contrast parts of the image
didn't get processed later

18
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,780
because this myelinated machine is
wrong but rather because the image

19
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,420
itself

20
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,790
must be moving. Akiyoshi Kitaoka's brilliant

21
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,770
"Out of focus" causes nearby neurones to
disagree about the little slices they

22
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:19,408
each detect. Some see big changes

23
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,070
after a saccade and some see hardly any.
This makes it difficult for our brains

24
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:26,219
to calculate and factor in the effect

25
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:29,349
of our own eye movements, so the image itself

26
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:33,459
appears to be moving. But illusions aren't just about

27
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:36,629
moving. They can also be

28
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:39,688
moving, poignant, significant,

29
00:01:39,688 --> 00:01:43,368
practical. They can mean the difference
between life and death,

30
00:01:43,368 --> 00:01:46,549
like in nature or during World War I

31
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:52,890
as dazzle paint on ships.
This form of camouflage doesn't conceal the object

32
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:53,659
but rather

33
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:57,600
makes it difficult for an enemy to ascertain its prey's

34
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,728
true shape and thus where it's heading

35
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:04,009
or how fast it's going. In 1955

36
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:08,509
the Soviet Union displayed their new
Bison and Bear long-range bombers

37
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:12,039
at an air show. It looked like they had

38
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:17,479
a lot. Afraid of falling behind, the US
ramped up production on their own

39
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:20,929
B-52 bomber. But the whole thing

40
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,439
was an illusion. In the Soviet's film of the air show

41
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:28,859
the same few planes had been flown
past the camera multiple times

42
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,050
in formations that gave the illusion of
them having more bombers

43
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,080
than they really did. By the end of the
1950s the Soviet Union

44
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,730
only had about 150 long-range bombers,

45
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:44,159
whereas the Americans, fooled

46
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,090
by the illusion, had built nearly 2,000

47
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,789
at a cost of 900 million dollars.

48
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:56,400
Architecture is full of examples of real-world practical

49
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,060
optical illusions. My favorite are Disney castles.

50
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,370
They appear huge but it's

51
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,379
forced perspective - a lie. The tops

52
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:11,959
appear further away from us because they are actually

53
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:14,419
quite tiny.

54
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,659
Illusions also tell us about ourselves culturally.

55
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:22,099
The MÃ¼ller-Lyer illusion is classic.

56
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,150
The horizontal lines are all the same
length but the bottom ones

57
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,489
appear longer to people from Western cultures,

58
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:33,378
familiar with our rules of perspective
and man-made straight lines.

59
00:03:33,378 --> 00:03:36,628
However, bushmen from
Southern Africa and tribespeople

60
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:40,259
from northern Angola or the Ivory Coast aren't

61
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:44,000
fooled at all. Akiyoshi Kitaoka

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,158
is using optical illusions to discover glaucoma

63
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:50,378
earlier than current techniques can. And

64
00:03:50,378 --> 00:03:54,318
anamorphic illusions are used to save lives.

65
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:59,158
They look weird from any perspective but one,
from which they seem to pop out

66
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:02,158
defying the environment's actual shape.

67
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,438
Hoping to remind drivers to always pay attention

68
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:10,120
traffic safety organizations in
West Vancouver, Canada placed a skewed

69
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,670
decal on the road. From the right perspective,

70
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:17,978
the perspective of the driver in this case,
it becomes a 3D illusion of a child

71
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:19,909
you are about to hit.

72
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:25,100
Slow down. Brusspub has made some
incredible examples of the 3D effect

73
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,810
such illusions can happen.

74
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,280
This object? Just an anamorphic projection.

75
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,739
Anamorphic illusions have also
been used to safely practice

76
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,240
political dissent.

77
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:39,199
In 1746

78
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,699
supporters of the Stuart claim to the British throne

79
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,579
had to be quiet about it. It was treasonous.

80
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:50,120
So, sympathizers served things on

81
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,569
trays that looked like this.

82
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:57,339
Innocuous enough until only supporters

83
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,989
were around.
And it was safe for someone to place a reflective

84
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,978
goblet or cylinder on the tray,
revealing the tray's anamorphic secret a

85
00:05:05,978 --> 00:05:07,469
hidden portrait

86
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,930
of their elicit love, Charles Edward Stuart himself.

87
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,410
The Encyclopedia Titanica lists descriptions

88
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,530
of everybody recovered from the Titanic.

89
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:23,409
It's quite macabre. Why was the iceberg

90
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,600
not seen until it was too late?

91
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,930
And why did the nearest ship - the Californian -

92
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:34,509
not come to the Titanic's rescue sooner?

93
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:37,840
Tragic questions whose answers might be

94
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,978
optical

95
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:42,699
illusions. The Titanic was sailing through conditions

96
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:45,059
perfect for mirages.

97
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,079
This theory points out that the Titanic sank

98
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,629
at the border of the warmer Gulf Stream
and the frigid Labrador Current,

99
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:56,319
where the normal case of cooler air at higher altitudes

100
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,339
was inverted - a thermal inversion.

101
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:03,579
Now, because the temperature of air
effects its index of refraction,

102
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:07,250
a thermal inversion means light bending

103
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,459
in a typical ways. If light reaches the eye

104
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:14,918
from higher up than usual, objects can appear to float.

105
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:18,759
Seriously. Like this ship off the coast of Australia.

106
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:23,439
A thermal inversion can also render
objects completely unrecognizable,

107
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,000
hidden within a haze, like this ship(?)

108
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,418
Or like an iceberg.

109
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:33,788
Or a sinking ship in need of help.

110
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,879
The Delboeuf illusion may be causing

111
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:40,819
teeth to split and crack more often than they should

112
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:43,480
when dentists drill holes in them.

113
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,379
Doctor Robert O'Shea observed

114
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:49,199
8 practicing dentists and found that
they were all drilling holes

115
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,870
that were too big, 
even though they knew the correct size

116
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,269
to be drilling.

117
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,480
Why? Well, it may be the same reason people

118
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,530
eat more food when they're given a bigger plate.

119
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:06,069
Objects appear smaller when enclosed by larger areas.

120
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:10,399
Holes of the same size may appear
different sizes on bigger

121
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,089
teeth. Dentists may be deciding that correctly sized

122
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:17,759
holes drilled in the teeth need to be made larger,

123
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,439
not because they do, but because perception

124
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,139
is a tricky thing.

125
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:26,219
Illusions affect not only big ships and

126
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,740
teeth but also your future.

127
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:35,538
The End of History Illusion is our
tendency to think of ourselves today

128
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,079
as somehow done.

129
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:39,139
Sure.

130
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:42,978
I went through a lot of personal growth
and changes in taste

131
00:07:42,978 --> 00:07:46,589
in the past, but today, who I am now,

132
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:48,789
this is pretty much the final me.

133
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,740
But that's not true.

134
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,990
Studies have consistently shown that
people underestimate just how

135
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,560
different they will be, say, 10 years in the future,

136
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,639
even though they can easily point out
how much they've changed

137
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,848
since 10 years ago.
I like how Daniel Tomasulo puts it:

138
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:10,110
"We believe we are going to live, love,

139
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,729
and long for where, who,
and what we are thinking about

140
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:18,028
right now.
But the research says it just ain't so.

141
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,300
This too is a transient state."

142
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:25,538
Yogi Berra put it even more succinctly: "The future

143
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,618
ain't what it used to be."

144
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,978
Their advice

145
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:32,439
is don't imagine your future.

146
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,740
Look at other people and their
experiences instead, take their advice.

147
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,450
Your imagination is just that, their experiences

148
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,730
are actual data. Well, of course,

149
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,700
it's not that simple. Which brings us to our final

150
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,070
illusion: The illusion of control.

151
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:57,740
Named by psychologist Ellen Langer,
it's our tendency to believe we control the

152
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,139
outcomes of things.

153
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:02,220
We demonstrably don't.

154
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:05,620
It can help motivate us to not give up

155
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,839
and, in healthy people at a healthy level, it is

156
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,039
optimistic self-appraisal.

157
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,639
But it's a lie.

158
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:17,198
In one study, traders in the City of
London's investment banks were shown a

159
00:09:17,198 --> 00:09:17,789
graph

160
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:20,929
of a real time stock price and given three

161
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:24,278
buttons that secretly didn't do anything

162
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:28,458
to affect the price.
But they were told the buttons might have an effect -

163
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,739
try them out, see what you can do.

164
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,289
Afterwards, the traders were asked to
rate how much they felt they had been

165
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:38,259
able to control the stock price

166
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:41,569
with the useless buttons. And it turns out

167
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:47,110
the traders who reported the greatest
sense of control over the stock price

168
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,750
were the ones who scored lowest
on risk management tests

169
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,208
and, in the real world, contributed the least

170
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,828
to their company's profits and in terms of salary

171
00:09:57,828 --> 00:09:59,528
made the least money.

172
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,240
It's kind of a bummer.
The illusion of control is a nice feeling

173
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,610
but sometimes it's fine,
sometimes it even pays handsomely to admit

174
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,860
you don't have control.

175
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,740
And as always,
