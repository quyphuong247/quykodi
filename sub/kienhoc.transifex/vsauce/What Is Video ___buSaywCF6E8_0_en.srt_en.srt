1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,060
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here,
and I just got back from

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,459
VidCon. The entire convention was
incredible, but the whole time I was

3
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:07,099
there

4
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:11,619
I thought a lot about video.
We all watch video

5
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:15,239
and many of us work with video,
but what is it? I mean, what really

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,920
is video? Well, guess what, today
we're gonna take a look.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,949
To begin I think we should start all
the way down at the bottom

8
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,300
with language.
What does the word record mean?

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,760
The story behind the word 'record' is
actually quite cool and makes me a little

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,760
sentimental.

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,690
The word 'record' comes from the Latin,
where "re" means

12
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:38,439
again and "cor" means the heart or the soul.

13
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:42,199
So when you record something you are
literally bringing it back

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,039
into your heart, bringing it back into your
soul, remembering it.

15
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,289
Now, that sounds really nice and pretty,
but it actually had more to do with the

16
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:49,700
fact that

17
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,440
ancient people thought that the heart
was we were stored memories, not the brain.

18
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:57,459
The reason a sequence of still images
can appear to be moving

19
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:01,489
is an effect known as "beta movement."
If images move fast enough

20
00:01:01,488 --> 00:01:04,938
our brain can't comprehend them as
separate images and the illusion of

21
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:05,609
motion

22
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:09,170
is created.
Now, for a very long time we recorded

23
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,960
moving images on photographic film,
but later on

24
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,789
a new way of capturing moving images
came about and it was called

25
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,189
"video."
Video comes from the Latin for "I see"

26
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:24,258
and rather than preserving a moving
image chemically on celluloid

27
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:28,549
photographic film stock,
video is an electronic

28
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:33,220
representation of the moving image.
Now in the real world stuff just

29
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:37,158
happens. The things just continuously
happen. But in the world of a camera,

30
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,118
whether it's film

31
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:41,790
or video camera, it's almost always in
the form of frame rates.

32
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,570
Pictures of the world taken at a
certain speed that are then quickly gone

33
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:46,078
through

34
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,658
producing, through beta movement,
the illusion of movement.

35
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:53,750
When a camera records at a lower frame
rate, playback often looks

36
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,649
jittery and skips like this. More frames
per second means that more information

37
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,109
is taken every second

38
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:03,609
leading to more fluidity.
But that leads to a whole can of worms,

39
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:06,618
which is a great transition to a
conversation I had with Dylan from

40
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:08,118
HouseholdHacker at VidCon.

41
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,280
Roll the tape.

42
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,800
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here, and I am in the bathroom at VidCon and I've got a special guest. Right outside

43
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,260
it's Dylan from HouseholdHacker.
Hey, what's going on everyone?

44
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:24,068
You know, I got a good question for you
based on frame rates and what not. What would you

45
00:02:24,068 --> 00:02:24,549
say

46
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:31,050
the human eye sees as a frame rate? Very good question. What frame rate do we see the world in with our

47
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,099
eyeballs?
I mean,

48
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:35,409
how fast does information travel
from our eye to our brain?

49
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:39,729
It obviously can't be too low,
because fast objects don't look like they're

50
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:40,539
skipping,

51
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:44,979
they look pretty fluid. Well, it's a little bit of a
trick question because our eyes

52
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:48,878
are not cameras.
Instead, they track onto objects

53
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,219
and receive a continuous flow of photons
onto the retina

54
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:55,250
sending information via a chemical reaction

55
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,150
to the brain. Now, here's what we do now.
The visual cortex in our brain

56
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,408
usually holds that information
from our retina for about a fifteenth

57
00:03:02,408 --> 00:03:06,400
of a second. So if an animation moves
fifteen frames a second

58
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,719
or faster, it's gonna look nice and fluid.
But

59
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,568
if it's lower than fifteen frames a second,
our brain's not fooled by the beta

60
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,158
movement

61
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:19,699
and it'll look like it's skipping. So, basically,
the faster the frame rate, the better

62
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:24,268
everything's gonna look in the end. Here's the thing.
If frame rates get higher and higher,

63
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:27,500
you wind up with an image that can
actually cause headaches when people

64
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,549
watch it on the screen.

65
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:31,989
Uhm... Here, I'll explain why.
Hold this camera for a second.

66
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:35,450
Oh yeah, no problem.
So back to the point

67
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:39,060
about our eyes tracking onto objects.
If I do this -

68
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,709
move my hand in front of my face and
track it with my eyes -

69
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:47,340
I can see my hand, it makes sense. But at
a certain point my hand will move so fast

70
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,239
that it's just a blur and the reason
it's a blur is because my eye

71
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,890
can only track so fast. And when objects move
faster than our eyeballs can track, your brain

72
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:57,529
adds in

73
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,900
motion blur. That way we get a sense of
movement happening,

74
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,140
but we don't see something like a hand randomly

75
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:07,818
appearing all over the place.
But this becomes a problem with new

76
00:04:07,818 --> 00:04:09,658
high-definition programs on

77
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:13,639
big televisions, because some of those
programs are brought to your TV

78
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:16,949
at frame rates as high as a 1000 frames a second.

79
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:20,739
And objects, like a tennis ball,
that normally travels so fast

80
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:24,439
our eyes can't track them and they look blurry
don't look blurry,

81
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:28,240
because the camera is able to see them
clearly. And when you watch that program

82
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,970
on TV

83
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,470
you can actually get a headache or get
dizzy, so they're having to find ways to

84
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,650
add blur

85
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:37,159
back into HD pictures.
Pretty neat, right?

86
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,380
That's great information. How did you
learn this? That's what I'm here for, man.

87
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:45,918
Thank you. See you.
See you.

88
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,118
You know, the bathroom. You know.
I heard you coming out. Did you wash your hands?

89
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,160
Uhm, yeah.

90
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,829
So there you go. Some cool facts about
video that I learned while I was flying

91
00:04:58,829 --> 00:04:59,589
to

92
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:03,719
and from VidCon from New York to LA.
It was a long flight, but I learned a lot

93
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,509
and I wanna end with some numbers about
YouTube specifically.

94
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:11,259
YouTube host videos from all over the world.
Massive,

95
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:14,840
massive amounts.
In fact, every minute of the day

96
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:18,750
people are uploading video to YouTube.
And if you were to take all the video

97
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,550
uploaded to YouTube at any given minute,
all together it would equal

98
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:27,250
48 hours. That's right.
Two full days of video

99
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,699
are uploaded to YouTube every single
minute. You guys are part of something

100
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:35,199
gigantic. All right, now later this week
I'll have a new episode of IMG.

101
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,569
And soon enough we'll have episodes of
DONG, LÃœt, it's gonna be super cool, so be

102
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:40,579
sure you're subscribed so you don't miss anything.

103
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:41,620
And as always,

104
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,000
thanks for watching.

105
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,460
They're not, they're not the same person.
