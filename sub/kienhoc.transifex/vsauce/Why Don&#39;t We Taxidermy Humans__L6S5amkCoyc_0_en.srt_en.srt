1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,649
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And when you die,

2
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:08,309
what happens to your body?
It can be buried

3
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:11,428
or cremated or donated to science,

4
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,000
but are those your only options?
I mean,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,719
what if I wanted to be taxidermied, like my friend here?

6
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:23,219
What if I requested to have my body
stuffed and mounted in some hilarious

7
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:24,219
position, like

8
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:27,538
a permanent high five, so people could high five

9
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,769
my actual skin forever?

10
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:34,558
Well, it turns out to be quite complicated.

11
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,109
So let's begin with an easier and more flexible solution.

12
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:41,909
Cremation and ashes.
Twelve

13
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:45,199
humans have walked on the Moon.
But

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,899
300 humans have been buried in outer space.

15
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,960
With the right connections and budget
you can have a portion of your

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,100
ashes launched into space.
The very first space burial

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,340
occurred in 1997, when a rocket deposited the ashes

18
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,609
of 24 people into orbit around Earth.

19
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:09,849
In 1999, human remains were first

20
00:01:09,849 --> 00:01:14,688
buried on the Moon.
A lunar prospector probe dropped some scientific

21
00:01:14,688 --> 00:01:15,469
instruments

22
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:19,109
and some of the cremated
remains of Eugene Shoemaker,

23
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:22,349
co-discoverer of the comet Shoemakerâ€“Levy 9.

24
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:26,000
But the first human to have their remains

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,019
leave our solar system will be

26
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:32,640
Clyde Tombaugh, the guy who discovered Pluto.

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,299
In 2006, some of his ashes were launched
aboard the New Horizons probe,

28
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:41,500
which will arrive near Pluto in 2015,

29
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,978
take some recordings and pictures and
then continue on

30
00:01:44,978 --> 00:01:49,129
beyond our solar system.
You don't need to get all

31
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:52,938
outer spacey to have fun with you ashes.
Right here on earth

32
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:56,758
there are companies that will take carbon
from your remains and expose them to

33
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,618
extreme heat and pressure

34
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,799
long enough that you wind up with a diamond

35
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,610
made out of you. It can be cut and
polished. One woman even had it done with

36
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:06,819
the

37
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:10,449
ashes of "Meowy," her cat.

38
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:13,829
The point here is that you can be quite creative

39
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,580
with cremated remains.
But ashes don't

40
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,230
look like you did when you were alive, so let's revisit

41
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:27,149
taxidermy. The shapes and combinations
that animals have been taxidermied into

42
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,319
are quite creative.
For instance, an actual

43
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:33,848
pig turned into an actual piggy bank.

44
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:37,299
A bird light fixture.
A goat

45
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,999
that's also a bagpipe.

46
00:02:40,998 --> 00:02:42,818
Doves turned into

47
00:02:42,818 --> 00:02:46,568
shoes.
And, of course, the guy who taxidermied his

48
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:49,888
cat into a remote-controlled quadcopter.

49
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,699
Taxidermy doesn't preserve

50
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:57,098
every part of your body.
It is taxi

51
00:02:57,098 --> 00:03:00,759
dermy - the arrangement of skin,

52
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:05,500
which is okay.
I mean, taxidermy won't bother to preserve

53
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,750
all of your internal organs, but your skin

54
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:14,729
is your largest organ.
Your skin comprises anywhere from 12 to 15 percent

55
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:18,188
of your total body weight plus it's an
organ that people

56
00:03:18,188 --> 00:03:23,299
see and recognize you by.
But here's one of the problems.

57
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:28,669
When animals are taxidermied,
their skin is removed and then mounted

58
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:32,819
on a mannequin.
A shape that resembles the animal,

59
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:36,488
but is made of wood or wall and wire or foam.

60
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:41,099
That's fine for museums.
But the use of a generic

61
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:45,039
mannequin can lead to an animal that looks generic.

62
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:49,628
All of the tiny, subtle, but very important
features of the animals'

63
00:03:49,628 --> 00:03:54,289
cartilage, fat, muscles are more difficult to recreate

64
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:57,568
after it's dead and all you have is its skin.

65
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,608
That's why many taxidermists hesitate

66
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:04,079
to taxidermy a person's beloved pet.

67
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,409
Because in order to satisfy the client,
an immense amount of specificity is

68
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:09,198
required.

69
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,540
Even more so if you were trying to recreate a person.

70
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:17,319
So, taxidermy may not be the best way to
preserve yourself

71
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:22,300
or your daddy or your mummy...
Mummies.

72
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,460
What about them?
Well, let's go back to the 19th century

73
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:31,569
and Jeremy Bentham. When he died, the
philosopher requested that his body be

74
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:36,199
mummified as best as technology would allow
and his body dressed up in clothes

75
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:40,439
and displayed at the University College
of London. It periodically still

76
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:45,209
is, but the mummification didn't turn
out perfectl, so he's really just

77
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:48,848
a skeleton dressed up in clothes and stuffed.

78
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:52,769
The head wound up looking a bit too
wrinkled and the color was off

79
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:57,060
and so a wax head was made.
You can check out a 3D photograph

80
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,769
of Jeremy Bentham online.
And who could forget

81
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:04,698
the dried out mummified middle finger of Galileo?

82
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:08,639
We still have it and it's on display in Florence.

83
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,449
It's a great thing to visit if you want
a pivotal historical figure

84
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:17,319
to flip you off.
But we're looking for a way to preserve ourselves

85
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:20,490
realistically, as we appear while living.

86
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,538
So, let's take a look at embalming.
Not

87
00:05:23,538 --> 00:05:27,120
all corpses are embalmed before they're
buried, but embalming

88
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,379
is a great technique for preserving a body,

89
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:33,838
slowing down decomposition,
so it can stay above ground and

90
00:05:33,838 --> 00:05:36,899
be displayed a little bit longer.
Now, if

91
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:41,269
a body is embalmed really really well
it can be preserved

92
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:46,069
longer than you might think.
Abraham Lincoln was embalmed so well

93
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:50,408
that even though his coffin has been moved 17 times

94
00:05:50,408 --> 00:05:54,528
since he was buried and the casket opened five times,

95
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:58,550
on each of those occasions,
including the most recent in 1901,

96
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,038
people said "yeah, still looks like Lincoln."

97
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,560
On an even more extreme scale are the
bodies of people like Mao

98
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,560
and Lenin, which continue to be on display

99
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,500
to this day. The bodies require special
treatments multiple times a week.

100
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,149
The exact techniques and embalming fluids
used to preserve Lenin

101
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:22,848
are kept secret, 
but they've kept him preserved for more than

102
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:27,819
80 years.
Well embalmed bodies can be displayed

103
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:30,879
before being buried in more positions than just

104
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,009
lying down in a coffin.
For instance, leaned up against a wall

105
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:38,080
or riding a motorcycle.

106
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,800
Wow.
But embalming

107
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,709
doesn't last for ever,
and if you try to make it last forever

108
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:50,348
be prepared to spend a lot of money and time.

109
00:06:50,348 --> 00:06:54,629
One method that could be used on humans
and has become popular with pets

110
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:58,588
is similar to instant coffee.
Freeze-drying.

111
00:06:58,588 --> 00:07:01,629
The process involves freezing the animal,

112
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:06,269
so that all of its water solidifies.
And then using a partial vacuum with the

113
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:08,088
pressure so low

114
00:07:08,088 --> 00:07:11,668
that the solid water instantly turns into vapor

115
00:07:11,668 --> 00:07:15,408
and escapes away, leaving a much much lighter

116
00:07:15,408 --> 00:07:18,528
freeze-dried pet.

117
00:07:18,528 --> 00:07:22,449
Unfortunately, when it comes to preserving a human

118
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:26,379
body, as realistically as possible after death,

119
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,759
these methods - freeze-drying, mummification,

120
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,180
taxidermy, long-term embalming are either

121
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,360
unsatisfactory or impractical.

122
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,680
With the exception possibly of a slightly newer method -

123
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,449
plastination.
It's the method used to prepare bodies for exhibits

124
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:51,269
like Body Worlds.
Essentially plastination involves a specimen

125
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:55,060
soaked in a volatile solvent and then placed in a

126
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,949
polymer solution.
In a low-pressure environment

127
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:02,189
the volatile solvent leaves the specimen and

128
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:05,778
the empty space is filled with the polymer solution.

129
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:09,088
The specimen is flexible and can be put into a pose

130
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:12,769
and then the polymer hardened by using special gases.

131
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:17,259
Human bodies that have been plastinated
last a very long time,

132
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:21,459
even at room temperature.
But here's the crazy thing.

133
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,310
It's free.
You can quite easily donate your body

134
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:30,439
to the Institute for Plastination.
It counts as donating your body to science.

135
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:33,979
But here's the thing: you won't necessarily have control

136
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:37,038
over what's done with your body,

137
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,139
because at the end of the day corpses are legally

138
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:44,209
not property.
No one owns

139
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,458
a corpse.
Because a corpse

140
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:51,059
is not legally a piece of property,
no one can just

141
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:54,569
do whatever they want with it.
Your options are severely

142
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,450
limited and even if you you specifically have requested,

143
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:03,629
say, that your body be taxidermied and
all of your surviving can agree and

144
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:05,309
want it to happen,

145
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:09,679
it's very unlikely that a mortuary would
allow that to happen,

146
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,319
and, historically, the law sides

147
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,610
with the mortuary.
For example,

148
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:20,850
in 1994, David Eugene Russell
requested that when he died

149
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,709
his body be skinned,
his skin tanned in the leather

150
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:28,838
and that leather used to bind a book of his writings.

151
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:32,149
He wanted this to happen, as did his surviving widow.

152
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:36,419
But the mortuary refused to do it and
the court sided with the mortuary. So,

153
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:39,979
even if you have a really cool idea for
how your body could be

154
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,769
embalmed forever and displayed in a funny, weird or

155
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:49,028
bizarre way, you're not going to get permission to do so.

156
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:53,399
Plastination winds up being one of
your only options, but you won't have a

157
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,570
lot of control over

158
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,089
what happens to you once plastinated.

159
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:02,010
But hold on a second.
In 1998,

160
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:06,528
Anthony-Noel Kelly was arrested for
stealing anatomical specimens from the

161
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:07,730
Royal College

162
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,740
of Surgeons.
Now, he claimed that he was not guilty of theft,

163
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,120
because a corpse is not a piece of property.
He was merely guilty

164
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,820
of the mistreatment of a corpse.
But the judge ruled

165
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,820
that because these anatomical specimens
had been especially prepared by

166
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,760
licensed and skilled workers at the college,

167
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:31,629
they had become property.
So here's something really strange.

168
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:35,080
If you found a way to get your body taxidermied,

169
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,170
for the benefit of medical science,
