00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,759
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And what do you
say we get outta here...to space and into

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:12,739
an orbit. That way we could just float around
and be free from the influence of gravity.

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,620
Except not really.

4
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:19,119
Astronauts orbiting around the Earth experience
pretty much the same gravitational pull that

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:25,820
you and I are feeling right now. The major
difference is that those astronauts are falling,

6
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:31,389
constantly, towards Earth, but their angular
velocity is so large that they're falling just

7
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:39,009
as fast as Earth curves away from them. Now,
of course, this is nothing New...ton's Cannon

8
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:40,589
hasn't already taught us.

9
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,560
Gravity makes stuff fall and, in particular,
Newton realized that it makes objects accelerate

10
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,670
towards the Earth the same amount independently
of how fast they're moving horizontally. That's

11
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,929
called relativity. And, of course, orbiting
is just falling, but falling where you move

12
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:58,190
horizontally fast enough that the earth falls
away faster. In order to successfully fall

13
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:02,928
and miss the Earth, unless you dug a tunnel,
you need to be travelling at over 17,000 mph

14
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:07,299
or 8 km every second. So, you'd probably
incinerate from friction with the air, well

15
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:09,039
before you had a chance to enjoy the trip.

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,960
Of course, Newton's thought experiment involved
the Earth, but on something smaller, like

17
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:18,759
the Moon, the cannon wouldn't have to throw
its projectile nearly as fast for it to complete

18
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:25,380
an orbit. In fact, if you had a powerful enough
gun on the Moon and you fired that gun at

19
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:30,590
the horizon and then waited a little bit,
you could get hit in the back of the head

20
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,210
by the same bullet.

21
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:37,449
Henry calculated that the bullet would have
to travel about 1,600 m/s, which is exactly

22
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,000
how fast the Paris gun fires.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,450
Now, that's a powerful gun, it's no squirt
gun. But if you had a squirt gun, out there

24
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:52,310
in space, and you fired a stream of water
at the Sun, how much water would it take to

25
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,379
put out the Sun? I mean, in general, putting
water on something hot would cause that something

26
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,879
hot to lose some heat, especially since the
water will be frozen because it's out there

27
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:08,659
in space. But, here's the issue. The Sun is
not a big ball of hydrogen on fire. Instead,

28
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:11,539
the Sun is powered by fusion.

29
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:16,598
Fusion of Hydrogen nuclei, which is kind of
like the chemical bonds between the Hydrogen

30
00:02:16,598 --> 00:02:20,459
and Oxygen that make up water, except on a
much smaller and much more powerful scale.

31
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,199
Now, before I get tackled by nuclear physicists
from one side, and chemists from the other,

32
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,280
let me explain.

33
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,379
A bond of any sort, whether between planets,
molecules, atoms, nuclei or quarks is just

34
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:34,240
a happenstance where two or more particles
together have a lower total energy than when

35
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,400
they were apart. Like if you get married
and your taxes go down. So, when you form

36
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,739
a bond, that extra energy that the two solitary
particles had is released, and because of

37
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:46,699
a little relation we called "E=mcÂ²," this
actually means that the mass of the pair goes

38
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,358
down a little bit too.

39
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:53,259
For example, every fusion reactions turns
a little bit of Hydrogenous mass into light.

40
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:58,780
Sunlight, for example, amounts to a loss of
100 quadrillion kg each year. That's the equivalent

41
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:03,370
of a medium sized asteroid. But stars have
a lot of mass and the more massive a star

42
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,689
is, the hotter it burns. And adding a bunch
of water to the Sun would only cause it to

43
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:14,750
be more massive, so it would burn brighter,
not go out. Of course, it would also burn

44
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,610
faster, which means that its life would be shorter.

45
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:25,480
For instance, if you were to add 20 solar
masses of water to the Sun, you would decrease

46
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:31,849
its life expectancy from the current 5 billion
years to only a few hundred million more years.

47
00:03:31,848 --> 00:03:36,608
But there's a faster way to put out the Sun.
Take that water, or whatever material you

48
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:41,689
want, and shoot it into the Sun in a way that
causes everything to get spread out and scattered,

49
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:47,060
so that there's no longer the critical density
needed for fusion to occur. Now, no matter

50
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:55,780
which avenue of putting out the Sun you pick,
both would be a disaster. Literally, disaster.

51
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,759
From "Dis," meaning "against," and "aster"
meaning star, you would have literally turned

52
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:04,000
our own star against us.

53
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:11,240
If you were somehow able to avoid that disaster
by magically appearing in inter-galactic space,

54
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:17,980
here's a fun experiment to try. Take out your
gun and fire a bullet. That bullet will be

55
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:20,328
forever alone.

56
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,899
That's because the universe is expanding,
and if you were a few megaparsec's away from

57
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:30,399
the nearest galactic cluster, on average those
galaxies would be 200 km father away from

58
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,839
you every passing second. In space terms,
200 km per second is pretty slow. It's barely

59
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,759
as fast as the solar system orbits the center
of the Milky Way. And stars closer to the

60
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,620
center of the galaxy can orbit 10 times faster.
But a measly bullet travels only a few km

61
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,600
every second and would have no chance of reaching
the receding galaxies, ever.

62
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:55,639
It makes you realize how tiny we are compared
to the scale of the universe. But it also

63
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:01,000
makes you realize how close together we all
are here on Earth. Of course, to get from

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,939
one side of the Earth to the other, you have
to fly over half the sphere.

65
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:08,809
So, what if instead there was a tunnel through
the Earth? Let's jump over to my channel,

66
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:13,489
Minute Physics, to see what happens.
Click here and I'll see you on the other side.

67
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,300
Oh, and as always,

68
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,400
thanks for watching.
