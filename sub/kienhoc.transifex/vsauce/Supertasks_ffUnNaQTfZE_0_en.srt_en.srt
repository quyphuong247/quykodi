00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,340
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. Now, one of my favorite
treats of the holiday season is

2
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:29,280
Gabriel's cake. It's a super solid
based on Gabriel's Horn that you can

3
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:38,510
make right at home, as long as your home
is infinitely large. Okay, all right. Now, the

4
00:00:38,509 --> 00:00:44,659
first thing you want to do is bake a
cake. I prepared this cake earlier. It's a

5
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:50,319
real beautiful cake. It's a little large,
but I bet you I could eat that whole

6
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,320
thing in a day if I tried. Am I right?
Okay, now the second step is cut the cake in

7
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,070
half.

8
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,658
Notice that while I cut this cake in half

9
00:01:02,658 --> 00:01:08,120
you don't add or create any new cake but
the surface area of the cake has

10
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,840
increased. It used to be completely
covered and now we've got two regions on

11
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,090
the inside that aren't covered. The next
step is to cut this half, one of the halves,

12
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,409
in half.

13
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:25,880
Here we go. Again, the volume of cake on
the table is the same as it was in the

14
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:30,750
beginning but the surface area is going
up. As you may be able to guess, the next

15
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,109
step is going to be to cut one of these
quarters of the original cake in half.

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,859
It's getting pretty thin, but all you have to
do is keep this up - cutting halves in half

17
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:49,978
and half and half and half forever and
once you've done that, well, you're almost

18
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:55,489
there. When you finish cutting, stack the
halves on top of one another in order,

19
00:01:55,489 --> 00:02:00,769
like this, to create a beautiful tiered
dessert. Because you have an infinite

20
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:05,379
number of thinner and thinner slices
when you're done stacking them the cake's

21
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:10,008
vertical height will be endless.
Such a cake has an interesting

22
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:17,250
mathematical property. Its volume, the
amount of cake it contains, is clearly no

23
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:23,650
different than the amount you started
with, but its surface area is infinite. It's

24
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:29,819
a cake you can eat but not frost.
You would need an infinite amount of frosting

25
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:35,378
to cover the whole thing with a uniform
coat. An object with finite volume but

26
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:40,009
infinite surface area doesn't need to
be endlessly tall, by the way. There are

27
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:45,280
bounded super solids, like this cube,
with an infinite number of smaller and

28
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,560
smaller circular holes.
Of course, building these objects in the real world

29
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,280
comes with some obvious difficulties.
One is the fact that the amount of steps

30
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,468
required to complete the construction of
Gabriel's cake or any other super solid

31
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:08,068
is literally infinitely many.
And infinity isn't a number that, you know,

32
00:03:08,068 --> 00:03:15,668
you eventually get to.
It means unending. There will always be a next step,

33
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:21,090
another piece to slice in half again.
By definition, an infinite sequence of tasks

34
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:27,370
has no last task. So you could never
finish making a super solid.

35
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,419
Or could you?

36
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,939
Enter the Supertask.

37
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:44,439
What if instead of taking the same
amount of time to complete each step we

38
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:50,569
accelerated as we worked and did each
step in half the time as the last? For

39
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:54,659
example, let's say you wanna make
Gabriel's cake in just two minutes.

40
00:03:54,659 --> 00:04:00,319
That's easy. First, cut the original
cake in half and then wait a minute

41
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,109
before making the second cut. Wait half a minute before making the third, a quarter of a minute

42
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:11,220
before the 4th and so on.
Always waiting for half of what's left to pass

43
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:17,529
before cutting again. Since you can keep
dividing in half forever, there will

44
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:25,159
always be another step. Infinite actions
within a finite amount of time is a

45
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,260
supertask. The strange thing, of course,
is that while supertasking no matter

46
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:35,300
how many steps you've already completed
there will always be an infinite amount

47
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:43,710
of steps ahead. But yet, when time's up,
you will have finished all of them. What

48
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:49,359
we've just described is similar to Zeno's
famous paradox of the dichotomy in which

49
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,699
the Greek hero Achilles runs a short race
that he can clearly finish,

50
00:04:54,699 --> 00:05:00,479
I mean, people finish races all the time,
but how exactly it's finished

51
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:06,759
is a mystery. Because first Achilles must
cover half of the race's distance and

52
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:10,519
then half of what's left and half again
and again and again. Since there will

53
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:14,180
always be another half way point to
reach, the number of subdivisions

54
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:21,400
infinite, there is no final destination,
after which Achilles' next stop is the

55
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,359
finish line.

56
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,830
But yet Achilles obviously can finish.
He somehow reaches them all despite the

57
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:34,149
fact that during his journey he always
has an infinite number of steps left to

58
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:41,049
reach. Think about it this way.
What if at each half way step along the way

59
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:46,538
Achilles is required to hold up a flag.
At even steps a blue flag and at odd

60
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:52,188
steps a red flag. Blue, red, blue, red,
blue, red, the flags will alternate faster

61
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:58,430
and faster. But when Achilles finishes
the race, which flag will he be holding

62
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:04,519
up? To be holding up either flag would
seem to suggest that a largest number

63
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:11,418
not only exists, but is either even or
odd. Now, to this it is often suggested

64
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:16,468
that the real problem here is that Achilles
isn't actually doing infinitely

65
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:20,848
many things.
He's just taking a few strides or whatever.

66
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:27,550
A true supertask requires doing
infinitely many distinct actions. Fair

67
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:33,218
enough. But even if Achilles ran the
race in a staccato fashion, stopping at each

68
00:06:33,218 --> 00:06:37,860
half way point for half as long as he waited
to the last one, the scenario would still

69
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,788
be sensical and logical and would
complete in a finite amount of time. It

70
00:06:43,788 --> 00:06:48,348
has even been shown how a staccato
runner could move to avoid discontinuous

71
00:06:48,348 --> 00:06:52,899
velocities and accelerations.
The point is, fine,

72
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:58,908
infinite distinct actions are at least
logically possible to do in a finite

73
00:06:58,908 --> 00:07:05,069
amount of time, but only logically.
Only as a mathematical abstraction.

74
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:11,220
Supertasks are obviously just products of our
imagination. Because in the real world

75
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:17,360
there must be some smallest amount of
space and/or time that cannot be

76
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,588
meaningfully divided in half again.
Once you're within one of these distances of

77
00:07:22,588 --> 00:07:23,819
the finish line,

78
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,900
the only possible next position you can have is the

79
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:34,008
finish line. That certainly seems fair.
After all, it's believed that in reality

80
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:40,069
there is a smallest meaningful distance - the Planck length. Any interactions

81
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:46,079
between or observations of particles
more accurate than this span make no

82
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:51,909
sense within physics as we understand it
today. And the time it would take to

83
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:57,300
travel a Planck length at the fastest
speed possible, the speed of light, is the

84
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:03,689
Planck time. So these seem to be the
briefest pieces of space and time any

85
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:09,870
known force in the universe could act
across. Whether that force is gravity or a

86
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:16,509
force from Achilles' leg muscles.
But does that resolve the crisis or is it

87
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:20,329
just a way of avoiding the problem
altogether by saying "it doesn't matter,

88
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:24,990
because it won't be on the test?"
As John Earman has complained, it seems to

89
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,879
me unattractive to make the truth of
mathematical statements depend on the

90
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:36,860
contingencies of space-time structure.
Maybe Zeno's dichotomy tells us less

91
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:42,028
about motion and time and space and truth
than it does about our impressive

92
00:08:42,028 --> 00:08:49,470
abilities to confuse ourselves.
And that's what makes supertasks important.

93
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:56,330
They're a contact point in uneasy
handshake of sorts between the universe we live

94
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:02,730
in and the brains inside us.
Let's play around with some. They're not all the

95
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:08,778
same. Some converge, like Zeno's dichotomy,
others converge but in ways you may not

96
00:09:08,778 --> 00:09:15,038
expect and still others refuse to
cooperate in any way. They diverge.

97
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:24,509
A great example of a supertask whose
behavior diverges is Thomson's lamp, a

98
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:28,769
famous supertask devised by James F. Thomson.

99
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:35,459
Imagine a lamp that can be turned on and
off as quickly as you desire. What would

100
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:42,328
happen if you turned such a lamp on and
off Zenoianly? Well, let's find out. Just set a

101
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:50,178
timer and turn the lamp on. Then wait
one minute and turn it off. After half a

102
00:09:50,178 --> 00:09:54,938
minute turn it back on and then off
again after a quarter of a minute, on

103
00:09:54,938 --> 00:09:58,019
again after an eighth of a minute and so on.

104
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:02,698
Waiting half as long to flip the switch
each time as you previously did. Now, as the

105
00:10:02,698 --> 00:10:07,729
number of switching grows without bound,
the total time elapsed approaches just

106
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:13,920
two minutes. The lamp will be turned on
and off an infinite number of times in

107
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:21,238
just two minutes.
So after two minutes, will the lamp be on or off?

108
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:28,069
Well, by the definition of infinity,
there is no last step. There is never a

109
00:10:28,068 --> 00:10:34,909
switching not followed by another.
So the lamp can't be on, because whenever it's

110
00:10:34,909 --> 00:10:40,149
turned on, it is immediately turned off
in the next step and it can't be off

111
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:44,480
because whenever it's turned off it's
turned on right afterwards. What's the

112
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,970
answer? It's easy to say something about
a supertask when its partial sums

113
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:56,450
converge, but when they just oscillate back
and forth forever... Hmmmm...

114
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:05,079
Zeno objects do this. Imagine building a meter
high cube. As with all supertasks, you

115
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:11,099
construct at an accelerated pace.
First, you put down a green half metre tall slab,

116
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:17,079
then a quarter metre tall slab that's
orange, then a green eight metre slab,

117
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:21,979
then an orange 16th meter slab and so on,
until there are infinitely many layers

118
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:28,339
of alternating color. Now, when you look at the cube from above, what color will

119
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:29,200
you see?

120
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:35,710
Orange, green? Well, it can't be orange
because every orange layer is covered by

121
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,910
a green one. And it can't be green
because every green layer is blocked by

122
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:45,079
an orange one above it. What if we had a
machine display each digit of Pi

123
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:50,389
in order at a supertask pace? After its
finite runtime, what would be on the

124
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:53,100
screen?
The last digit of Pi?

125
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,600
Well, that's impossible, right? But how could it be anything else? A supertask allows us

126
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,220
to exhaust an infinite sequence.

127
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:07,960
Paul Benacerraf delivered what is often considered the
best response to these confusions. Is

128
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,530
Thomson's lamp on or off?

129
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:17,409
Is the cube orange or green? The answer
is we don't know, because these questions

130
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:24,230
are incomplete. Thomson's lamp could be
on or off or broken. The cube could

131
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,190
appear orange or green or something else.
But the supertasks, as stated, don't let

132
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:35,410
us figure out which. I may as well ask
you if a lamp hidden in a locked room

133
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:40,889
is on or off. It's definitely one or the other,
but I haven't given you enough information

134
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:47,319
to do anything but guess. Supertasks like
these describe an endless sequence of

135
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:53,150
tasks and then ask us about the end.
But we can't determine an outcome because,

136
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:57,789
although there may be an end to their
duration, there is no end,

137
00:12:57,789 --> 00:13:04,189
no final member of their actions.
They must be reworded or coupled with extra

138
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:09,690
assumptions in order to be solved.
For example, if we assume that the switch

139
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:16,030
used on Thomson's lamp can only be all
the way on or all the way off, we can't

140
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:22,149
determine where it is after the supertask.
But if the switch is, say, a

141
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:26,659
bouncing ball that completes the circuit
turning the lamp on each time it bounces

142
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:31,969
on a metal plate, an outcome can be
determined. If the physics here are ideal

143
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,480
and the ball bounces half as high and
half the time as it did on

144
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,409
the previous balance, its sequence of
bounce heights will turn the lamp on and

145
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:45,828
off an infinite number of times in a
finite amount of time. Although this

146
00:13:45,828 --> 00:13:52,638
bouncing ball has no penultimate state,
no second-to-last bounce, it does have an

147
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,870
ultimate state, a final one,

148
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:03,220
resting on the plate. The circuit will be
complete and the lamp will be on. You can

149
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,899
also describe a switch on Thomson's lamp that leaves it off.

150
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,440
Sometimes, the

151
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,899
next state after infinitely many isn't
paradoxical because of lack of

152
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:20,809
information, but because of a surprising,
or non-intuitive, discontinuity that

153
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:26,528
occurs there. The Ross–Littlewood paradox
is one of the greatest examples. Imagine

154
00:14:26,528 --> 00:14:32,519
a giant urn that can hold an unlimited
number of balls. Now, imagine that you

155
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:38,500
have an unlimited supply of balls, each
with a unique natural number written on

156
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,948
it. All natural numbers, in fact, since
there's no end to how many balls you

157
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:48,789
have. Now, working at an accelerated Zenoian pace you move the balls to the urn

158
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:50,689
10 at a time,

159
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:56,840
but in a weird way. At step one, you place
balls number 1 to 10 in the urn, but

160
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:02,780
remove number 1. At step two, a minute
later, you place balls 11 to 20 in the

161
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:09,259
urn and remove ball number 2. At step three,
you place balls 21 to 30 in the urn

162
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:12,370
and remove ball 3, and so on.

163
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:19,159
Upon the completion of the supertask
how many balls will be in the urn? At

164
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:24,079
first the answer seems obvious. At each
step you are adding 10 balls and

165
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,680
subtracting 1, so a net of nine balls
is added each time.

166
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:33,889
9 + 9 + 9 + 9 forever, the series grows without end.

167
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:40,419
Infinite nine's means infinite balls at
the end. But here's the problem. At each

168
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:46,919
step, the ball with that step's number
written on it is removed. Ball 1 is

169
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:53,169
removed at step one, ball 2 was removed
at step two, ball 12-googol is removed at

170
00:15:53,169 --> 00:15:59,009
step twelve-googol. Since there are an
endless number of steps for any ball

171
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:05,509
number, there is a step number at which
it is removed. So although the urn's ball

172
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:11,679
population grows without bound during
the task, after the supertask the

173
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,528
number drops to 0.

174
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,860
It gets weirder. Here's a second, seemingly identical
method. Instead of beginning with balls

175
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:27,149
1 to 10 and then removing 1, begin with
balls 1 to 9. Then write

176
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:36,039
zero after the "1" on ball 1. For step two, add balls 11 to 19 and draw a zero on ball 2, making it

177
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:43,748
say 20. For every finite step, both methods
results in identical earned contents, but

178
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:50,329
after infinitely many steps, the first
leaves us with no balls and the second

179
00:16:50,328 --> 00:16:54,828
leaves us with infinitely many balls
written on which are all the natural

180
00:16:54,828 --> 00:17:00,929
numbers, each followed by an infinite
string of zeros. Both are discontinuous

181
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:10,658
at infinity, but dang, in very different ways.
The bigger question now becomes, "so

182
00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:16,929
what? Who cares?" You will never have an
infinite number of balls and you will

183
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:21,669
never have a large enough to urn to
hold all of them. You will never build a

184
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:23,490
lamp that can turn on and off

185
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:29,529
arbitrarily fast. We cannot investigate
time or space past a certain smallness,

186
00:17:29,529 --> 00:17:35,648
except when pretending, so what are supertasks, but recreational fictions,

187
00:17:35,648 --> 00:17:43,208
entertaining riddles? We can ask more
questions than we can answer, so what?

188
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:44,740
Well, here's what.

189
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:51,660
Neanderthals. Neanderthals and humans, us,
Homo sapiens, lived together in Europe

190
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:57,769
for at least five thousand years.
Neanderthals were strong and clever, they

191
00:17:57,769 --> 00:18:03,279
may have even intentionally buried their
dead, but for hundreds of thousands of

192
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,230
years, Neanderthals barely

193
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:12,910
went anywhere. They pretty much just explored
and spread until they reached water or

194
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:19,300
some other obstacle and then stopped.
Homo sapiens, on the other hand, didn't do

195
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:24,480
that. They did things that make no sense
crossing terrain and water without

196
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,920
knowing what lay ahead. Svante Pääbo has
worked on the Neanderthal genome at the

197
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,960
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology
and he points out that

198
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,880
technology alone didn't allow humans to go to
Madagascar, to Australia. Neanderthals

199
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:49,810
built boats too. Instead, he says, there's
"some madness there. How many people

200
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:55,169
must have sailed out and vanished on the
Pacific before you found Easter Island? I

201
00:18:55,170 --> 00:19:01,820
mean, it's ridiculous. And why do you do
that? Is it for the glory? For immortality?

202
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:13,579
For curiosity? And now we go to Mars. We
never stop." It's ridiculous, foolish, maybe?

203
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:20,199
But it was the Neanderthals who went
extinct, not the humans. Maybe it's only a

204
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,940
fool who will perilously journey out to
what might not be there. And maybe it's

205
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:31,930
only a fool who will ask about supertasks,
about infinity. But if you want to

206
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:36,430
solve problems, you don't just solve the
ones that are there, you find more and

207
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:42,100
make more and go after the impossible
ones; fostering a love and obsession with

208
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:43,039
problems

209
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,379
is how you solve problems.

210
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,179
Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wasn't a
mathematician, but his advice

211
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:57,990
fits nicely here. If you want to build a
ship, don't drum up people to collect

212
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:03,950
wood and don't assign them tasks and work,
but rather teach them to long for the

213
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,230
endless immensity of the sea.

214
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,279
And as always,

215
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,599
thanks for watching.

216
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:40,099
Supertasks are cool, but super gifts are
even cooler. That's why I'm excited to

217
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:44,609
announce this year's Vsauce holiday
box. This thing comes loaded with

218
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:50,439
exclusive Vsauce stuff and science gear,
plus all Vsauce proceeds go directly to

219
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,150
Alzheimer's research. I'm really proud of
this box. You can pick one up at

220
