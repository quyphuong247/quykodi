00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
Hey, Vsauce Michael here, and a couple of weeks ago,

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,309
Vice's new channel Noisey blind folded me,

3
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:10,888
the Gregory Brothers, about 200 other people,

4
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:14,058
and then bused us to a hidden skrillex show.

5
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:22,639
It was cool, but what is cool?

6
00:00:22,638 --> 00:00:26,358
I mean, what does it mean to be cool?

7
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,789
Cool is a judgement of taste.

8
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:31,959
People who are cool are with it.

9
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:35,789
They exhibit a style people want to emulate,
they're fashionable.

10
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:41,129
But being cool isn't just about confidence or being above the situation.

11
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:45,338
In fact, what is considered cool changes
all the time.

12
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:48,308
Here's a fantastic illustration charting

13
00:00:48,308 --> 00:00:52,228
by time and location what was generally considered cool.

14
00:00:52,228 --> 00:00:56,988
To truly get the origin of what we today mean by cool,

15
00:00:56,988 --> 00:01:01,368
we're going to have to go back to West Africa
in the 15th Century.

16
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:05,278
The Yoruba language has a great word, itutu.

17
00:01:05,278 --> 00:01:09,748
It means physical beauty, but also being calm

18
00:01:09,748 --> 00:01:12,378
and detached from your circumstances,

19
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:14,459
almost unnaturally so

20
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:16,549
in a superhuman kind of way.

21
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:22,219
And a similar, more specific term comes from the Italian concept of sprezzatura.

22
00:01:22,218 --> 00:01:28,096
This was a way of behaving favored by the wealthy upper class in 15th Century Italy.

23
00:01:28,096 --> 00:01:30,393
And to exhibit this behavior,

24
00:01:30,393 --> 00:01:34,811
you wanted to act nonchalant, even
if doing so would take a lot of work.

25
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:37,188
You would hide your desires and emotions

26
00:01:37,188 --> 00:01:39,890
behind ironic detachment.

27
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,736
But where can you see sprezzatura?

28
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:46,746
Well, how about here—the Mona Lisa.

29
00:01:46,746 --> 00:01:50,698
She doesn't laugh.
She's exercising restraint.

30
00:01:50,698 --> 00:01:55,257
It almost feels like she's looking down on you, smugly.

31
00:01:55,257 --> 00:01:59,920
Now, to make this more clear, let's take a look at a recent discovery, a painting,

32
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:04,675
that used to be thought of as a copy of the Mona Lisa made years and years later.

33
00:02:04,674 --> 00:02:10,373
Except, recent restoration has shown that the very same mistakes and corrections

34
00:02:10,373 --> 00:02:14,480
that DaVinci made on the original
were also done on this painting,

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,025
leading restorers to believe that this painting

36
00:02:18,025 --> 00:02:22,230
was made side by side with the actual Mona Lisa.

37
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,272
Look at her expression.

38
00:02:24,272 --> 00:02:28,782
It's even more clear that she's looking at you like
"Huh, really?"

39
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:32,452
"You think you're cool.  Okay."

40
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:36,716
Related is the Italian concept of omerta.

41
00:02:36,716 --> 00:02:42,543
This is keeping your cool and not
telling the authorities anything about anybody.

42
00:02:42,543 --> 00:02:46,393
It's the type of attitude you see in movies like
Goodfellas or The Godfather.

43
00:02:46,393 --> 00:02:48,545
But our modern definition of cool

44
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:51,381
may most directly come from slaves

45
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:53,265
and prisoners.

46
00:02:53,265 --> 00:02:57,269
People in those positions are subjected to authority in a very direct way,

47
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,099
and any kind of rebellion against authority or fighting against it

48
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:06,949
is most certainly going to be answered with nothing but punishment and very little chance of success.

49
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:11,485
And so instead, an attitude of
ironic detachment is taken on,

50
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:14,360
which allows you to distance yourself from that authority

51
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,375
to be away from it, against it without actively confronting it and getting in trouble.

52
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:21,799
Now, later on in the 1940s,

53
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:26,843
the actual word cool began to stick to this attitude.

54
00:03:26,843 --> 00:03:29,634
it came out of the smoke filled nightclubs

55
00:03:29,634 --> 00:03:32,509
where jazz, beatnik, and bohemian culture thrived.

56
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:35,383
The only way to freshen up that smoke filled air

57
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:38,472
was to open windows and let the cool

58
00:03:38,473 --> 00:03:40,718
night air in.

59
00:03:40,717 --> 00:03:44,186
Saxophonist Lester Young is credited with making this connection

60
00:03:44,187 --> 00:03:47,651
and popularizing the use of the word cool,

61
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:52,741
even cooler is the fact that Lester also popularized the use of the word bread

62
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:55,443
to mean money. Well look at that, the sun has come out.

63
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:59,618
That's cool. It also means that it's a
good time to talk about the brain.

64
00:03:59,617 --> 00:04:04,454
Laurence Steinberg points out that there are systems in the brain that mature as we get older.

65
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:07,288
The first is the socioemotional network,

66
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,675
and this deal is social and emotional inputs.

67
00:04:09,675 --> 00:04:13,211
Second is the cognitive control network.

68
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:17,132
This deals with regulating behavior
and making ultimate decisions.

69
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,850
But these two networks do not mature at the same rate.

70
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,812
In fact, there's an awkward period
in puberty and adolescence

71
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:27,725
where the social emotional network in our brain

72
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,315
is more active, and so, whether or not people

73
00:04:30,315 --> 00:04:33,109
think you are cool matters more to you

74
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,903
than is reasonable.

75
00:04:35,903 --> 00:04:39,113
So in a way, you could say that the less worried you are with

76
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:42,912
being cool, the more developed your brain is.

77
00:04:42,913 --> 00:04:46,540
Instead, focus on vocabulary.

78
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,918
The only thing that doesn't change, the only
coolness that doesn't fade

79
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:54,504
is cool—the word.

80
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:57,674
Over the years, we have used all
kinds of other words

81
00:04:57,673 --> 00:05:02,641
to mean cool, but the one that has never changed,
the one that has always been cool to use

82
00:05:02,641 --> 00:05:04,937
is cool.

83
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:08,188
And that's cool.  Go check out that skrillex concert footage.

84
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:11,064
Noisey is the channel that uploaded that new MIA video

85
00:05:11,064 --> 00:05:14,100
as well as MIAs responses to YouTube comments.

86
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,951
And according to this guy, fat people
shouldn't be making music.

87
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,740
All I know is, as always, thanks for watching.
