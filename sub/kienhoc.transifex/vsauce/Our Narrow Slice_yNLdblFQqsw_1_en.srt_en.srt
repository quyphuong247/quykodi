1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,430
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,028
This picture is

3
00:00:04,028 --> 00:00:08,699
about a year and a half old.
But the pyramids themselves

4
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:13,529
are much older than that.
How much older? Well, think of it this way.

5
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:16,570
The Pyramids of Giza were as

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,519
old to the ancient Romans as the ancient Romans

7
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,350
are to us.
When the pyramids were being built

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,990
there were woolly mammoths living on Wrangel Island.

9
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:31,570
That's pretty old.
But don't get too impressed.

10
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,090
We often learn about the past in units, separate

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,899
chapters, which distracts from the fact
that many chapters aren't

12
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:42,308
just nearer each other than you might think,
they are often

13
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:46,589
literally written on top of one another.
Anne Frank

14
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,910
and Martin Luther King Jr. were born
in the exact same year.

15
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:54,609
By the late 1960s humans had come a long way.

16
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:58,920
We've become a spacefaring species.
But while we were sending

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,710
the first probes to the Moon and Venus and Mars,

18
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,810
it was still illegal for a black person
and a white person to marry

19
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,049
in 16 states.
The guillotine

20
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:14,650
seems like a macabre artefact from bygone days

21
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,180
but it was last used by France to
officially behead a criminal

22
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,610
the year Star Wars came out.
While General Custer was fighting

23
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:28,469
native tribes on the American frontier,
the Brooklyn Bridge

24
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:31,950
was being build.
And there were people alive then

25
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,150
who would later watch the Moon landing on television.

26
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,310
We went from Custer's last stand to

27
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,490
Armstrong's first steps within the span

28
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:44,729
of a single human life.

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,500
But all of these stories,
from the pyramids to Julius Caesar to

30
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:55,459
you watching this video right now,
belong to an incredibly thin section

31
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:56,459
in the book

32
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:59,798
of human history.
Compared to what human life has

33
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:04,040
mainly been like here on earth, our current societies

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,659
are weird.
Weird is also an acronym used

35
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:12,579
by Jared Diamond in his new book
"The World Until Yesterday."

36
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,180
Jared Diamond wrote
"Guns, Germs, and Steel," "Collapse"

37
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,290
and he's here with me to talk about weird.

38
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,818
Weird, w-e-i-r-d,

39
00:02:22,818 --> 00:02:27,310
is an acronym for "western, educated,
industrial, rich and democratic."

40
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,939
When we talk about human nature
we're really talking about

41
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:35,550
a narrow slice of society.
Traditional societies were

42
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,450
everybody in the world,
from the beginning of human evolution

43
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:42,649
6 million years ago until within the last

44
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:48,069
10,000 years for the first time we began
encountering strangers and then we

45
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:48,679
developed

46
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,239
writing and then we acquired kings.
All of these things that we take for granted

47
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,939
are matter of the last 5,000 - 10,000 years.
Or the Internet

48
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:02,620
or the media, they're a matter
of the last few decades.

49
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,590
The relative recency of weird societies
in the speed with which

50
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,110
information and knowledge increases
means that not that long ago

51
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,780
we thought some pretty strange things.
For instance,

52
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:19,000
in 1903 The New York Times predicted
that building a flying machine

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,110
would be possible in 1 to 10 million years.

54
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:28,140
Later that very same year
the Wright brothers flew at Kitty Hawk.

55
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:31,839
In 1908 it was said that no flying machine will

56
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,158
ever fly from New York to Paris.
Who made that 

57
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,959
foolish prediction?
One of the Wright brothers.

58
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,750
In 1962 the Decca recording company

59
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,370
passed on a young rock band, saying
"we don't like their sound

60
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,599
and guitar music is on the way out."
The band in question

61
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:58,179
was the Beatles. Keith Moon 
and John Entwistle were said to have remarked

62
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,688
about a band called The New Yardbirds,

63
00:04:00,688 --> 00:04:04,009
"that band so ill-conceived it will sink

64
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:07,579
like a balloon or a zeppelin made out of lead."

65
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,460
Well, Jimmy Page was not deterred.
In fact, he took that phrase

66
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:15,750
and made it his band's new name.
He removed the A, so it wouldn't be pronounced

67
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,519
"lead," and that's where we got Led Zeppelin.

68
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,990
There is evidence the Nazis weren't entirely convinced

69
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,350
Earth was a globe we lived on the outside of.

70
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,990
Instead, they figured the Earth's
continents were actually aligning

71
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:37,530
on the inside of a hollow concave surface
with the stars and moon and planets

72
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:40,839
in the middle. Seriously.

73
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:44,899
As the story goes, Doctor Heinz Fischer
was sent to RÃ¼gen Island

74
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:49,529
to spy on the British.
Now, the curvature of the earth would have made this

75
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:50,649
impossible.

76
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:55,239
But thinking the earth was shaped like
this, they pointed their telescopes

77
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,439
up at a 45 degree angle. Needless to say,

78
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,019
the experiment didn't work.
The Eiffel Tower's

79
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:06,948
inauguration and the Wall Street Journal
and "Starry Night"

80
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:10,038
and Coca-Cola and Nintendo and Adolf Hitler

81
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:13,389
all began in 1889.

82
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:17,699
As did a guy named Thomas Midgley Jr.

83
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,740
Celebrated in his time,

84
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,120
Midgley's legacy has since been tarnished by

85
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,180
the negative consequences of his inventions.

86
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,840
His list of contributions to society is

87
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,728
impressively disastrous.

88
00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:38,008
In the late twenties, Midgley synthesized
the first chloro-fluorocarbons -

89
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:41,788
CFC - for which he won
the Society of Chemical Industry's

90
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:45,560
Perkin medal.
Only later did we realize

91
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:49,228
all of those tons of CFCs we were emitting

92
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:54,008
were eating away 4% of our
atmosphere's protective ozone layer

93
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:57,669
every decade. Like a virus, creating a

94
00:05:57,668 --> 00:06:01,568
wound, unlikely to completely heal until me and you

95
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:05,639
have long been dead. In the early 1920s

96
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,189
Midgley discovered that by adding Tetraethyllead

97
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:12,939
to gasoline engine knocking could be reduced.

98
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:16,779
The American Chemical Society gave him
the 1923 Nichols' medal

99
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:22,198
for the discovery. There were other, safer
alternatives but General Motors jointly

100
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,829
owned a patent on Tetraethyllead

101
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:29,029
with Midgley.
They could make a profit on it, so they advertised it as

102
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:32,079
the best option and almost immediately nearly

103
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,659
every motor vehicle on earth was spewing

104
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,699
lead into our atmosphere

105
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:42,460
and soil, which put it in our blood,

106
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:46,430
lead poisoning for decades.

107
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,430
Currently, the reference for healthy children is a blood

108
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,629
lead content of less than 5 micrograms

109
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:56,579
per decilitre. After the popularization of Midgley's

110
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:00,409
leaded gasoline, 88% of children

111
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,210
in America had double that amount of lead in their

112
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:07,459
blood.
When leaded gasoline was finally phased out

113
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:10,568
in the 1970s, that percentage fell

114
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:14,639
to 9%. Lead is a neuro toxin.

115
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,439
Even light exposure,
like that caused by Midgley's invention,

116
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:21,699
can cause a decrease in intelligence and in increase

117
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:25,360
in anti-social behaviour.
Fordham University found that

118
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,120
in young adults the best predictor of delinquent

119
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,639
and violent behavior is literally the lead content

120
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:37,750
of their blood.
Chillingly, the rise and fall

121
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,560
of violent crimes by juveniles in the 20th century

122
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,899
tracks significantly closely with the
rise and fall of lead

123
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:50,209
in their blood when they were
preschoolers - all over the world.

124
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:53,459
Historian J. R. McNeill remarked that Midgley

125
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:57,120
had more impact on the atmosphere
than any other single

126
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,699
organism in Earth's history.
Midgley's

127
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:04,210
final invention was even worse.

128
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:07,969
Well, for him. In 1940 he contracted

129
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,639
polio.
To help his friends and family lift him from bed

130
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,780
he designed an intricate system of ropes and pulleys.

131
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:19,388
As was the story of his life, the invention seemed

132
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:22,579
brilliant at first, but four years later he became

133
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:26,788
accidentally entangled in the ropes
and his own invention

134
00:08:26,788 --> 00:08:29,878
strangled him to death.

135
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,940
Midgley's life took up 0.55%

136
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,349
of human history.
And, roughly speaking, yours will too.

137
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:41,289
To put that in perspective, let's time travel,

138
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:44,559
starting right now.
We begin

139
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,669
100,000 years ago - the beginning of modern humans.

140
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:51,829
We are moving forward in time an entire millennia,

141
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:56,330
a thousand years, every second.
As you can see,

142
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,910
not much is changing.
Our modern world

143
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:04,549
will briefly flash at the end.
That's all it is. That's all it's been.

144
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:06,929
So be careful not to miss it.

145
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:08,089
And as always,

146
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,410
thanks for watching.
