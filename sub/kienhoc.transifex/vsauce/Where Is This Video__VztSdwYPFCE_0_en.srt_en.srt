1
00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:06,219
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. Steve Seitz

2
00:00:06,219 --> 00:00:11,250
and Chuck Dyer used view morphing to 
digitally reveal a side of the Mona Lisa

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,660
we've never seen before.
What it would look like if she stared

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,740
directly at us. That's her but it seems a bit

5
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:22,129
unfamiliar. I mean, there is only one iconic

6
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:26,198
view of the Mona Lisa. There's only one
physical object you can look at

7
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:29,400
to say that you saw the Mona Lisa with
your own eyes.

8
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:33,100
Photographs exist.
There are copies you can also look at.

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,160
There are forgeries,
there are parodies but the true

10
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,968
original Mona Lisa is in the Louvre.
That's where it is.

11
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:43,429
But where is this video?

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,540
Seriously,

13
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:49,570
where is this video?

14
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,628
I mean, it's on your screen right now but it's
also on a lot of

15
00:00:52,628 --> 00:00:55,679
other screens. Where's the original? Well,

16
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,948
it's stored on YouTube servers and the
original export is on my hard drive

17
00:00:59,948 --> 00:01:03,039
but those are just instructions for making

18
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,439
the video. This video is anywhere.

19
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,908
Every stream, every viewing of this video
is, as Bill Thompson would say,

20
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,669
"a digital simulacrum of something that
has no original".

21
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:23,539
So, how does a museum curator 
or an archaeologist deal with this?

22
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,570
Well, they are rethinking curating.

23
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:29,669
I mean, take a look at this sculpture.

24
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,850
"The distance from this sentence to your eye

25
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:36,339
is my sculpture." That's pretty cool, but

26
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,100
how do you put something like that in a
museum? This sculpture and this video can be

27
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:44,478
endlessly copied and every version is
made out of different

28
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:47,978
stuff at different times, a bit like

29
00:01:47,978 --> 00:01:53,109
your body. There's an identity crisis
going on. As I discussed before,

30
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:56,890
every few years nearly all of your atoms are replaced.

31
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,709
Old ones leave, new ones come in.
Where is the original

32
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,239
you?

33
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:09,318
Like this video, you are really just the
result of a set of instructions being

34
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:13,169
followed. And in our cases, interestingly, 
those instructions

35
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:18,729
are kind of forgeries. 'The $12 Million Stuffed Shark'

36
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:22,598
is a great book about the art world. It
mentions that, at one point in history,

37
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:26,389
there were 600 Rembrandt's hanging in
museums

38
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:29,769
and 350 Rembrandt's in private
collections.

39
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,900
The only problem is Rembrandt scholars
say that Rembrandt only ever made

40
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,280
320 paintings. Mistaken identity,

41
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,348
forgeries and phonies have been around for a long time.

42
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:48,030
In 1496 a young Michelangelo, the same
Michelangelo that painted

43
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,300
this, forged a statue. He treated the
statue with acid to make it look

44
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,280
not like his own work but like the work
of ancient Greeks or Romans,

45
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,280
so he could sell it for more money.
But really, what's wrong with a forgery?

46
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,459
I mean, sure, supporting forgeries is
like supporting plagiarism but as far as

47
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:10,830
intrinsic aesthetic properties go, what's the difference?

48
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:16,180
Whether painted by Da Vinci, or a dog, or
copied perfectly by a robot,

49
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,349
wouldn't the Mona Lisa smile just as mysteriously

50
00:03:20,348 --> 00:03:23,658
and cooly? Well, here's the thing.

51
00:03:23,658 --> 00:03:28,120
We feel like the original, the Mona Lisa
Da Vinci originally made, has

52
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,860
an aura about it. As Richard Wiseman discussed

53
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,750
in Quirkology - a great book - psychologist
Paul Rosen once studied just how obsessed

54
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,259
we are with relics,

55
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:42,439
things important merely because of their
auras. He found that people were more

56
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,340
willing to wear a sweater

57
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,569
that had been dropped in dog poop than
they were to wear a sweater they had been told

58
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:49,389
what was once

59
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:53,649
owned by a mass murderer.
We are influenced by auras.

60
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:59,129
Right now, I am in Mougin. The city in
southeastern France where Picasso

61
00:03:59,128 --> 00:04:03,688
died. On one occasion Picasso refused to
sign a painting

62
00:04:03,688 --> 00:04:08,370
he knew he had painted, saying "I can paint a fake Picasso just like anybody else."

63
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,480
You can disown your own paintings

64
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:16,620
and you can disown your children but
you can claim to have created your own paintings,

65
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,639
but can you really claim to have created

66
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,718
your own children?

67
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,960
Let's explore a metaphor.
Your mother is a 3D printer that printed you.

68
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,340
But hold on, your parents conceived you

69
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:34,859
and curated you, cared for you.
But the actual blueprints that made you

70
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,270
were outside of their conscious control.

71
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:41,448
Your blueprint is a forgery.

72
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:45,680
It has been copied, replicated, over and
over again, ever since the very first

73
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,269
group of molecules were arranged in a
way that automatically replicated

74
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:54,000
billions and billions of years ago.
It's not a perfect forgery.

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,639
Changes occur every time, making
successive copies a little bit different.

76
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:00,650
But 99.9 percent of your DNA

77
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:04,060
isn't different from anyone else's.

78
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,740
Now, you might say, but wait, Michael,
we all look so different.

79
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,769
Kind of. But that's also because your brain

80
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:15,219
is particularly good at recognizing
differences amongst things that you are

81
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,259
familiar with.

82
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:19,550
It's called the cross-race effect and it's the reason

83
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:24,120
new twins you've never met before look
totally the same, until you get used to them.

84
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,930
It's the reason people from a culture
you're not use to tend to be

85
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,959
more difficult to distinguish. And the
reason, say, a big group of black labs

86
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:32,959
you've never met before

87
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,989
all kind of look like the same black lab.

88
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,788
We all have a common descendant, a common
person our DNA has been replicated from

89
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:42,240
over and over again,

90
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,560
making us, in a funny way, a big bunch of forgeries.

91
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,910
Go back 50 forgeries ago, 50

92
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,479
generations ago, and that's enough to
connect every single human living on Earth.

93
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,228
I've said this before, you are at least 50th cousins

94
00:05:58,228 --> 00:06:02,500
with everyone else living on the planet
today. But we can go back further than that,

95
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,899
as Guy Murchie famously did. You see,
animal populations, and even

96
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,109
molecule populations, experience replication

97
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,430
variation and selective pressures, which means

98
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,160
you are trillionth cousins with all life on

99
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,400
Earth and, technically speaking, quadrillionth

100
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,489
cousins with water and trees and rocks.

101
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,120
It's a beautiful notion but it's anything but new.

102
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,399
The word 'human' comes from a word for soil.

103
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:36,539
And compare the Hebrew word for 'ground'
with their name for the first man.

104
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:41,349
You are quadrillionth cousins with dirt,

105
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:46,039
with rocks, with trees, with plastic, with
the very clothing you are wearing

106
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:50,089
right now. So whether you're fighting
with a stranger in a bar

107
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:53,568
or stubbing your toe on a rock, it's all

108
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:55,968
just a family squabble.

109
00:06:55,968 --> 00:06:57,409
And as always,

110
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,270
thanks for watching.

111
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:06,959
Oh, hey, you're still there.
This is great because I have some

112
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,870
really cool news. Vsauce was just
nominated for a Webby,

113
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,250
in the news and information category.
It's a really big honor

114
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,478
and I want to thank you guys for making this possible.

115
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:21,629
You can be a Vsaucer in a whole new way
now by voting for Vsauce in the

116
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:22,759
Webby's. Just follow

117
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,759
the link at the top of this video's
description. All the nominees, by the way,

118
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:30,729
are great. It's great that the universe
has these channels, so check all them out.

119
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:32,088
And as always,

120
00:07:32,088 --> 00:07:34,088
thanks for watching.
