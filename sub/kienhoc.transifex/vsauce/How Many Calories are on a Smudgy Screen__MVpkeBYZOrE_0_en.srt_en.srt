00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,440
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And I'm home for the holidays.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,150
I'm in my parents' basement,
using a different camera than usual.

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:16,129
But you know what is always different?
Fingerprints.

4
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,609
The palms of our hands and the soles of our
feet are weird.

5
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:25,399
They are covered with friction ridges, which
act like the design of a stamp that stamps

6
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:30,529
everything you touch.
Plastic or patent prints are visible to the

7
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,539
naked eye.
But even with seemingly clean hands on a seemingly

8
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:42,539
clean surface, a fingerprint can be left.
A latent fingerprint.

9
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:48,479
But what are those made of?
Well, by the square millimetre, they're made

10
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:51,099
out of this.
All of this stuff is natural.

11
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:57,130
In fact, a lot of it is produced to keep your
skin healthy, waterproof, pliable.

12
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,960
But touch a surface enough and the gunk can build up.

13
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,109
It's what causes smudges on computer screens
and mobile devices.

14
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:13,469
Now, given that protein contains 4 calories
per gram, fat contains 9 calories per gram

15
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:20,959
and the surface area of the iPhone 5 is 4,400
square millimetres, completely licking clean

16
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:26,269
a smudgy iPhone 5 screen is gonna give you
about 2 calories.

17
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:33,269
If you were to lick clean 245 smudgy iPhones 5, well, that would be the same as eating

18
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,650
a Big Mac.
But before you run off and get all of your

19
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:44,540
nutrition from smudgy phones, you should know that
us humans need a bit more variety than that.

20
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,299
I've always found it interesting that cats
and dogs can grow up and live great lives

21
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:53,920
eating the exact same food everyday.
Well, what about us humans?

22
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,618
What can we eat everyday without ever changing
it up and be fine?

23
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:05,188
It turns out that there is one type of food
that you could eat everyday for the rest of

24
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:09,269
your life and be fine,
without ever having something different.

25
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,170
If you follow @tweetsauce,
you already know what it is.

26
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:19,839
The answer is human breast milk.
Whether your ridges loop or arch or whorl

27
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,989
is largely genetic.
But the tiny minutiae of your prints formed

28
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:31,480
while you were developing inside your mother.
It tells a story about the very specific conditions

29
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:35,979
around the dividing cells that became your skin.

30
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:41,939
And for that reason, even identical twins,
who pretty much share the exact same DNA,

31
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:47,870
wind up with different fingerprints.
I could clone you 100 times and every one

32
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,739
of those clones would have a unique set of fingerprints.

33
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,709
Your skin has two major layers.
The epidermis on the outside and the dermis,

34
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:03,310
which is below.
The basal layer of your epidermis creates

35
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:08,990
new skin cells, which migrate up towards the
outside world, where they die and flatten

36
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:14,260
out, forming the protective outermost part
of your skin - the 'horny layer' - which means

37
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:23,000
that all day, everyday, you are covered with
and showing off to the entire world your horny

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,459
layer.
These outer cells are constantly shed away,

39
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:33,459
but their arrangement stays the same, because
their shape is determined by the shape of

40
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:40,080
the basal layer down below.
This is why you can superficially and temporarily

41
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,509
sandpaper or cut off your fingerprints, but
they'll still grow back the way they were

42
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:50,609
before.
But why do we have fingerprints in the first

43
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,659
place?
I mean, not all mammals have friction ridges.

44
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:58,929
Is this some sort of cruel joke the universe
made to make it more difficult for us humans

45
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,349
to get away with crimes?
Probably not.

46
00:04:03,348 --> 00:04:07,598
The most likely answer is two-fold.
First of all, it has been show that friction

47
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:14,318
ridges allow us to sense subtle textures 100
times better than if we didn't have them.

48
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,509
And because fingerprints loop and arch and
swirl in different directions, all it takes

49
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:24,109
is one simple touch for us to detect a subtle
texture moving in any direction.

50
00:04:24,108 --> 00:04:29,279
It's also been shown that having friction
ridges allows mammals, like us, primates,

51
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:34,528
koalas, the North American fisher, to better
climb and grasp wet stuff.

52
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,199
Even though no two fingerprints are exactly
the same, the methods we have for matching

53
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:45,609
fingerprints aren't always perfect.
There are plenty of different ways to model

54
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,699
fingerprints and each one is calculated at
different probability of a false match.

55
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:55,960
But if you wanna commit a crime, it's best
to just avoid fingerprints altogether.

56
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:03,659
How about hiring someone with adermatoglyphia?
A few skin conditions can cause the disappearance

57
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,520
of fingerprints.
But adermatoglyphia is a genetic one that

58
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,279
has no other side effects.
But it's rare.

59
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:18,359
Only four extended families on Earth are known
to have the condition.

60
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,899
But if you wanna avoid leaving fingerprints
and can't find somebody with adermatoglyphia,

61
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:28,158
don't worry, just find someone who hasn't
gone through puberty yet.

62
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:36,079
Sure, kids might snot and slob all over stuff,
but they carry far less heavy waxy oil on

63
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,478
their skin.
And for this reason, the fingerprints of a

64
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:45,519
child will disappear, evaporate, much more
quickly than those of an adult.

65
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:49,359
A child's fingerprints can evaporate in only a few hours.

66
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,519
So, use kids to commit your crimes.

67
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,220
And as always,

68
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,480
thanks for watching.
