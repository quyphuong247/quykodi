00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,059
Hey, Vsauce.

2
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:12,718
Michael here. The title of this video is misspelled

3
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:15,820
in honour of mistakes. Mistakes are

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,620
everywhere, they surround us like air

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,278
To err is human. Faults, flaws, faux pas, fumbles

6
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,339
and fallacies are as much a part of who we are today

7
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:29,550
as the stuff we've gotten right. For instance,

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,570
if a knight knocked your knuckle or knifed your knee,

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,030
why would there be so many "k"s?

10
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,018
Well, the "k"s are silent by mistake.

11
00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:45,878
The original old English forms of these
words were pronounced with "k"

12
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:46,419
sounds.

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,539
K-nife, k-night, k-nee.

14
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:53,600
But that's a bit of a mouthful to say and
because reading and writing weren't as

15
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:55,429
common hundreds of years ago,

16
00:00:55,429 --> 00:01:00,730
people just pronounced words the way
they want to do, regardless of spelling.

17
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:06,539
Spelling is fun. Warren G knows what
I'm talking about. In the fourth

18
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:10,670
verse of his "What's Next", he asks what's next.

19
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,500
What's next, what's N-X-E-T

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,939
Spelling isn't the only thing

21
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,109
we get wrong. The history of science is a graveyard

22
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:26,930
of dead an abandoned ideas.
Fritz Machlup coined the phrase

23
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,280
"Half-life of knowledge". The amount of time
it takes for half of the knowledge

24
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,510
within a field

25
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,510
to be superseded by new, better ideas
or to simply be shown

26
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,810
untrue. Donald Hebb famously

27
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,879
estimated that the half-life of knowledge in psychology

28
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,759
is just five years.

29
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,980
Humans are awesome, don't get me wrong,
but we tend to believe that what we currently

30
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,160
think we know about the universe

31
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,280
is reasonably correct, even though statistics

32
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,909
aren't on our side. Previous generations

33
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:03,369
incorrectly thought the exact same thing
about what they used to think was true.

34
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,890
My favourite examples of the ubiquity
of mistakes are production

35
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,019
errors in popular songs. They're like

36
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:14,968
humbling Easter eggs, just waiting
to be found. For instance, 

37
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:18,639
Buffalo Springfield's "For What It's Worth".

38
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,840
26 second in the "be" in the lyric

39
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,248
"beware" is clipped, as is the "p"

40
00:02:25,248 --> 00:02:30,120
in "people" at 1:24 minute. Once you hear the mistake,

41
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,920
it's tough to unhear it. In "Hey Jude"

42
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:39,208
Paul McCartney misses a cord. And if you
listen closely you can clearly hear him

43
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:39,889
say

44
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:44,150
"F***ing h*ll". Seriously, it's in the actual song.

45
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,569
Go listen to it. In fact, there's an entire
website that chronicles

46
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:51,568
mistakes in Beatles' songs. Take a look at this

47
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:55,259
700-year-old prayer book. A monk

48
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,379
wrote it on fresh, clean paper.

49
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:03,699
I'm kidding, of course. He scraped the ink
off an older manuscript, cut the pages and

50
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:05,018
rotated them before

51
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:09,468
writing all over them. A mistake? Well,

52
00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:13,459
kind of. Recent multispectral images

53
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,670
of the prayer book have revealed that
the old manuscript he

54
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:20,518
erased was a previously unknown copy of a work

55
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,998
by Archimedes. It was called "The Method"

56
00:03:23,998 --> 00:03:27,549
and laid out the heart of calculus thousands of years

57
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:31,650
before Newton and Leibniz. If that one monk

58
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,109
hadn't erased that one book, would we be

59
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:38,489
hundreds, thousands of years
mathematically and technologically more

60
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:39,590
advanced today

61
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,870
than we currently are? It's hard to say.

62
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,299
All that is certain is that we would
continue to make ridiculous mistakes,

63
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:47,739
like

64
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:54,539
the Mars Climate Orbiter.
This 327.6 million dollar expedition

65
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:58,340
burned up in the red planet's atmosphere because

66
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,808
when calculating flight manoeuvres NASA
used the agreed-upon metric units

67
00:04:02,808 --> 00:04:06,889
while Lockheed Martin used the imperial system.

68
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,540
This is Neil Armstrong taking humankind's first steps

69
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:14,799
on the Moon. It's about the best footage

70
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,810
we have. The original tapes containing
the highest quality recording

71
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,129
of that moment have been lost. They were probably

72
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:27,759
recorded over by later test missions. Ten years ago

73
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,848
Sergio Martinez became lost in the woods while

74
00:04:30,848 --> 00:04:34,610
hunting outside of San Diego.
Hoping to attract the attention of

75
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,020
rescuers, he lit a small fire.

76
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:43,418
But that fire quickly got out of control
and became a giant Cedar Fire.

77
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:46,870
It destroyed 300,000 acres of land,

78
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,269
2,322 homes and killed

79
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:53,158
15 people.

80
00:04:53,158 --> 00:04:57,060
The man carrying a wounded soldier in
this painting, based on a photograph

81
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,889
taken during World War I,

82
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:03,370
is Henry Tandey, an English recipient
of the Victoria Cross.

83
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:08,218
Four years after the event in this image
Tandey caught a wounded

84
00:05:08,218 --> 00:05:12,089
German soldier in his gun sights.
But rather than kill the man,

85
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:17,128
Tandey took pity on his wounded state
and spared his life.

86
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:20,249
The German he allowed to live was

87
00:05:20,249 --> 00:05:24,699
this man. Later the man whose life he
spared wore his mustache

88
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,710
shorter but still had the same name,

89
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:31,638
Adolf Hitler. In 1918

90
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:37,269
did Henry Tandey miss a chance to kill
Hitler? Detailed researchers found that

91
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:38,168
the exact

92
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:42,168
days their units were in the same
location don't quite match up.

93
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:45,188
The story is apocryphal but what is known

94
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:48,520
is that Hitler owned a copy of the painting

95
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:52,008
of Tandey, and in 1938,

96
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:55,819
when meeting with Neville Chamberlain,
Hitler pointed to Tandey

97
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:59,908
and told Chamberlain: "That man came
so close to killing me

98
00:05:59,908 --> 00:06:03,370
in 1918 that I thought I
should never see Germany

99
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,348
again." So, who's wrong?

100
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:11,370
Maybe Hitler confirmed the story

101
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,500
merely because he hoped to make up extra
evidence that providence had kept him

102
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,468
alive to pursue his goals.

103
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:20,468
Either way, someone

104
00:06:20,468 --> 00:06:24,509
is mistaken. Missed opportunities

105
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:29,189
are a bummer.
Obsessing over them is not healthy but regret

106
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:33,810
is a powerful emotion. How do you deal

107
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,250
with regret, with guilt?

108
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:42,899
Can you? In the early morning hours on a
bench outside a hotel in Anaheim this

109
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:43,560
summer

110
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,098
Ze Frank told me something
I am going to paraphrase.

111
00:06:47,098 --> 00:06:50,978
I love this metaphor. Stuff in your past

112
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:55,560
is like a carving on the bark of sapling. Over time,

113
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,399
the scar, the carving won't go away.

114
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:03,990
Because of the way trees grow it won't
go up or down much either, it'll just

115
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,598
stay right where it began. It might even get darker.

116
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,158
But it won't get bigger. You, however,

117
00:07:11,158 --> 00:07:15,800
can. You can keep growing,
doing more things, more branches,

118
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,778
being more things. The wound won't get
smaller but you can make it a smaller

119
00:07:21,778 --> 00:07:22,560
part

120
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,588
of who you are. Maybe regrets

121
00:07:26,588 --> 00:07:29,728
are like that. They stick around forever

122
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:34,038
like arborglyphs. Or maybe they make like a tree

123
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:36,218
and leaf.

124
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,759
A red or purple leaf in the autumn.
As days get shorter

125
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,050
and chlorophyll production decreases, the yellow

126
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,459
and orange carotenoids, which are always in leaves,

127
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:53,718
appear as the green fades.
But red and purple leaves

128
00:07:53,718 --> 00:07:58,500
are the interesting ones.
As winter approaches it would seem to be a good

129
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,908
time for trees to conserve energy but some trees

130
00:08:01,908 --> 00:08:04,968
do the opposite. Instead of giving up, they spend

131
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:08,050
extra energy producing anthocyanins

132
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,750
to turn their leaves red and purple hues.

133
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,918
These colours protect their leaves from
sun damage before their nutrients can

134
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:16,318
all be

135
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,278
used and may also be a defence
against insects looking for

136
00:08:21,278 --> 00:08:25,098
a parasitic home.
A way for the tree to tell the insects: "Yes,

137
00:08:25,098 --> 00:08:28,978
I am in part dying but not without a fight.

138
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:32,278
I am still very much vital."

139
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,729
Drought and even turn a kit applied by man

140
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:40,879
can bring about these colors prematurely.
When you look at beautiful

141
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,419
autumn colours, you are looking at stress.

142
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:47,629
But the bigger the fight the trees
put up, the more energy

143
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:51,328
they put into their defences at the
very end, the more brilliant

144
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:54,769
their colours will be. Winter

145
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:58,110
will eventually come. But scientifically,

146
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,740
the brightest, deepest, most remarkable colours

147
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,509
come from not giving up too easily

148
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:06,970
or quickly.

149
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,500
And as always,

150
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,000
thanks for watching.
