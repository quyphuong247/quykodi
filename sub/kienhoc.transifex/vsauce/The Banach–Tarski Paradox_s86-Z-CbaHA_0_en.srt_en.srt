00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,799
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
There's a famous way

2
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:08,199
to seemingly create chocolate out of
nothing.

3
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:11,459
Maybe you've seen it before.
This chocolate bar is

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,750
4 squares by 8 squares, but if you cut it like this

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,189
and then like this and finally like this

6
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:22,198
you can rearrange the pieces like so

7
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,660
and wind up with the same 4 by 8

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,539
bar but with a leftover piece, apparently
created

9
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:33,239
out of thin air. There's a popular
animation of this illusion

10
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:37,058
as well. I call it an illusion because

11
00:00:37,058 --> 00:00:40,689
it's just that. Fake.
In reality,

12
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:44,460
the final bar is a bit smaller.
It contains

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,030
this much less chocolate. Each square
along the cut is shorter than it was in

14
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:50,910
the original,

15
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:55,069
but the cut makes it difficult to notice
right away. The animation is

16
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,579
extra misleading, because it tries to
cover up its deception.

17
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:02,799
The lost height of each square is
surreptitiously

18
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,349
added in while the piece moves to make
it hard to notice.

19
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:10,938
I mean, come on, obviously you cannot cut up
a chocolate bar

20
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:14,678
and rearrange the pieces into more than
you started with.

21
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:19,199
Or can you?
One of the strangest

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,880
theorems in modern mathematics is the
Banach-Tarski

23
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:24,339
paradox.

24
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,640
It proves that there is, in fact, a way to
take an object

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,959
and separate it into 5

26
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,479
different pieces.

27
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,859
And then, with those five pieces, simply

28
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:44,709
rearrange them.
No stretching required into

29
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:48,719
two exact copies of the original

30
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,299
item. Same density, same size,

31
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:54,480
same everything.

32
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:58,709
Seriously. To dive into the mind blow

33
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:02,500
that it is and the way it fundamentally
questions math

34
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,790
and ourselves, we have to start by asking
a few questions.

35
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,280
First, what is infinity?

36
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,639
A number?
I mean, it's nowhere

37
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:16,958
on the number line, 
but we often say things like

38
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,009
there's an infinite "number" of blah-blah-blah.

39
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:24,409
And as far as we know, infinity could be real.

40
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:27,620
The universe may be infinite in size

41
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,459
and flat, extending out for ever and ever

42
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:34,500
without end, beyond even the part we can
observe

43
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,879
or ever hope to observe.

44
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:41,530
That's exactly what infinity is.
Not a number

45
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,390
per se, but rather a size.
The size

46
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:49,949
of something that doesn't end.
Infinity is not the biggest

47
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:53,319
number, instead, it is how many numbers

48
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:57,370
there are. But there are different
sizes of infinity.

49
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,370
The smallest type of infinity is

50
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,939
countable infinity.
The number of hours

51
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:07,810
in forever. It's also the number of whole
numbers that there are,

52
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,830
natural number,  the numbers we use when
counting

53
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,219
things, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

54
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:17,840
and so on. Sets like these are unending,

55
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,039
but they are countable. Countable
means that you can count them

56
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,269
from one element to any other in a

57
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:31,280
finite amount of time, even if that finite
amount of time is longer than you

58
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,159
will live

59
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,270
or the universe will exist for, it's still finite.

60
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:40,060
Uncountable infinity, on the other hand, is literally

61
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,370
bigger.
Too big to even count.

62
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,550
The number of real numbers that there are,

63
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,020
not just whole numbers, but all numbers is

64
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,560
uncountably infinite.
You literally cannot count

65
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,659
even from 0 to 1 in a finite amount of
time by naming

66
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,909
every real number in between.
I mean,

67
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:04,030
where do you even start?
Zero,

68
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:10,939
okay. 
But what comes next? 0.000000...

69
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:14,289
Eventually, we would imagine a 1

70
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:17,608
going somewhere at the end, but there is no end.

71
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:21,509
We could always add another 0.
Uncountability

72
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:26,149
makes this set so much larger than the set
of all whole numbers

73
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:30,099
that even between 0 and 1, there are more numbers

74
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,080
than there are whole numbers on the
entire endless number line.

75
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,120
Georg Cantor's famous diagonal argument helps

76
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,180
illustrate this.
Imagine listing every number

77
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,769
between zero and one. Since they are
uncountable and can't be listed in order,

78
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:48,859
let's imagine randomly generating them forever

79
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:54,040
with no repeats. Each number regenerate can be paired

80
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,819
with a whole number. If there's a one to
one correspondence between the two,

81
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:03,740
that is if we can match one whole number
to each real number

82
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,780
on our list, that would mean that countable

83
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:11,489
and uncountable sets are the same size.
But we can't do that,

84
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,840
even though this list goes on for

85
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:19,259
ever. Forever isn't enough.
Watch this.

86
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,060
If we go diagonally down our endless
list

87
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,240
of real numbers and take the first decimal
of the first number

88
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,210
and the second of the second number,
the third of the third and so on

89
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:34,728
and add one to each, subtracting one

90
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:38,278
if it happens to be a nine, we can
generate a new

91
00:05:38,278 --> 00:05:41,978
real number that is obviously between 0 and 1,

92
00:05:41,978 --> 00:05:44,990
but since we've defined it to be
different

93
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:49,180
from every number on our endless list
and at least one place

94
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,319
it's clearly not contained in the list.

95
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,468
In other words, we've used up every
single whole number,

96
00:05:56,468 --> 00:06:00,019
the entire infinity of them and yet we
can still

97
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:05,408
come up with more real numbers.
Here's something else that is true

98
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:08,759
but counter-intuitive.
There are the same number

99
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,870
of even numbers as there are even

100
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:17,418
and odd numbers. At first, that sounds
ridiculous. Clearly, there are only half

101
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:17,818
as many

102
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,218
even numbers as all whole numbers,
but that intuition is wrong.

103
00:06:22,218 --> 00:06:25,509
The set of all whole numbers is denser but

104
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:28,710
every even number can be matched with a
whole number.

105
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:33,459
You will never run out of members either
set, so this one to one correspondence

106
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:37,068
shows that both sets are the same size.

107
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,538
In other words, infinity divided by two

108
00:06:41,538 --> 00:06:44,068
is still infinity.

109
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:47,449
Infinity plus one is also infinity.

110
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,850
A good illustration of this is Hilbert's
paradox

111
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,139
up the Grand Hotel.
Imagine a hotel

112
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:57,900
with a countably infinite number of
rooms. But now,

113
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:02,329
imagine that there is a person booked
into every single room.

114
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:07,139
Seemingly, it's fully booked, right?
No.

115
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:10,679
Infinite sets go against common sense.

116
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,079
You see, if a new guest shows up and wants a room,

117
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,839
all the hotel has to do is move the
guest in room number 1

118
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,000
to room number 2. And a guest in room 2 to
room 3 and 3 to 4 and 4 to

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,209
5 and so on.

120
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:26,649
Because the number of rooms is never ending

121
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:30,138
we cannot run out of rooms.
Infinity

122
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:34,030
-1 is also infinity again.

123
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:37,158
If one guest leaves the hotel, we can shift

124
00:07:37,158 --> 00:07:40,719
every guest the other way.
Guest 2 goes to room 1,

125
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,409
3 to 2, 4 to 3 and so on, because we have an

126
00:07:44,408 --> 00:07:48,908
infinite amount of guests. That is a
never ending supply of them.

127
00:07:48,908 --> 00:07:52,949
No room will be left empty.
As it turns out,

128
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:56,610
you can subtract any finite number from infinity

129
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,530
and still be left with infinity.
It doesn't care.

130
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:04,529
It's unending. Banach-Tarski hasn't left
our sights yet.

131
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:07,609
All of this is related.
We are now ready to move on

132
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,270
to shapes.
Hilbert's hotel can be applied

133
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:15,149
to a circle. Points around the
circumference can be thought of as

134
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:19,370
guests. If we remove one point from the circle

135
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,579
that point is gone, right?
Infinity tells us

136
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:27,668
it doesn't matter.
The circumference of a circle

137
00:08:27,668 --> 00:08:31,250
is irrational. It's the radius times 2Pi.

138
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,500
So, if we mark off points beginning from
the whole,

139
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,899
every radius length along the
circumference going clockwise

140
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:42,269
we will never land on the same point
twice,

141
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:45,610
ever.
We can count off each point we mark

142
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:49,759
with a whole number.
So this set is never-ending,

143
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,389
but countable, just like guests and
rooms in Hilbert's hotel.

144
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:56,669
And like those guests,
even though one has checked out,

145
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:00,069
we can just shift the rest.
Move them

146
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,360
counterclockwise and every room will be
filled

147
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,590
Point 1 moves to fill in the hole, point 2

148
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,950
fills in the place where point 1 used to be,
3 fills in 2

149
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:16,050
and so on. Since we have a unending
supply of numbered points,

150
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:19,129
no hole will be left unfilled.

151
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:24,189
The missing point is forgotten.
We apparently never needed it

152
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,600
to be complete. There's one last needo
consequence of infinity

153
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,980
we should discuss before tackling Banach-Tarski.
Ian Stewart

154
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,259
famously proposed a brilliant dictionary.

155
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:40,539
One that he called the Hyperwebster.
The Hyperwebster

156
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:44,069
lists every single possible word of any length

157
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,560
formed from the 26 letters in the
English alphabet.

158
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:51,329
It begins with "a," followed by "aa,"

159
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,410
then "aaa," then "aaaa."

160
00:09:54,409 --> 00:09:57,750
And after an infinite number of those, "ab,"

161
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,950
then "aba," then "abaa", "abaaa,"

162
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,129
and so on until "z, "za,"

163
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:08,289
"zaa," et cetera, et cetera,
until the final entry in

164
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:11,919
infinite sequence of "z"s.
Such

165
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,990
a dictionary would contain every

166
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,480
single word.
Every single thought,

167
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,009
definition, description, truth, lie, name,

168
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:25,240
story.
What happened to Amelia Earhart would be

169
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,220
in that dictionary,
as well as every single thing that

170
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,970
didn't happened to Amelia Earhart.

171
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,259
Everything that could be said using our

172
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:39,500
alphabet.
Obviously, it would be huge,

173
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,009
but the company publishing it might
realize that they could take

174
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:46,799
a shortcut. If they put all the words
that begin with

175
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:49,959
a in a volume titled "A,"

176
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,210
they wouldn't have to print the initial "a."
Readers would know to just add the "a,"

177
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,320
because it's the "a" volume.
By removing the initial

178
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,760
"a," the publisher is left with every "a" word

179
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:04,309
sans the first "a," which has surprisingly

180
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:07,909
become every possible word.
Just one

181
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:12,819
of the 26 volumes has been
decomposed into the entire thing.

182
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,620
It is now that we're ready to
investigate this video's

183
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:21,269
titular paradox.
What if we turned an object,

184
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:24,710
a 3D thing into a Hyperwebster?

185
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:28,700
Could we decompose pieces of it into the
whole thing?

186
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,360
Yes.
The first thing we need to do

187
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,889
is give every single point on the
surface of the sphere

188
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:40,939
one name and one name only. A good way to
do this is to name them after how they

189
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,620
can be reached by a given starting point.

190
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,740
If we move this starting point across
the surface of the sphere

191
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,740
in steps that are just the right length,
no matter how many times

192
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,110
or in what direction we rotate, so long
as we never

193
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,419
backtrack, it will never wind up in the
same place

194
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:03,079
twice. We only need to rotate in four
directions to achieve this paradox.

195
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,280
Up, down, left and right around

196
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:10,000
two perpendicular axes.
We are going to need

197
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,230
every single possible sequence that can
be made

198
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:17,269
of any finite length out of just these
four rotations.

199
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,269
That means we will need lef, right,

200
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:24,250
up and down as well as left left,

201
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,460
left up, left down, but of course not

202
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,009
left right, because, well, that's
backtracking. Going left

203
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:34,759
and then right means you're the same as
you were before you did anything, so

204
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:37,870
no left rights, no right lefts and no up
downs and

205
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:42,220
no down ups. Also notice that I'm writing
the rotations in order

206
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,300
right to left, so the final rotation

207
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:48,949
is the leftmost letter.
That will be important later on.

208
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:53,960
Anyway. A list of all possible sequences
of allowed rotations that are finite

209
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,040
in lenght is, well,

210
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:00,209
huge. Countably infinite, in fact.

211
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:03,580
But if we apply each one of them to a
starting point

212
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,879
in green here and then name the point we
land on

213
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:09,929
after the sequence that brought us there,
we can name

214
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:13,189
a countably infinite set of points
on the surface.

215
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:17,050
Let's look at how, say, these four strings
on our list would work.

216
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:21,849
Right up left. Okay, rotating the starting
point this way takes

217
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:27,259
us here. Let's colour code the point
based on the final rotation in its string,

218
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:31,189
in this case it's left and for that we will use

219
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,339
purple.
Next up down down.

220
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:38,730
That sequence takes us here.
We name the point DD

221
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,959
and color it blue, since we ended with a down

222
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:46,099
rotation.
RDR, that will be this point's name,

223
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,879
takes us here.
And for a final right rotation,

224
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:52,990
let's use red.
Finally, for a sequence that end with

225
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,070
up, let's colour code the point orange.

226
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,290
Now, if we imagine completing this
process for

227
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:03,740
every single sequence, we will have a
countably infinite number of points

228
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,330
named

229
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:07,509
and color-coded.
That's great, but

230
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:11,269
not enough.
There are an uncountably

231
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:15,110
infinite number of points on a sphere's surface.

232
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:18,139
But no worries, we can just pick a point
we missed.

233
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:21,559
Any point and color it green, making it

234
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:25,349
a new starting point and then run every
sequence

235
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,659
from here.
After doing this to an

236
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:32,449
uncountably infinite number of
starting point we will have indeed

237
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,990
named and colored every single point on
the surface

238
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:39,709
just once.
With the exception

239
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:44,389
of poles. Every sequence has two poles of
rotation.

240
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:48,740
Locations on the sphere that come back to
exactly where they started.

241
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,129
For any sequence of right or left

242
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:55,299
rotations, the polls are the north and
south poles.

243
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:59,579
The problem with poles like these is
that more than one sequence can lead us

244
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,280
to them.

245
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:03,850
They can be named more than once and be colored

246
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:08,290
in more than one color. For example, if
you follow some other sequence to the

247
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:09,679
north or south pole,

248
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:12,989
any subsequent rights or lefts will

249
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:17,490
be equally valid names. In order to deal
with this we're going to just count them out

250
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:17,750
of the

251
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,470
normal scheme and color them all yellow.
Every sequence has two,

252
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,580
so there are a countably infinite amount

253
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:28,540
of them. Now, with every point on the
sphere given just

254
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:33,860
one name and just one of six colors,
we are ready to take the entire sphere

255
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,860
apart. Every point on the surface
corresponds to a unique line of points

256
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,629
below it

257
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:43,269
all the way to the center point.
And we will be dragging

258
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:47,329
every point's line along with it.
The lone center point

259
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:52,200
we will set aside. Okay, first we cut out
and extract all the yellow

260
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,370
poles, the green starting points, the

261
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,389
orange up points, the blue down points

262
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:02,730
and the red and purple left and right
points.

263
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:06,099
That's the entire sphere.
With just

264
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,590
these pieces you could build the whole
thing. But take a look at the left piece.

265
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,769
It is defined by being a piece composed of

266
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:17,220
every point, accessed via a sequence ending

267
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,340
with a left rotation.
If we rotate this piece

268
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,730
right, that's the same as adding an "R" to

269
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:28,250
every point's name.
But left and then right

270
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,200
is a backtrack, they cancel each other
out. And look what happens when you

271
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,980
reduce

272
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,980
them away. The set becomes the same

273
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,550
as a set of all points with names
that end with L,

274
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:44,539
but also U, D and every point reached

275
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:47,870
with no rotation.
That's the full set of starting points.

276
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:53,039
We have turned less than a quarter of
the sphere into nearly three-quarters

277
00:16:53,039 --> 00:17:00,219
just by rotating it. We added nothing. It's like
the Hyperwebster. If we had the right

278
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:00,920
piece

279
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:05,649
and the poles of rotation and the center
point, well, we've got the entire sphere

280
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,759
again, but with stuff left over.
To make a second copy,

281
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,259
let's rotate the up piece down.
The

282
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:16,959
down ups cancel because, well,
it's the same as going nowhere

283
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,250
and we're left with a set of all
starting points, the entire

284
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,549
up piece, the right piece and the left
piece, but there's a problem here.

285
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:28,730
We don't need this extra set of starting
points. We still haven't

286
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,700
used the original ones. No worries, let's just
start over.

287
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,700
We can just move everything from the up
piece

288
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,809
that turns into a starting point when
rotated down.

289
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:42,629
That means every point whose final
rotation is up. Let's put them

290
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:47,400
in the piece. Of course, after rotating
points named

291
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,920
UU will just turn into points named U,
and that would give us a copy here

292
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,130
and here.
So, as it turns out, we need to move

293
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:58,770
all points with any name that is just a string of Us.

294
00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:01,960
We will put them in the down piece and
rotate the up

295
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,170
piece down, which makes it congruent to
the up right

296
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:09,039
and left pieces, add in the down piece
along with some up

297
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,928
and the starting point piece and, well,
we're almost done.

298
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:15,860
The poles of rotation and center are missing

299
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:18,788
from this copy, but no worries.
There's a countably

300
00:18:18,788 --> 00:18:22,658
infinite number of holes,
where the poles of rotations used to be,

301
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:28,130
which means there is some pole around
which we can rotate this sphere such that

302
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:32,070
every pole hole orbits around without
hitting another.

303
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,648
Well, this is just a bunch of circles
with one point missing.

304
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:40,519
We fill them each like we did earlier.
And we do the same for the centerpoint.

305
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,038
Imagine a circle that contains it inside
the sphere

306
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:47,269
and just fill in from infinity and look
what we've done.

307
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:53,329
We have taken one sphere and turned it
into two identical spheres

308
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:56,678
without adding anything.

309
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:01,159
One plus one equals 1.
That took

310
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:04,929
a while to go through,
but the implications are huge.

311
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:09,600
And mathematicians, scientists and
philosophers are still debating them.

312
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,569
Could such a process happen in the real
world?

313
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:18,788
I mean, it can happen mathematically and
math allows us to abstractly predict and

314
00:19:18,788 --> 00:19:21,319
describe a lot of things in the real
world

315
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:26,038
with amazing accuracy, but does the Banach-Tarski paradox

316
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:29,929
take it too far?
Is it a place where math and physics

317
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:33,330
separate?
We still don't know.

318
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:37,999
History is full of examples of
mathematical concepts developed in the

319
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:38,749
abstract

320
00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:42,589
that we did not think would ever apply
to the real world

321
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:47,089
for years, decades, centuries,
until eventually science caught up and

322
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:50,209
realized they were totally applicable

323
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:56,769
and useful. The Banach-Tarski paradox could
actually happen in our real-world,

324
00:19:56,769 --> 00:20:01,200
the only catch of course is that the
five pieces you cut your object into

325
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,440
aren't simple shapes.
They must be infinitely complex

326
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,899
and detailed. That's not possible to do in
the real world, where measurements can

327
00:20:10,898 --> 00:20:12,339
only get so small

328
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:16,980
and there's only a finite amount of time
to do anything, but math says it's

329
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,509
theoretically valid and some scientists

330
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,720
think it may be physically valid too.

331
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,400
There have been a number of papers
published suggesting

332
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:29,619
a link between by Banach-Tarski

333
00:20:29,618 --> 00:20:32,949
and the way tiny tiny sub-atomic
particles

334
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:38,009
can collide at high energies and turn
into more particles

335
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:39,509
than we began with.

336
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:46,619
We are finite creatures. Our lives

337
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:51,359
are small and can only scientifically
consider a small part of

338
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:54,908
reality.
What's common for us is just

339
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:59,028
a sliver of what's available. We can
only see so much of the electromagnetic

340
00:20:59,028 --> 00:20:59,990
spectrum.

341
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,429
We can only delve so deep into
extensions of space.

342
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:07,370
Common sense applies to that which we
can

343
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:10,788
access.
But common sense is just that.

344
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:14,019
Common.
If total sense

345
00:21:14,028 --> 00:21:18,700
is what we want, we should be prepared to
accept that we shouldn't call infinity

346
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,330
weird or strange.

347
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:24,668
The results we've arrived at by
accepting it are valid,

348
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:28,919
true within the system we use to
understand, measure, predict and order the

349
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:29,740
universe.

350
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,288
Perhaps the system still needs
perfecting, but at the end of day,

351
00:21:34,288 --> 00:21:38,980
history continues to show us that the
universe isn't strange.

352
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,799
We are.

353
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,610
And as always,

354
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:46,569
thanks for watching.

355
00:22:06,778 --> 00:22:10,690
Finally, as always, the description is full
of links to learn more.

356
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:14,090
There are also a number of books linked
down there that really helped me

357
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:17,388
wrap my mind kinda around Banach-Tarski.

358
00:22:17,388 --> 00:22:22,329
First of all, Leonard Wapner's "The Pea and the Sun." This book is fantastic and it's full of

359
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:23,928
lot of the preliminaries needed

360
00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:27,659
to understand the proof that comes later.
He also talks a lot about the

361
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:28,940
ramifications

362
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,019
of what Banach-Tarski and their
theorem might mean for mathematics.

363
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:36,868
Also, if you wanna talk about math and
whether it's discovered or invented,

364
00:22:36,868 --> 00:22:37,720
whether

365
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,659
it really truly will map onto the universe,
Yanofsky's

366
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:45,090
"The Outer Limits of Reason" is great.

367
00:22:45,089 --> 00:22:49,019
This is the favorite book of mine that I've read
this entire year. Another good one is E.

368
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:50,138
Brian Davies'

369
00:22:50,138 --> 00:22:53,488
"Why Beliefs Matter." This is actually
Corn's favorite book,

370
00:22:53,489 --> 00:22:57,389
as you might be able to see there.
It's delicious and full of lots of great

371
00:22:57,388 --> 00:22:59,758
information about the limits of what we
can know

372
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,919
and what science is and what mathematics is.

373
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,399
If you love infinity and math, I cannot
more highly recommend Matt Parker's

374
00:23:08,398 --> 00:23:11,719
"Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension." He's hilarious and this book

375
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:11,960
is

376
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,308
very very great at explaining some pretty
awesome things.

377
00:23:15,308 --> 00:23:19,230
So keep reading,
and if you're looking for something to watch,

378
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,730
I hope you've already watched Kevin
Lieber's film on

379
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:26,108
Field Day. I already did a documentary about Whittier, Alaska over there.

380
00:23:26,108 --> 00:23:29,618
Kevin's got a great short film about
putting things out on the Internet

381
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:32,808
and having people react to them. There's
a rumor that Jake Roper might be doing

382
00:23:32,808 --> 00:23:34,178
something on Field Day soon.

383
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:37,269
So check out mine, check out Kevin's and

384
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:41,138
subscribe to Field Day for upcoming Jake
Roper action, yeah?

385
00:23:41,138 --> 00:23:45,508
He's actually in this room right now, say
hi, Jake. [Jake:] Hi. Thanks for filming this, by

386
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:46,028
the way.

387
00:23:46,028 --> 00:23:49,950
Guys, I really appreciate who you all are.

388
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,630
And as always,

389
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,750
thanks for watching.
