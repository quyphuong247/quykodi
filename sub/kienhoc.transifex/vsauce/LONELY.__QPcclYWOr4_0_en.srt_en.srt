00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,100
Hey, Vsauce Michael here, and I am back in New York City.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,057
And today, we're going to talk about

3
00:00:07,057 --> 00:00:09,057
loneliness.

4
00:00:10,226 --> 00:00:14,461
But first, I just learned this yesterday, Bear Grylls,
the host of Man vs. Wild

5
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:17,861
has three sons, and I'm not kidding,
their names are

6
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:21,995
Jesse, Huckleberry, and Marmaduke.

7
00:00:21,995 --> 00:00:23,733
Well, here's another name for you.

8
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:25,500
Michael Collins.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,396
Not the Irish Revolutionary leader, but Michael Collins,
the NASA astronaut.

10
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:33,200
This guy was part of the Apollo 11 crew,

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,288
meaning that he was part of the
team that went to, landed on the moon,

12
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:39,999
and became the first people to
walk on the moon,

13
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:42,384
except you might know Michael Collins'
name as well,

14
00:00:42,384 --> 00:00:44,933
because he did not get to walk on the moon.

15
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:47,473
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin
walked around,

16
00:00:47,473 --> 00:00:49,642
but Michael Collins had to stay orbiting

17
00:00:49,643 --> 00:00:53,067
the moon in the command module
to link up with them later.

18
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:55,779
Well, this is where things get lonely.

19
00:00:55,779 --> 00:01:00,188
People realize that Michael Collins, there
in the command module,

20
00:01:00,188 --> 00:01:04,150
orbiting the moon alone was in
a quite unique position.

21
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,943
When he circled around to the far side of the moon,

22
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,984
the side that faced away from Earth,

23
00:01:08,984 --> 00:01:13,506
he lost all radio contact with Earth
and with Armstrong and Aldrin.

24
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:17,843
For about the 48 minutes that Michael Collins
was orbiting around the other end of the moon,

25
00:01:17,843 --> 00:01:21,714
he was quite literally the most lonely

26
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:25,260
a human being has ever been.

27
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,013
He was the furthest from any other humans

28
00:01:28,013 --> 00:01:32,188
than any human has ever been
since the very beginning of mankind.

29
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:36,811
If you haven't yet seen Veritasium's video about how far away the moon is from Earth,

30
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:38,680
you should definitely check it out.

31
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,987
But the whole point is that we tend to think that the moon is much closer than it really is,

32
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:47,161
because most illustrations we see
put the two objects quite close

33
00:01:47,162 --> 00:01:49,641
because it's easier, but to scale,

34
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:52,740
this is how far away the moon is.

35
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:57,250
We actually measure the distance to the moon quite frequently using reflectors

36
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,123
that were left on the moon.

37
00:01:59,123 --> 00:02:01,966
That's right, they're just sitting there all alone
on the surface of the moon

38
00:02:01,966 --> 00:02:04,171
waiting for us to shoot lasers at them.

39
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:06,843
By looking at how long it took the light to return to us,

40
00:02:06,843 --> 00:02:10,216
we can calculate quite accurately
how far away the moon is.

41
00:02:10,216 --> 00:02:11,933
And we've been doing this for a while,

42
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:14,137
and one of the most bizarre things we've learned

43
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:19,735
is that the moon is actually spiraling
away from Earth quite slowly.

44
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:23,362
Every year, the moon is about 38 millimeters

45
00:02:23,361 --> 00:02:25,646
further away than it was the year before.

46
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:29,110
Thirty-eight millimeters is about one and a half inches.

47
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,001
Those reflectors are not the
only thing we left on the moon.

48
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:36,090
We actually left a lot of man-made stuff,
a lot of junk there.

49
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,741
There is an entire Wikipedia article just listing

50
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,966
the big stuff we left behind.

51
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:45,264
But there are man made objects that are even further away from the Earth than the moon.

52
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:48,007
In fact, there are four things that humans have built

53
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:52,801
that have traveled so far away from Earth,
they are no longer within our solar system.

54
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:57,443
Voyager I is actually the furthest
man made object from Earth ever.

55
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:01,725
And aboard, NASA included a gold plated record

56
00:03:01,725 --> 00:03:04,276
that contained information about humanity,

57
00:03:04,276 --> 00:03:07,771
just in case anything out there found them.

58
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,482
You can read all about everything
that NASA put on the disc

59
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:12,413
by following a link in this video's description.

60
00:03:12,413 --> 00:03:14,872
But the item that has always resonated with me

61
00:03:14,872 --> 00:03:16,751
is a song they chose.

62
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:19,006
They put lots and lots of audio on the disc,

63
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:21,260
but one song in particular was chosen

64
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:27,802
to represent to whoever or whatever found it, the human emotion of loneliness.

65
00:03:27,802 --> 00:03:33,806
The song is by blind Willie Johnson, and it's called
Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground.

66
00:03:33,806 --> 00:03:35,848
There are no lyrics, just humming.

67
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,266
You can listen to it by following
the link in this video's description.

68
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:40,400
And as you listen, think about

69
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,655
the weight of that meaning.

70
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,728
This song was picked to represent

71
00:03:44,728 --> 00:03:48,568
to aliens what loneliness is.

72
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:51,819
Blind Willie Johnson himself wasn't blind his whole life,

73
00:03:51,818 --> 00:03:55,658
he was blinded as a child when his step mother threw lye in his face,

74
00:03:55,658 --> 00:03:59,366
and he died of malarial fever after his home burned down

75
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:02,465
and he had nowhere else to live but on wet newspaper.

76
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:05,960
But now, his song is way out there

77
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,754
in inner stellar space representing us.

78
00:04:09,753 --> 00:04:12,100
Thanks for watching.

79
00:04:25,353 --> 00:04:33,943
This point of light is Earth, as seen from 4 billions miles away by Voyager 1 in 1990
