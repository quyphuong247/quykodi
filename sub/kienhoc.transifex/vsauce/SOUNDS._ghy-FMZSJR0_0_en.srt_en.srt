1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,160
Hey, Vsauce.
Michael here.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,240
And I'm with Destin in Alabama.
What he's about to do is capture on a Phantom

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:17,050
camera at a 1080 frames a second a hawk - that
one - catching a target.

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,960
But today we're going to talk about sound.
First things first.

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,820
The Raptor Center takes care of raptors that
have been injured, or would otherwise not

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,179
be able to survive in the wild on their own.
For instance, this bald eagle named Spirit,

7
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,759
who was hit by a car that damaged his beak.

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,320
Okay, so that is the bald eagle.

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,520
Very interesting sound that it makes.
But what I'm interested in today is the recording

10
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,198
of sound.
It hasn't really been that long in human's

11
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:53,210
history that we've able to record sounds.
In fact, it wasn't until 1859 with the invention

12
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,590
of the phonautograph in Paris that we first
recorded sound.

13
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,470
It really blows your mind to listen to this.
What you're about to hear is the very first

14
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,250
recording ever of any kind of sound.

15
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:13,840
One thing I found fascinating was that these

16
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:17,669
large birds have such high metabolisms that
in order to figure out if they're hungry or

17
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,519
not all you have to do is weigh them.
And if a bird weighs too much it means it's

18
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,609
not hungry and so they won't bring it out
to fly, 'cause it might not come back.

19
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:30,489
It's not hungry, it's not gonna obey commands
to get little bits of food.

20
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:37,409
But let's now time travel to 1860 and listen
to the very earliest recording of the human

21
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,798
voice.
What you're about to hear is the voice of

22
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:43,739
the inventor of the phonautograph signing
a French folk song.

23
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,340
Three years after that recording Abraham Lincoln
delivered The Gettysburg Address and three

24
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:04,449
hours before he gave the speech this photo
was taken.

25
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,030
The only known photo of Lincoln at the historic
event.

26
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:12,400
It dedicated a cemetery in Pennsylvania to
the Battle of Gettysburg, the deadliest battle

27
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,860
of America Civil War, where more than 23,000 men died.

28
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,700
Now in attendance was a 9 year old boy named
William V. Rathvon.

29
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:28,119
And in 1938, as he neared the end of his life,
Rathvon took a copy of the speech and recorded

30
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,819
himself delivering it as he remembered Lincoln
speaking it.

31
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:37,199
We don't have any audio of Lincoln delivering
the speech, which makes this recording the

32
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,419
only one done by an eyewitness of the event.
Pretty mind-blowing.

33
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:01,400
But what about sounds we don't wanna hear?
For instance, fingernails scratching against

34
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,780
a blackboard.
Well there are a lot of theories about why

35
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,319
that sound affects us so viscerally and so
immediately.

36
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:13,719
Some of them argue that the sound of the scratching
may mimic an early warning cry of early humans.

37
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:19,280
But more recent research suggests that it's
actually certain frequencies inside that scratching

38
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,860
sound, specifically those between 2000 and
4000 Hz.

39
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,360
A range similar to the human voice.
Our ear canals actually amplify those frequencies,

40
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,320
so that we can hear them better, but when
it comes to the scratching of things on a

41
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:38,620
chalkboard, or styrofoam against styrofoam,
those frequencies become too loud, making

42
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,280
it painful.
Okay, now let's leave Earth and listen to

43
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:45,310
sounds from outer space.
Now, I know what you're thinking, sound in

44
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:50,420
outer space is impossible.
Sound waves need a medium to travel through

45
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:54,119
and in space you practically have a vacuum.
I know.

46
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,079
But here's something really neat.
The radio antenna on Voyager I was broadcasting

47
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:04,759
the signal back to Earth as Voyager passed
through the rings of Saturn.

48
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:09,679
What you're about to listen to is that broadcast,
and all the static and pings you hear are

49
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,520
actual pieces of Saturn's rings hitting the
radio antenna.

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,339
But would outer space really be silent if
I were to walk right out of a space craft

51
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:32,918
into it?
I mean, I wouldn't survive very long, because

52
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:36,909
of a lack of air, a lack of air pressure,
freezing temperatures, radiation, it would

53
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,880
be really terrible.
But even though sound waves could not travel

54
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:46,000
through space itself, there is a medium that
the sound can travel through.

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,579
My body.
That's right.

56
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:54,659
As my blood boiled and my body inflated, it
would vibrate my bones, it would vibrate my

57
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:59,719
body and in turn vibrate my ear drum, which
is something that we experience every day

58
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,410
if you own a Justin Bieber singing toothbrush.
Special toothbrushes like these vibrate in

59
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:10,069
a way that you can barely hear, but as soon
as you bite down on it the vibrations go through

60
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:15,370
your jaw and jiggle your eardrum and you hear
a quite high fidelity version of Justin Bieber's

61
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:21,038
"Baby" or "You Smile," which is fun.
But what this really means is that in space

62
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:27,959
no one can hear you scream.
But you can hear yourself inflate.

63
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,439
Okay, as you guys know, I'm in Alabama with
Destin from SmarterEveryDay.

64
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:40,418
Now, even though I grew up in Kansas, I've
never, in my entire life, fired a gun.

65
00:05:40,418 --> 00:05:44,218
Well, Destin is a ballistics expert, he's
one of the smartest guys I've ever met.

66
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,700
And tonight he's gonna let me fire a gun for
the first time in my life.

67
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:53,538
This is a 9mm bullet, quite common.
This is not gonna be the first thing I shoot

68
00:05:53,538 --> 00:05:56,269
in my life.
This is.

69
00:05:56,269 --> 00:06:00,359
A 50 caliber bullet, Destin says it's a good
idea, and that I'll be okay because I have

70
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,360
a beard.

71
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,520
And as always,

72
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:04,019
thanks for watching.
