00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,220
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And today we're
going to discuss déjà vu. What is it, and

2
00:00:06,219 --> 00:00:10,879
why does it occur? You know, those moments
where the current situation feels like it's

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,600
happened before? You're certain it has, but
you don't know when, or how it became so familiar.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,540
It's difficult to scientifically study déjà vu because there's no reliable way to cause

5
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,429
it to happen in people's heads in a laboratory.

6
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:29,339
But here's what we do know: humans don't seem
to experience déjà vu until they're at least

7
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:34,710
8 or 9 years old. It's most frequent in your
teens and twenties, and then tapers off as

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,009
you get older. So, it might have something
to do with brain development. In fact, we

9
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:45,049
should probably go get ourselves a brain.
That was easy. Now, like a stomach ache, déjà

10
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:50,129
vu may be a symptom with many possible causes.
A lot of the popular theories about what causes

11
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:55,199
it involve a disconnect that may be occurring
between the deep structures of the brain that

12
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:00,299
process our experiences unconsciously, and
the parts of the brain that are conscious

13
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:04,140
of what they experience, process it, and
then tell us what we're seeing.

14
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,009
For the sake of simplicity, let's begin with
the visual system. Now, the brain sits in

15
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:13,438
your head like this, and your eyeballs are
over here seeing things, sending that signal

16
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,489
to the back of the brain, the Occipital lobe,
where visual cortex is. That's where the image

17
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:23,438
is processed and we become aware of what we're
seeing. But visual cortex isn't the first

18
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:28,508
stop that information makes. Instead, we know
that it stops in lots of other places. For

19
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:33,790
instance, the amygdala, where it may be processed
at an involuntary emotional level, and this

20
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:40,009
fun little part right here, #31, the tectum.
It's involved in preliminary visual processing

21
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:41,459
and helps control eye movements.

22
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:47,839
Now, that fact is incredibly important because
what it means is that people with blindness

23
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,859
caused by brain damage to the visual cortex
cannot see anything. They don't report seeing

24
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:58,840
or recognizing anything; however, the other
preliminary parts of the brain that get that

25
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,460
message are still healthy, and so, despite
being legally blind, these people exhibit

26
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,059
what is known as blindsight.

27
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,280
They can defy all odds and avoid an obstacle
course on the ground. They can also be presented

28
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:19,159
faces showing joy, or anxiety and fear, and
feel, without knowing why, at all, on Earth they feel

29
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:21,090
that way, a similar emotion.

30
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,009
So, a lot is going on when we look at things,
and if those preliminary structures in the

31
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:31,579
vision system allow certain blind people to
be oddly and unconsciously aware of what they're

32
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,659
looking at, we may have the ingredients we
need for this disconnect.

33
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:41,740
Think of it this way. If I experience event
A and then B and then C, and the inner parts

34
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,400
of my brain commit it to memory and generate
an emotional response, but then, a fraction

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,080
of a second later, out-of-sync, my visual
cortex finally gets around to telling me,

36
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,500
the conscious aware part of my brain, what
I'm seeing. It will say "Ok guys, we're looking

37
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,949
at A, and then B, and then..." and then the
brain says "Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait,

38
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:07,629
and then C, right? That's already happened
I thought?..." and that may be déjà vu.

39
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:13,159
But what could cause these processes, dealing
with the same information, to get temporarily

40
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:19,889
out-of-sync like that? Well, it's probably
a neurological abnormality, possibly an epileptic

41
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:25,309
episode where neurons all fire in sync. We
also know that patients who experience chronic

42
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:31,400
and persistent déjà vu tend to have brain
damage in the temporal lobes of their brain -

43
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,159
these lobes on either side.

44
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,949
Well that sounds kinda bad, right? I mean, when I
experience déjà vu, should I run to the doctor

45
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:43,449
right away? Well, not at all. In fact, minor
epileptic events are quite common. You've

46
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:48,659
probably experienced a similar phenomenon
known as a Hypnagogic Jerk. That's a fancy

47
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:53,199
name for what occurs when you're about to
fall asleep and then all of the sudden you

48
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:57,129
feel like you're falling, or that you tripped,
and your body jolts itself awake.

49
00:03:57,129 --> 00:04:02,389
What's going on there is that as you fall
asleep your muscles relax, and some part of

50
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:06,679
your brain that's still awake notices that,
and feels like you're no longer supported -

51
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,500
you must be falling - and it sends out a huge
signal that causes all of your muscles to

52
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,479
twitch, waking you up.

53
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:19,719
Oh, and déjà vu is not the only "vu" out there.
There's also something known as Presque vu,

54
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,250
or "tip of the tongue," and this is what happens
when you're familiar with something, you know

55
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,269
you know it, but, for the life of you, at that
moment, you cannot recall it. It's like "what's

56
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:35,549
that actor's name from that movie? I've seen
it 18 times, how can I not remember it? Wow."

57
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:41,090
One explanation of how that happens is that
other words similar to the target word are

58
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:45,729
being remembered, and to help you out your
brain is actively blocking other stuff around

59
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:50,500
it, including the word you're actually looking
for. Now, this explanation is really nice

60
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:55,819
'cause it might actually explain why Presque
vu has a shared or social aspect. Even a

61
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:59,909
bunch of people in a group, all with separate
brains, if they're given the same "blocking

62
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:04,590
words" that are related, no one in the group
can come up with the name until the subject

63
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:09,089
is changed and those words are no longer blocked,
and then all the sudden someone goes "Oh,

64
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:12,119
Gary Sinise, that's who it was. Yup, there
you go."

65
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,180
Ok, finally, Jamais vu. This is when something
that you know, something that you're familiar

66
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:23,000
with, all of a sudden seems brand new and bizarre.
Schizophrenic patients will sometimes see

67
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:28,230
people they know and insist that it's not
the person they know. Instead, it's an imposter.

68
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:32,520
But all of us have probably experienced Jamais
vu to a certain extent, for instance, when

69
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:38,919
you repeat a word over, and over, and over,
and over again, the word starts to lose its

70
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,140
meaning and you start to think "What? How
is this even a word? It's so weird!" Well,

71
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:48,060
scientists believe that happens because continuing
to excite the neurons responsible for that

72
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,290
word causes them to become inhibited, and
further use is less intense.

73
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:58,050
It is just crazy to think that there is so
much out there in the world, in the universe,

74
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,500
that we don't know, that we don't understand,
that we haven't yet discovered. But yet

75
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:08,699
that very feeling of familiarity for what
we do know can't always be trusted. About

76
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,560
the only constant seems to be:

77
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,519
As always,

78
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,519
thanks for watching.
