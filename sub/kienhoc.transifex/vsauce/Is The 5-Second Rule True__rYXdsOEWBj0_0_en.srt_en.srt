00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And bananas are fantastic. They're actually one of the most

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,990
radioactive foods we regularly eat. Sometimes
they're difficult to peel from the top. One

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:17,109
of my favorite ways to avoid that is to simply
hold the banana and snap it in half. Boom,

4
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:24,109
now it peels itself. It's a wonderful little
trick, except when you drop it on the ground.

5
00:00:24,768 --> 00:00:29,659
This is unfortunate, but if it picked it
up quickly, would it be safe enough to eat?

6
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,579
I mean, how quickly do the bacteria on the
floor move onto the food? Some people call

7
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:39,599
it the "5-Second Rule." Others, the "10-Second
Rule." And still, others, the "2-Second Rule."

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,140
But is there any truth to it, or is it just
something we say to allow us to eat food off

9
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,268
the floor?

10
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:55,698
In 2003, Jillian Clarke famously investigated
this question. She found that 50% of men use

11
00:00:55,698 --> 00:01:04,198
the 5-Second Rule to eat food off the ground.
But 70% of women do. More importantly, she

12
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:10,259
found that even brief contact with a contaminated
floor will contaminate food, wet or dry.

13
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,660
The Myth Busters found similar results.
And a paper published in the Journal of Applied

14
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:21,040
Microbiology got even more technical.
The researchers contaminated various floor surfaces

15
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:28,300
with salmonella and they found that 5 seconds
is way too long to wait. Bacteria adhere to

16
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:34,939
dropped food almost immediately, but time
does matter. After 5 seconds, they found that

17
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:41,228
the food had acquired anywhere from 150 to 8000 bacteria. But if left for a full minute,

18
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:44,340
the number they found was 10 times greater.

19
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,259
Now considering it only takes about 10 bacteria
of certain strains of salmonella to infect

20
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,188
you, you should probably think twice 
before eating off the ground.

21
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,700
Oh, and don't complacently think that you're
safe because the floor looks clean or the

22
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:06,100
food that fell on it does. Floors make great
homes for bacteria. Also, floors come in

23
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:12,659
contact with the bottoms of our shoes
and the University of Arizona has found that 93%

24
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:17,840
of our shoes are contaminated with fecal bacteria.

25
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,090
I've linked all of these studies down in the
description. They're great reads, very thorough.

26
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:30,170
But is it true that food dropped on a dirty
floor becomes contaminated immediately?

27
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:35,479
I mean, sure, practically speaking, that makes
a lot of sense. But instantly? Is there a

28
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:41,539
limit to how quickly bacteria can move from
one object to another? Is there an amount

29
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:47,159
of time, short enough, that were I to pick
the food up within it, there would be no way

30
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,378
for what it touched to contaminate it.

31
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:58,179
Well, we're going to need to define "touch."
I've talked about this before on Vsauce and

32
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:04,129
on Thinker and MinutePhysics has a great
quantum perspective, but when we say "touch,"

33
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:11,848
we tend to think of two objects contacting
each other with no space in between. Unfortunately,

34
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:18,659
that's not really what happens. At a subatomic
level, atoms resist smashing together because

35
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:26,189
their electrons repel. Electrons can be modeled
as waves, waves that overlap and interact,

36
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:32,719
but they never touch. There's always space
between them. When I touch something or someone,

37
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:39,569
I'm really just feeling their electrons react
to mine at a distance. A sub-atomically small

38
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:41,500
one, but a real one.

39
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:48,019
So, if that's the case, how come glue can
stick things together? How come lipstick sticks

40
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:54,259
to lips? And how can bacteria on a dirty floor
stick to food that's been dropped on it?

41
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:59,859
The positive charge from the protons in an
atom or molecule isn't always balanced perfectly

42
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:06,560
in space by the negative charge from electrons.
Sometimes, a molecule is asymmetrical and this

43
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:13,039
imbalance is permanent, which gives the molecule
a constant dipole, so it's like a tiny little

44
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,929
magnet.

45
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:19,939
But even in symmetrical molecules, electrons
are mobile. At any one point in time they

46
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:24,250
might happen to find themselves more towards
one end of the molecule than the other, creating

47
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:30,550
rapidly fluctuating dipoles,
causing the molecule to act like a magnet.

48
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,579
If molecules have a lot of energy, they will
simply whiz by one another and their dipoles

49
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:40,859
and those of their neighbors won't matter much.
But if you cool them down, slow them

50
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,970
down, the dipoles will have more of an effect,
which is why molecules tend to stick together

51
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:52,390
as they cool - going from a gas to a liquid to a solid.

52
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,800
That's a lot of information about molecules,
but it's incredibly important. It's the reason

53
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,189
things can get wet. In fact, when you get
out of the shower, you, on average, weigh

54
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:07,990
about one more pound more than you did before
you got wet. It's also the reason Capillary

55
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:14,769
Action happens. If you dip a napkin in a glass
of water, you can watch the water climb up the napkin

56
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:20,339
against gravity. That's because the molecules
of water have very strong dipoles and they're

57
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:25,589
attracted to each other - cohesion - and they're
attracted to molecules of the paper - adhesion -

58
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:29,250
more strongly than gravity pulls them down.

59
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,250
If you want to learn more about intermolecular
forces, I've put a bunch of links down in

60
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:40,600
the description. But here's my question: how
quickly do those forces act? Can two surfaces

61
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:46,680
come into contact, briefly enough, that their
molecules don't have time to be influenced

62
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,689
by intermolecular forces?

63
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:53,899
Well, for this, we're going to need Molecular Dynamics.

64
00:05:53,899 --> 00:06:00,779
Molecular Dynamics is the computer simulation
of the physical movements of atoms or molecules.

65
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:07,179
For instance, this is a simulation of a single
copper atom depositing on a copper surface.

66
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:13,519
Notice that the timer up there is counting
off hundredths of a picosecond. These simulations

67
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:19,698
need to have a narrow enough time-step to
account for the fastest molecular vibrations

68
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:24,319
of the material,
including everything from wagging to scissoring.

69
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,658
Typically, time as brief as a quadrillionth
of a second is taken into account. So, the

70
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:39,699
5-second rule may be true. If we rename it
the "1 Femtosecond Rule." Spend less time

71
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,710
on the floor than that and it's unlikely
that room temperature molecules would have

72
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:51,829
time to be influenced by intermolecular forces.
Except, oops, I think we've been thinking

73
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:57,449
too small. Intermolecular forces are fun,
but objects can become entangled with each

74
00:06:57,449 --> 00:06:59,819
other on a macroscopic level.

75
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,159
Glue and make-up and other sticky stuff often
take advantage of the tiny imperfections -

76
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,340
ridges and nooks and crannies - on an object's
surface. Sticky things can seep inside and

77
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:17,779
hold on. Even surfaces that seem smooth to
us, when you really get down to it, aren't

78
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:19,059
smooth at all.

79
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,280
Two sheets of paper from a phonebook may slide
across each other quite easily, but multiply

80
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:29,609
that friction by the number of pages in two
phonebooks by interweaving the pages and

81
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:34,509
you've got yourself a monster
capable of lifting an entire car.

82
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,840
I was recently lucky enough to see this happen
in real life. You can check out my adventure

83
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:44,360
over on Fast, Furious & Funny. It's a new
channel. Stay tuned, because we lifted cars

84
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,699
with more than just phonebooks.

85
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,780
The adhesion between two objects caused by
the shapes of their surfaces contributes to

86
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:59,079
friction and is known as "mechanical adhesion."
It plays a pretty big role in getting floor

87
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,769
germs to sick to dropped food.

88
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:08,000
In fact, if two surfaces can mechanically
adhere, but aren't close enough to do so,

89
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:12,780
we wouldn't say they were touching. And so,
if by definition "touching" means that you

90
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:18,869
can mechanically adhere to other object's surface,
well, then maybe the 5-Second Rule shouldn't

91
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,939
be known as the "1 Femtosecond Rule,"
because if they're touching, it's already too late

92
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:29,129
and instead the rule should be known as
the "Don't Touch Food That's Fallen on the

93
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:31,109
Floor Rule."

94
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:37,199
But come to think of it, maybe we shouldn't
be eating food that's touched anything, because

95
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:43,989
bacteria are everywhere, including on you
right now. There are more bacteria on your

96
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:49,049
body right now than there are people living in America.

97
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:56,780
There are 40 million bacteria in one gram
of soil and 5 nonillion bacteria on Earth.

98
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:03,899
It's been found that one out of every 10 bank
cards, and one out of every 7 bills, has fecal

99
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,639
bacteria on it.

100
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:11,139
Here's something fun. Go down to the comment
section and type the letter "V." If you used

101
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:18,759
a mobile phone to do that, congratulations,
you just touched 6,281 bacteria. If you're

102
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:23,319
using a desktop keyboard, you're a little
safer. You probably only touched about 180.

103
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,240
Cellphones are actually one of the most bacteria-ridden
things we frequently encounter.

104
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:33,060
If you want to estimate about how many bacteria
are specifically on your phone, based on how

105
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,970
clean you are, The Oatmeal has a really great
quiz. You can find that in the description.

106
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:44,240
But honestly what amazes me the most isn't
how dirty our world is, or how much bacteria

107
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:51,250
there is; instead, it's the fact that despite
those numbers, we don't get sick more often.

108
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:58,840
Our immune system is amazing, but it relies
on the same principles of adhesion that bacteria do.

109
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,220
The forces that cause food dropped on the
floor to pick up germs are the same forces

110
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:10,589
that we need to fight them. They're same forces
that bring us closer together, whether we

111
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:11,550
like it or not.

112
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:13,049
So, keep adhering.

113
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:14,029
And as always,

114
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,560
thanks for watching.
