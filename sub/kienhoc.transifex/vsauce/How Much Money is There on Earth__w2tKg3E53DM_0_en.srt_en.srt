1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,448
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
On Earth

2
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:06,849
the average piece of currency changes hands

3
00:00:06,849 --> 00:00:10,910
about 55 times a year.
That's about once a week.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,548
With that kind of turnover,
it's safe to say that statistically

5
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:19,198
in the United States out of every 100
pieces of currency

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,060
one was most likely touched in the last year

7
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:27,679
by someone who within the next year will
commit murder.

8
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,710
But how much cash,

9
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,230
how much physical currency is there on

10
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:37,599
earth?

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,640
First things first, how much cash

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,280
is inside of bank?
Well, according to the FBI,

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,859
the average successful bank robbery
involves 10,000 dollars.

14
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:54,460
But that's usually just currency from the tellers

15
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,960
tills. In their vaults, the average bank
might have anywhere from 10,000

16
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,899
dollars

17
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:04,599
to a 100,000 dollars with some
larger banks at times

18
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:08,658
carrying as much as a few million in cash.

19
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:14,070
But what about in our homes?
How much loose change do we all have scattered on

20
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:14,809
dressers

21
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,359
or lost under cushions?
Well, it's tough to

22
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:22,009
accurately figure out the exact number
and many of the estimates vary.

23
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:26,090
Last year, Lloyds TSB announced that in the UK

24
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,420
the average person has about Â£14.15 just

25
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,099
lying around. A recent survey by VISA
looked at a bunch of countries

26
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:38,368
and included cash left at home, the office,

27
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:41,968
and in the car.
Their figures are a tad higher,

28
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:45,718
but agree with the US Treasury's
estimate of few years ago

29
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:49,089
that the typical US household has ninety

30
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,820
to a hundred dollars just laying around,

31
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:57,328
which means that if just everyone in
America scrounged up all of their loose

32
00:01:57,328 --> 00:01:58,109
change

33
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:02,468
and put in one place, they would have 15

34
00:02:02,468 --> 00:02:06,069
billion dollars.
That's enough to fund

35
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:10,728
357 more seasons of Arrested Development.

36
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:14,019
But we are asking about how much cash

37
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:18,870
there is on the entire planet.
Well, that amount has a special name.

38
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,890
It is called M0.

39
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:25,219
It's an aggregate of all coins and banknotes.

40
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:28,299
DollarDays.org's most recent estimate

41
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:32,319
values this total amount, considering all
currencies in countries,

42
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,709
at just slightly over the equivalent of 5

43
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:40,159
trillion US dollars.
That number,

44
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,229
the value of all of the currency on Earth,

45
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:47,408
M0, is huge.
But believe it or not,

46
00:02:47,408 --> 00:02:50,560
it represents less than 10 percent

47
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,870
of all of the money we humans have  available to spend

48
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,519
right away.
To explain, we should look at how

49
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:02,620
money is born.
In pretty much every country on Earth,

50
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,050
one of the ways new money can be born involves

51
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:10,340
a central bank. Now, let's say that in our
country the bank is run

52
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,789
by Jake from Vsauce3.
He's really smart

53
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:17,209
and he pays close attention to our economy.
If he feels

54
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:20,259
that an increase of the
money supply would help us, well,

55
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:23,289
he can just make more money.

56
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:27,179
It's that easy.
It doesn't need to be printed as currency

57
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,349
to be born.
The next step involves the commercial banks,

58
00:03:31,348 --> 00:03:35,000
like the Bank of Vsauce.
These are the banks that you and I use.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,489
All the central bank needs to do is buy
some things from these banks using the

60
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:40,650
money it just made

61
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,610
and now the commercial banks have more
money. There's another way money can be

62
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,290
born.

63
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:49,500
It involves commercial banks and gets to
the heart of our question.

64
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,229
If I go to the bank and deposit 5 pounds,

65
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:57,810
the bank says fantastic, 
we will hold on to this money for you

66
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,090
and at anytime you want,
you can withdraw or spend

67
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,509
these 5 pounds.
The thing is, legally,

68
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:07,699
banks only need to reserve a fraction

69
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:12,469
of the money that they are given.
It is known as fractional reserve banking

70
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:16,120
and it pretty much happens in every country.
It means

71
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,949
that if someone else comes along,
like, say, Kevin from Vsauce2

72
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:23,379
and he wants to borrow some money,
say, 3 pounds,

73
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:27,759
the bank can lend him 3 pounds.
And now, whenever he wants he can

74
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,348
spend these 3 pounds.
But here's the thing:

75
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:34,889
Kevin can spend 3 pounds and I can spend 5

76
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:39,199
for a total of 8, despite the fact that
there are only 5 pounds

77
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,158
in the bank.
New money has been born.

78
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:46,569
And if we want to count all of the
spendable money

79
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:50,418
on Earth, we're going to need to include
this type of money, the kind that

80
00:04:50,418 --> 00:04:52,478
fractional reserve banking

81
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,899
creates.
If we include that kind of money,

82
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:59,159
we are now talking about a number much larger than

83
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,419
M0. Economists call this figure

84
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:05,728
M1.
M1 includes all

85
00:05:05,728 --> 00:05:09,849
physical currencies, as well as money
that people can access quickly,

86
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,939
like money in checking accounts.
Globally,

87
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:16,410
across all countries and all currencies, M1 is

88
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,710
estimated to be the equivalent of 25

89
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:22,689
trillion US dollars.

90
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:26,579
M2 is an even broader definition of money

91
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:30,418
and it includes things that you can't
necessarily spend right away.

92
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:33,629
For instance, savings accounts or CDs

93
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:37,199
under a hundred thousand dollars.
M2, globally,

94
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,259
is currently estimated to be the
equivalent of 60

95
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:44,560
trillion US dollars.
Finally,

96
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,500
M3.
This is a broad definition of money that includes

97
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,860
all currencies, banknotes and coins,
checking accounts,

98
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:57,110
savings accounts, small CDs and really
big, long time deposits.

99
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,879
In the American economy, the Federal
Reserve doesn't even report this figure

100
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:01,538
anymore,

101
00:06:01,538 --> 00:06:05,818
but as a measure of eventually
spendable wealth it's real

102
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:09,160
and if we consider M3 the global money supply

103
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,350
that gives us a figure that is equivalent

104
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,379
to 75 trillion

105
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:19,389
US dollars.
Of all that money,

106
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:23,150
how much of it is yours?
Well, last week

107
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:26,668
over Twitter, Mark Boadey introduced me to
Global Rich List

108
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:31,469
dot com.
Enter your salary and figure out how you stack up

109
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,849
against everyone else on Earth.

110
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:38,709
By the way, you can act just like a central bank

111
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:42,079
and control the money supply yourself.

112
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,918
It is illegal, but you can technically
increase the money supply

113
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:50,469
by counterfeiting and you can decrease
the money supply

114
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:54,759
by subtracting money.
For instance,

115
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:58,300
burning it.
If you burn your own money,

116
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,509
you become poorer, but because you've
decrease the money supply,

117
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:07,650
the power of everyone else's money goes up
and they become a tiny tiny bit

118
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:10,799
richer.
Of course, given the amount of money

119
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,669
on Earth and the amount that you could
probably get your hands on and burn,

120
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:18,469
your effect will be quite imperceptible.

121
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,240
One the largest amounts of cash ever
burned was done by KLF,

122
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,220
who in the nineties for reasons

123
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:29,089
no one's still quite sure of, burned a million

124
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:32,848
pounds worth of cash.
It took them about

125
00:07:32,848 --> 00:07:37,069
2 hours to burn all of that cash and
they recorded the act

126
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:40,090
on video.
You can also destroy money

127
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:43,638
by eating it, like the rapper Tyga did.
But

128
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,220
you probably shouldn't do that either
because money

129
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,810
is dirty. A study published in Applied
and Environmental Microbiology

130
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,728
reported that the flu virus can survive on cash

131
00:07:56,728 --> 00:08:00,209
for 1 hour to 2 days.

132
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:03,689
And other studies have found that about
7 percent of cash

133
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:07,009
carries viable strains of dangerous bacteria,

134
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:10,580
like those the cause pneumonia or those
that come from

135
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:13,899
feces.
That is a lot

136
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:18,179
of germs and those germs might be high.

137
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,019
Studies have found that 92 percent of banknotes

138
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:25,728
are contaminated with traces of illegal drugs, typically

139
00:08:25,728 --> 00:08:31,000
cocaine.
In London that number has been as high as 99 percent.

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,009
All it takes is for a few exposed

141
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:37,549
bank notes to circulate normally for all of the cash

142
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:42,389
to become contaminated.
Locked within the fibres of a banknote,

143
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,899
there's an average of 28 micrograms

144
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:50,019
of cocaine, which means that in 5,000 banknotes,

145
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:53,159
there's enough cocaine for an entire

146
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:59,629
line. These drug traces are nearly
impossible to remove from bank notes,

147
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:03,610
so there's little risk of the drugs
transferring to your skin.

148
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,409
However, they can be detected by drug sniffing dogs

149
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:11,568
and, on more than one occasion, courts
have forced police to return confiscated

150
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:12,750
cash,

151
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,828
because even though drug dogs detected
drugs on the cash,

152
00:09:16,828 --> 00:09:20,039
that's just how cash is.

153
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:23,110
As if that wasn't enough, cash is

154
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,980
also not nutritious.
Termites can eat cash,

155
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,639
but to us humans,
the ones who love this stuff so much,

156
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,568
cash as we know it today and, for that matter, money

157
00:09:34,568 --> 00:09:38,568
doesn't really have any intrinsic value.

158
00:09:38,568 --> 00:09:41,958
In a post-apocalyptic world, where nothing was stable

159
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,129
and survival was a challenge, food,

160
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:49,279
clean, water, AMO, weapons, antibiotics, machines,

161
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,909
fuel, the trade and exchange and gifting

162
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:56,539
of those types of things would be our economy.

163
00:09:56,539 --> 00:10:01,159
When what you use as money has an
intrinsic value, it's useful

164
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:05,458
in and of itself, it is known as commodity money.

165
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:08,529
It can also include precious metals, like gold,

166
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:12,269
whose rarity makes it likely to be
accepted by other people

167
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:17,419
for goods and services. Now, when you can
safely store all of your commodities in

168
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:18,139
one place

169
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:21,899
and you don't need a defend them
or lug them around everywhere,

170
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,899
representative money often makes more sense.

171
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:29,458
Store your valuables in a trusted place like a bank

172
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,529
and get some slips of paper from them, saying "yeah, I

173
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:37,610
own that stuff." Now you can walk around
with some easy to carry slips of paper

174
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,789
and use those to buy the things that you want.

175
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:44,428
We are now closer to what we call money today.

176
00:10:44,428 --> 00:10:49,779
I say closer, because almost all money
that we know of today

177
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:53,139
doesn't represent any actual useful commodity

178
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:58,688
anywhere on Earth. This note doesn't
represent how much food or water or gold

179
00:10:58,688 --> 00:11:02,328
or spices or video games I have stocked up in a bank,

180
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,688
it just is money.

181
00:11:05,688 --> 00:11:10,058
It's called fiat money.
Fiat is Latin for "let

182
00:11:10,058 --> 00:11:14,259
it be done."
And that kind of authoritative command is exactly what

183
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:15,698
gives fiat money

184
00:11:15,698 --> 00:11:18,990
its value.
The people who make it have decreed

185
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,548
that it is valuable. Why?

186
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:26,139
Just let it be done.
Because of this,

187
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:30,029
the value a fiat money depends on
everyone believing

188
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:34,350
that the people who make it will
continue to exist and have the authority

189
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,579
that they already do.
This means that the value of fiat money,

190
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:41,808
unlike other commodities, can be erased

191
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:46,529
by force. Let's imagine that you live in
America and have a lot of dollars.

192
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:50,100
Great job.
Well, technically, Canada

193
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,120
could invade and declare that the US
dollar will no longer be accepted

194
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,379
at all.
Well,

195
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:02,740
shucks.
You now have a bunch of paper, which at best

196
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,339
is a incomplete deck of famous American

197
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:10,030
flashcards.
The important distinction here

198
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:13,338
is that invading Canadians could technically

199
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:16,540
erase the value of fiat money.

200
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:20,159
But nothing they said or did could make a commodity,

201
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:25,708
like gold, less valuable.
Other countries would still be glad to take your gold

202
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,769
and in return give you their own, still valuable,

203
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:31,818
currencies.
No amount of force

204
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:36,879
or authority or laws or rules can make a
commodity like potable water

205
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,159
any less important to drink or gold

206
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,048
any less rare.
On the other hand, the value of

207
00:12:44,048 --> 00:12:47,519
fiat money depends on our beliefs,

208
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,980
what we think.
So long as we all believe

209
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,870
that fiat money is valuable, it is.

210
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,480
This happens all the time.
What we believe,

211
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,709
what we think we know, can actually
cause those things

212
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:06,088
to become true.
Actual people, real

213
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:09,209
objects, the way the universe works and deities,

214
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:14,229
like Zeus, can exist all by themselves,
whether we know about them

215
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,438
or believe in them.
But some concepts

216
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:21,548
require us to believe in them
for them to be real.

217
00:13:21,548 --> 00:13:24,879
And if no one believes in them, they literally

218
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,399
aren't true.
It's called the Tinkerbell

219
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,078
effect, and the value of fiat money is an
often-cited example.

220
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:37,058
But what's really cool is the fact that
there are situations where

221
00:13:37,058 --> 00:13:40,698
our convictions can actually destroye

222
00:13:40,698 --> 00:13:44,068
the very thing we believe in.
It's called

223
00:13:44,068 --> 00:13:48,399
the reverse Tinkerbell effect
and it describes the situation,

224
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,428
whereas more people believe something that

225
00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:54,769
thing actually becomes less and less

226
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:59,779
true.
For example, the idea that driving a car

227
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:03,428
is safe.
As more and more people believe this,

228
00:14:03,428 --> 00:14:08,958
more people will go out driving and they
are likely to drive less cautiously,

229
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,458
ironically making driving less

230
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,469
safe.
Another example would be the idea that

231
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:20,509
in an election your vote matters.
As more and more people believe this, more people

232
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:21,779
will go out and vote

233
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:27,159
and the individual weight of each vote will go down.

234
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:30,399
It took hard work and tools

235
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,938
to build civilization and find cures
and explore our solar system,

236
00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:39,759
but we should keep in mind that without
doing anything at all

237
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,958
we are still capable of creation.

238
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,588
By merely believing in something we can make it

239
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:50,290
actually truly real.

240
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,808
Other things can actually be destroyed,

241
00:14:53,808 --> 00:14:57,019
if we merely believe in them.

242
00:14:57,019 --> 00:14:58,120
Can you believe that?

243
00:14:58,379 --> 00:14:59,460
And as always,

244
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,040
thanks for watching.
