1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:03,540
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
But now

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,300
I'm not. I'm gone like 90% of
the original silent films

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,009
ever made.
Six of the seven wonders of the ancient world

4
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:16,539
deleted, like that text you thought twice about sending

5
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:19,920
or a Snapchat photo, right?

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,439
When Stalin decided that Trotsky was
an enemy of the state,

7
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:28,268
he had Trotsky removed from photos he appeared in

8
00:00:28,268 --> 00:00:32,159
with Lenin.
Plenty of software tools and professional services

9
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,328
allow you to do the same.
Don't just

10
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:39,370
forget the actual attendees of a moment in time,

11
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:43,149
delete them.
But where do things go

12
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:45,799
when they're deleted?

13
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:50,030
The Google Ngram Viewer allows you
to search words and phrases

14
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,698
in 5.2 million books published between 1500

15
00:00:54,698 --> 00:00:58,329
and 2008.
It's a great way to see how

16
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:01,789
the words we use have changed overtime.

17
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:05,640
1979 was a significant

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,359
year. According to the Ngram Viewer,
it was the first year we begin to use the

19
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:10,969
word

20
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:14,329
delete more often than the word

21
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:17,759
erase.
Biological deletion

22
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,929
still wins though. Forget is by far more
pervasive in our communication

23
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:26,649
but how does a computer forget?

24
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:30,649
Moving a file to the trash is just the beginning.

25
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:34,579
To protect against accidental deletion,
when thrown in the trash

26
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:39,109
a file remains on your computer in a
temporary directory, a sort of

27
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:44,609
purgatory, where it awaits a more
ultimate deletion but can be resurrected

28
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:48,200
if you wish.
When you empty the trash

29
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,269
you are warned that you cannot undo the action.

30
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:54,929
But when you empty the trash, the physical space

31
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,409
inhabited by the file isn't actually emptied.

32
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,909
It's marked as empty.
Available

33
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:05,210
if and when new data needs to be stored somewhere.

34
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:09,250
The file's home has become available real estate

35
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,870
but the file itself hasn't moved out.
Only the pointers

36
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,730
have gone away. Pointers are another type
of data on your drive that point to

37
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:20,229
places in memory

38
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:24,238
where the actual file they are referencing
can be found.

39
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,730
They're a bit like the table of contents,
which means that on most

40
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:31,189
operating systems deleting a file and emptying the trash

41
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:34,329
is like deleting a chapter from a book

42
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:37,390
by turning to the table of contents and marking

43
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:42,078
the chapter as empty.
There's nothing here, do what you want with the pages.

44
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:46,489
To a computer reading the table of
contents it looks like the space is

45
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:49,469
empty but of course that doesn't change
the fact that the contents of the

46
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,099
chapter

47
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:54,650
are still there.
Special data recovery tools

48
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,659
look through memory marked empty available

49
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:01,310
to see what's actually there.
If you're lucky,

50
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,579
they can even find a file and save it, bring it back

51
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:08,199
mark it not available, undeleted.

52
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:11,940
But if some of the file has already been overwritten,

53
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:15,729
there can be problems.
The file can be

54
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:19,768
corrupted, melded together with other
data like some kind of digital

55
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:23,239
Frankenstein's monster.
A couple years ago

56
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:26,549
a laptop that belonged to photographer
Melanie Willhide

57
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:30,859
was stolen.
It contained many of her recent digital photos.

58
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:35,669
Luckily, police were able to return the
laptop to her. They found it in a car they

59
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:36,489
pulled over,

60
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:41,900
but the thief had wiped the laptop's
hard drive clean and had been using it

61
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,419
for his own purposes.

62
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:46,600
Data recovery experts were able to find

63
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:50,039
some of her files, still there,
on the now-empty space,

64
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:53,099
but the files had been slightly overwritten

65
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,299
by things the thief had done.
They'd been corrupted but in a

66
00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:00,510
really cool way.
So cool Willhide decided to exhibit the work.

67
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:03,870
She titled the show after the thief who made it possible,

68
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,959
"To Adrian Rodriguez, with love."

69
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,209
If you want to delete the file so completely

70
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:14,359
it can't even be recovered in a cool,
weird way, like Willhide's photos,

71
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:18,449
you will need to overwrite the unwanted file

72
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:22,030
completely.
Deny the file a proper burial

73
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,059
and rearrange its corpse with new data.

74
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,850
One overwrite should be fine but some
people do as many as 35.

75
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,410
Even 35 overwrites might not be enough.

76
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:39,080
Sure, the overridden data is hidden, but what about bad

77
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,969
sectors? These are parts of a drive that
devices can't access

78
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,280
because of failed transistors or physical damage.

79
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:52,478
An overwrite won't be able to reach them,
meaning any data that was ever put there

80
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:59,269
stays there. So, if you are the United
States Department of Defense and you

81
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:00,948
don't want to take any risks,

82
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:04,990
you will also shred, physically polarize

83
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:09,180
unwanted drives.
The US, Europe, Japan

84
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,750
often send such electronics waste to dumps

85
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,459
in Ghana, like this one.
This city in Ghana is known as

86
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:19,589
Earth's digital dumping ground.

87
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:23,158
Why Ghana?
Well, it is cheaper to send

88
00:05:23,158 --> 00:05:27,860
unsalvageable electronics to Africa,
marked as a donation,

89
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,669
than it is to properly recycle them.

90
00:05:31,668 --> 00:05:34,769
But there, in these electronic dumps,

91
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:38,098
the files can still be brought back to life.

92
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:42,639
Organized criminals operating in Ghana
have managed to successfully recover

93
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,468
data

94
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:47,300
from unregulated e-dumps.
They've been able to find confidential

95
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,680
multi-million-dollar agreements, involving

96
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,069
the Defense Intelligence Agency, Homeland Security

97
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:56,759
and the TSA.
Shredding

98
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,330
paper to get rid of whatever used to be
on the paper isn't even safe

99
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:06,288
either. It's not easy and it doesn't
always work. But by scanning

100
00:06:06,288 --> 00:06:11,120
shreds of paper computer software can
match the pieces together.

101
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,168
But in the past, shredded documents 
have been unshred

102
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:21,218
by hand. In 1979 Iranian students seized
the US Embassy in Tehran.

103
00:06:21,218 --> 00:06:25,050
With the help of local carpet weavers and
years of hard work,

104
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,180
they managed to reassemble thousands of
pages of confidential documents

105
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,718
shred by the CIA.
The smaller the shredded particles

106
00:06:33,718 --> 00:06:37,019
are and the more of them there are,
the more difficult the task. So,

107
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:40,848
the Department of Defense requires that
the majority of shredded particles

108
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:45,848
not exceed 5 square millimetres.

109
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:49,319
If you really want to delete something, destroy it,

110
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,819
erase it, time is on your side.

111
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:55,860
In about 5.4 billion years

112
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,569
the Sun will become the ultimate shredder.

113
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:03,610
A red giant large enough to swallow earth whole.

114
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,439
Everything will be fine for billions of years.

115
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:12,150
But many accepted models of the universe
predict that in 10 to the 100

116
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:13,459
years

117
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:17,778
whatever intelligence is left will
witness the universe's

118
00:07:17,778 --> 00:07:21,098
dark era and its final

119
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:24,528
Heat Death, the end of the universe, the end of

120
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:27,639
any file or photo or memory of you

121
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:32,199
ever being accessed again.
Every time something happens

122
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,620
a little bit of energy is lost.
For instance,

123
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,590
friction through sound or heat.
That energy goes out into the universe a

124
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:42,528
little bit at a time, slowly

125
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:46,408
more and more.
Eventually, in a closed system,

126
00:07:46,408 --> 00:07:51,269
energy becomes homogeneous,
evenly distributed, the same

127
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:54,930
everywhere.
There's no gradient maximum

128
00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:00,189
entropy.
In a little glass of ice water it's pretty quotidian

129
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:03,559
but given enough time our entire universe

130
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:09,080
may be no different. A gradient,
a difference in energy from one place to

131
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,199
another is necessary for

132
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,759
things to happen, for files to be created and read,

133
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,528
for life to exist.
And in 10 to the 100 years

134
00:08:19,528 --> 00:08:22,689
there may not be any usable energy

135
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:27,090
left.
In Isaac Asimov's short story "The Last Question"

136
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:30,348
humans are concerned about this.
As the story

137
00:08:30,348 --> 00:08:33,899
leapfrogs billions of years into the future,

138
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:37,689
their list of solutions doesn't get any longer

139
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:43,030
than none. So, if we think across a grand timescale

140
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:46,179
is cosmic deletion the freezing

141
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:50,549
of everything, heat death, all we have to look forward to

142
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:53,939
in this universe?

143
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,029
We went to the Moon.
We brought

144
00:08:57,028 --> 00:09:00,338
flags with us that we planted on the
Moon, representing a place

145
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:04,010
on earth.
But those American flags on the Moon

146
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:07,409
are likely erased now,

147
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:11,889
their symbols and colors bleached by the
intense radiation of the Sun on the

148
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:12,759
lunar surface,

149
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:16,950
unfiltered by any atmosphere.
The flags are still there, we didn't

150
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,259
take them back with us but now day are

151
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:25,730
empty. White flags.
White flags representing our surrender

152
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:31,810
to the inevitability of deletion in the universe.

153
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:34,819
But we, today, are preoccupied with

154
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:39,340
just the opposite.
What really saturates our language,

155
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,370
what we really seem to talk about is

156
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,779
creation.
Things happening, not

157
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:49,049
loss.
Compared to erase,

158
00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:52,829
forget and delete, "make" practically

159
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,840
deletes deletion.

160
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,860
The flags on the Moon are bleached

161
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,940
out but is that bleak?
Are they

162
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,750
deleted or blank, like a fresh

163
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:10,889
sheet of paper ready for new stories?
Really, it just depends on what you

164
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:14,120
make of it.
So thanks for making things.

165
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,159
And as always,

166
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,639
thanks for watching.
