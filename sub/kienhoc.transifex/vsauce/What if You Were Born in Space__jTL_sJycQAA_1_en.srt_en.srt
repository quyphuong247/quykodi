00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,020
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
How many people

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,139
are in space right now

3
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:10,769
dot com tells us that the answer

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,940
is 6. Ever since the first person reached

5
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:19,739
outer space 52 years ago, more than 500 humans

6
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:23,399
have left Earth and they've gone as far as the moon,

7
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:28,009
an impressive distance. I mean, space
stations, which we use in outer space

8
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:28,820
today

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,230
are way cool, but to scale they only

10
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:36,269
orbit about this far away from Earth.
Whereas

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,590
the Moon, where Apollo astronauts went,

12
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,600
is way out

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,058
here.
For the last twelve years,

14
00:00:47,058 --> 00:00:51,320
there has been a continuous and
uninterrupted presence

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,020
of humans living in space.
Different people at different times,

16
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,609
ever since November of 2001.
But so far,

17
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:04,049
all of us, every human who has

18
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,890
ever existed was born right here on

19
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,349
Earth. Of course, Earth is a giant
collection of matter that got together

20
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:14,158
in space,

21
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,909
held together by its own gravity, so technically,

22
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,159
we were all born in space.
But I wanna talk about

23
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,259
outer space.
What is our

24
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,078
relation to it and within it?

25
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:33,750
How suited is our biology for the
larger universe we were born into?

26
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,650
More specifically, if you were born and raised

27
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,500
beyond earth, what would you look like?

28
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,560
First things first.
Where

29
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:49,099
is outer space?
Well, outer space happens to be

30
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:52,908
about one hundred thousand meters above your head.

31
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:56,420
At that point the atmosphere is so thin

32
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,530
that in order to achieve lift, an
aircraft has to travel at a speed

33
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,310
so quickly that that speed is the same

34
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,590
as an orbital speed.
An orbital speed

35
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,550
is a speed that is so fast, even with no lift,

36
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,450
even while falling you don't,

37
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:19,609
because the earth literally curves

38
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,739
away from you as fast as you fall

39
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,560
towards it. This is what astronauts in
the International Space Station are

40
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,620
really doing.

41
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,769
They're falling. It's a common misconception
that astronauts float around

42
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:37,629
weightless in space, 
because there is no gravity there.

43
00:02:37,628 --> 00:02:41,409
But there's plenty of gravity.
In fact, there's pretty much the same amount of

44
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:41,969
gravity

45
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:45,449
operating on them that there is
operating on you

46
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:48,889
right now while you watch this video.
Believe it or not,

47
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:53,759
if we build a tower all the way up to
where the International Space Station

48
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,889
orbits, 370,000 meters high,

49
00:02:56,889 --> 00:03:02,068
and you walked out onto the top of that
tower, it would feel kind of like this.

50
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,480
You would just be walking around like I'm walking

51
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,539
right now. You wouldn't feel that much different,

52
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:13,329
but the International Space Station
would be whizzing by

53
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,719
at 17,000 miles per hour.
It has to,

54
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:21,830
because they are falling. So to say that
astronauts float around in

55
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,430
orbit, because they are experiencing zero gravity

56
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,280
is very misleading.
Really, what they are feeling

57
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,598
is Zero-G, where G is accelleration

58
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,518
felt as weight.
G hurts

59
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,650
so good, because gravity's limiting influence

60
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,140
insures that we develop correctly and healthfully.

61
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:48,348
After all, it is what we were born to thrive in.

62
00:03:48,348 --> 00:03:51,658
So asking what a human would look like, if conceived

63
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:54,979
gestated, delivered and raised in orbit

64
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:59,268
would look like, requires a discussion of weightlessness.

65
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:03,980
Realistically, people building colonies
on planets beyond Earth

66
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:07,068
or traveling through space for long
periods of time,

67
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:12,348
who expected new humans to be born, would
utilize technology that helped mimic

68
00:04:12,348 --> 00:04:14,399
conditions here on earth.

69
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,239
But until artificial gravity is
perfected and can be easily implemented,

70
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:22,859
it's important to understand the effect
weightlessness has on

71
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,199
our biology and other things.
For instance,

72
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,370
in a zero-g environment hot air doesn't

73
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,350
rise.
So a candle flame is not shaped like a stretched

74
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,430
ball of glowing gas that's drawn upward.

75
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,530
Instead, it's just a round

76
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,638
ball of hot gas.

77
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,478
We are not sure we can make babies

78
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,879
in space. The logistics of merely
hugging are difficult enough.

79
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,860
A recent invention, called the '2suit',
might make it easier.

80
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,740
The 2suit provides effortless intimacy
in weightless environment, such as

81
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,189
outer space or on planets with low gravity.

82
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:07,300
But will it be enough to ensure that
conception happens?

83
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,470
The enzyme responsible for stopping the
movement of a sperm cell's

84
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,600
tale doesn't work very well when they're at zero-g.

85
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,180
In space, sperms

86
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:22,509
swim faster.
One thing we know about babies

87
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:26,530
inside mothers in space involves the development

88
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:31,409
of the vestibular system. Canals in the
inner ear that use the flow of fluid

89
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,639
to determine movement, up versus down and balance.

90
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:41,319
In a zero-g environment the fluid in the
vestibular system just floats around.

91
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:45,009
It's confused.
And this can lead to motion sickness,

92
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:48,460
visual illusions and disorientation.
It's called

93
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:52,569
spaced adaptation syndrome and it
affects about 50 percent

94
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:56,449
of astronauts.
Confusion about motion can make you

95
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:00,569
vomit, carsick, seasick, zero-g sick,

96
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:04,360
because of survival.
It's believed that

97
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,069
motion sickness, a confusion about acceleration,

98
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:13,030
is similar to the effects caused by the
consumption of poisonous plants,

99
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:16,489
in which case vomiting can save your life.

100
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,019
Pregnant rats taken to space

101
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:24,109
give birth to babies back on earth that
struggle with directions.

102
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,699
Unlike rat babies that gestated here on earth,

103
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:31,728
the ones that gestated in space have
trouble writing themselves when thrown

104
00:06:31,728 --> 00:06:32,959
into water.

105
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,500
They do tend to be better at processing
orientations common during

106
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,019
weightlessness,

107
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:41,149
which is a good sign for humans gestated,

108
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:44,899
born and raised in space, but it's some of the only

109
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:50,500
good news. Vestibular fluid isn't the
only fluid to be affected by a zero-G

110
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,689
environment.
All of your body fluids are. On

111
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:57,329
earth, gravity pulls those fluids down, but in

112
00:06:57,329 --> 00:07:00,699
orbit, the fluid is free to evenly distribute,

113
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:05,810
giving astronauts their characteristic
bird legs and puffy faces.

114
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:11,519
Cosmetically it's kind of a bummer.
And all of that new fluid pressure in your face

115
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,348
can compromise vision. Of 27
astronauts studied after long space

116
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:17,139
flights

117
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:20,418
nine had fluid expansion around the optic nerve,

118
00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:24,698
6 had eyeballs flattened in the back by fluid pressure

119
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:28,199
and four had bulging optic nerves.

120
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,829
More fluid pressure in your head causes 
an errant message

121
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:36,439
that your body must have too much fluid.
So the bodies of zero-G travelers

122
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,918
respond by

123
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:43,329
producing less blood. Astronauts can lose
up to 22 percent of their total blood

124
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,219
volume

125
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,479
while in space, leading to weaker

126
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:51,728
atrophied hearts.
Away from Earth's protection,

127
00:07:51,728 --> 00:07:55,168
radiation from the Sun, and the rest of the universe,

128
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:59,740
is incredibly dangerous and we're still
not exactly sure how to best guard

129
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,810
against it.

130
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:06,370
Mice exposed to levels of radiation
expected during interplanetary journeys

131
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:10,889
showed signs of different brain blood
flow and larger plaques of the type

132
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:12,189
found in patients

133
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:15,209
with Alzheimer's.
Psychologically,

134
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:19,870
feelings of isolation in space,
thinking about just how far away you are

135
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,668
from the rest of humanity

136
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:25,870
can affect you physically. Scientists
working at the South Pole have developed

137
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,870
compromised immune systems

138
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,800
with fewer T-cells.
As for the shape of your body,

139
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,089
fully grown astronauts in orbit, no longer pressed

140
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:38,659
down by earth typical g-force experience

141
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:43,588
spinal expansion, sometimes growing by as
much as 3 percent

142
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,970
before they come back to Earth.
A 6-foot-tall human

143
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,700
can go to space and come back as a 6-foot 2-inch tall

144
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,190
person. 
Without usual and necessary stress,

145
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:59,540
bones in space atrophy at a rate of
about one percent

146
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,009
per month.
Given enough time, total bone mass

147
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:06,990
lost can be as high as 40 to 60 percent.

148
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,639
And when weightless, you don't need as
much muscle strength to

149
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:15,639
move around. This causes the muscles of
people weightless in space to atrophy.

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,458
Those that you use to fight gravity can
shrink 5 percent per month,

151
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:24,619
for total muscle mass loss of 20 percent.

152
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,399
It's all kind of scary and sad.

153
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,309
But don't bother crying over it, 
because without 1G to pull them down,

154
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:36,799
tears don't work the same way in space.

155
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,539
Astronaut Chris Hadfield makes excellent
videos about how things happen

156
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:41,389
differently

157
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:46,990
in orbit. For instance, tears just pool
upon your face due to surface tension.

158
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,600
In space you can cry, but as he says,

159
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,399
the tears don't fall.
We know that these problems exist for

160
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:58,870
adults in space.
Theoretically they would affect

161
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,519
developing children in space even more so.

162
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,320
Parallels have been drawn between the
way a child skeleton would likely

163
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,149
develop in

164
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:10,399
orbit and diseases that cause weak

165
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,350
and soft bones here on earth.
Bones that break and heal

166
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,750
according to different forces than the
typical downward ones,

167
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,399
like Rickets. It's tenable to say that
without proper precautions,

168
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,539
exercise and care, like adult astronauts already take,

169
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:31,208
children developing in space could look like this.

170
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:34,719
Not because of Rickets or a lack of vitamin D,

171
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,000
but because the usual forces and active
use required for healthy bone

172
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,089
development

173
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:43,500
just wouldn't be there.
Added to the other threats,

174
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,570
imagine a body shaped like this but with

175
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,040
thinner legs, thin, weak muscles, a puffier

176
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:54,509
face, poor eyesight and a higher than
usual proclivity to dementia later

177
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:55,879
in life.

178
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:59,549
Doesn't sound very good, does it?
Remember though that a lot of this

179
00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:03,528
is speculation.
Few studies have been done on the topic

180
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:08,019
and few are planned for the future.
We don't even know if a healthy fetus can

181
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:09,578
develop in the first place

182
00:11:09,578 --> 00:11:13,159
or if conception can even occur in space.

183
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:16,669
When I think about how little we know
about our bodies

184
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:20,399
and how our bodies might grow and
develop in the larger

185
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,490
universe beyond earth, I like to think about

186
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,079
plankton.
These little guys live in the ocean

187
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:31,229
and they exist in staggering numbers.

188
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:35,100
Many varieties are too small to even see individually,

189
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,159
but collectively they can be seen from space.

190
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:43,439
It's estimated that there are more
plankton in the oceans of Earth

191
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,130
than there are stars in our galaxy.
More plankton on

192
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:51,039
Earth than there are galaxies in the observable

193
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:54,088
universe.
And these guys

194
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:58,029
wonder around at the whim of ocean currents.

195
00:11:58,028 --> 00:12:02,629
They're wanderers. In fact, they get their
name from the Greek word for

196
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:05,789
wanderer, a name that they share with objects

197
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:10,149
seen wondering in the sky.
Planets.

198
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:13,620
Plankton on a planet.
Wanderers

199
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,919
on a wanderer.
Maybe,

200
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:21,899
like ocean plankton, we humans are
destined to wander far and wide

201
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:26,019
eventually also becoming more numerous than the stars

202
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:29,889
in our galaxy.
It's within the realm of what we can achieve.

203
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:33,570
But before we start feeling too excited, too proud,

204
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,990
keep in mind that we know very little

205
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,190
about how our bodies grow and develop

206
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:44,100
outside of this wanderer, this planet.

207
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,639
And even though we know a lot of older

208
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:51,470
words that sound like body,

209
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:56,540
fundamentally we don't even know why we
call these things

210
00:12:56,539 --> 00:13:00,120
bodies in the first place.

211
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,528
And as always, thanks for watching.
