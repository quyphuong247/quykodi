00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,139
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
Text.

2
00:00:03,138 --> 00:00:07,369
The printed word.
Vitally important,

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,839
but never naked.
When

4
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:14,419
words and letters are printed,
they have to wear the

5
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:19,640
clothing of a typeface. A font family.
We don't always think of it this way, but

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,609
you cannot

7
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,090
type without using a typeface.

8
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:27,969
Even right now, here on YouTube,
when you leave a comment,

9
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:31,788
you are communicating your own words,
your own thoughts,

10
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:34,969
but through the visual styling of someone

11
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:39,980
else - the creator up Arial.
In these Vsauce videos,

12
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:43,390
Jake, Kevin, myself and others use Alsina,

13
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,700
because it most closely resembles the handwritingof

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,120
Nik Guinta, the creator of the Vsauce

15
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:53,198
logo. Now, thinking of typefaces

16
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,640
as fashion for letters is not a new idea.

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,948
Adrian Frutiger famously said
that the work of a type designer

18
00:01:00,948 --> 00:01:04,688
is just like the work of dressmaker.
Or

19
00:01:04,688 --> 00:01:08,089
as Alan Fletcher put it, a typeface is an

20
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:13,350
alphabet in in a straitjacket.
Some typefaces have serifs

21
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:16,780
and some don't.
Some are famously neutral,

22
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,390
while others are silly or ugly.

23
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,939
But one typeface is

24
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:27,188
so silly and so ugly

25
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:30,339
and so popular that it has

26
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,600
arguably become the most hated font

27
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,739
of all time. Comic Sans.
People who consider themselves

28
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:42,759
discerning designers scoff at its ubiquity,

29
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,899
usually wielded by amatures who

30
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,228
don't know better.
It was recently reported that

31
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:54,310
on Twitter, the only thing complained
about more often than Justin Bieber,

32
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,379
but less frequently than airlines, is

33
00:01:57,379 --> 00:02:01,118
Comic Sans.
Online you can play

34
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,399
a Kill Comic Sans game.
And the website

35
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,710
Ban Comic Sans provides a gigantic

36
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:11,810
list of hand-written looking fonts
that they would prefer you use

37
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,360
instead.
Comic Sans is so hated

38
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,750
it's almost pulled a 360 and is

39
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,949
cool again, ironically.
David OReilly's amazing t-shirts, for example.

40
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:28,060
But irony isn't the only thing

41
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,909
Comic Sans has going for it.
The British Dyslexia Association considers

42
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:34,019
Comic Sans

43
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:38,319
a particularly good font for children
who have trouble reading letters because

44
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:39,738
of its easily distinguishable

45
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:44,560
characters, like the letter A.
For most of our history

46
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,610
books and signs had to be hand

47
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,750
written, often meticulously and expensively copied

48
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,810
by hand.
There were no printers, no typesetters.

49
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,908
If you wanted a book, someone had to

50
00:02:57,908 --> 00:03:01,449
literally write by hand the whole book for you.

51
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:04,869
But Gutenberg changed that by popularizing

52
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,280
interchangeable type.
He modelled his tight pieces after the

53
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,110
handwriting of scribes at the time,
producing what could be called

54
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,580
the very first font ever textura.

55
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,219
Later on, typesetters in Italy realized
that words could be

56
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:24,219
slanted and remain legible and readable,

57
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:28,859
but take up less vertical space,
so more could be printed on a single

58
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,549
page.
That's why it's called italics. Not because

59
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:35,739
italics means slanted or oblique, 

60
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:40,530
but because of where it was invented - Italy.
Metal type

61
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,848
pieces had to be cast from molten metal

62
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:47,238
in foundries, which get their name from the French

63
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:50,849
fondue, which means something that has been melted.

64
00:03:50,848 --> 00:03:55,469
And so it's because of the word fondue that
we now call a collection of characters

65
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:56,908
within a typeface

66
00:03:56,908 --> 00:04:00,079
a font.
When setting type,

67
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,500
typesetters kept their type pieces in cases.

68
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,219
The most commonly used pieces were kept
in the lower case for easy access,

69
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:11,419
whereas capitals were kept just a little above

70
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:14,818
in the upper case.
Back

71
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:19,759
to Comic Sans.
Comic Sans was designed in 1994

72
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,970
by Vincent Connare.
According to the BBC,

73
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,770
Melinda Gates herself asked Connare to design

74
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:30,799
a font for the cartoon dog in Microsoft Bob

75
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,340
to speak in.
And so, within three days,

76
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:38,049
Connare had designed Comic Sans,
based on hand drawn fonts

77
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,110
from comic books.
It never actually made it into the final version of

78
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,800
Microsoft Bob,

79
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,569
but was subsequently released as a font
choice on so many Microsoft products

80
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:55,689
that it became what it is today.
Million of amateurs now had access to this font,

81
00:04:55,689 --> 00:05:00,019
which seemed simple and cute and became
popular on things like homemade birthday

82
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:00,870
cards,

83
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,620
but also in less appropriate situations.

84
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,759
For instance, on an official Canadian coin

85
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,900
or on a gravestone.

86
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:14,129
Because of things like that, Comic Sans has amassed

87
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:18,759
a lot of haters.
But it was never intended to be used

88
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,530
so often or in such inappropriate situations.

89
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:26,459
And so in reality, the fault may lie

90
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,829
with us, the typers.

91
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,859
Comic Sans doesn't disappoint people.

92
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,220
People disappoint people.

93
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:41,580
Another way to think of it is this.
Discerning type aficionados

94
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:45,228
may recognize Comic Sans so quickly because

95
00:05:45,228 --> 00:05:48,379
it is a threat.
Type design

96
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:51,779
is a specialized discipline, but now

97
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:55,168
anybody with a computer can take a stab at it

98
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:58,810
without your approval.
They don't need

99
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,720
you.
To be sure, Comic Sans, objectively speaking,

100
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,300
isn't really that well designed
according to the fundamentals of type

101
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,280
design.

102
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,029
David Kadavy has a brilliant
explanation of this in his

103
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:16,000
"Why You Hate Comic Sans."
He points out that it's

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,038
unbalanced and not very well kerned.

105
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,519
Comic Sans is certainly not a calculated, precise

106
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:25,818
font liked Trajan.
But it's not organic, like

107
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:29,800
real handwriting.
Instead, it lies within

108
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,439
the uncanny valley.
This concept often comes up in robotics.

109
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,519
The more human something gets,
the cuter it becomes and

110
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:43,418
the more we like it,
until its almost human

111
00:06:43,418 --> 00:06:47,079
but not quite.
At this point, things become

112
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:51,490
creepy, almost scary.
Perhaps Comic Sans

113
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:56,139
exists in that same area, typographically speaking.

114
00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:01,360
But that said, the screens that Comic Sans
was originally designed to appear

115
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:01,889
on,

116
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:05,978
were typically aliased, and as Kadavy
points out, compared to fonts like

117
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:07,159
Garamond,

118
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,449
Comic Sans does really well here.

119
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:14,139
That is how we should think about Comic Sans.

120
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:18,490
A pragmatic font, a font that worked
remarkably well in its

121
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,639
era and exists today as one of the most
recognizable

122
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,759
relics of one of the most important
design revolutions

123
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,288
in history.
Books used to be painstakingly copied by

124
00:07:31,288 --> 00:07:35,889
hand.
Now later, you could design a story or an idea,

125
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:39,500
but the final look really just came down to what a

126
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,949
few typesetters could do.
Today,

127
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:46,680
almost anyone can dabble in typography

128
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,189
and that is an amazing thing.
Sure,

129
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:54,279
it means that Comic Sans will be used.

130
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:57,489
A lot.
But as Corey Holms points out, Comic Dans

131
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,978
is proof the design works.
The public understands that

132
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:05,990
"type means more than words."

133
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,620
And David Kadavy argues that just as
interchangeable type

134
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,340
led to a spread of literacy, Comic Sans,

135
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:16,388
and the personal publishing it comes along with,

136
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:20,090
should lead us toward a spread of design

137
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:22,529
literacy.

138
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:25,529
Sure.
Comic Sans is a bit

139
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:30,000
ugly.
But it's ugly in the same way that the first few chords

140
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,409
of 'Smoke on the Water' are ugly, as

141
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:37,219
played by almost every beginning guitarist,

142
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,310
who picks up a guitar at almost every

143
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:43,869
instrument store.
Sure, it sounds

144
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:49,090
annoying and a little bit fumbly, but it
represents someone who is using

145
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:52,930
tools to move toward mastery.

146
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:58,139
Adrian Frutiger said that type
has the power to make the whole world of

147
00:08:58,139 --> 00:08:58,870
thought

148
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,460
legible, simply by rearranging the same letters

149
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,800
over and over again.
Well, Comic Sans,

150
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,029
overused by the untrained majority

151
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:13,919
may seem unsavory to some people,
but as such,

152
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,069
it most loudly represents something phenomenal.

153
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,830
Today it is possible for the whole world of

154
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:25,770
thought to be made legible and be shared

155
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:28,309
by the whole world.

156
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,199
And as always,

157
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,820
thanks for watching.
