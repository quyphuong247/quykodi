00:00:03,549 --> 00:00:06,545
Hey, Vsauce, Michael here,
and you guys

3
00:00:06,546 --> 00:00:10,028
are my family.

4
00:00:10,028 --> 00:00:14,018
Scientifically speaking,
geneticists tell us

5
00:00:14,018 --> 00:00:17,593
that every single person on earth
is, at the least,

6
00:00:17,593 --> 00:00:20,565
50th cousins
with everybody else on earth.

7
00:00:20,565 --> 00:00:24,071
It kind of has to be that way.

8
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:28,251
Think of it like this—
you have two biological parents

9
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:31,594
and four biological grandparents,

10
00:00:31,594 --> 00:00:34,960
and eight biological great-grandparents.
It keeps doubling.

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,814
Well, if you follow your family tree
all the way back

12
00:00:38,814 --> 00:00:43,156
to the time of the ancient Romans,
64 generations ago,

13
00:00:43,156 --> 00:00:45,817
that tree would need

14
00:00:45,817 --> 00:00:50,113
one quintillion separate individuals,

15
00:00:50,113 --> 00:00:52,597
which is a number
that is larger

16
00:00:52,597 --> 00:00:56,820
than the number of humans
who have ever existed. Ever.

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
So what does that mean?

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,930
Well, I think Bill Bryson put it best
when he said,

19
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,436
"You couldn't be here
without a little incest—

20
00:01:04,436 --> 00:01:08,429
actually, quite a lot of incest."

21
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,635
Nothing ridiculous, mind you,
but if you go far enough back

22
00:01:11,635 --> 00:01:14,676
in your family tree,
you're going to find that quite frequently,

23
00:01:14,676 --> 00:01:18,159
people who were distantly related
had kids.

24
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,989
In fact, if you are currently dating
or married to somebody

25
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:26,564
who is from your own country
and is of your own ethnicity,

26
00:01:26,563 --> 00:01:29,531
there's a one in five chance
that the two of you share

27
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:34,337
a common family member
fewer than 10 generations ago.

28
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:40,213
Furthermore, because our society
is becoming more and more mobile,

29
00:01:40,212 --> 00:01:44,902
our most recent common ancestor
is becoming more recent.

30
00:01:44,903 --> 00:01:48,896
Mathematical models are now showing us
that for everybody,

31
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:52,426
every human on earth right now,
our most recent common ancestor

32
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:56,164
probably lived
only 2,000 to 4,000 years ago.

33
00:01:56,164 --> 00:01:58,579
A recent study—it's a great one,
you should read it—

34
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:02,387
found that there was
a person alive

35
00:02:02,387 --> 00:02:06,983
as early as 300 B.C.
who is related

36
00:02:06,983 --> 00:02:10,560
to every single person alive
on Earth today.

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,530
Their study also found
that that person most likely lived

38
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,572
in Taiwan
near a busy port city,

39
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:20,680
so their descendants could quickly spread
around the world.

40
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,790
Now, all that said, you only receive half
of your genetic information

41
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:27,390
from your mother
and half from your father,

42
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,944
and as you go up your tree,
it's quite possible

43
00:02:29,944 --> 00:02:34,704
that distant, distant ancestors
had literally no contribution

44
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:36,705
to your genome.

45
00:02:36,705 --> 00:02:40,440
So who are you?

46
00:02:41,574 --> 00:02:44,890
I've said this before,
but because bacteria

47
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:47,954
are so much smaller
than the average human body cell,

48
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:51,507
your body contains
more bacteria

49
00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:54,456
than it contains its own cells.

50
00:02:54,455 --> 00:02:59,308
And forget about trying to remember
every individual cell and bacteria in your body.

51
00:02:59,308 --> 00:03:01,716
They're constantly dying
and being replaced.

52
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:04,524
Even cells like brain cells,
which seem to live

53
00:03:04,524 --> 00:03:07,956
for a very long time,
still take in new nutrients

54
00:03:07,956 --> 00:03:12,716
and expel waste, meaning
that within about every five years,

55
00:03:12,717 --> 00:03:17,639
every single atom
that used to make up your body

56
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,984
has been exchanged.

57
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:22,539
Do you remember
what you were like five years ago?

58
00:03:22,538 --> 00:03:26,810
Well, the atoms that make up your body,
they sure don't.

59
00:03:26,811 --> 00:03:31,359
This is a little existentially scary,
but it leads to a very good question.

60
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:35,004
How many atoms are inside my body
to begin with?

61
00:03:35,003 --> 00:03:38,393
How much is a billion atoms?

62
00:03:38,394 --> 00:03:40,739
Well, here's one way
to think about this.

63
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,733
If you were to count
one number greater every second,

64
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:48,772
it would take you 12 days
to count to a million,

65
00:03:48,772 --> 00:03:50,885
and if you wanted to count
to a billion,

66
00:03:50,885 --> 00:03:54,996
that would take you 32 years.

67
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:58,988
So a billion
is a very large number,

68
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,682
but not when it comes to atoms.

69
00:04:01,682 --> 00:04:06,066
Atoms are so inconceivably small
that even if you had

70
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:09,521
a billion, say, sodium atoms,
their entire weight

71
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,957
would only be
38 femtograms.

72
00:04:12,957 --> 00:04:17,113
Each individual cell
in your body,

73
00:04:17,113 --> 00:04:19,179
too small
to be even seen by the eye,

74
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:25,007
contains 100 times more atoms
than there are stars

75
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:27,329
in the Milky Way galaxy.

76
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:29,902
Multiply that by the number of cells
that make up

77
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:33,316
what we call ourselves,
and each human body

78
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:36,536
contains more atoms
than there are stars

79
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:39,161
in the known universe.

80
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:44,107
Numbers that large lead
to some pretty mind-blowing truths,

81
00:04:44,107 --> 00:04:46,823
for instance, this one mentioned
by Bill Bryson—

82
00:04:46,822 --> 00:04:51,257
because our bodies contain
so many atoms,

83
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,882
and because we
so vigorously recycle them,

84
00:04:53,882 --> 00:04:58,990
statistically speaking,
about one billion of the atoms

85
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,007
inside your body
used to belong to Shakespeare.

86
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:06,560
A billion of your atoms
used to belong to Beethoven.

87
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,997
A billion of the atoms
in your body

88
00:05:08,997 --> 00:05:11,250
right now,
as you sit and watch this,

89
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,081
used to be inside the body
of Buddha.

90
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:19,677
You could also think of it this way—
a thousand years from now,

91
00:05:19,677 --> 00:05:22,925
when humans first land
on a planet

92
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:25,363
outside of our solar system,
that first person

93
00:05:25,363 --> 00:05:28,962
to step onto the surface
of the alien planet—

94
00:05:28,963 --> 00:05:32,585
their body will contain
a billion atoms

95
00:05:32,584 --> 00:05:36,137
that are in you
right now.

96
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:39,805
And as always,
thanks for watching.
