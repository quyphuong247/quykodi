1
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:03,609
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:06,980
This point of light in the sky is

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,888
Earth as seen from the surface of Mars.

4
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:14,629
And this is Earth as seen from Saturn.

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,778
Here's an image taken only 45,000 kilometres away,

6
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:22,679
the famous Blue Marble. But what does

7
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:25,600
Earth really look like?

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,220
Well, it depends on how you define "look".

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,829
The word look comes from
the old Breton word "lagud",

10
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:36,160
mean eye, the human eye.

11
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:41,299
And that's part of the problem.
Images like this are based on light

12
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:44,558
humans can see. But we don't see

13
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,909
everything.
There's a fantastic episode of Radiolab that uses

14
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:52,288
sound to illustrate just how different other creature

15
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,879
visual spaces are from our our own.
When we talk about the way something

16
00:00:56,878 --> 00:00:58,219
physically looks

17
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:01,710
we are talking about the visual perception of emitted

18
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,170
or reflected electromagnetic radiation.

19
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,689
Specifically, visible light.

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,620
Light we perceive as red has a longer wavelength

21
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:15,489
than blue or violet.
But what if I crank the wavelength

22
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:18,709
even shorter? Does it stop being light?

23
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:21,798
No, it just becomes light

24
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:25,439
you can't see - ultraviolet, X-rays,

25
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,118
gamma rays.
Going the other way, you get infrared,

26
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,390
microwaves and finally, radio waves.

27
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,509
In principle, the spectrum of possible

28
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:38,689
electromagnetic wavelengths is infinite.

29
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:41,889
But even within the range of wavelengths we observe,

30
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,960
the breadth is breathtaking. If the entire

31
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:49,029
practical spectrum of wavelengths was laid out

32
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:54,079
linearly from New York to Los Angeles,
the visual portion we see

33
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:57,158
would only be the size of

34
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,659
100 nanometers. Small enough

35
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,269
to slip through a surgical mask. Point is,

36
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:07,859
when it comes to what their is to see, our

37
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:10,939
eyes miss out on lot. For instance,

38
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:15,870
take a look a remote control.
Many of  these things communicate with light

39
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,430
of wavelengths we can't see but mobile phone cameras

40
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,770
can. Try this at home. Push a button on a
remote control and you won't see much

41
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,469
but use a mobile phone camera
to detect wavelengths you can't see

42
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:32,680
and have them rendered visible.
There's a whole lot going on

43
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,290
we miss out on. Our night sky is full of

44
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:39,378
frequencies we can't see with our eyes alone

45
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:42,959
but Chromoscope.net allows you to extend

46
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,969
your vision.
This is the Milky Way as we see it,

47
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:49,969
the visible light it gives off. But slide

48
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:53,789
to see how it would look if our eyes
sensed other frequencies.

49
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:57,519
Of course, we are having to represent
these other frequencies

50
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,580
with visible colours because even
electromagnetic pretend time

51
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,709
is bounded by our puny limits.

52
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:11,128
As for Earth, if we only saw infrared
frequencies it might look something

53
00:03:11,128 --> 00:03:15,030
like this in our minds.
Ultraviolet and extreme

54
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,848
ultraviolet vision would return
unrecognizable spheres.

55
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:23,139
With X-ray vision auroras around the
poles would shine brightly

56
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:26,318
and gamma ray vision would give
Earth a bright edge

57
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:29,889
from high-energy electromagnetic
radiation hitting the atmosphere

58
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:32,049
at a shallow angle.

59
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:36,420
So, which view is correct? Is there an

60
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,900
absolute true appearance of the Earth?

61
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,920
We haven't even started yet.

62
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,950
Look back at the Blue Marble.
What's with the tyranny 

63
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:50,369
of "north" meaning "up"? Perhaps,

64
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,459
it's because we often equate "up" with "better"

65
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,598
and many early map makers were from
North of the equator.

66
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,929
But upside-down maps are equally true,

67
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,110
no matter how strange day may seem to us.
Funny enough,

68
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,280
the famous Blue Marble itself is a
product of North equals

69
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,128
up bias. It didn't originally look like this.

70
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:15,438
The crew of Apollo 17 originally took it

71
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:18,858
like this. NASA rotated it to

72
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:22,620
fit our traditional idea of up after the fact.

73
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,620
Here's a visual birth that comes from
the US Naval Observatory's live

74
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,769
animation of our planet.
You can see exactly what parts are

75
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:34,889
in its shadow at this very moment.
Other shadows fall

76
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:38,449
on Earth as well, like the Moon's shadow.

77
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:43,400
Last week @BadAstronomer shared this
image. The dark smudges on the left is

78
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,089
actually

79
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:47,698
the Moon's shadow during a Solar Eclipse

80
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,830
as seen from above Earth.
There's another problem with

81
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:55,310
the Blue Marble - it's flat and the Earth

82
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,060
is three-dimensional.
A  globe is the best way to represent the Earth

83
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,720
but globes are difficult to carry around
and even when displayed in two

84
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,840
dimensions,

85
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,000
well, you just can't see everything at once.

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,389
A flat map of the Earth is really convenient

87
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:15,759
but requires projecting a globe onto something

88
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,288
flat. And a sphere's surface cannot be
represented on a plane

89
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:24,409
without distortion.
The West Wing famously pointed out

90
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,930
the limitations of flat maps.

91
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:31,500
There's no such thing as a perfect flat map of the entire

92
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,379
world. Some maps are useful for some
things and other maps for other things

93
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:40,038
but it is really fun to pick on the Mercator projection,

94
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:43,879
mainly because it's so popular and is
even used by Google Maps,

95
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:46,930
mainly because it's so easy to zoom in on.

96
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,810
It preserves shape decently well but suffers

97
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,649
when it comes to area. As I've shown before, Africa

98
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:59,888
is huge. Its area is so large the
entire contiguous United States could

99
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:03,150
fit inside of it, along with all of China,

100
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:06,859
India, Japan and much of Europe.

101
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,370
But on the Mercator projection scale near the poles

102
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,610
is pretty wonky, distorted, which means

103
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,060
Greenland appears to be as large as Africa,

104
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,060
even though in reality it is only 1/14th

105
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,500
the size. There's more.

106
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,829
Check out Alaska and Brazil on a
Mercator projection. They appear almost

107
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:33,228
the same size but in reality Brazil

108
00:06:33,228 --> 00:06:37,109
is nearly five times bigger than Alaska.

109
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,460
Areas near the equator are minimized, whereas

110
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:43,739
areas closer to the poles are exaggerated.

111
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,250
To have fun with this problem, play the Google Maps

112
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,899
Mercator puzzle. The red pieces are
countries projected outside of their

113
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:52,529
usual

114
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:55,848
locations. Now, what the heck is this

115
00:06:55,848 --> 00:07:00,219
weird shape? Well, let's pull it away from
the North Pole, where scale is distorted

116
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:00,710
a lot

117
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:04,029
and now it's Australia.

118
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:07,619
You can see how the math behind map
projections distort Earth

119
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,639
by interacting with them on Jason Davies'

120
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,960
brilliant site. Notice how small
Greenland appears on the Mercator

121
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,239
projection when pulled down to the

122
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,069
equator and how exaggerated it becomes 
when moved to the edge.

123
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:25,240
To be fair, the Mercator projection is great for navigation.

124
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,918
If you want something that is more fair
when it comes to area,

125
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:32,168
try the Gall–Peters. Here,

126
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:35,469
landmasses are the right relative size

127
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,509
but shape is sacrificed. Everything looks a bit

128
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:40,528
too narrow.

129
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:44,879
Enter the Mollweide. This projection shows

130
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:49,069
equal areas and is a bit more pleasant shape-wise.

131
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:53,479
If you interrupt the Mollweide around
the oceans, relative area is preserved

132
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:56,740
and the shape of land masses becomes even more

133
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,280
accurate. When it comes to the shortest
route between two places on the surface

134
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,728
of the Earth, Gnomonic projections are really cool.

135
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:10,909
Every straight line journey taken on
Earth's surface is actually part of a great

136
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:15,379
circle. On Mercator projections actual straight line paths

137
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:18,479
look curved. But every straight line

138
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,079
on a Gnomonic projection is also a straight line

139
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,449
in real life - the shortest route. If you want

140
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:29,970
a compromise between shape and area,
you might try the pleasant

141
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:34,229
Winkel tripel, which the
National Geographic Society has used for maps it

142
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:35,060
produces

143
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:39,528
since 1998. Or a beautiful butterfly map

144
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:43,259
that could be a ball until it's
flattened, say, under a pane

145
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:46,700
of glass. The Dymaxion map can unfold

146
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,350
to show how nearly connected Earth's landmasses

147
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,570
are. It's a great way to visualize human migration

148
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,610
overtime. It's quite impressive how far and wide

149
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:03,060
humans have traveled on earth,
but it remains a bit of a disappointment

150
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:06,179
to realize just how narrow our slice

151
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:09,409
of visual perception really is.

152
00:09:09,409 --> 00:09:12,490
But don't feel bad.
This brings us to the story of

153
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,110
Julian Bayliss.

154
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,360
Yes, hello, is this doctor Julian Bayliss?

155
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,690
[ON THE PHONE:] Yes, speaking.

156
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,769
Bayliss told me about how
one day, while using Google Earth, he

157
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,570
spotted some dark green vegetation.

158
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:27,778
It looked like a rain forest.
An expedition was scheduled

159
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:31,088
and it turned out to be just that - a rain forest

160
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:34,769
we had previously never seen. I asked him more.

161
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:36,609
So, what have you found there?

162
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,440
[ON THE PHONE:]
That day we found about 12 new species

163
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,910
just from Mabu.
So we found about 3 snakes, 2 chameleons and

164
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:47,448
about 4 butterflies, 2 new species of plants

165
00:09:47,448 --> 00:09:50,919
and we've only really just been into the
forest edge. So, I read, read a paper

166
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:54,628
the other day, a scientific paper.
They estimate that there's maybe 8 million,

167
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:58,999
8.5 million species in this world
but we've only actually discovered

168
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:03,119
1.5 million or between 1.5 and 2 million.

169
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,539
So, we've actually only discovered maybe one fist of everything that's living on this

170
00:10:08,548 --> 00:10:09,088
planet.

171
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:12,809
Wow, our eyes only see

172
00:10:12,808 --> 00:10:15,860
a tiny fraction of what there is to see.

173
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,839

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,739
an enormous number of things left to find.

00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,539
[ON THE PHONE:]
And as always,

176
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:26,639
thanks for watching.
