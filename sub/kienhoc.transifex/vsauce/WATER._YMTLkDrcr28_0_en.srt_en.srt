1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,198
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And I'm in London,

2
00:00:02,198 --> 00:00:04,198
right outside Buckingham Palace.

3
00:00:04,198 --> 00:00:06,958
Oh, I'm actually running a little bit late
for tea with the Queen.

4
00:00:06,958 --> 00:00:09,768
Yeah, she's really into tea,
but do you know what tea's mainly made out of?

5
00:00:09,768 --> 00:00:13,414
Water, and so today,
we're going to talk about water.

6
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:16,199
Now, we all know that water
is vital

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,448
for life on Earth to exist
and that water covers

8
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:22,536
more than 70%
of Earth's surface,

9
00:00:22,536 --> 00:00:24,881
but before we talk
about liquid water,

10
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:27,457
I want to talk
about a culinary treat

11
00:00:27,457 --> 00:00:31,219
that occurs when you put a piece of bread
on the ground,

12
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:35,469
and then, at the exact same time,
on the other side of the Earth,

13
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:39,161
the exact geographical opposite point,
you have someone else

14
00:00:39,161 --> 00:00:43,154
put another piece of bread—
Earth sandwich.

15
00:00:43,154 --> 00:00:46,239
That's right—it's a challenge
that was popularized

16
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:49,721
by Ze Frank, and it turns out
that making an Earth sandwich

17
00:00:49,722 --> 00:00:52,137
is incredibly difficult.
Why?

18
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:54,273
Because of water.
That's right.

19
00:00:54,273 --> 00:00:56,711
If you take a globe
and you look at it

20
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,710
so that France is right there
in the middle,

21
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,935
you're only looking at one-half
of the Earth,

22
00:01:01,935 --> 00:01:04,442
but from that perspective,
you are looking

23
00:01:04,442 --> 00:01:08,993
at almost 90%
of Earth's dry land.

24
00:01:08,993 --> 00:01:10,993
It's all right there on that one side.

25
00:01:10,993 --> 00:01:13,799
It's known as the land hemisphere,
and the other side,

26
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,771
the exact other half of the Earth,
is called the water hemisphere.

27
00:01:16,772 --> 00:01:19,791
Now, you might be saying to yourself,
"Okay, great.

28
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,903
"So Earth sandwiches
are almost always soggy.

29
00:01:21,903 --> 00:01:24,132
Why should I care?"
I don't know.

30
00:01:24,132 --> 00:01:26,152
But here's something
that you should care about—

31
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:29,195
the Three Gorges Dam
in China,

32
00:01:29,194 --> 00:01:32,189
one of the largest hydroelectric dams
ever constructed.

33
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,323
Completed in 2006,
and upon completion,

34
00:01:35,323 --> 00:01:38,691
it fundamentally changed
something about Earth.

35
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:41,867
You know how a figure skater
spinning in place

36
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:44,835
can slow down their speed
by moving their arms out,

37
00:01:44,835 --> 00:01:48,272
by moving some of their body mass
away from the middle of their body?

38
00:01:48,272 --> 00:01:51,036
Well, the same thing can happen to Earth.

39
00:01:51,036 --> 00:01:54,448
The Three Gorges Dam
did exactly what a figure skater does

40
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,933
when they move their arms
away from their center.

41
00:01:56,933 --> 00:02:01,762
It transferred 39 trillion kilograms of water

42
00:02:01,763 --> 00:02:05,710
175 meters above sea level.

43
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:09,954
NASA calculated that
that massive amount of water moved

44
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:12,834
caused Earth's rotation to slow down,

45
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:16,362
so that every day of your life
since that dam was finished

46
00:02:16,362 --> 00:02:21,471
has been longer
by .06 microseconds.

47
00:02:21,471 --> 00:02:23,651
It's not something that,
for all intents and purposes,

48
00:02:23,651 --> 00:02:25,070
you have to worry about.

49
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,875
If you are worried,
you might be hydrophobic,

50
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:32,241
but you're in good company—
there are a lot of good hydrophobic materials,

51
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:34,888
and they behave
in some pretty cool ways.

52
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:38,836
Hydrophobic materials are resistant
to getting wet.

53
00:02:38,836 --> 00:02:41,483
That's right—they're usually made
out of hydrocarbons

54
00:02:41,483 --> 00:02:44,780
that don't form good hydrogen bonds
with water molecules,

55
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,356
and because it takes more energy
for the water

56
00:02:47,356 --> 00:02:50,794
to spread out on those surfaces,
the water just sticks together.

57
00:02:50,794 --> 00:02:53,695
It coheres to itself
and forms nice little spheres.

58
00:02:53,695 --> 00:02:57,550
Now, in certain cases,
super-hydrophobia occurs

59
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,550
and it looks awesome.

60
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,048
The leaves of the lotus plant do this
and when water falls on them,

61
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,713
the water just floats around
like some big old blob

62
00:03:05,713 --> 00:03:07,713
of liquid mercury or something.

63
00:03:07,713 --> 00:03:10,914
It's a very bizarre trick,
and I have you guys to thank

64
00:03:10,914 --> 00:03:12,534
for bringing it to my attention.

65
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:15,479
In fact, it was that message
that inspired me to do an episode

66
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:18,016
about water in the first place,
so thanks.

67
00:03:18,016 --> 00:03:22,382
One final note on hydrophobia—
it can happen in humans.

68
00:03:22,382 --> 00:03:24,584
And I don't mean being afraid of swimming

69
00:03:24,584 --> 00:03:29,018
or not liking the ocean—
I mean an actual psychological aversion

70
00:03:29,018 --> 00:03:30,717
to the sight of water.

71
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:33,379
Rabies is a virus that,
if left untreated,

72
00:03:33,383 --> 00:03:35,797
can lead
to severe neurological damage.

73
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:40,116
In the late stages of rabies,
the victim salivates constantly,

74
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:43,135
but their throat and jaw
become paralyzed,

75
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:46,846
which means that the body cannot control
the fluid in its own mouth

76
00:03:46,846 --> 00:03:49,377
and is in a constant fear
of drowning.

77
00:03:49,377 --> 00:03:53,487
This man has contracted rabies
and is in the late stages of the disease.

78
00:03:53,486 --> 00:03:55,826
As he attempts to take a drink of fluid,

79
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:59,539
his body recoils instinctively,
as if the water might burn him.

80
00:03:59,544 --> 00:04:03,050
But thanks to vaccination efforts,
the threat of rabies

81
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,370
all over the world
has been significantly reduced.

82
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,550
Now, we could say a lot of other stuff
about water,

83
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,530
but I might save that
for another episode.

84
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,370
In the meantime...

85
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,370
And as always,

86
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,800
thanks for watching.
