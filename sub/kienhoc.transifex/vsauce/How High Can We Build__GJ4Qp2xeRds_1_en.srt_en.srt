1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:08,500
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And when the pyramids
of Giza were built, the tallest was 147 meters

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:16,440
tall, making them the tallest things humans
had ever built. And they remained that way

3
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:24,420
for nearly 4,000 years. It wasn't even until
the 1300's that we finally got around to making

4
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,130
something taller, a cathedral in England.
So, does that mean that the Great Pyramids

5
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:32,909
of Giza are the "Best tallest structures of all time?"

6
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:36,839
Well, to find out more, all aboard the BOAT.

7
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:44,439
So, what is a building? Well, technically,
a building is a structure in which at least

8
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:52,079
50% of its height comes from floor plates
where people can live, work, chill out, it

9
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:58,239
has to be habitable. Any less than that and
it's not a building, it's a tower. After the

10
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:03,678
Lincoln Cathedral finally surpassed the height
of the pyramids, a number of churches continued

11
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:09,780
to be built that kept breaking and setting
new records. The next long-term record holder

12
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,190
was the Eiffel Tower.
It was the tallest thing, ever in history,

13
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:20,469
that we had built, for about 40 years in a
row. It was finally surpassed by the Chrysler

14
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:25,579
Building in New York, a personal favorite,
which was then quickly bested by the Empire

15
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:31,908
State Building. Now, the Empire State Building
is interesting in that it was the first structure

16
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:38,380
ever built by man that was so tall, were you
to jump off the top of it, you would actually

17
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:44,009
reach terminal velocity before you hit the
bottom. It was the first structure we'd ever

18
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:50,060
built that was so tall, rather than just continuing
to accelerate as you fell, you would actually

19
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,129
stop accelerating because you would reach
the fastest possible speed your limp body

20
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:03,250
can fall at. In the mid 1950's, something
weird started to happen. Humans started to

21
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:09,840
build radio and TV towers. These things could
be way taller than the buildings that we'd

22
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:15,810
made previously that had to be habitable.
And so, ever since the Empire State Building

23
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:21,530
had its record broken by a TV tower, all these
other famously tall buildings, the Petronas

24
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:27,479
Towers, Tapei 101, the World Trade Center,
the Willis Tower - formerly Sears Tower - none

25
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:33,060
of them have ever, within their existence,
actually held the title for being the tallest

26
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:41,640
"thing" we've ever built. There was always
a radio or TV tower somewhere that was taller.

27
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:47,579
Up until quite recently, and for quite a while,
the record for the tallest thing ever built

28
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:54,560
by humans went to the Warsaw radio mast in
Poland. It's visually incredibly striking,

29
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,920
because there aren't any other sky scrapers
around it. It's all alone, being very tall.

30
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:06,680
Well, that was until 1991, where some workers
exchanging guy-wires made a mistake and the

31
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:11,598
whole thing started to bend and then snapped
in the middle. There's no video of the event

32
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:18,598
happening, but it would have been similar
to this collapse, though much, much taller.

33
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:26,699
After the Warsaw radio mast collapsed, the
KVLY-TV mast in North Dakota became the tallest,

34
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:33,289
still standing, structure built by man. But
recently, buildings have made a comeback.

35
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:38,598
And to check that out, we're going to have
to travel to the Middle East. This is the

36
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:49,318
first time I've ever touched the Nile. 
Tadaaa. Ok, so that was me dipping my

37
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,629
waterproof camera into the Nile. If you were to take

38
00:03:52,628 --> 00:03:59,149
the entire length of the Nile River and stand
it up on its edge, perpendicular to the Earth,

39
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:05,860
it would reach into outer space about this
far, which is pretty impressive. But where

40
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,980
does the space shuttle orbit? And where does
the International Space Station orbit? This

41
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:19,719
far away? This far away? Maybe this far away?
Actually, if this pink, inflatable "Horrible

42
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:28,440
Bosses" ball was the Earth, the space shuttle
would orbit about right there. It's incredible,

43
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:32,139
but it's possible because the shuttle, and
the International Space Station, travel so

44
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:38,189
quickly. They travel so quickly around the
Earth that instead of seeing one sunrise

45
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:46,528
and sunset every 24 hours, they see 16.
But don't be jealous. You can easily see more

46
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:54,058
than one sunrise and/or sunset in a day by
taking advantage of tall structures. So, let's

47
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:58,680
take a look at the tallest structure, the
current record holder for the tallest thing

48
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:05,959
humans have ever built, the Burj Khalifa in
Dubai. The height of this building blows my

49
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:11,508
mind. You can literally watch the sunset from
the base of the building, and then take a

50
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:18,468
super-fast elevator all-the-way up to the
top and watch the same sun set again. In fact,

51
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:21,129
the difference
in timing between sunset at the base and the

52
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:27,270
top is so significant, the Dubai Islamic Affairs
department actually had to make a ruling about

53
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:33,139
when you can start, and break, your fast during
Ramadan inside the building. People above

54
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:39,978
floor 80 or higher have to actually wait to
start eating 2-3 minutes after the people

55
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:45,348
at the base, because the sun hasn't yet set
for those at the top. But before you head

56
00:05:45,348 --> 00:05:50,788
to Dubai to watch the sun rise or set twice
in a day, keep in mind that the only height

57
00:05:50,788 --> 00:05:57,678
you actually need to see two sunrises or sunsets
is the height of your own body. Try this the

58
00:05:57,678 --> 00:06:01,938
next time you're at a beach.
Watch the sun rise or set over

59
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:06,629
the water. Water is important because it won't
have the terrain and hill issues that land

60
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:13,229
does. Now let's say you're watching a sunset.
Begin by laying on your stomach. Watch the

61
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:18,519
sun set and as soon as the very last little bit
of the sun goes below the horizon, quickly pop

62
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:24,348
up into a standing position and voilÃ¡,
you'll see the sun's back - part of it's back -

63
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:27,028
and it will set another time.

64
00:06:27,028 --> 00:06:31,899
If you take a stopwatch and record the time
between the first setting and the second setting

65
00:06:31,908 --> 00:06:36,838
that you witness and measure the height
of your eyes when you're laying down and when

66
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:42,300
you're standing, you can use those numbers
to calculate the radius of the Earth.

67
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:49,678
XKCD took this a little bit further by proposing
the "Double Sunset Date." Take your date out

68
00:06:49,678 --> 00:06:54,408
to the beach in a cherry picker and sure
enough, it was calculated, given the speed

69
00:06:54,408 --> 00:06:59,389
of a cherry picker, all you have to do is move
about 6 feet up and you can watch a beautiful

70
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:01,769
sunset all over again.

71
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,400
To put things in perspective, the Burj Khalifa
is nowhere near as tall as Mount Everest.

72
00:07:07,408 --> 00:07:14,399
But the tallest structure that we could potentially
build wouldn't be as tall as Mount Everest,

73
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:21,079
it would be way, way taller. Like, into space
taller. Of course, the problem with building

74
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:25,348
things that are really tall is that they get
heavier and heavier and have to support their

75
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:28,348
own weight. But only up to a point.

76
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:35,180
If a structure was so tall that it wound up
at the altitude of a geostationary orbit,

77
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:39,848
it would start to feel a new force, not just
a gravitational force downward, but all of

78
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:45,218
the sudden this new, centrifugal force up and outward.

79
00:07:45,218 --> 00:07:53,459
And so, a building that tall could be stable
through tension. And more than 35,000 km

80
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:59,838
high.
This kind if structure is known as a "Space Elevator."

81
00:07:59,838 --> 00:08:04,360
Unfortunately, there aren't any materials
known to science today that are strong enough

82
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,459
to make building something that large feasable.
With the exception, maybe, of Carbon Nanotubes,

83
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:15,759
or Boron-Nitrate Nanotubes. Of course, if
we went to a smaller celestial body, like

84
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,360
the Moon, we could build one today out of
stuff like Kevlar.

85
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,460
There are a lot of different things that we
have to be wary of when we build a space elevator.

86
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:30,199
For instance, how do we dodge space debris?
One solution is to attach the Earth side of

87
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:35,899
the cable to a boat in the ocean that can
maneuver around and move the elevator away

88
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:37,458
from dangerous obstacles.

89
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:43,479
Another interesting point is that the taller
the cable, the faster the far end of it will

90
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:50,519
be traveling. In fact, if the cable is more
than 50,000 km long, its far end will be travelling

91
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:57,698
near escape velocity and simply walking outside
could take you to the Moon. But why build

92
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:03,640
a space elevator? Well, because it would be
awesome. But also for better reasons too.

93
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:09,370
For instance, right now, in order to send
a pound of material into orbit, it costs about

94
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:15,370
11,000 dollars. But with a space elevator,
we could send the same amount of material

95
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:22,370
into orbit for only about 100 bucks. That
difference is so significant that Philip Ragan

96
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:29,500
has said that the first country to deploy
a space elevator will have a 95% cost advantage

97
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:37,980
and will possibly be able to control all space
related activities. Alright, so here you see,

98
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,560
in the mirror, Alex
playing guitar while she holds a camera in

99
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:47,979
her mouth and records us. Impressive. I'm
here with Kristen from Barely Political. She's
