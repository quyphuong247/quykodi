1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,660
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:03,639
A few years ago

3
00:00:03,638 --> 00:00:08,199
in Minneapolis an angry dad stormed
into the retail store

4
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:11,579
Target.
His daughter, a high schooler,

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,839
had been receiving coupons in the mail
from the store for things like cribs

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,778
and diapers.
Was Target encouraging his daughter,

7
00:00:19,778 --> 00:00:22,458
a minor, to go out and get pregnant?
well

8
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:28,699
Well, the store apologized but a few days
later they heard back from the father. He

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,449
told them

10
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:32,859
"a few things have been going on in my household

11
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:36,500
I was unaware of. My daughter is due

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,700
in August. I owe you an apology."
You see,

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,520
Target's internal algorithms have been tracking

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,039
and processing his daughter's purchases and recently

15
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:51,260
she'd started buying different items than usual.

16
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:56,179
Things like certain vitamin supplements
and scent-free soaps and lotions.

17
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:59,769
Behaviors the system flagged as evidence

18
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,559
she could be pregnant, thus they her sent the coupons.

19
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:08,349
And they were right.
Without being told,

20
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:12,149
Target knew that a girl was pregnant

21
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,930
before her own father.

22
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,700
We are tracked and followed digitally now more than

23
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:26,309
ever before.
We live in a world of 24/7 CCTV,

24
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,879
browser cookies, trackable debit cards
and cell phones and GPS,

25
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,640
fingerprinting and DNA analysis.
But despite

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,070
all of that, every single year

27
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:42,478
in the United States alone more than 2,000 people

28
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,438
disappear and are never found again

29
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:48,218
dead or alive.

30
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,739
Where do missing people go?
How did they disappear?

31
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,859
What if you disappeared and

32
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:59,968
how do you know you haven't already

33
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:04,530
disappeared?
In many cases, missing persons are the victims

34
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,579
of unsolved or unknown crimes.

35
00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:11,049
They may have suffered accidents
or taken their own lives

36
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:16,450
and their bodies were never found.
Or they may be perfectly fine and have simply

37
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:21,280
escaped their old life, old friends and
family, old debt and obligations to start

38
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,030
a new life

39
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,219
somewhere else, possibly as someone else.

40
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:29,930
How long would it take for people to notice

41
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,390
if you disappeared?
Well, think about it. I mean,

42
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:37,979
it sort of depends on who you are, how you live

43
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:42,969
and how you disappeared.
In most jurisdictions after about five to seven

44
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:43,818
years,

45
00:02:43,818 --> 00:02:47,149
if no one has heard anything from you at all,

46
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,230
you can be declared dead in absentia.

47
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:53,829
This is what happened to French astronomer

48
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:59,160
Guillaume Le Gentil.
In the 18th century hundreds
of people traveled far and wide

49
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:02,339
to observe the transit of Venus from different locations

50
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,400
on earth. They knew that by comparing their
measurements they could calculate

51
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,680
more accurately than ever before just how far away

52
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,300
the Sun was.
So, Le Gentil

53
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,840
left Paris in 1760 for Pondicherry

54
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,680
in India.
But after a storm blew him off course

55
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,840
and the British occupied Pondicherry,
he was forced to spend the day

56
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,408
of the transit on a boat at sea, which rocked

57
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:33,048
too much for accurate measurements to be taken.
Now, the next

58
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:37,360
transit would happen in 8 years.
But after that, the next

59
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,480
next transit wouldn't happen for another 100 years.

60
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:45,179
So, he stuck around. He didn't return to Paris.
Instead, he built an observatory

61
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,860
and waited.
When he finally returned

62
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,610
to Paris, 11 years after leaving,
he found that he had been declared

63
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,140
dead.
His wife had remarried,

64
00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:00,878
his family had plundered 
his belongings and his position

65
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,628
at the Royal Academy of Sciences
had been given to someone else.

66
00:04:04,628 --> 00:04:08,688
He never did see the transit of Venus,

67
00:04:08,688 --> 00:04:12,280
by the way.
On the day that it happened, the sky above him

68
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,640
was overcast.

69
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:19,469
We know the human population

70
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,330
of Earth.

71
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,939
Kind of.

72
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:27,340
Population figures and counters are only estimations.

73
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:31,168
Individuals are best accounted for by real people

74
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:35,549
in their real lives.
But that doesn't always

75
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,970
happen.

76
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,760
Earlier this year Janet Veal
passed away in her apartment

77
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,139
in Ringwood, Hampshire.
Large portions of her body

78
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:48,659
were eaten by her pet cats before she was discovered

79
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,810
weeks later.
And seven years ago

80
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,149
Joyce Carol Vincent was found dead on her sofa,

81
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:59,029
in Wood Green; or at least her skeleton

82
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:02,439
was found.
She'd been dead for at least three

83
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:05,480
years and no one ever checked on her.

84
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,509
Her television was still on.

85
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:11,560
And four days after Timothy McVeigh bombed

86
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,399
a federal building in Oklahoma City, taking

87
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,419
168 lives, a severed

88
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,389
left leg was found in the rubble.

89
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:27,250
No one knew who it belonged to.
The legs of all the other victims had been

90
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,209
accounted for

91
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:31,389
and no one else had been reported missing.

92
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,019
DNA analysis showed that the leg
belonged to a Lakesha Levy,

93
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:39,419
but she had already been buried with both her legs.

94
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,069
So, they dug up her corpse.

95
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:46,399
She'd been buried with someone else's left

96
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,439
leg. The legs were swapped, 
but because her body had been embalmed,

97
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:54,740
DNA in the unknown leg could not be analyzed.

98
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,360
To this day no one knows who that leg

99
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,509
belongs to. The 169th

100
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:04,620
victim remains a mystery.

101
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,459
Some conspiracy theorists argue that
the leg may have belonged

102
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:12,859
to be actual bomber,
someone besides Timothy McVeigh,

103
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,780
who was close enough to the explosion
to be obliterated completely,

104
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:20,659
except for one leg.
Regardless,

105
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,010
what it does show is that it is possible
for a person to disappear

106
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:29,120
without anyone ever asking where they went.

107
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,980
Sometimes people are reported dead or missing

108
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,590
even when they aren't.
Premature obituaries

109
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:41,468
are common.
Many living people already have one on file.

110
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:46,339
If a famous person dies, 
the media, television, newspapers, magazines, well

111
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:49,549
they need a full story as soon as possible.
So, they

112
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,918
prepare them ahead of time, locked away,
leaving only the dates and circumstances

113
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:56,560
of the death to be filled in.

114
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,930
Makes sense, but it's awkward

115
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:04,340
when they leak before the person's dead.
In 2003

116
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:10,188
CNN's website accidentally carried draft
obituaries for living people that could

117
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:10,639
be

118
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,000
accessed.
It's embarrassing, but

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,468
for the person reading their own
obituary, it's a chance to do something

120
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:20,478
that most of us never get a chance to do.

121
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:25,088
See how you will be remembered after you're gone.

122
00:07:25,088 --> 00:07:29,028
Alfred Nobel invented dynamite.

123
00:07:29,028 --> 00:07:32,180
He made a fortune manufacturing and selling

124
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,379
deadly weapons - cannons and armaments.
In 1888

125
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:41,060
his brother Ludvig died but many
newspapers mistakenly thought that he

126
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,819
had died

127
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,830
and published obituaries for Alfred

128
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:48,528
Nobel.
They weren't very flattering.

129
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:52,009
One French paper declared 
"The merchant of death

130
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:55,288
is dead."
Nobel read these

131
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:59,860
obituaries and was so ashamed by
what his legacy apparently

132
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,360
was going to be.
When he did die, he left almost

133
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,218
all of his money to the cause of celebrating humanity.

134
00:08:07,218 --> 00:08:11,788
He created The Nobel Prize.
Marcus Garvey

135
00:08:11,788 --> 00:08:15,568
wasn't so lucky.
The story goes that after suffering

136
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:19,979
a stroke newspapers ran premature obituaries that

137
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:23,149
were critical of him, saying, he died broke,

138
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:28,430
alone and unpopular.
Shocked by how negatively he was being remembered

139
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:33,690
Garvey suffered another stroke while
reading his own obituary

140
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,300
and died.
In April of 2006

141
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:43,109
five Taylor University students died
in a tragic car accident.

142
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,589
Another student survived, but was in a coma.

143
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:50,019
She was identified as Laura van Ryn.

144
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:54,120
Her friend Whitney Cerak wasn't as lucky.
She was pronounced

145
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,659
dead.
A thousand people attended her funeral

146
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:00,990
but over the next few days as Laura

147
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,568
recovered, she began speaking
and when asked her name,

148
00:09:04,568 --> 00:09:09,139
Laura said my name is Whitney.
The girls

149
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:12,250
looked similar.
It turned out Laura

150
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,629
was the one they had buried.
Later, Whitney

151
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:18,708
was married in the very same church that years before

152
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:23,369
had held her funeral.
What if you are already missing

153
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:28,409
and just don't know it?
It's not known how often hospitals

154
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:31,750
accidentally switch babies at birth.

155
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,440
Modern hospital policies make it
unlikely to happen, but because we don't

156
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,399
all go out and get maternity

157
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,519
and paternity tests for fun,
there isn't a lot of data

158
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:47,659
on the phenomenon. But it does happen.
It's often discovered because of DNA tests

159
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:51,100
administered to resolve child support disputes.

160
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,120
Or, in the case of the 35-year-old woman,
in the Canary Islands,

161
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,810
it's because in 2001 an employee at a
store you're shopping at mistakes you

162
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:04,759
for her best friend - because you look exactly

163
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:08,059
like her, because she is

164
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:11,669
your long-lost twin, separated from you

165
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:14,729
since birth.
And the sister you grew up with,

166
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,620
thinking was your twin, turns out to be a biological

167
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,289
stranger.
What if you are missing

168
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,379
but the authorities don't know?

169
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:29,519
Such is the life of the unreported

170
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,209
missing.
People in a country illegally,

171
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:36,578
people estranged from their family and friends with no

172
00:10:36,578 --> 00:10:39,828
missing person report ever being filed,

173
00:10:39,828 --> 00:10:44,250
children of homeless mothers.
These people aren't just

174
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,289
missing, they are what is known as

175
00:10:47,289 --> 00:10:49,569
missing missing.

176
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:52,860
The FBI's National Crime
Information Database contains

177
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,149
approximately 50,000 reported missing children,

178
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:01,448
but Outpost For Hope reports that
there are more than a million

179
00:11:01,448 --> 00:11:05,188
children in America who are missing, without anyone

180
00:11:05,188 --> 00:11:09,500
knowing they're missing.
It is not against the law

181
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,789
to go missing under your own volition.

182
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:15,860
You might have debts to pay or contracts to honor,

183
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,789
but if you are an adult, the act of disappearing

184
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:23,899
is not illegal in and of itself.
You have the right

185
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:27,198
to go missing.
But believing that no one would

186
00:11:27,198 --> 00:11:32,649
miss you? That is ridiculous and unscientific.
Statistics

187
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:35,970
would suggest otherwise.
David Wong

188
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,990
wrote one of the most powerful articles I've ever read.

189
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,519
There is a lot of information

190
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,559
out there.
There's even a word for it - infobesity.

191
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:50,480
It takes a lifetime to even

192
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,860
experience some of it.
It's easy to think  that everyone

193
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,200
knows everything that you know.
But every year

194
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,778
more than 100 million new people are
born and not a single one of them is

195
00:12:02,778 --> 00:12:03,500
born

196
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,879
knowing that they are made out of atoms 
or that black holes

197
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:11,028
are awesome.
Someone needs to be there

198
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:14,338
to tell them, to show them.

199
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:17,540
How many jokes do you hear every day,

200
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:20,679
every week?
How many jokes do you hear

201
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:23,699
every year?
Here's a fun thought.

202
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,000
By considering average life expectancy

203
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,620
and the typical number of jokes
a person hears in a year,

204
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,649
David Wong posited a thought, rough

205
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:37,179
in its approximation, but sharp in its essence.

206
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:40,458
If you are under the age of 38

207
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,500
odds are the funniest joke

208
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,299
you will ever hear is a joke
you haven't even heard yet.

209
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:51,419
And, if you are over the age of 38,

210
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:56,250
odds are you already know a joke that
to more people than you could ever

211
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,370
possibly meet

212
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:01,179
might be the funniest joke
they will ever hear.

213
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:04,809
So, wherever you are, we're glad you there.

214
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,379
And as always,

215
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,580
thanks for watching.
