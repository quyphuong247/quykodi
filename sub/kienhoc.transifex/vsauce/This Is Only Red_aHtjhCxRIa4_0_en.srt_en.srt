00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,450
Happy New Year, Vsauce! Michael here.
And in honor of 2013

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,950
let's discuss 13 things.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,240
To begin, where to spend all that cash
you picked up over the holidays?

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,048
Now, plenty of website sell cool stuff.
United Nuclear sells

5
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:20,379
Aerogel, radioactive isotopes, jet engine schematic

6
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:25,858
and even marbles doped with uranium.
Maths Gear sells these cool non transitive

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:26,859
dice I actually bought

8
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:31,750
yesterday, as does Grand Illusions.
But they also carry for explosive magic

9
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:32,320
tricks,

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,738
optical illusion masks and a poster of

11
00:00:35,738 --> 00:00:39,149
this image.
What makes that

12
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,628
image so special?
Well, it's an example

13
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:45,949
of the land effect.
Even though it appears to contain

14
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,590
a bunch of different colors -
oranges and yellows and greens,

15
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,980
the entire image is actually made out of nothing

16
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:57,628
but red. Seriously. I've linked the image
down in the descriptions, so you can grab

17
00:00:57,628 --> 00:00:59,079
it and investigated using

18
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:02,570
your favorite image editor.
The yellows are actually

19
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,790
light reds or pinks.
And the green is just dull grey

20
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,979
red.
What's going on is called

21
00:01:09,978 --> 00:01:14,310
color constancy.
Your visual system, your eyes and brain

22
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,680
calculate the average illumination
conditions of a scene

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,479
and then subtract those conditions,
so that colors remain relatively constant.

24
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:25,989
This is why a blue object looks blue,
whether you're viewing it

25
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:29,809
under the midday Sun or a dark red
sunset or fluorescent light or

26
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:30,810
incandescent light.

27
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,000
It's a very brilliant system, but it can fool

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,769
us. Special images, like this one, appear
to be illuminated with a lot of red

29
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:39,289
light,

30
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:43,680
so your brain actually subtracts the red
and makes assumptions.

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,470
There are plenty of other examples of
the land effect and other ways our visual

32
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:49,039
system lies to us.

33
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,140
But you know what else is a lie?

34
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,660
Raindrops.
Well, at least

35
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:59,450
that depiction of raindrops.
Raindrops are not shaped like

36
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,859
teardrops.
Surface tension means that  small drops are spherical,

37
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:07,540
but when they combine the air and get
bigger, the pressure of the air below

38
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,780
them as they fall causes the bottom to

39
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,259
flatten, which means that raindrops are
shaped less like

40
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:16,729
teardrops and more like hamburger buns.

41
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,520
But how many raindrops have fallen

42
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,439
on land ever?
It's a fun question

43
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:27,829
and there are plenty of resources
discussing how many raindrops fall

44
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,410
during a typical storm,

45
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:34,239
but throughout all of history?
Let's go to mathforum.org for this one.

46
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,939
Doctor Ian calculated,

47
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:39,939
quite roughly but amusingly, that given
the percentage of earth

48
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:43,389
usually covered in land and the amount of rain that

49
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:47,279
typically falls on earth and the volume of a raindrop,

50
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,739
the total number of raindrops that have fallen on land,

51
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:54,250
ever since earth began, is about 16 times

52
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,360
10 to the 28.
So, earth

53
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,560
has had a lot of raindrops.

54
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,239
But you know what earth doesn't have a
lot of? Nice big, old chunks of Moon rock.

55
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:08,360
Material from the Moon is incredibly rare.

56
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,569
We can only get pieces of the Moon in two ways.
By

57
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:14,609
visiting it or by finding chunks of the
Moon that were blown off

58
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,629
a long time ago and eventually fell to Earth.

59
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,799
Interestingly, you can buy paintings

60
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,060
containing traces of Moon dust made

61
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,949
by an astronaut.
I discussed this with my friends over at emotistyle,

62
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:33,369
video link in the description.
But the point is, you will not be owning

63
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,400
a big old Moon rock anytime soon.
Interestingly,

64
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,408
a surprising number of the rocks we
brought back from the Moon

65
00:03:41,408 --> 00:03:45,098
have been stolen or just plain

66
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:48,509
lost.
For instance, in 2002

67
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:52,370
interns Thad Roberts and Tiffany Fowler stole

68
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,890
101 grams of lunar material

69
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:00,029
from the Johnson Space Center.
They celebrated by throwing the rocks onto a

70
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,560
bed,

71
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,128
and I guess the best way to explain what
happened next would just be to point out

72
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:07,030
that the book based on this true story

73
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:12,110
is called "Sex on the Moon."
Or, from a different angle,

74
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,870
fun.
This was built using the Side View maker.

75
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,689
Type in a word or name and it will
construct the word using

76
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:23,969
dots, which from another angle say
something else. For instance, Vsauce

77
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,780
can be vacuum.
If you prefer dots that represent people,

78
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:33,629
Brandon Martin-Anderson's got just what
you need. The entire 2010 US Census

79
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:37,040
on a map with a dot for every single

80
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,410
person.
The data is specific down to the size of an individual

81
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,800
block.
It's really fun to play around with, as is

82
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,600
the searchable Calvin and Hobbes.
I shared this on @tweetsauce a few weeks ago.

83
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,729
Type in a word and you can find every
single Calvin and Hobbes comic strip

84
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:59,310
that used that word. Words or phrases
that help you remember something are

85
00:04:59,310 --> 00:04:59,899
called

86
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:03,049
mnemonics.
For instance, if you wanna remember the exact

87
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,430
speed of light in meters per second in a
vacuum, just count the number of letters

88
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,509
and each word of this sentence.
"We

89
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:15,710
guarantee certainty, clearly referring to
this light mnemonic."

90
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:19,138
Or if you're like me, your biggest
struggle is spelling the word

91
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,560
diarrhoea.
Well, don't worry. Just remember

92
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,750
diarrhoea is a really runny heap

93
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,370
of endless amounts.
We've all seen illusions like this before.

94
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,259
Four circles with corners cut out of them.
We perceive

95
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:38,830
an actual square resting on top of
circles, even though no square

96
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:42,129
is there.
Now interestingly, if you take this shape

97
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:46,029
and put it on top of text, the letters within the

98
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:50,228
fake square appear bigger than the rest of the letters.

99
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:54,149
This is because our brain assumes the letters are closer to us

100
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:58,739
than the rest of the text. After all,
the letters are on top of a square

101
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,400
that's on top of circles on top of text.

102
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,689
Speaking of size, let's take a look at the scale

103
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:08,930
of our solar system.
OMGspace.net

104
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,819
is a website containing images of the
Sun and the planets

105
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:15,870
to scale.
Not just in size, but also

106
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:20,180
distance. If you scroll long enough,
you will eventually get to Mercury

107
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,310
and then Venus and then Earth and so on.
Or, just click a planet's name

108
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,939
and have the site take you there right away.
If that sort of thing makes you

109
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:28,709
feel

110
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:33,089
small and insignificant, rush on over and grab yourself

111
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:36,489
emergency compliment dot com.

112
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,220
The site will keep complimenting you
until you feel better,

113
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,729
but if practicing patience is more your thing, check out

114
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:48,959
chickenonaraft.com.
Geo sketch is a really fun way to draw.

115
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,489
You have this strange folding mechanism that

116
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,710
draws.
You can individually control the rate of rotation for each

117
00:06:56,709 --> 00:07:00,989
joint to see how it affects the image.
But if you'd rather combine rotation

118
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,410
with our solar system,

119
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,500
check out gravity.
Click and drag to place

120
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,038
objects of varying size in the space and watch how

121
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,089
they interact.
So there you go

122
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:15,209
that was about 13 things.

123
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:18,228
I guess. I don't really know.
But there's more.

124
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:22,250
I created a playlist of videos that you should totally see.

125
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,060
I host the playlist and you can start it by
clicking the link at the top of this

126
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,139
video's description

127
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:30,800
or this annotation.
I call it a lean back,

128
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,660
because you start the playlist and
just lean back and let YouTube

129
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,919
do the work.
So, what are you waiting for? Go ahead and click

130
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:39,618
and I will see you over there.

131
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:41,199
And as always,

132
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:42,269
thanks for watching.
