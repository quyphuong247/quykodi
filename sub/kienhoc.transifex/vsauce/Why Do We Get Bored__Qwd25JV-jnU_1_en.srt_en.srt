1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,490
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,020
Action and

3
00:00:04,028 --> 00:00:07,310
danger is exciting but this

4
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:10,339
is a fake gun and the process

5
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:14,250
of enlarging a hole,
like the barrel of a gun, is called

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,809
boring. Boring. Boring a hole

7
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:22,549
is a slow process requiring repetitive
movements from a tool that goes in

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,240
circles,

9
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:28,159
which may be why things that are slow
and repetitive and don't appear to be going

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,989
anywhere

11
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:35,070
came to be described with the same word.
They're boring. But why do we get

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,359
bored and why does it matter?
Evidence of being

13
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,979
temporarily uninterested in anything
happening - boredom -

14
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:46,299
has been found as far back as ancient Pompeii.

15
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:49,570
Boredom is a feeling we don't like. It's

16
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:54,759
uncomfortable but it's trivial, right?
I mean, boredom happens to all of us but

17
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:55,350
now

18
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,960
we have Facebook and Twitter and YouTube
and texting and Candy Crush

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,058
to keep ourselves occupied.
So, really,

20
00:01:02,058 --> 00:01:06,009
who cares?
Well, here's the thing.

21
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,469
Physical pain, heartbreak and nausea are also

22
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,500
uncomfortable but they're caused by dangerous

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,530
serious toxic things, whereas boredom

24
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,349
occurs when you are merely disinterested
in the outside world

25
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:23,579
and the inner world of your thoughts,
when you are

26
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:27,840
alone with just yourself.
So,

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,469
does the existence of boredom mean that
when it really comes down to it life

28
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:36,760
itself existing isn't really enough?

29
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,260
Arthur Schopenhauer said that "if life possessed

30
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,440
in itself a positive value in real content,

31
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,599
there would be no such thing as boredom.
Mere existence would fulfil

32
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,409
and satisfied us."
But apparently it doesn't

33
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:56,049
because boredom exists.
Is something wrong

34
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,920
with being, or is something

35
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,659
awesome about us?
Nearly 200 hundred years ago
Giacomo Leopardi wrote in a

36
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,039
letter to his father

37
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,750
"boredom is the most sublime of all human
emotions because

38
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,909
it expresses the fact that the human
spirit, in a certain sense,

39
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:19,240
is greater than the entire universe.
Boredom

40
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,300
is an expression of a profound despair
and not finding anything that can

41
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,890
satisfy the souls'

42
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:30,669
boundless needs."
So, while superficially boredom might seem trivial or

43
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:34,649
childish, embarrassing, almost rude to admit to feeling,

44
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,950
one thing's for sure - boredom isn't

45
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:42,009
boring.
When bored, your brain activity

46
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:47,340
only drops about 5% and magnetic
resonance images of people's brains

47
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,330
while they were bored actually showed
greater activity in regions responsible

48
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:52,880
for

49
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,189
recalling autobiographical memory, conceiving

50
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:00,989
the thoughts and feelings of others and
conjuring hypothetical events -

51
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:04,379
imagining.
Jennifer Schuessler wrote about this

52
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,949
in her appropriately titled essay "Our boredom,

53
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:11,629
Ourselves."
She points out that in line with neurological

54
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:15,000
evidence, boredom historically has been
"an important source

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,159
of creativity, well-being and our very sense self."

56
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:22,239
It's an imposed state that leaves us

57
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,099
to think about ourselves, notice things
we may have overlooked and get "ancy" enough

58
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:28,349
to take productive

59
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:31,449
actions we might have otherwise put off, like

60
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:35,049
cleaning, writing or challenging the mind with puzzles

61
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,000
and games.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,479
As a pressure to move, boredom

63
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:43,079
may have driven us to accomplish much of
what we have achieved.

64
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,120
But how do you measure

65
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,539
boredom?
The boredom proneness scale,

66
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:52,889
'BPS', assess an individual's propensity for getting

67
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:56,689
bored, in a sense their ease of being attentive.
Average

68
00:03:56,689 --> 00:04:00,520
scores range between 81 and 117.

69
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,810
We can take scores on the BPS and correlate

70
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,930
them with other things.
For instance, people who know themselves well

71
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,120
can easily label their feelings,
have high levels of self-awareness,

72
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:15,829
tend to have a lower propensity score feeling bored.

73
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:19,419
But when it comes to feeling boredom frequently,

74
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:22,759
the culprit may be one's own physiology.

75
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:26,180
Individuals with fewer dopamine
receptors in the brain

76
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,900
tend to need more excitement to stay stimulated,

77
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:33,359
meaning chronic boredom may be a symptom

78
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,840
of the way your body is.
A symptom that if

79
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,859
left unchecked can become something worse

80
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,910
Anna Gosline lists depression,

81
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,500
anxiety, drug addiction, alcoholism, hostility,

82
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,639
poor social skills, bad grades and low work performance.

83
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,769
In fact, the National Center on drug
abuse and addiction has reported that the

84
00:04:56,769 --> 00:04:57,839
top three

85
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,099
risk factors for teenage substance abuse

86
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,650
are too much stress, too much spending money

87
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:09,239
and too much boredom.
The Beth Israel Medical Center in New York

88
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,579
reports that addicts reported levels of boredom

89
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:16,939
are the only reliable indicator of
whether or not they will stay clean.

90
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:21,139
Our brains need stimulation

91
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:25,240
in order to be healthy, not so much that
they're overwhelmed but a perfect

92
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,870
balance

93
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,899
unique to each individual,
under which they can perform

94
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:33,029
optimally, with energized focus,
what psychologists call

95
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:37,959
flow.
Too little stimulation and our brains will act out,

96
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:42,138
hoping to find some somewhere to prevent
something worse

97
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:45,579
from happening.
Our brains have thaasophobia,

98
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:50,310
the fear of boredom.
Peter Toohey's "Boredom: A Lively History"

99
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,459
quotes Norman Doidge's findings that "nothing

100
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:56,519
speeds brain atrophy more being

101
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:59,639
immobilized in the same environment: the monotony

102
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,030
undermines our dopamine and attentional
systems crucial for maintaining

103
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:07,049
brain plasticity."
Variety

104
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,210
and stimulation encourage neurogenesis,
new brain cells

105
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:15,349
and can extend the lives of cells that
already exist in certain regions

106
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:20,070
of the brain.
In order to avoid a lack of stimulation,

107
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:24,639
our brains will even try to make up
their own stimulations -

108
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,360
hallucinations.
Hallucinations can be induced

109
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,259
in almost anyone's brain,
if there isn't enough stimulation

110
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,500
around.
For instance, the ganzfeld effect.

111
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,089
When exposed to random noise and
unchanging monochromatic field,

112
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:44,949
the brain freaks out and starts
generating hallucinations.

113
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:48,449
The effect can also be induced with
ping pong balls hemispheres

114
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,569
over the eyes and a radio tuned to static.

115
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:55,860
Extended sensory deprivation in a special chamber

116
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,120
that eliminates site, sound, smell, taste
and tactile sensations

117
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,790
by floating the body in a special fluid
to reduce the sensation of weight

118
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,090
can also cause hallucinations as well

119
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:11,849
as anxiety.
When denied proper stimulation,

120
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,040
the brain goes through phases that begin
with boredom

121
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,300
and if left unchecked can become worse.

122
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,370
It's a phenomenon well-documented in
animals confined to cages

123
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,420
for long periods of time, and,
in a horrific case,

124
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,069
a human child named Genie.
Born

125
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:34,139
in 1957 in Arcadia, California,

126
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,849
Genie became one of the most famous
cases of abnormal

127
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:42,580
child psychology.
Her father was abusive to her and her family

128
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:47,479
and delusional. He hated the outside
world and sought to isolate his family

129
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,129
from it

130
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:51,540
as best he could.
He confined Genie

131
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,170
to a room with only two blacked-out
windows for the first

132
00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:00,150
thirteen years of her life.
He often tied her to a toilet chair

133
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:04,279
and never fed her solid food.
When authorities finally found her,

134
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:08,049
in 1970, she had not acquired a language

135
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,310
and had the mental age of an 18-month-old child.

136
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,660
Genie was extensively studied and became a staple

137
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,870
of psychology courses, a rare example of
an impossible

138
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,160
experiment.
What if a human child was

139
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,640
isolated from human contact, social behaviors

140
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,849
and human language.
A feral child, not raised by the proverbial

141
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,759
wolves, but instead

142
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:38,580
right in the middle of suburbia.
Genie

143
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,158
is still alive today, her identity anonymous,

144
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:47,110
as a ward of the state of California.
Extended

145
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,279
under stimulation isn't just a
punishment inflicted by delusional

146
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,339
caretakers,

147
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,420
it's also a punishment inflicted on criminals,

148
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:59,990
especially in the form a solitary confinement.

149
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,340
In the Bureau of Prisons, the record for most

150
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,139
time spent denied social contact is held

151
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:10,759
and still being set by Thomas Silverstein.

152
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:15,179
Considered extremely dangerous,
Silverstein has been kept in solitude

153
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:19,679
since 1983.
He has barely seen a single

154
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,819
other human for the last 29 years.

155
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,970
Stories like those are intense

156
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,759
and are far beyond everyday occasional boredom,

157
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,909
simple boredom.
What you feel when waiting

158
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:36,139
at an airport or listening to an
unengaging lecture

159
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:39,269
is not a disorder, it's not a moodm

160
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:44,009
it's an emotion. Robert Plutchik's
wheel of emotions is a great way to

161
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:45,179
visualize this.

162
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:49,219
The wheel is based on 8 basic emotions extended

163
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,190
in order of intensity.
Boredom is positioned as a

164
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,840
light version of disgust.
Emotions

165
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,620
are not superfluous.
Normal amounts of them have a purpose.

166
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,610
Creatures who feel emotions are often
compelled to do

167
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,259
and not do more complicated things than merely

168
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:11,539
eating, drinking, sleeping and procreating, like

169
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:16,139
building friendships, apologizing,
loving unconditionally and

170
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:20,509
planning and building for the future.
Disgust

171
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:24,679
is an emotion we don't like.
It keeps us from doing things. Its purpose

172
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:28,849
is most likely a warning, an alarm triggered
by things that appear rancid,

173
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,839
spoiled or toxic, 
that could poison us or make us sick.

174
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:38,400
Like a good friend, disgust pushes us
away from such things. It guides us

175
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,860
in a healthy direction.
Likewise, boredom

176
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,320
protects us.
Monotonous speakers,

177
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,950
mind-numbing tasks and overloaded sameness,

178
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,930
those things aren't dirty or poisonous,
they're just not

179
00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:57,829
stimulating enough.
Boredom compels us to new things,

180
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,860
fresh stimulation and when it can't be overcome

181
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:05,300
a propensity to boredom is a sign of a healthy mind.

182
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:08,769
It's advantageous.
Creatures who felt it wound up

183
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:14,139
doing more, flourished more, which led to
more creatures like themselves,

184
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:17,789
boredness feelers.
So the next time you're

185
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:21,459
a little bored, be proud.

186
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,129
Thank your ancestors,
you are participating in a life

187
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:28,309
improving drive, like hunger or thirst

188
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:31,429
that pushes us toward new and better things.

189
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:35,259
Give yourself time away from the usual distractions

190
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:38,600
to get bored.
It will be

191
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,840
boring, but boring is literally how

192
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,360
holes get made and perfected.
Not all holes are useful but some

193
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,490
become people's to some pretty cool stuff.

194
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,099
And as always,

195
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,990
thanks for watching.
