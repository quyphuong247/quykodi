00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:07,139
Using GPS, these trails represent pizza delivery
in Manhattan on a typical Friday night.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,519
And is this a frog or a orse?

3
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:15,599
It's episode 52 of IMG!

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:23,800
This lemon looks yellow to me, and it probably
looks yellow to you as well, but not in

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:31,739
the same way. You see, here in this room,
this lemon is "Subtractively Yellow." It absorbs

6
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:37,370
all visible wavelengths of light except for
yellow light, which it reflects onto my retina.

7
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:43,589
But the screen that you are using to watch
this video doesn't produce yellow light at

8
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:50,030
all. In fact, it can only produce red, blue,
or green light. The really cool, but kind

9
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:55,730
of disturbing thing about this is that here
in the room, I am actually seeing "real" yellow

10
00:00:55,729 --> 00:01:02,909
light. But you are seeing "fake" yellow. Absolutely
no yellow is coming off your screen and falling

11
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:09,670
onto your retina. But it still looks yellow
because it's quite easy to lie to the brain.

12
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:14,240
Our retinas contain three different types
of cone cells that are receptive to color

13
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,280
and each one is best suited to detect a certain
color. One is great for blue, the other is

14
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,560
great for green and the third is great for
red. Notice that there is no individual cell

15
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:32,000
looking for yellow. So, the way we actually
see yellow happens like this. The wavelength

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,040
of yellow light falls between the wavelengths
of red and green. And, so, when an object

17
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:44,109
reflects yellow light onto your retina, both
the green and the red cones are slightly activated,

18
00:01:44,108 --> 00:01:48,108
which your brain notices and says "well, that's
what happens when something's yellow, so it

19
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,608
must be yellow."

20
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:55,429
All a computer monitor or a mobile phone screen
has to do to make you think you're seeing

21
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,939
yellow is send a little bit of red and a little
bit of green light at you. As long as the

22
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:03,949
pixels and the little subpixels on them are
small enough that you can't distinguish them

23
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,909
individually, your brain will just say "well,
I'm recieving some red and some green, that's

24
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:16,870
what yellow things do...hmm...it must be yellow."
Even though it actually is not...

25
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,939
Lemons can also produce electricity. A little
bit of zinc, a little bit of copper, and boom,

26
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:27,099
you're moving electrons around. But not that
many, I mean, the current voltage are quite

27
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:30,840
low.
You could run an LCD, but even a potato could do that...

28
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,590
If you wanted to run a flashlight bulb, that
would take 3,000 lemons. And if you wanted

29
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:43,348
to run a halogen bulb, well, that would take
37,000 lemons. But artist Caleb Charland

30
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:44,588
doesn't care.

31
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:52,860
He spent 11 hours hammering nails into 300
living apples hanging on trees. By connecting

32
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:58,000
them to a household lamp, he was able to make
it glow just dimly enough to capture this

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,960
image with a 4 hour exposure.

34
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:07,099
Less alive and more frightening are Steve
Shaheen's sculptures: little dudes with bulb

35
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:10,739
heads desperately trying to plug themselves in.

36
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:16,989
Merve Kahraman's "Revitalizer" never dies.
It's a lightbulb surrounded by wax. Now, the

37
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:20,920
wax melts because of the lightbulbs heat,
and drips into a special container into all

38
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:25,518
kinds of weird new shapes, but whenever you
want you can just flip it so that the new,

39
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,579
cooled wax is at the top.

40
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:33,819
But my favorite is the Fukusada wooden lightbulb.
It looks like a solid block of wood, but it's

41
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:40,938
actually hollow and chipped to a nearly paper-thin
width. When you turn it on you can see the

42
00:03:40,938 --> 00:03:42,739
light coming from inside.

43
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,319
Combos.

44
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:53,400
Artist Tang Yau Hoong blew my mind this week.
We've got clear days and smoke, boats and

45
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:04,360
crocs, whales and hearts, Pie-bike, brains
and boxing gloves, day and night, but don't

46
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:10,860
be scared, you can always paint yourself some
light. Or just swing on some light.

47
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,620
Ok, let's frame it this way. Climbing Wall.
This fitness club in Japan uses frames and

48
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,040
other pretty interior elements to create a
decidedly less rugged climbing wall.

49
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:25,879
But let's get simple. Like, minimal.

50
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:31,529
Thanks to Lego, here are their bricks arranged
to represent famous characters. Enjoy.

51
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,740
Now for some Art Illusions.

52
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:54,120
Here's a cute couple, but can you see, in
this very same image, the baby they will soon

53
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:01,259
have? Or how about these zebras? There's
a lion hiding amongst them. Can you find it?

54
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:05,449
Billboards can be clever, but here's a great
one that makes it look like someone is pushing

55
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:08,029
out a section of the building.

56
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,140
But how many of you will remember seeing it?
If we assume that you don't remember experiencing

57
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:20,519
major cultural events before you're 5 or 6
years old, that means that every year there

58
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:26,819
are fewer and fewer people alive who remember
experiencing recent historical events.

59
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:33,680
xkcd made this amazing chart to show when,
in the future, the majority, more than half

60
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:39,649
of living americans, will not remember being
alive when certain things happened. For instance,

61
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:46,589
he calculated using data from the US Census
Bureau that 2012, this very year, is the

62
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:53,979
first year in American history since in which
fewer than half of living Americans remember

63
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:56,689
being alive in the 1970's.

64
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:02,860
By 2041, most of us won't remember a time
when Pluto was actually called a planet. By

65
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:10,020
2043, most of us alive won't remember living
during George W. Bush's presidency. And by

66
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:16,069
2047, more than half of living Americans
will not have been alive to have remembered

67
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:18,879
anything that you did today.

68
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:25,180
Like when you made that funny face in the
yearbook. No, no, no, THAT funny face.

69
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:29,730
If you're not following @tweetsauce, you're
missing out on daily Vsaucey content, most

70
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:34,250
of which never makes it to a video. So go
follow us on Twitter and I'm gonna leave you

71
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:40,040
with another combo. A tessellation, while you
listen to Jake Chudnow's "Flan." He made a

72
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,170
music video for this song over on his channel,
so check that out.

73
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,569
And as always,

74
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:46,029
thanks for watching.
