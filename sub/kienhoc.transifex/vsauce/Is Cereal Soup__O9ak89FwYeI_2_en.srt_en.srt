1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,700
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,320
Take a look at this.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,179
Simple enough, right?

4
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:10,179
But watch what happens next.  

5
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:17,859
Okay, what the heck is this thing?

6
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:19,859
Mostly people eat it like a soup,

7
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,219
out of a  bowl with a spoon. 

8
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:24,000
But is it a soup?

9
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:27,699
The word 'soup' comes from words that originally meant

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:33,140
 "to absorb liquid", which dry cereal
left in milk too long will do.

11
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,199
But words change.

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,240
What if cereal is actually a type of salad?

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,880
And milk is just a dressing?

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,439
Or maybe, dry cereal is the actual meal and

15
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:49,219
milk is just a condiment or a coating.

16
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:51,219
Adding milk to dry cereal might be like adding

17
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,789
ketchup to french fries, or icing a cake.

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,480
Honestly, there is no real answer. The answer

19
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,829
is whatever we agree the answer should be.

20
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:10,260
We make up the words and we make up the categories.

21
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:16,580
If you ask me, cereal is soup, but it's not
soup soup.

22
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:19,239
Cereal is also salad, but it's not

23
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,959
salad salad.

24
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,179
What I just did there is
called reduplication.

25
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,618
We do it all the time

26
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,379
but usually for emphasis. For example,

27
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:31,779
 "I like you" but I also like like you.

28
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,980
Tomorrow's event is fancy, but it's not fancy fancy.

29
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,498
When I say "soup soup" or "salad salad", I

30
00:01:39,498 --> 00:01:46,158
am using reduplication in a way that is known
as Contrastive focus reduplication. I am reduplicating

31
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,739
a word to express a focus on prototypical
types of that word,

32
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:53,000
in contrast to French types.

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,239
A Caesar or vegetable are more prototypical

34
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:04,239
types of salad than, say, potato, taco, fruit,
or a bowl of cereal with milk.

35
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:11,069
The increasing progress of technology forces
us to contrastively focus reduplicate more

36
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:12,248
and more often.

37
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:14,769
For example, now when talking about a book,

38
00:02:15,098 --> 00:02:19,869
you might need to clarify whether it is an
e-book or a book book.

39
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,969
The original physical paper type.

40
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:24,650
The phrase paper book is a retronym.

41
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:30,679
A modification to an old word made necessary
by the advent and popularisation of something

42
00:02:30,688 --> 00:02:31,628
new.

43
00:02:31,628 --> 00:02:34,099
Before movies with sound came along,

44
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:36,599
silent movies were just called movies.

45
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,819
Before voicemail and e-mail, snail mail was
just mail.

46
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:47,060
And before mobile phones, your landline or
home phone was simply a phone.

47
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,819
Or in many cases just the phone.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,479
This is Morse code for a smiley face emoticon.

49
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,040
It's a happy beat.

50
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,860
The eyes of the emoticon are a colon,

51
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:10,099
which up until as recently as the middle of the
1900s was often used with a dash

52
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:12,180
to represent a pause.

53
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,040
It was an especially helpful direction to

54
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,699
people reading text out loud.

55
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:19,359
It was used all over the place.

56
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,209
In personal letters and

57
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:24,628
all over America's Declaration of Independence.

58
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:26,759
You may also notice that it looks a little

59
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:27,558
bit 

60
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,558
anatomical.

61
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,900
The Oxford English Dictionary has a name for

62
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,120
this punctuation mark

63
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,099
and that name is

64
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,479
"the dog's bollocks".

65
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,100
In other words, dog balls.

66
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,300
Although other emoticons were definitely used

67
00:03:45,818 --> 00:03:52,458
earlier, as far as official dictionary entries
are concerned, the very first emoticon with

68
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:57,199
an official name was an emoticon for a willy.

69
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:59,259
This also means that America's Declaration

70
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:00,959
of Independence is, 

71
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,878
punctuation-wise,

72
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:05,400
covered in dog wieners.

73
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:08,368
Nine of them, to be exact.

74
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,319
What I'm about to do is called drawing.

75
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,870
When I am finished,

76
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,269
what I have created is called 

77
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:19,259
a drawing.

78
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,240
But it's finished. Shouldn't it be called "a drawn"?

79
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,259
A similar version of this problem is often
attributed to Steven Wright.

80
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:32,710
Why are they called buildings if they are finished?

81
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:34,329
Shouldn't they be called "builds"?

82
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:36,329
What's really going on here is a phenomenon

83
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,040
known as 'verbal nouns'.

84
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,600
A noun formed from a verb.

85
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:47,019
It's often easier to "noun-ify" a verb than
to just use lots of words.

86
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:51,519
Why call this a structure resulting from the
active of building, when you could just call

87
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,279
it a building?

88
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,279
Where does the word 'nickname' come from?

89
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,740
Did a guy name Nicholas one day decided everyone
could call him Nick and in doing so create

90
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,300
a literal nickname?

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,980
No.

92
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:08,139
Nickname is a product of rebracketing.

93
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:11,300
A process in which speakers, often unknowingly, create

94
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,370
new words by moving sounds from one word to another.

95
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:21,170
For instance, the English word alligator is
a corruption of the Spanish "el lagarto" -

96
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,370
the lizard.

97
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,629
El lagarto, el lagarto, el, alligator.

98
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,740
Eke used to mean "also",

99
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,740
as in you could have a name,

100
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,579
and you could have another name that

101
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:34,659
was also your name.

102
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,520
Your "eke name". 

103
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,620
Eke name. Eke name. Ni, ni, nickname.

104
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,920
Here's another funny thing about language.

105
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:49,530
If you're noisy in class, you're disrupting class.

106
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:52,409
But if you sit around silently paying attention,

107
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,150
are you

108
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,139
rupting class?

109
00:05:55,589 --> 00:06:00,369
You can be disgruntled, but can you ever be gruntled?

110
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:06,569
Words that would seem to have a related word
but actually do not are called unpaired words.

111
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:11,169
Maybe they were in a pair at one point in
history, or maybe through a fluke of etymology

112
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:17,348
they only seem to have one, but what you think
it would be isn't in any dictionary.

113
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:23,219
Some definitions like "soup" and "salad" are
so vague their borders are almost hilariously

114
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,080
fuzzy.

115
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,180
Other words, well, they're just plain silly.

116
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,270
For example, the sun does not rise every morning.

117
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:33,699
The Earth actually just turns you toward it,

118
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,389
but yet our word for that phenomenon is sunrise.

119
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,259
Languages are full of expressions like that.

120
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:47,660
George Steiner wrote colourfully about this,
saying "The accelerando of the sciences, and

121
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:52,760
of technology, have beggared both the reach and veracity of natural language.

122
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,060
 In consequence,

123
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,288
the commonplace relations of language to phenomenon
to our daily context have become virtually

124
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:00,848
infantile.

125
00:07:00,848 --> 00:07:05,468
They are a bric-a-brac of inner
metaphors, of whory fictions and handy falsifications.

126
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:11,750
From the perspective of the theoretical and
exact sciences, we speak a kind of neanderthal

127
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,209
babble."

128
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:15,989
Whether spoken or typed or tabbed or felt

129
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,490
or signalled,

130
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:22,500
language may be inevitably full of idiomatic expressions and expressions that are

131
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:24,739
incomplete.

132
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,980
And categories

133
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,379
that are fuzzy.

134
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,040
But hey,

135
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,040
at least it's our fuzz, and at least

136
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,560
fuzz is entertaining.

137
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,300
It would be nice to just know everything and have absolutely nothing

138
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,780
to explain or demonstrate to anyone else.

139
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,520
But then again,

140
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,939
as Emily Dickinson once said,

141
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:50,000
"a letter is a joy of earth. It is denied
the Gods".

142
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,788
If we were all omniscient, we'd have no reason
to write letter to one another, there wouldn't

143
00:07:54,788 --> 00:08:00,699
be anything new you had to tell someone else. We would have no reason to debate the soupiness

144
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:03,079
or saladness of cereal.

145
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:05,978
No reason to wonder, no reason to read, or

146
00:08:05,978 --> 00:08:07,358
to watch.

147
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,720
I'd have no reason to say and as always,

148
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,500
thanks for watching.
