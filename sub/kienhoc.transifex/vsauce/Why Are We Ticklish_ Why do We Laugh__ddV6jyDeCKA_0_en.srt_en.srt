00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:04,080
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And today we're going to talk about

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,649
humor, comedy.
What makes something

3
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:10,710
funny and when something's funny, why do we laugh?

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,309
What's the purpose of laughing and why
do we laugh when we're tickled?

5
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:18,070
Well, people study this.
They're called gelotologists

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,420
and we don't have all the answers yet,
but what we do know is that you are

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,929
thirty times more likely to laugh

8
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:26,649
if there are other people around.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,000
We also know that babies laugh before
they learn a language

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,359
and that babies born blind and deaf will laugh.

11
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:41,058
There are thousands of languages,
hundreds of thousands of dialects, but yet we

12
00:00:41,058 --> 00:00:41,539
all

13
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:47,009
laugh in much the same way.
Our brains are constantly looking for

14
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:51,259
patterns - ways of understanding the world and
predicting what's next. It's to our

15
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:55,849
evolutionary advantage. And so when
something begins in a way that we expect

16
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,059
and then all of a sudden changes and
surprises or delights us,

17
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:02,488
we often react with laughter,
because we have just

18
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:05,500
learned something.
We've learned a new

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,700
logical order.
This theory posits that things are

20
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,539
funny because there's an incongruity
between what we expected

21
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:16,750
and what happened.
Whether it's a dog

22
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,170
dressed like a human or a clever use of word play.

23
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,868
In other words, comedy is about learning.

24
00:01:23,868 --> 00:01:27,420
But once you've learned the new logical
order of the joke,

25
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,189
well it ceases to be funny,
which is why jokes are funny the first time,

26
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:35,000
but not every other time after that.
Take a look at this

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,670
percentage sign.
Alright, so you know what a percent sign is.

28
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,150
But besides the percent, there's also a permil

29
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,710
and permyriad symbol.
But that's not

30
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:50,289
funny, because even though it might be
new information to you, it still falls

31
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:55,009
right in line with the logic of the
percent symbol. But what Demetri Martin shows

32
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:55,290
us

33
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,720
with just one more line,
you can make it look like a man cheering

34
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,859
after taking a dump... well, that surprises us.

35
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:05,540
But we don't only laugh when something's funny.

36
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,670
What about tickling? How does that make any sense? Most of us don't like being

37
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:14,199
tickled, but when tickled we can't help but smile

38
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:18,669
and laugh.
Well, a possible explanation is that tickling

39
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:22,369
helps teach children at a young age
proper defensive

40
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,379
behaviors. Is it a coincidence that the
most ticklish areas are also

41
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,509
the most vulnerable
and the ones that we instinctively cover

42
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:34,569
when startled. Also, because being tickled
makes the person laugh,

43
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:38,128
it may encourage others to tickle them,
teaching them

44
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:42,378
these defensive skills.
Tickling may even play a role

45
00:02:42,378 --> 00:02:46,799
before you are born.
In order to avoid being tickled, a baby

46
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,129
gets into a better position to be delivered.

47
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:53,759
Now, physically, laughing involves the

48
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,310
epiglottis - a little flap thing that
protects the trachea

49
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,340
whenever we swallow, so that food and water
doesn't go down into our lungs.

50
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:04,738
I know it doesn't look very funny,

51
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:09,080
but this is where the laugh happens.
The epiglottis constricts the larynx

52
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,739
and we get the LOL.
Interestingly,

53
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:16,759
the epiglottis actually has taste buds
on it, which means that,

54
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:19,859
anatomically speaking, comedy truly is

55
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,240
a matter of taste.

56
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,199
Get out of my house!

57
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:43,419
And as always,

58
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:45,119
thanks for watching.
