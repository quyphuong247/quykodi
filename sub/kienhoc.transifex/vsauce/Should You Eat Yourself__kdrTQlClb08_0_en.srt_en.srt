00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:04,408
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And Jake. And Kevin.

2
00:00:04,408 --> 00:00:06,279
And we are in Santa Monica, which

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:11,108
of course means that the "V" in "Vsauce"
will stand for the Roman numeral five,

4
00:00:11,108 --> 00:00:13,269
as in five questions

5
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:14,689
from you guys.

6
00:00:16,509 --> 00:00:18,850
Our first question comes from "@notch".

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:23,009
He didn't ask this of me in particular,
but I love how non-intuitive the

8
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:25,609
answer is.
Assume

9
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,980
an Earth that's perfectly spherical

10
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,708
and a rope, stretched around the equator snugly.

11
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:37,988
What would happen if that rope was just,
say, six meters longer? Six meters

12
00:00:37,988 --> 00:00:39,229
isn't very much,

13
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:42,449
but because of the relationship
between a circumference

14
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,699
and a radius,

15
00:00:43,698 --> 00:00:48,509
six meters of extra rope would allow the
entire rope to not fit snugly around

16
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:49,450
the earth,

17
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,320
but one meter above it,

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,170
all the way around.

19
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,989
That's cool, but what if instead of a rope

20
00:00:55,988 --> 00:01:00,259
we used something more rigid, like a structure, a bridge

21
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:03,570
and we built the bridge all the way around the Earth.

22
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,500
And then, all at once, destroyed its supports.

23
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,760
Would it

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,109
float?
Clearly the earth's gravity would pull the structure down,

25
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:18,669
but down is in the opposite direction
for the other side of the bridge.

26
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,150
Well, it turns out

27
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:26,560
such a scenario would be incredibly
unstable. Earth's gravity isn't equal

28
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,399
everywhere, and if you follow @tweetsauce
you saw some great graphs showing

29
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:32,099
just how much gravity changes,

30
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,669
simply based on the density of rock below.

31
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:40,120
When you factor in the Sun and the Moon,
you wind up with a bridge structure that is

32
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,460
not gonna stay where it is.
If the bridge itself was indestructible, it would start

33
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:49,409
violently hula hooping around the
earth, crushing things. But there's no

34
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:54,090
known material strong enough to do that.
Instead, you would wind up with

35
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,810
bridge pieces flying everywhere.

36
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,859
A sphere around the earth would be a bit
more stable, but a ring?

37
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:02,150
Not so much.

38
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:07,618
The ring, even if spinning, would rapidly
break apart into smaller pieces.

39
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:11,959
Last week you guys asked me a question
that I have always wondered.

40
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:17,150
Let's say I was stranded in the
mountains, waiting for rescuers to arrive,

41
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,510
but it was going to take

42
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:21,908
a while.
I had plenty of snow and plenty of water,

43
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,049
but I was hungry -

44
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,868
dying of starvation -

45
00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:26,509
would it make sense

46
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:27,668
to

47
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:29,819
amputate one of my legs

48
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:31,459
and eat it?
I mean,

49
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,959
it kinda makes sense, right?!

50
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,579
I'd have my entire leg to eat as food,
which would probably fill me up

51
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:39,590
and I would have one less limb

52
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,489
that I would need to keep alive.

53
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:47,799
The only problem is that the trauma your
body would endure from the loss of a

54
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:48,498
limb

55
00:02:48,498 --> 00:02:53,258
would greatly exceed the benefit you would get
by eating the food. You're better off keeping

56
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:54,059
that limb

57
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,330
on your body,

58
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:59,510
because your body's process of using
reserves of energy is more efficient than

59
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:02,938
the process of digestion.
So keep the leg on

60
00:03:02,938 --> 00:03:08,658
and let it wither away, keeping you alive.
Don't cut it off and eat it and digest it.

61
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:15,108
How does hair know when to stop growing?

62
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:16,569
It's a good question,

63
00:03:16,568 --> 00:03:18,659
because the hair on my arm, which

64
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:21,729
there's a lot of, never grows any longer than this.

65
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:25,399
And if I were shave my arm off,
it would grow back and stop

66
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:27,519
right where it is right now.

67
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,129
But head hair is different.

68
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:35,468
For instance, my hair - what's left of it -
would keep growing if I didn't cut it.

69
00:03:35,468 --> 00:03:40,008
But no other animal has that situation.
You don't see wolves out in the forest

70
00:03:40,008 --> 00:03:44,008
saying, wow, look how long my hair is
getting, I better get to the barber shop.

71
00:03:44,008 --> 00:03:48,689
So, why do humans have head hair that grows so long,

72
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:53,528
but body hair elsewhere that stops
seemingly right when it's supposed to.

73
00:03:53,528 --> 00:03:54,829
Well, first things first.

74
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:59,099
The hair on your head will not keep growing for ever.

75
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:02,918
Typically around six years of growth is the limit.

76
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:08,029
When hair grows, it is in what is known as its
anagen phase. And for hair on your

77
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:10,079
head that phase can last

78
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:12,028
up to six years.

79
00:04:12,028 --> 00:04:17,009
But the anagen phase of hair elsewhere
on your body - eyebrows, eyelashes -

80
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:18,629
is much shorter.

81
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:23,449
Except in cases like this guy, whose
eyebrows grove like head hair and

82
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:27,569
have allowed him to set the world record 
for longest eyebrows.

83
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:33,168
Humans probably lost their fur coats,
their thick body hair,

84
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:38,418
because it didn't really help us hunting
and running around sweating on the savannah.

85
00:04:38,418 --> 00:04:42,250
And unlike other animals,
us humans had discovered fire

86
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,620
and could make clothing

87
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,999
to keep ourselves warm
without needing a built-in fur coat.

88
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:54,040
To be sure, long hair that falls over
your ears and neck can keep you warmer.

89
00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:00,110
But leading theories also argue
that long head hair may be

90
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,509
our fault.

91
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,999
A result of the fact that early humans

92
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:07,850
picked mates that could grow longer hair on their heads.

93
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,528
Mates that could do that were probably healthier

94
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:14,389
and in colder climates literally had a built-in hat

95
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:16,559
to keep their body warm.

96
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:20,630
One of the questions I get the most
is about eye floaters.

97
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:24,550
Those little dots or squiggles that you see 
in your vision, especially when looking at

98
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,460
a bland scene, like the clear blue sky.

99
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:32,649
Eye floaters are made out of little fibrals
that occur in your eye

100
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:37,808
as you age. And you can't look directly
at them because they're inside the fluid

101
00:05:37,809 --> 00:05:43,080
of your eye. Turning your eye to look
at them simply causes the fluid to move

102
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:47,718
and the floater as well.
But the thing about eye floaters that I love the most is

103
00:05:47,718 --> 00:05:49,879
that they are almost always

104
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,389
microscopic.

105
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:54,158
You can't see them with the naked eye,

106
00:05:54,158 --> 00:05:57,139
except when they are inside

107
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:58,120
your eye.

108
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,228
If you were to pull an eye floater out,
you wouldn't be able to see it. But in your eye,

109
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,519
it's close enough to the retina

110
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:09,188
to leave a shadow on the retina and
that's what you see when you see eye

111
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:10,329
floaters.

112
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:14,680
Finally, how much would Wikipedia weight

113
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,139
if i printed all the text out

114
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:19,610
and bound it into books?
Well luckily,

115
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:24,050
there's a Wikipedia article about this very topic.

116
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,240
The English-language Wikipedia contains
about two billion three hundred and

117
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,168
forty five million words, which,

118
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:35,870
if printed at the density of the
Encyclopedia Britannica, would equal

119
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,680
about

120
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,668
1,759

121
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:40,740
volumes.

122
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,750
Which would look

123
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,949
like this.

124
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:47,520
Altogether they would weigh about 7,000 pounds.

125
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,799
If you're between the ages of 13 and 18,

126
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,199
you may want to check out

127
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,250
the Google

128
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,740
Science Fair.

129
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,228
It's an amazing competition.
These guys are great. They actually helped

130
00:06:58,228 --> 00:07:01,438
make that Earth bridge animation for me.

131
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,949
So be sure to check out

132
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:05,740
GoogleScienceFair.com.

133
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,240
And I'll keep checking out Los Angeles.
I'm here

134
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,329
with Kevin and Jake from Vsauce2 and 3

135
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:12,788
for the first time ever.

136
00:07:12,788 --> 00:07:17,618
The three of us have never been in one
location simultaneously until now, so be

137
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:20,799
sure you're subscribed to us, because amazing videos

138
00:07:20,798 --> 00:07:22,109
will come soon.

139
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,259
And as always, thanks for watching.
