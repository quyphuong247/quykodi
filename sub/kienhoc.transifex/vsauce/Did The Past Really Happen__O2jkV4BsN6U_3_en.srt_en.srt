1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,610
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. The dog

2
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:07,580
that played Toto in The Wizard of Oz was
credited

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,559
as Toto, but in reality the dog's name

4
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:15,838
was Terry. And when Terry died in 1945

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,969
her owner and trainer Carl Spitz buried
her on his ranch

6
00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:23,729
in Los Angeles. But in 1958

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,300
the Ventura Highway was constructed
right

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,789
through Terry's grave. Her remains were

9
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:35,850
disturbed and have never been found.
Fifty-three years later

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,030
a memorial was erected in Hollywood
Forever Cemetery

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,600
in her honor but because she isn't burried

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,640
there, the memorial is not a grave. It's
what's known

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,759
as a cenotaph, an empty

14
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,820
tomb. I was reminded of Toto's

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,679
cenotaph when I saw the cenotaph of Philopappos, atop the Hill of the Muses

16
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,829
in Athens. You see, I was recently in
Greece

17
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:03,929
talking about YouTube with YouTube
creators. The

18
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:07,510
all seen eye of Guy came along and we
visited

19
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:12,728
the Acropolis, a Lion Gate - nearly a
thousand years older than the Acropolis.

20
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:16,959
The earliest known analog computer.
Plenty of beautiful

21
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,478
cats and I even took a selfie in

22
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,719
Delphi. I've seen all of these things and

23
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,009
how old they were, it made me wonder how
will we

24
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,200
be remembered.

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,620
How will future archaeologists react to
the ruins of today's

26
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,120
society they find thousands of years
from now.

27
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,120
Will they do a good job piecing it

28
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,230
together? Will anything about you in
particular

29
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,420
be remembered? And, for that matter,

30
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,519
how do we even know that the past really
happened?

31
00:01:54,519 --> 00:02:00,390
Not just the way we think it happened,
but it all.

32
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,060
Seriously, can you prove that the universe
wasn't created

33
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,719
last Thursday? That everything - every
person, every memory you have,

34
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:14,020
every photo you've taken didn't just pop in
into existence

35
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,030
last week or five minutes ago?

36
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:21,710
Last Thursdayism is the belief that
the universe was created

37
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,629
last Thursday. It doesn't have actual

38
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:29,709
followers or rituals but proving it
wrong

39
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:32,719
is impossible. Not because the universe

40
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,939
actually was created last Thursday but
because Last

41
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:40,099
Thursdayism is not also falsifiable.

42
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:44,650
It cannot be shown to be false. In the
evidence you bring up against it can be

43
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,789
explained away as part of the

44
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:50,739
everything that was created last
Thursday.

45
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:54,110
Many people believe that in order for a
theory

46
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,540
and explanation to be scientific it must
be possible

47
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:01,840
to refute it, to prove it wrong, to test it.

48
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,849
So, instead, Last Thursdayism falls
into the domain

49
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:08,870
of philosophy, where luckily

50
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,209
there are razors - little rules of

51
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:15,530
thumb that help shave off unlikely
explanations.

52
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:20,400
The most famous is Occam's Razor. When
faced with the choice between

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,769
explanations,

54
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:25,480
choose the one that requires diffused
assumptions.

55
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,869
Occam's Razor can shave off

56
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,420
last Thursdayism because it requires

57
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:35,108
fewer assumptions to believe that, say,
this beehive

58
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:38,719
tomb was constructed way back in the
Bronze Age

59
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:42,858
and that I just visited it later than it
does to believe that

60
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:46,469
the tomb, my memories of it and this
footage of me

61
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:52,090
inside it just happen to coincidentally
pop into existence at the same time

62
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,299
last Thursday. One of my favourite
philosophical razors

63
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:59,799
cuts off so much stuff it's not even

64
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:02,840
called a razor. It's called Newton's

65
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,250
Flaming Laser Sword. It states

66
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,938
if something cannot be settled by
experiment, then it is not worthy

67
00:04:10,938 --> 00:04:14,438
of debate. So let's move on

68
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:17,538
to the past. What does Newton's

69
00:04:17,538 --> 00:04:21,319
Flaming Laser Sword tell us about the
past? I mean, it doesn't exist in the same

70
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,259
way

71
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:27,840
gravity or light or protons do. We
can't do experiments on it,

72
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,339
build control groups, run trials. The past

73
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:34,799
just is what it was.

74
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,098
We will one day be the past and no
matter how well we try to record

75
00:04:40,098 --> 00:04:43,389
our stories ourselves, without

76
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:47,860
time machines future archaeologists are
going to have to make a lot of guesses

77
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,699
about us.

78
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:51,579
But that's kinda cool.

79
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:55,199
Future humans will likely know way more
than us today

80
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,959
about medicine, about exoplanets, about physics.

81
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,349
But one thing they almost surely

82
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,040
will not know more about than we do is

83
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,870
today. Will your great great great great
grandkids

84
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,180
know your name? Will aliens, who visit
Earth

85
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,699
millions of years after humans leave or
go extinct,

86
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:21,250
understand that Animorphs was just

87
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,680
fiction, and not a history of our people?

88
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,530
You are destined to become whatever the
future

89
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:32,199
thinks you were, if you're lucky.

90
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,889
Vandals, fire, natural disaster,

91
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:39,710
conquerors, thieves, all of these forces
obscure facts

92
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:43,750
overtime, but no matter how well we tried
to preserve

93
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,050
today for future history books, there's
one type of

94
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,949
fog we are unlikely to avoid.

95
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:55,060
Apathy. Ira Glass put it well

96
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,889
when he asked his listeners a simple
question: name

97
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:03,599
10 people from the 15th century.

98
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,680
We have records of more than 10 people
but to most of us

99
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,069
they don't matter. In five hundred years

100
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:16,009
radio host will be making the same jokes
but about us.

101
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:20,569
However, there is a legacy
leave behind

102
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:24,310
that is irreversible. Immutable,

103
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,930
and in a way, unforgettable.

104
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,590
To conserve energy, turn off when not in
use.

105
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:36,119
Or just keep them on. Energy will be
conserved

106
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,449
no matter what you do. Even if you leave
lights on all year,

107
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:44,370
there will be no less or more energy in
the universe.

108
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,728
What's really being conserved when we
turn off lights

109
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:50,728
are the resources we turn into energy

110
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:53,829
the lights can use. But if you counted up

111
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:58,288
all the energy in the system, before and
after turning the lights on,

112
00:06:58,288 --> 00:07:02,560
it would be the same. Energy also does
something else.

113
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,050
Unless hindered from doing so, energy

114
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,819
will spread

115
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:11,528
out - it will disperse. That is,

116
00:07:11,528 --> 00:07:15,168
in so few words, the Second Law of
Thermodynamics.

117
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:20,158
It's how our universe works. It's why
things that happen spontaneously

118
00:07:20,158 --> 00:07:23,319
do. Energy spreads.

119
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:27,379
Even when a process locally concentrates
energy,

120
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:30,550
like when a crystal forms or life grows,

121
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,150
the Second Law isn't violated because these
processes

122
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:37,959
aren't independent from the larger world
around them. They aren't

123
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:43,098
100 percent efficient. Hindrances can hold
back the inevitable spread of energy for a

124
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:45,889
long time. The Second Law doesn't say

125
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:49,848
when energy will disperse - just that when it can, 

126
00:07:49,848 --> 00:07:53,668
oh it will. Balloons will deflate,

127
00:07:53,668 --> 00:07:58,288
objects will fall, hot objects will cool
down,

128
00:07:58,288 --> 00:08:03,128
and perfume sprayed across the room will
eventually migrate to your nose

129
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:07,218
even in really still air. How much

130
00:08:07,218 --> 00:08:11,158
or how widely energy has spread out is
measured

131
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,778
in entropy. Entropy is often called

132
00:08:14,778 --> 00:08:21,228
"disorder", "chaos". But entropy is very
different from macroscopic

133
00:08:21,228 --> 00:08:24,598
messiness. This deck of cards is

134
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:28,560
themed after Greek philosophers. It's
also arranged by

135
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,068
value and suit - the entire deck. But if I
take the deck

136
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:37,049
and shuffle it, that is, disorder it, I
haven't

137
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,049
actually increased the deck's

138
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:40,998
entropy,

139
00:08:40,999 --> 00:08:44,028
because nothing about this deck of cards'

140
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:47,799
energy is different than it was before.
However,

141
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:50,899
entropy in the greater world around us

142
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:54,899
has increased because in order to
shuffle the cards

143
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,980
my body has to do work. It has to take
energy concentrated in my cells

144
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,039
and change and disperse that energy into
kinetic energy,

145
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,649
movement, and a little bit of heat from
my body and from the cards,

146
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:11,489
friction, and a little bit of sound
energy - that rustling noise.

147
00:09:11,489 --> 00:09:16,028
So there's your real legacy.

148
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:19,600
Your contribution to the universe's
growing

149
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,399
entropy. No process will be able to

150
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,458
undo the net increase in entropy

151
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:30,948
you accomplish in your life. History may
forget you,

152
00:09:30,948 --> 00:09:34,678
or misinterpret your accomplishments, or
what stood for.

153
00:09:34,678 --> 00:09:38,289
The ripples you leave behind may get
redirected

154
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:41,998
but the universe will never be able to
forget the

155
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:45,740
entropy you add. That's the law.

156
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,470
The Second Law of Thermodynamics.

157
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,959
Many scientists believe that this means
that eventually

158
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,328
energy - heat - will be completely spread out

159
00:09:57,328 --> 00:10:02,328
evenly throughout the universe. It will be
the same temperature

160
00:10:02,328 --> 00:10:06,508
everywhere, and at that point nothing
will be able

161
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:09,919
to happen. Because in order for something
to happen

162
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,169
entropy needs to increase, energy needs
to spread, the move to change.

163
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:18,828
This may be the ultimate fate of the
universe - 

164
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:22,388
thermodynamic equilibrium. The

165
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:28,930
"Heat Death" of the universe. It's been estimated that
at the rate things happen

166
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:31,929
this end the universe will occur in about

167
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:36,919
8 googol years, and you're contributing
to it

168
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:40,899
by simply existing. A funny consequence
of all this

169
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:45,559
is the fact that people who aren't very active, people who don't do much but lay

170
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,359
around

171
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,980
aren't just being lazy. In a way

172
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,240
they're being considerate. Sloth

173
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,039
maybe of vice, but to the universe

174
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:02,019
it's a fountain of youth. Choosing to do as little
as possible

175
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:05,100
means consciously limiting your
contribution

176
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,300
to the inevitable dispersal of energy and
thus

177
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:11,500
in a teeny-tiny way postponing

178
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,659
the "Heat Death" of our universe.

179
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:17,759
Relaxing adds time

180
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,250
to the universe's life: in amount of
time, to be fair, almost indistinguishable

181
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,490
from zero,

182
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,110
but still theoretically real. Being

183
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,610
lazy will make the universe last

184
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,690
longer. So thanks for

185
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:38,020
chilling out.  Thanks for taking it easy. And, as always,

186
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:39,480
thanks for watching.
