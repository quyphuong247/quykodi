00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,905
Hey, Vsauce Michael here coming to you from my hotel room in London

2
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:08,877
with a little camera that I taped to a bunch of
furniture I stacked up.

3
00:00:08,877 --> 00:00:13,214
Which is better than nothing, and as you
can tell from the title of this video,

4
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:15,185
it's also what we're going to discuss.

5
00:00:15,185 --> 00:00:17,318
Nothing.

6
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:22,458
Can there ever be nothing?
I mean, we're surrounded by matter all the time.

7
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:24,829
Even this glass is not empty.

8
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:27,399
I know you might think there's nothing in it,
but it's full of air.

9
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:29,837
And air is packed.

10
00:00:29,838 --> 00:00:33,200
One cubic centimeter of air contains almost

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,339
30 quintillion molecules.

12
00:00:36,338 --> 00:00:39,610
But if I remove the air from this glass,

13
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,078
I can create what is known as a vacuum,

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,783
an awesome word that uses a double u, but not a w.

15
00:00:46,783 --> 00:00:51,679
The challenge, however, is removing
all of the air.

16
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:54,960
To this day, the best scientists have been able to do

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,231
is to create what they call an ultra-high vacuum.

18
00:00:58,231 --> 00:01:00,353
At this point, one cubic centimeter

19
00:01:00,353 --> 00:01:04,030
of space contains not 30 quintillion molecules,

20
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,605
but a mere and amazing 100.

21
00:01:07,605 --> 00:01:10,744
To put that in perspective, a vacuum cleaner

22
00:01:10,745 --> 00:01:14,371
like you use at home hardly changes
the thinness of the air at all.

23
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:17,947
In fact, if you use a vacuum cleaner at sea level,

24
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:22,020
the vacuum created inside the operational part of the machine

25
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:26,420
only has the thinness of air found
in Denver, Colorado.

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,766
If you want thinner air, if you want even
fewer particles per cubic centimeter,

27
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:34,093
you're going to have to leave earth.

28
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:37,933
But before we go too far, let's talk about
high altitude flying.

29
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:41,042
When you're in an airplane 30,000 feet high,

30
00:01:41,042 --> 00:01:44,070
the outside air is very thin and dangerous.

31
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:49,412
So by law, the airplane must keep the inside of that commercial aircraft pressurized

32
00:01:49,412 --> 00:01:53,882
so that it only feels like you're no more than 8,000 feet high.

33
00:01:53,882 --> 00:01:57,286
The reason it's dangerous is that
when air gets that thin,

34
00:01:57,286 --> 00:01:59,754
there's not enough oxygen for your brain.

35
00:01:59,754 --> 00:02:04,763
This man is about to remove his mask
temporarily and with supervision

36
00:02:04,763 --> 00:02:07,801
in the actual thinness of the air around him.

37
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:10,828
Within less than a minute,  he suffers from hypoxia,

38
00:02:10,828 --> 00:02:12,437
a lack of oxygen.

39
00:02:12,437 --> 00:02:14,773
Even though he appears to be awake and alert,

40
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:18,573
when told to put his mask back on or else he will die,

41
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:20,716
he does nothing.

42
00:02:27,716 --> 00:02:30,986
But a lack of oxygen, a lack of air, a lack of matter

43
00:02:30,986 --> 00:02:35,060
can get even more dangerous when
you go above 60,000 feet,

44
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,668
about 19,000 meters above the surface of the earth.

45
00:02:38,668 --> 00:02:42,335
This limit is known as Armstrong's Limit.

46
00:02:42,335 --> 00:02:44,733
We all know that the boiling point of water

47
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:47,872
decreases as your altitude increases,

48
00:02:47,872 --> 00:02:52,179
and at Armstrong's limit, the boiling point for your own blood

49
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:56,515
drops all the way down to the temperature of your own body.

50
00:02:56,515 --> 00:03:00,020
If you reach that altitude without wearing a special suit,

51
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,251
bubbles will form inside your blood, and your body

52
00:03:03,252 --> 00:03:05,790
will inflate to twice its normal size.

53
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,758
But because your internal organs and
your skin are flexible, you won't explode.

54
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:12,992
So let's talk about out gassing.

55
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:17,240
Out gassing is why it's so difficult
for us to reach an ultra high vacuum.

56
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,140
If you remove so much air from this glass,

57
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:23,543
there's fewer than 100 particles per cubic centimeter.

58
00:03:23,544 --> 00:03:27,140
The glass itself or whatever material
your chamber is made out of

59
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:30,552
will start to lose its own trapped gasses.

60
00:03:30,552 --> 00:03:35,081
But materials don't need to be inside
partial vacuums to out gas.

61
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:39,551
It happens all the time, and is
especially noticeable in confined spaces.

62
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:41,522
For instance, a car.

63
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:44,052
All of the adhesives and chemicals used to make that car

64
00:03:44,052 --> 00:03:46,266
will out gas and collect inside,

65
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:49,302
creating what we know as the new car smell.

66
00:03:49,302 --> 00:03:51,801
All right, time to leave earth for good.

67
00:03:51,801 --> 00:03:54,462
Let's go into the space between planets.

68
00:03:54,462 --> 00:03:58,241
Now remember that in a laboratory, the best vacuum we've been able to create

69
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:01,746
is about 100 particles per cubic centimeter.

70
00:04:01,747 --> 00:04:04,419
Well, between the planets and our solar system,

71
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:09,823
there is space that only contains ten particles per cubic centimeter.

72
00:04:09,823 --> 00:04:13,195
And if you leave our solar system in the innerstellar space,

73
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:17,461
you're only going to find about one particle per cubic centimeter.

74
00:04:17,461 --> 00:04:20,937
The real winner though is intergalactic space.

75
00:04:20,937 --> 00:04:23,694
Leave the Milky Way altogether and you can find regions

76
00:04:23,694 --> 00:04:28,307
where there's only one or two particles
per cubic meter.

77
00:04:28,307 --> 00:04:31,446
Okay, that's cool and all, but would it be possible

78
00:04:31,446 --> 00:04:34,443
to find a region of space where there is absolutely

79
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:37,652
and literally nothing, no matter at all?

80
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:40,889
Well, according to quantum mechanics, no.

81
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:44,677
First of all, you've got gravitational and electromagnetic fields

82
00:04:44,677 --> 00:04:48,295
that extend forever, because the particles that cause

83
00:04:48,295 --> 00:04:51,362
those fields to happen have no mass whatsoever.

84
00:04:51,362 --> 00:04:54,136
And this is what's really mind blowing:

85
00:04:54,136 --> 00:04:58,458
there's a thing known as virtual particles
that's happening all the time,

86
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,435
even around us right now where there's no vacuum.

87
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:05,274
These virtual particles come into
existence and then disappear.

88
00:05:05,274 --> 00:05:08,078
And we believe they exist for a couple of reasons.

89
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,679
One big reason is the fact that our universe

90
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:14,615
continues to expand, even though that
shouldn't necessarily happen.

91
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:18,952
Where are we getting that extra force that pushes it, that causes it to keep expanding?

92
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:24,092
Well, these particles that pop into
existence and disappear may be the answer.

93
00:05:24,093 --> 00:05:29,095
Even crazier is an effect we've observed
known as the Casimir Force.

94
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:32,869
If you put two pieces of metal nanometers
apart inside a vacuum,

95
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:35,704
they will be pushed together.

96
00:05:35,704 --> 00:05:38,680
One of the most popular theories for why this happens

97
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,651
is that these virtual particles popping
into space and then disappearing

98
00:05:42,651 --> 00:05:45,384
are actually reflecting off of the metal.

99
00:05:45,384 --> 00:05:47,954
But because the plates are so close together,

100
00:05:47,954 --> 00:05:51,052
particles with wavelengths longer than that gap

101
00:05:51,052 --> 00:05:56,497
don't get reflected, so there's more virtual particles pushing on the outside than the inside,

102
00:05:56,497 --> 00:05:58,697
and the metal plates contact.

103
00:05:58,697 --> 00:06:01,561
I know these concepts have gotten pretty crazy,

104
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:06,733
but rest assured that really all it means is that whenever you feel down and feel like nothing matters,

105
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,110
you're scientifically incorrect.

106
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,740
Nothing matters, there can't be nothing.

107
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,911
There's always matter, there's always something.

108
00:06:14,911 --> 00:06:17,379
And as always, thanks for watching.
