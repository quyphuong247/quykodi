00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,379
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And I'm sure that
we all love to have fun with hand shadows,

2
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:09,900
but how much does a shadow weigh?

3
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:15,678
It might sound like a silly question, because
it is. I mean, a shadow cannot be put on a

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,919
scale and weighed. But the material that
it falls on top of can be weighed. And

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,179
we know that light has energy. In fact, when
light encounters an object, it pushes that

6
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:34,009
object just a little bit. On the surface of
Earth, when sunlight is hitting it, every

7
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:42,378
square inch is being pushed with a force of
about one-billionth of a pound, which is basically

8
00:00:42,378 --> 00:00:47,539
nothing. But, over a large enough surface
area, the results can be pretty fun.

9
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:54,539
On a sunny day, the city of Chicago weighs
300 pounds more, simply because sunlight is

10
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,490
falling on it, pushing it.

11
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,940
In outer space, where solar wind isn't filtered
by Earth's atmosphere or magnetic field, the

12
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:09,549
results are even bigger. A space craft, traveling
from Earth to Mars, would be pushed by light

13
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:16,469
1,000 km off course. So these things have
to be factored into journeys to Mars. We've

14
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:22,409
actually already created things that can sail
with light: giant reflective solar sails that

15
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,049
are pushed by the Sun's light.

16
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:32,040
So, in a way that is calculable, though difficult
to measure, an area covered in shadow technicaly

17
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:36,829
weighs less than surrounding areas being pushed
by light.

18
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,420
But enough about the Sun. There are 3 astronomical
bodies that can cast shadows on the surface

19
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,540
of Earth bright enough for us humans to see.
One is obviously the Sun, and the other is

20
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,480
the Moon.
But what's the third?

21
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:54,799
Venus.

22
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,079
Pete Lawrence investigated this over a digital
sky. Now, to make sure that the shadow he

23
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:04,939
saw was caused by Venus, he used a tube that
could be pointed at specific regions in the

24
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:11,348
sky. Inside the tube, he put a cutout shaped
like the astronomical symbol for Venus.

25
00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:18,009
Now, here is light coming through the tube
when pointed just adjacent to Venus at a point

26
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:23,840
in the sky relatively dark and empty to
the human eye. But here is what came out of

27
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,640
the tube when pointed at Venus - a  Venusian shadow.

28
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:38,960
We all know that light travels quickly - 
299,792,458 metres per seconds = c.

29
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,438
But this light right here, in fact, the light
coming off your screen into your eyeballs

30
00:02:44,438 --> 00:02:52,878
right now, is moving slightly slower than
"c" because "c" is the speed of light in a vacuum,

31
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,818
but all of this light if having to travel
through a medium, in this case air.

32
00:02:57,818 --> 00:03:11,058
The speed of light in air is ever-so slightly
slower than "c"- 298,925,574 m/s. This is

33
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:18,068
interesting because light travels more slowly
through different materials, but "c" remains

34
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:23,078
the universal speed limit, and as long as
an object doesn't go that fast, it can still

35
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,499
outpace light in a material.

36
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:32,899
A charged particle, for instance an electron,
can travel through water faster than light

37
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:40,180
does, but never faster than "c". When this
happens, we get something analogous to a sonic

38
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,000
boom. We get a "Photonic Boom."

39
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:50,699
In a sonic boom, the sound information propagating
off of the object is in the form of compression

40
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:55,319
waves, and as the object gets closer and closer
to the speed of sound, the speed that those

41
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:01,558
waves are moving away from it at, each new
wave has less time to get out of the way of

42
00:04:01,558 --> 00:04:08,079
the next, until eventually the waves collapse
all into each other and the denisty and pressure

43
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:10,579
is enormous, causing a sonic boom.

44
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:17,399
Normally, when a charged particle moves through
a material whose molecules can be polarized,

45
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:26,418
the molecules give off photons. But each photon
has room to fly away, and the waves all destructively

46
00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:30,049
interfere with each other,
so no radiation is given off.

47
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:36,430
But the faster the particle goes, the less
room the photons have away from each other

48
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:44,790
and their waves begin to constructively interfere,
giving off a photonic boom - "Cherenkov Radiation."

49
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:50,098
Astronauts, especially those who have gone
all-the-way to the Moon, have reported seeing

50
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,680
flashes of light. Many people attribute this
to high-speed particles moving through the

51
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:02,680
liquid inside their eye faster than light
normally would, causing photonic boom's right

52
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,220
inside their body.

53
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:09,379
Speaking of the speed of light, here's a great
question a few of you have sent me. It involves

54
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:15,869
a possible way of going faster than "c".
Here's how it goes.

55
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Let's say I want to push a button that is
a lightyear away from me, which means that

56
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,550
it would take light, the fastest possible
thing in the universe, a year just to get

57
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,960
from me to the button.

58
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:35,959
Ok, well what if I built a board, one lightyear
long, all-the-way from me to the button and

59
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:41,318
then I pushed one end of the board.
Would the other end immediately push the button?

60
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:46,710
And if so, did I just break the speed of
light? Did I just send information faster

61
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:53,478
than light? Well, we're not talking about
the speed of light anymore, are we? We are

62
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:57,118
talking about the speed of push.

63
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:03,779
When you push a rigid object, what you are
really doing is putting a series of compression

64
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:10,699
waves through the object, which move at the
speed of sound in the object's material.

65
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:16,500
The information about "whoa, we've been pushed,
you should move," is sent via that compression

66
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,860
wave and it only travels at the speed of sound.
So, when pushing a normal day-to-day size

67
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:28,250
type object, it feels almost instantaneous.
But when pushing a lightyear-long board, it would

68
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,598
take a lot longer.

69
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,180
A cool way to see this in action is to look
at an object in which compression waves travel

70
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:41,819
more slowly. For instance, what Veritasium
has done: blowing minds by showing Slinky's

71
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:48,800
being dropped. The information telling the
Slinky that "hey, uh, we're moving," travels

72
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,639
through the Slinky slow enough that a slow-mo
camera can see it happen.

73
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,050
If you haven't watched all of Veritasium's
Slinky videos, you've missed out. In fact,

74
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:03,730
you should watch all of their stuff, it is superb.
But to wrap things up, here's the

75
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:11,200
point. The speed of push is not instant and
it's certainly not the speed of light. But

76
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:19,779
light can push you. In fact, technically,
you weigh more when the lights are on than

77
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:22,899
you do when the lights are off.

78
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,560
I've put links in the description to all kinds
of cool things you should definitely check

79
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,980
out for fun and for science.

80
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,920
And as always,

81
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,140
thanks for watching.
