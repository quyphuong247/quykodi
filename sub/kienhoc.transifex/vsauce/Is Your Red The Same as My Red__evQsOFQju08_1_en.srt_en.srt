00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,569
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:10,849
This appears blue. This appears yellow.
And this appears green. Those of us with normal

3
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:19,060
color vision can probably agree.
But that doesn't change the fact that color is an illusion.

4
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:26,059
Color, as we know it, does not exist in the
outside world, beyond us, like gravity or

5
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:35,579
protons do. Instead, color is created inside
our heads. Our brains convert a certain range

6
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:42,140
of the electromagnetic spectrum into color.
I can measure the wavelength of radiation,

7
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:51,920
but I can't measure or observe
the experience of a color inside your mind.

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,960
So, how do I know that when you and me look
at a strawberry, and, in my brain, this perception

9
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:06,879
occurs, which I call "red," that, in your
brain, a perception like this doesn't occur,

10
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:12,039
which you have, of course, also learned to
call red. We both call it red. We communicate

11
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:19,819
effectively and walk away, never knowing just
how different each of our internal experiences

12
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:22,259
really were.

13
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:28,709
Of course, we already know that not everybody
sees color in exactly the same way. One example

14
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:34,759
would be color blindness. But we can diagnose
and discuss these differences because people

15
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:39,349
with the conditions fail to see things that most of us can.

16
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:45,428
Conceivably though, there could be ways of
seeing that we use that cause colors to look

17
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:50,850
differently in different people's minds, without
altering their performances on any tests we

18
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:52,828
could come up with.

19
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:57,288
Of course, if that were the case, wouldn't
some people think other colors look better

20
00:01:57,289 --> 00:02:03,209
than others? Or that some colors were more
complimentary of others? Well, yeah, but

21
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:05,740
doesn't that already happen?

22
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:12,740
This matters because it shows how fundamentally,
in terms of our perceptions, we are all alone

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,860
in our minds.

24
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:22,899
Let's say I met an alien from a far away solar
system who, lucky enough, could speak English,

25
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:30,109
but had never, and could never, feel pain.
I could explain to the alien that pain is

26
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:36,580
sent through A delta and C fibers to the spinal
chord. The alien could learn every single

27
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,920
cell and pathway and process and chemical
involved in the feeling of pain. The alien

28
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:47,379
could pass a biology exam about pain and
believe that pain, to us, generally is a bad

29
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:47,960
thing.

30
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:57,300
But no matter how much he learned, the alien
would never actually feel pain. Philosophers

31
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:05,939
call these ineffable, raw feelings "Qualia."
And our inability to connect physical phenomenon

32
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:13,659
to these raw feelings, our inability to explain
and share our own internal qualia is known

33
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:20,629
as the "Explanatory Gap." This gap is confronted
when describing color to someone who's been

34
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:23,180
blind their entire life.

35
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:28,099
Tommy Edison has never been able to see.
He has a YouTube channel where he describes what

36
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:35,519
being blind is like. It's an amazing channel.
In one video he talks about colors and how

37
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,750
strange and foreign of a concept it seems
to him. Sighted people try to explain, for

38
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:47,569
instance, that red is "hot," and blue is "cold."
But to someone who has never seen a single

39
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:56,879
color, that just seems weird. And, as he explains,
it has never caused him to finally see a color.

40
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,509
Some philosophers, like Daniel Dennett, argue
that qualia may be private and ineffable simply

41
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:09,549
because of a failure of our own language,
not because they are necessarily always

42
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,569
going to be impossible to share.

43
00:04:12,568 --> 00:04:17,579
There may be an alien race that communicates
in a language that causes colors to appear

44
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,569
in your brain without your retina having to
be involved at all. Or without you having

45
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:28,629
to have ever needed to actually see the color
yourself. Perhaps, even in English, he says,

46
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:34,560
given millions and billions of words used
in just the right way, it may be possible

47
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,560
to adequately describe a color such that a
blind person could see it for the first time.

48
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:48,289
Or you could figure out that, once-and-for-all,
yes or no, in fact, you and your friend

49
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,280
do not see the same red.

50
00:04:51,279 --> 00:05:00,059
But for now it remains the case that we
have no way of knowing if my red is the same

51
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:07,459
as your red. Maybe one day our language will
allow us to share and find out, or maybe

52
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:13,109
it never will. I know it's frustrating to
not have an answer, but the mere fact that

53
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:20,350
you guys can ask me about my internal experiences,
and the mere fact that I can ask my friends

54
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:27,169
and we can all collectively wonder at the
concept of qualia is quite incredible, and

55
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:29,759
also quite human.

56
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:36,340
Animals can do all sorts of clever things
that we do. They can use tools, problem solve,

57
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:42,220
communicate, cooperate, exhibit curiosity,
plan for the future, and although we can't

58
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:49,620
know for sure, many animals certainly act
as if they feel emotions - loneliness, fear,

59
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,720
joy.

60
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:57,339
Apes have even been taught to use language
to talk to us humans. It's a sort of sign

61
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:02,439
language that they've used to do everything
from answer questions, to express emotion,

62
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:08,709
or even produce novel thoughts. Unlike any
other animal, these apes are able to understand

63
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:14,750
language and form responses at about the level
of a 2.5 year old human child.

64
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:24,500
But, there is something that no signing-ape
has ever done. No ape has ever asked a question.

65
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:30,448
Joseph Jordania's "Who Asked the First Question?"
is a great read on this topic and it's available

66
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:32,540
for free online.

67
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,100
For as long as we've been able to use sign
language to communicate with apes, they have

68
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:42,560
never wondered out loud
about anything that we might know that they

69
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,600
don't.

70
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:50,500
Of course, this does not mean that apes, and
plenty of other animals, aren't curious. They

71
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:58,100
obviously are. But, what is suggests is that
they lack a "Theory of Mind." An understanding

72
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:04,870
that other people have separate minds.
That they have knowledge, access to information

73
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:12,079
that you might not have. Even us humans aren't
born with a "theory of mind," and there's

74
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:18,459
a famous experiment to test when a human child
first develops a "theory of mind." It is called

75
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:20,439
the "Sally-Anne" test.

76
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:27,580
During the test, researchers tell children
a story about Sally and Anne. Sally and Anne

77
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:34,189
have a box and a basket in their room.
They also happen to have a delicious cookie. Now,

78
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:41,350
Sally takes the cookie and puts it inside
the box, and then Sally leaves the room. While

79
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:47,540
Sally is gone, Anne comes over to the box,
takes the cookie out and puts the cookie

80
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:53,979
inside the basket. Now, when Sally comes back,
the researchers ask the children "where

81
00:07:53,978 --> 00:07:59,269
will Sally look for the cookie?" Obviously,
Sally will look in the box. That's where she

82
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:04,189
left it. She has no way of knowing what Anne
did while she was gone. But until the age

83
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:10,600
of about 4, children will insist that Sally
will check the basket because, after all,

84
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:16,240
that's where the cookie is. The child saw
Anne move the cookie, so why wouldn't Sally

85
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,819
also know? Young children fail to realize
that Sally's mental representation of the

86
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:27,779
situation, her access to information,
can be different than their own.

87
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:34,110
And apes who know sign language, but never
ask us questions, are doing the same thing.

88
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:40,240
They're failing to recognize that other individuals
have similar cognitive abilities and can

89
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,379
be used as sources of information.

90
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:53,000
So, we are all alone with our perceptions.
We are alone in our own minds. We can both

91
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:59,769
agree that chocolate tastes good. But I cannot
climb into your consciousness and experience

92
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:08,439
what chocolate tastes like to you. I can never
know if my red looks the same as your red.

93
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,770
But I can ask.

94
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:18,600
So, stay human, stay curious
and let the entire world know that you are.

95
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,060
And as always,

96
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,480
thanks for watching.
