00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
Hey, Vsauce.
Michael here.

2
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:06,399
And today, we're going to talk about this.
Just kidding.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,919
We're going to talk about this.
Left.

4
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,820
What's left?
First of all, 90% of humans, regardless of

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:21,539
culture or language are right-handed.
And we choose a dominant hand before we've

6
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:24,759
even left our mothers.
That's right.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,540
When a baby inside its mother's womb is seen
sucking its thumb, it is sucking the right

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,310
thumb 90% of the time.
Animals do it too.

9
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:40,469
In fact, horses take longer strides with their
right legs, which is the entire reason racetracks

10
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:45,799
are run counterclockwise.
Left-handedness is so rare that across most

11
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:50,239
cultures there has been a historical stigma
against being left-handed.

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:56,380
In fact, the word for somehow who's good at
using both hands is ambidextrous and "dexter"

13
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,739
comes from Latin for "right."
So when you call somebody ambidextrous, you're

14
00:01:00,738 --> 00:01:04,140
not saying that they're good with using both
hands, you're telling them that they have

15
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,879
two right hands.
And if someone is unable to use either hand,

16
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:14,839
they're called ambisinister, because in Latin
"sinister" means "left."

17
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:18,059
But why do we have to have a dominant hand
in the first place?

18
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,000
Why can't we all just be awesome with both
hands?

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,599
Well the fault lies in the brain.
Now, brain wants to be efficient, so it divvies

20
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:32,339
up tasks to specific regions and it tends
to avoid sending too much information between

21
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,250
both hemispheres, because doing so would require
using the corpus callosum, which would take

22
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:41,790
more time and energy.
Now, the way the brain works is kind of funny.

23
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,050
The left side of the brain controls the right
side of the body and the right side of the

24
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,019
brain controls the left side of the body.
So it makes sense that the hand you're best

25
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:55,368
doing precise stuff with would correlate to
the hemisphere of the brain that does the

26
00:01:55,368 --> 00:02:01,310
most precise processing.
In 95% of right-handed people it's the left

27
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:06,010
hemisphere that deals with precise language
thinking, like definitions.

28
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:11,580
But when you're left-handed, there's about
a 40% chance that you're using the right hemisphere

29
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,420
or both.
And this is where things get interesting.

30
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:18,539
Now being left-handed or ambidextrous does
not mean that your brain works in one way

31
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:21,818
or the other.
But it may help explain why across averages

32
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:27,389
ambidextrous people sometimes score lower
on IQ tests, or why a greater proportion of

33
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:31,209
schizophrenics are left-handed or ambidextrous
than the rest of the population.

34
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:35,340
Now that said, there are giant benefits to
having a brain like that.

35
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,590
By sending information back and forth, more
novel connections are made, more creative

36
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,890
ideas are made.
Albert Einstein was left-handed.

37
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:49,689
And 5 of the last 7 US presidents have been
left-handed.

38
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:54,030
There's something else left-handed people
have an advantage with - keyboards.

39
00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:00,379
On a QWERTY keyboard, thousands and thousands
of English words can be typed using the left

40
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,789
hand.
But on the right side of the keyboard you

41
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:07,959
can only write maybe about a 100 or so.
On the left side of a keyboard the left hand

42
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,819
all on its own can type pretty long somewhat
common words, like stewardesses, reverberated

43
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:16,818
and desegregated.
But on the right-hand side the longest common

44
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:22,179
word you can type is "lollipop."
Oh look, a spacebar.

45
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:28,939
When people go to space, they have left Earth.
The first person to leave Earth into space

46
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:33,959
was Yuri Gagarin, a Soviet cosmonaut.
But the one I'm interested in was the fourth

47
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,179
man into space, Gherman Titov.
He may have only been the fourth person into

48
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:45,500
space, but he was the first person to have
left Earth and simultaneously left wakefulness.

49
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:51,609
Titov was the first person to sleep in space.
And here's what's really fun.

50
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:57,140
He was 25 years old when he did it, which
means that to this day Titov is the youngest

51
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,870
human who has ever been to space.
You know what else leaves Earth?

52
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,530
Helium.
That's right.

53
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:08,539
Helium gas that we use in balloons is lighter
than air and so molecules of helium rise all

54
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:14,209
the way to the very tip top of our atmosphere,
where they get picked off by solar wind, meaning

55
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:18,338
that they leave us forever.
In fact, there's a little bit of a concern

56
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:22,678
over how much helium we have left, because
the only way helium comes into existence on

57
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,259
Earth is through radioactive decay.
Alpha particles are essentially helium nuclei

58
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:31,289
and we find a lot of helium inside natural
gas.

59
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:35,510
But right now we're using a lot of it and
helium is quite cheap, so there's a realistic

60
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:42,709
concern that within the next 30 or 40 years
we may have no helium left.

61
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:44,219
Thanks for watching.
