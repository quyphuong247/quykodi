1
00:00:03,638 --> 00:00:05,298
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:07,919
I am at the White House, in America's capital,

3
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:11,549
Washington, D.C. America makes a lot of
feature films every year - 

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,949
Hollywood. But they don't make the most
feature films every year. Nigeria makes more.

5
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,490
But the country that makes the most
films every single year is

6
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:23,500
India. Every two years, the country

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,240
of India fills up enough film with unique
feature films

8
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:30,559
that stretch all the way from this city,
Mumbai, to where I live,

9
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,339
in London. That's double what Hollywood
produces in two years.

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,879
That is a lot of movies, but is

11
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:43,378
real-life a movie? I've discussed the frame
rate of the human eye before but how

12
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:44,519
does the resolution

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,000
of the human eye compare to a camera or screen?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,488
VHS, LaserDisc, DVD,

15
00:00:51,488 --> 00:00:57,750
Blu-ray, IMAX. Numbers like these are
pixel dimensions. When multiplied

16
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,799
they tell us the total number of picture
elements an image is made up of.

17
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:06,030
A figure often used to describe digital
cameras. It might sound like

18
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,070
more is better, but to be sure numbers
like 1920 by 1080

19
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:16,329
are not resolutions per se.
More pixels is only part

20
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:19,629
of the equation. Resolution is about distinguishing

21
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:23,310
fine details and that depends on a lot of other factors.

22
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,829
For instance, the amount of light, the
size of the sensors,

23
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:30,158
what the millions of pixels are actually
encoding and

24
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,600
how close the subject is. I mean, up close

25
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,739
Salvador Dali's painting of his wife
looking at the Mediterranean can be

26
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:39,578
resolved into boxes. But from a far,

27
00:01:39,578 --> 00:01:44,188
well, it's Abraham Lincoln. For crying out
loud, on a small enough screen

28
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:49,099
from far enough away, low and high,
so-called resolutions on screens, aren't

29
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:50,438
even resolved differently

30
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:53,118
from one another by your eye.

31
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,060
How different nearby pixels are from one
another also matters. This is called

32
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,530
spatial resolution.

33
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,590
For instance, if I go out-of-focus

34
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,380
the number of pixels in the video frame
stays the same but you can't resolve as much

35
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:09,780
detail. Now, with all this in mind we can still

36
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,628
compare human vision to a digital image,
by asking a better question.

37
00:02:13,628 --> 00:02:17,870
Assuming everything else is optimal, how
many pixels would you need to make an

38
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,650
image on a screen large enough to fill
your entire field of view

39
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,860
look like real life, without any
detectable

40
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,560
pixelation? Now we are getting somewhere.

41
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,979
Kind of. The analogy is still crudy

42
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:36,549
because a camera snaps an entire frame
at once, whereas

43
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,900
our eyes move around. The brain amalgamates

44
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,340
their constant stream of information
into what we call vision -

45
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,060
sight. In fact, the image created by the
eyeball alone during a single glance

46
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:54,269
would hardly even be acceptable on a
broken TV screen. We think

47
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:58,330
our eyes create images like this picture
Guy took of me with a camera.

48
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:02,580
But for one thing, unlike a camera,
you've got some stuff

49
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,050
in the way. For instance, you are always

50
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,790
looking at your own nose, and maybe even
glasses,

51
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:14,310
if you have them. Luckily, our brains
process those stimuli out because they

52
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,158
don't matter

53
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:19,310
and they don't change. But thinking those are
the only difference

54
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,930
is a pitfall, literally,

55
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,180
latinly. The fovea gets its name from the Latin for

56
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,379
'pitfall'. The fovea is the pit on your
retina that receives light from the

57
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,628
central two degrees

58
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:35,949
of your field of view, about the area
covered by both your thumbs

59
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:40,649
when held at arms length away. Optimal
colour vision and 20/20 acuity are

60
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:46,560
only possible within that little area.
When it comes to these limitations XKCD[.com]

61
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,340
has a brilliant illustration.

62
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,400
It points out other problems, like blind spots - literal blank spaces

63
00:03:52,408 --> 00:03:55,409
in our vision where the optic nerve meets
up with the retina

64
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:58,919
and no visual information is received. If you bought

65
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,958
a camera that did this, you would return it.

66
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:04,989
You can find your own blind spot by closing

67
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:08,819
your right eye, fixating your left eye
on a point in front of you,

68
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:11,869
extending your left thumb and then moving it

69
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,819
left-of-center slightly slowly carefully
until

70
00:04:15,818 --> 00:04:19,548
it's not there anymore. Crazy(!)
But, of course,

71
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:24,508
we don't see the world horribly, like
this, because our eyes are constantly moving,

72
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:27,620
dragging foveal resolution wherever we need it.

73
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,910
And our brains' complex visual system fills in details,

74
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:36,840
merges images from both eyes and makes a
lot of gueses. What we actually see

75
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:41,060
is a processed image.
Not computer-generated imagery, but,

76
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:45,879
well, meat-generated imagery.
The neon color spreading illusion

77
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:49,870
is a great way to demonstrate this
difference. There is no

78
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,209
blue circle in this picture. The white here

79
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,609
is the same as the white here. A camera

80
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,669
isn't fooled, a screen isn't fooled, only

81
00:04:59,668 --> 00:05:03,870
you and the fleeting gumbo of
ingredients you call perception

82
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,079
is fooled. Our vision

83
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:13,050
is not analogous to a camera. But our
reformulated question can still be

84
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:18,250
answered because human anatomy allows us
to resolve, to differentiate certain

85
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,769
angular distances. Famously, Roger N .Clark

86
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:26,899
used a figure of 0.59 arcminutes
as the resolution of the human eye to calculate,

87
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:30,009
based on the size of our total field of
view,

88
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:34,180
how many of these distinct elements
could fit inside of it.

89
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,639
The result was an approximation of
exactly what we want to know:

90
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:42,908
how many individual picture elements -
pixels - our vision can appreciate.

91
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:47,980
His answer? 576 megapixels.

92
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,819
That many pixels, packed
inside a screen large enough to fill

93
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:55,009
your entire field of view, regardless of proximity,

94
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:58,240
would be close enough to be undetectable
by the average

95
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,129
human eye. But we should factor in the fovea,

96
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:06,129
because Clark's calculation assumes
optimal acuity everywhere, it allows the

97
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:07,478
eye to move around.

98
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:13,478
But a single glance is more analogous to
a camera snap, and, as it turns out,

99
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:17,478
only about 7 megapixels,
packed into the two degrees of

100
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:20,629
optimal acuity the fovea covers during a fixed stare,

101
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:25,199
are needed to be rendered undetectable.
It's been roughly estimated that the

102
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,478
rest of your field of view would only need about

103
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:32,718
1 megapixel more information. Now that might
sound low but keep in mind that there

104
00:06:32,718 --> 00:06:36,288
are plenty of modern technologies that
already use pixel densities

105
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:41,209
better than we can differentiate.
As Bad Astronomer deftly showed,

106
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:45,269
Apple's Retina Displays truly do
contain pixels at a density

107
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:48,468
average eyesight can't differentiate from typical

108
00:06:48,468 --> 00:06:53,009
reading distances. But the fact that
there are screen sizes and pixel

109
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:54,870
densities that can fool the human eye

110
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,000
is not a sign that we see in

111
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,819
any kind of megapixelly way. Human vision just

112
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:07,348
isn't that digital. I mean, sure, like a
camera sensor we only have a finite

113
00:07:07,348 --> 00:07:10,439
and discrete number of cells in our retina.

114
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:14,668
But the brain adjusts our initial
sensations into a final perception

115
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:18,158
that is a wishy-washy top-down processed blob

116
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:21,579
of experience. It's not made of pixels

117
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:26,379
and furthermore, unlike a camera, it's not
saved in memory with veracity like a

118
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,819
digital camera file.

119
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:32,598
Absolutely no evidence has ever been
found for the existence of a truly

120
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:37,228
photographic memory. And what's even
cooler is that not only do we not

121
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:40,228
visually resolve the real world, like a movie camera,

122
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:45,598
we also don't narratively resolve
conflict and drama in our lives

123
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,009
like most movie scripts. The point of
all of this, what I'm getting at,

124
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:53,699
is an idea. An idea that initially drew me to this question.

125
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,728
We play roles in the movie of life,

126
00:07:56,728 --> 00:08:01,788
but it's a special kind of movie.
Cinematic victories and struggles are often

127
00:08:01,788 --> 00:08:07,019
discrete, resolved, like pixels, with
unbelievably perfect beginnings and endings,

128
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:11,779
whereas the real world is all about ear resolution.

129
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:15,299
I like how Jack Angstreich put it in 'Cinemania'.

130
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,699
In a movie, a character can make a
decision and then walk away from the camera

131
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:25,658
across the street and have the credits
roll, freezing life in a perfect happily ever after.

132
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,720
But in the real world, after you cross
the street,

133
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,699
you have to go home. The world goes on.

134
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:39,918
Life doesn't appear in any particular pixel resolution

135
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,088
or narrative resolution. Things are

136
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:47,819
continuous. The world was running before
you came around and it will continue running

137
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:52,338
after you are gone. Your life is a plot
only in so far as it begins

138
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:55,690
and ends and occurs in medias res.

139
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,740
Damerish opens illustration for
Charles McGrath's endings

140
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:03,139
without endings says it perfectly. In life, there rarely is

141
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:05,439
the end. There is only

142
00:09:05,448 --> 00:09:06,948
the and.

143
00:09:06,948 --> 00:09:08,128
And as always,

144
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:09,489
thanks for watching.
