00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,240
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,780
Nyctophobia is the fear of the dark.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,039
But there's another fear that's more chilling.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,179
It's the fear that darkness will go away.

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,689
Optophobia, the fear of opening your eyes.

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:24,270
Light travels at the fastest speed possible for
a physical object.

7
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,359
Darkness is erased when light appears, and returns

8
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:31,419
when light leaves. The speed of dark

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,770
is the speed of light but there are
other types of darkness

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,580
that can move faster than light speed. For
instance,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,679
a shadow.

12
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,259
Across a distance, a shadow can become
much larger than the object creating it,

13
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:51,570
but still mimic its source, moving in the
same way for the same amount of time.

14
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,189
So when a shadow is bigger than the object casting it, it moves a greater distance

15
00:00:56,189 --> 00:01:00,459
when the object moves but in the same amount of time. Make a shadow large enough

16
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,859
and it can travel across the surface faster than light.

17
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:08,390
If you, here on Earth, cast a shadow onto
the Moon,

18
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,070
not an easy thing to do, that pointed
from, say, point A

19
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:16,379
on the moon's surface, and then you moved
your finger so that the shadow moved

20
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:20,069
to point B, your finger would only move a
few centimetres

21
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:23,368
in a fraction of a second. But the
shadow it cast on the Moon

22
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:27,069
would move thousands of kilometers in
the same amount of time.

23
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:30,148
Do it right and you're easily producing a shadow

24
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:32,009
that breaks the light barrier.

25
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,659
But nothing's wrong here.

26
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,670
The rule is that information can't
travel faster than light.

27
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,719
You can't cause something to happen
somewhere else

28
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,459
faster than light could travel from you
to that somewhere else.

29
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:47,699
And our superluminal shadow is transferring

30
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,359
no information from point A to point B.

31
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,359
Sure, point B is being cast into
darkness

32
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,219
sooner than a light speed message from A could warn him it's coming

33
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,750
but darkness isn't traveling from
point A to point B.

34
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,110
It's traveling from you to point A and point B

35
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,200
at the speed of light. What we tend to call a shadow

36
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,259
is really just a cross-section of a three-dimensional region.

37
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:19,019
The darkness you are causing only changes shape

38
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,900
when newly unblocked light fills

39
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,280
the previous gap. That's all shadow is:

40
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,709
a gap. So, in a way, a shadow doesn't

41
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:31,500
travel at all. That's an illusion caused by us thinking

42
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,830
that a shadow is a physical thing, when in reality

43
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,310
a shadow is just the lack of physical things -

44
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,979
photons - which chug along at speed limit

45
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:45,549
of the universe. But that doesn't mean two shadows

46
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,969
can't kiss. Or, at least,

47
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:52,650
look like they are. Watch as Guy brings two shadows

48
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,810
near each other. Right before they actually make contact,

49
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,229
the shadows seem to magically bulge toward one another,

50
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:04,299
in a sort of smooch of darkness. What's going on is the

51
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,360
shadows blister effect and it has to do with
the anatomy of a shadow.

52
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,160
The region where an object completely blocks a light source is called

53
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:17,679
the umbra. It's the darkest part of the
shadow in the most prototypical

54
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,540
part of the shadow. Where only a portion of the light source is

55
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:26,318
blocked, we find the fainter penumbra. But as two or more penumbras

56
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:30,429
approach and overlap, the combined amount of light they block can be enough to

57
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,360
produce a perceivable difference,

58
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,940
the shadow blister. The Earth has a big

59
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:40,219
umbra, it's 1.4 million kilometres long.

60
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:44,030
That's how far away you'd have to be from
the Earth for it to no longer have a

61
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,539
large enough apparent diameter

62
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:50,859
to block out all of the sun. Here, on the
surface of Earth, we are nowhere near that

63
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,430
far away, which is why night is so umbral.

64
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,260
Night is just the Earth's shadow falling on you.

65
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:01,439
A you eclipse.

66
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,800
Sunsets are cool, they're beautiful to look at, but look
the other way

67
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,250
and you can see the lumbering shadow of our planet.

68
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,139
Our atmosphere scatters shorter
wavelengths of light

69
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:16,389
more than longer wavelengths, which makes the sky

70
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:21,310
appear blue. But in Earth's shadow there's
less light to scatter and the sky

71
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,939
appears darker. During twilight you can see

72
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:28,889
the demarcation. While driving east from
Denver to Kansas City

73
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:31,769
I got a particularly great view of it.

74
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:35,560
This is Earth's approaching night-making shadow.

75
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,160
The beautiful pink band above it? 
That's the belt of Venus.

76
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,780
It's caused by the sky reflecting the the colours

77
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:46,500
of the sunset behind us. You've probably noticed that

78
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,698
right after the sun sets, and disappears from view,

79
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:53,430
there's still light in the sky, scattered from the

80
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,038
no longer visible sun. This is what we call twilight

81
00:04:57,038 --> 00:05:00,589
and there are many different stages of
twilight.

82
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:04,628
If the sun is less than six degrees
below the horizon it's technically

83
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:10,379
civil twilight. You can still do plenty of stuff outdoors without the need for artificial lights.

84
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:13,418
Down to 12 degrees below the horizon we have

85
00:05:13,418 --> 00:05:18,209
nautical twilight: artificial lights are
more or less necessary but the sky

86
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:21,498
still scatters enough light to be bright enough for ships at sea

87
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:25,770
to navigate by seeing a contrast of the horizon between dark sea

88
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:29,908
and faintly lit sky. Down to 18 degrees

89
00:05:29,908 --> 00:05:33,498
an astronomical twilight is occurring. It looks like

90
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,699
night but the sky can still get darker. Until

91
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:41,658
astronomical twilight ends not all night time astronomical observations can be made.

92
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:44,860
Below 18 degrees is technically,

93
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:52,000
honestly, night. If you live at greater than
48.5 degrees north or south latitude,

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,100
during the summer the sun never goes more than 18 degrees below the horizon.

95
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:03,400
It's never technically night. Places like
London only reach astronomical twilight at the most

96
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:07,348
during these months.
So, if you live in one of these areas,

97
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:11,538
and you want to avoid doing something during
the summer, just tell people

98
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:15,149
you'll do it tonight. You'll buy yourself
a few weeks.

99
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:18,149
But that's slow darkness. Let's

100
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:22,538
cut to the chase because we are looking
for fast darkness.

101
00:06:22,538 --> 00:06:28,019
When scissor blades snip, the intersection
point between both blades moves faster

102
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:31,278
than the blades themselves.
Think of it this way:

103
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:35,360
if you had a pair of scissors with
blades that were a light year long

104
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,580
and it took one second to close them, the
intersection point would've traveled an entire

105
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:43,748
light year, in not a year but...

106
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:48,930
a second. No laws are being broken here
because such a snip

107
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,300
would be physically impossible. 
As I've mentioned before,

108
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,110
rigid objects don't move instantaneously all over

109
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,970
when a push force is applied to them.

110
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,699
Instead, that force moves via electromagnetic
forces, from one atom

111
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:07,439
to the next, and so on down the line.
A compression wave

112
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,999
that travels at the speed of sound
through the material.

113
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:15,599
But what if we ignored that problem by
allowing the blades to simply be separately

114
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,269
already in motion? Well, their point at
intersection

115
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:22,759
can still travel faster than light,
because it's not a physical thing.

116
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:25,899
It's just a geometric point and it carries

117
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:29,318
no more information than you could already gather

118
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:33,098
by witnessing the approaching blades.

119
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:37,180
But don't count out that geometric point of
intersection just yet. It's the key to

120
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,680
another type of darkness that can move faster than light.

121
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:46,439
When waves collide their crests can fuse into larger crests,

122
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:51,569
their troughs into larger troughs. This is
constructive interference.

123
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:54,710
But crests colliding with troughs cancel
out.

124
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:58,158
Destructive interference if these waves
are light,

125
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:02,139
the result is darkness. And, in certain
circumstances,

126
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:06,629
darkness created this way can travel like the intersection between two lines -

127
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:11,840
faster than light. Imagine these concentric
circles as waves of light.

128
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:14,739
The lines are wave crests and the
gaps in between

129
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,699
are troughs. When they meet the points
where they intersect

130
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:22,038
flee up and down faster than the waves
travel,

131
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:25,699
especially in the middle, which, in the
case of light waves, makes them

132
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:31,559
faster than light. The superluminal
speeds of these dark patches can be seen really clearly

133
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:34,570
if we make the wave crests of one source black

134
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,700
as well as the background. Overlapping
regions where red

135
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,509
peeks through represent destructive
interference -

136
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:45,000
darkness. And you can see how, especially
in the middle,

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,500
this darkness races up and down faster
than the waves.

138
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,179
In 1995 a man named McArthur Wheeler

139
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,779
robbed a bank in Pittsburgh. He was caught

140
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:01,110
because his only disguise was lemon juice.

141
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:06,230
He covered his face with it. He knew that lemon juice could be used as an invisible ink

142
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:11,289
when writing on paper, revealed by heating, and he knew so little about

143
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:15,208
why that worked and he knew so little about how cameras worked

144
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:18,539
that he assumed, with extreme confidence, that lemon juice

145
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:22,480
could make him invisible too.

146
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:27,990
Seriously. Wheeler is an extreme example

147
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,080
and was the inspiration for the Dunning-Kruger effect

148
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,800
Novices, people unskilled in particular disciplines

149
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:39,439
will often overestimate their knowledge and abilities

150
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,940
in said disciplines because they don't even know

151
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,800
how little they know, how much more there is to learn.

152
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,039
On the flip side, experts in particular field will often

153
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:54,110
underestimate their knowledge, have less
confidence in their abilities,

154
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:58,129
or think that everyone else has the
same level of knowledge that they do.

155
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,980
What drives the Dunning-Kruger effect

156
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,200
is the fact that often the more you
learn about something the more you realise

157
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:12,200
just how rich and complex and overwhelming and full of as of yet unanswered questions it really is.

158
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,360
George Bernard Shaw once famously toasted Albert Einstein by saying

159
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,459
"Science is always wrong.

160
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:23,268
It never solves a problem without creating ten more."

161
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:26,620
Einstein didn't exactly disagree. He used

162
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,528
geometry to illustrate how ignorance grows
faster than knowledge, saying

163
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:35,379
"as our circle of knowledge expands so does
the circumference

164
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:38,600
of darkness surrounding it. Learning

165
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,899
studying, shedding light on a field of
inquiry also reveals just how

166
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:48,000
in the dark we continue to be. How many
shadowy things there are left

167
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,190
for us to illuminate. The diameter of
light

168
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:54,370
never exceeds the shadowy circumference."

169
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,669
But what's the speed of that kind dark?
The speed of the growth

170
00:10:57,669 --> 00:11:02,120
of the number of things we know we are in the dark about.

171
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,460
What's the speed of ignorance?

172
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,670
If we define ignorance as the difference
between questions we know to ask,

173
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:12,078
and answers we have, the field of agnotology,

174
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,110
the study of ignorance, suggests that the amount of

175
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:19,490
things we know we are in the dark about is growing faster

176
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,629
than the amount the things we have shed light on.

177
00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:27,519
Is it a coincidence that the phrase "in
the dark" originated during of all ages

178
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,720
the age of enlightenment? 
When Leeuwenhoek put a scraping

179
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,600
from his tooth under a collection of
magnifying lenses he built,

180
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,060
he saw, for the first time in human history,

181
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:43,269
little moving creatures... microorganisms.

182
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:47,889
He called them 'Animalcules'. 
The discovery shed light on why

183
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:51,419
food spoiled life didn't spontaneously come
from old meat,

184
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,159
it was already there, we just couldn't see it.

185
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,409
But the discovery also showed us that we
were in the dark

186
00:11:57,409 --> 00:12:00,610
about an entirely new realm of biology.

187
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,960
As Philippe Bourdeau has poetically put it,
"enlightenment leads to benightedness

188
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,660
science entails nescience".

189
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:14,019
What's really cool about
the expanding size of our nescience circumference

190
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:20,500
is what Stuart Firestein, the Chair of Biological Sciences at Columbia University, has said about it,

191
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:24,669
"it is there that science begins,

192
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:28,500
where the facts run out, just beyond them."

193
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,840
He says, "it is a mistake to bob around
in the circle of facts,

194
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,259
instead of riding the wave to the
great expanse

195
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:38,889
lying outside the circle."

196
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:43,829
If science is a road trip, facts are the photos

197
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:47,698
we take along the way, the fuel that drives it forward

198
00:12:47,698 --> 00:12:51,399
is ignorance. Facts... more like

199
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:54,958
fax. Part of the past, not the way forward.

200
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,618
When it comes to understanding our world,

201
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:01,899
knowing why is obsolesce by asking why.

202
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:05,059
Knowing facts makes you bright, but the

203
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:09,099
equally quick, sometimes quicker, and most rewarding prize

204
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,920
is the dark.

205
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:15,979
And admitting that you don't know everything but that you would like to know some of it.

206
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:17,180
And as always,

207
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:18,860
thanks for watching.
