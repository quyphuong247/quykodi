00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,889
Hey, Vsauce Michael here, and I'm celebrating the holidays in my mom's basement.

2
00:00:05,889 --> 00:00:10,471
But a few days ago, MadmegzOfEpic @tweetsauce this question.

3
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:13,519
Now, at first I was like, the end of a rainbow?

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,814
Of course you can't get there, everybody knows that.

5
00:00:15,814 --> 00:00:18,314
But then I said, why?

6
00:00:18,314 --> 00:00:21,230
I mean, what would happen if I saw a rainbow

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,490
and I fired a camera bullet at the rainbow?

8
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,318
What would the footage look like?

9
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:29,904
Well, I found that in this impossible journey to a rainbow,

10
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,621
you can learn a lot.

11
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:36,081
For instance, the rainbow that you see is unique to you.

12
00:00:36,081 --> 00:00:39,424
That's right, anybody nearby will also see a rainbow,

13
00:00:39,423 --> 00:00:41,750
but their rainbow will be slightly different.

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:47,722
There's a different rainbow for everybody, and that's because rainbows  are apparent phenomenon.

15
00:00:47,722 --> 00:00:52,769
Where you are dictates where
the rainbow will appear to you.

16
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,807
Rainbows happen because sunlight behind your body

17
00:00:55,807 --> 00:01:00,399
enters into raindrops in front of you that then reflect it back into your eyeballs,

18
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,147
and there's a rainbow because
raindrops not only reflect light,

19
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,402
they also refract it.

20
00:01:06,403 --> 00:01:10,653
Refraction occurs whenever any type of wave enters a new medium

21
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,081
where its speed is changed.

22
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:16,412
In order to change speed, that
wave must change direction.

23
00:01:16,412 --> 00:01:19,754
So when white light from the sun enters a raindrop,

24
00:01:19,754 --> 00:01:22,792
it is refracted. It changes direction.

25
00:01:22,793 --> 00:01:28,055
And different wavelengths of white, which means different colors, are refracted differently.

26
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:31,600
So they get separated into what we know as ROY G BIV.

27
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:34,809
The geometry of a spherical raindrop means

28
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,141
that this spectrum of colors will only be visible to you

29
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:41,646
from a very specific angle relative to where you are,

30
00:01:41,647 --> 00:01:45,111
and that angle is about 40 to 42 degrees

31
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:48,240
from the angle of your head to your head's shadow.

32
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,200
Here is a way to think about it.

33
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,993
The spectrum of a rainbow is firing out of raindrops

34
00:01:52,993 --> 00:01:55,909
between the angle of 40 and 42 degrees.

35
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:59,795
So if you move forward, you'll just see that rainbow coming from different drops,

36
00:01:59,795 --> 00:02:05,718
except light that reflects more
than one time inside the raindrop.

37
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:07,921
Now, in order for this light to get to your eyes,

38
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:10,127
it has to reflect at a very specific angle.

39
00:02:10,127 --> 00:02:13,427
So it's only visible about 50 to 53 degrees

40
00:02:13,427 --> 00:02:17,721
from your perspective, and this my
friends, is the double rainbow.

41
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:20,393
Now again, because of spherical geometry,

42
00:02:20,393 --> 00:02:23,896
these raindrops are not going to be
able to reflect light to your eyeballs

43
00:02:23,896 --> 00:02:29,941
between 42 to 50 degrees, which means the area between a primary and secondary rainbow

44
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,781
is darker than the rest of the sky.

45
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:36,783
This area is known as Alexander's Dark Band.

46
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:39,536
Oh, and there's way more than
we could ever cover here.

47
00:02:39,537 --> 00:02:44,920
For instance, if the sun is already set, but the moon
is behind you producing enough light,

48
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,043
you can get a moon bow.

49
00:02:47,044 --> 00:02:50,132
Also cool, reflection rainbows.

50
00:02:50,132 --> 00:02:52,259
If one of these occurs with a normal rainbow,

51
00:02:52,258 --> 00:02:55,723
you'll have two rainbows that
don't line up, that aren't parallel.

52
00:02:55,723 --> 00:02:58,181
The reason is that one of these rainbows

53
00:02:58,181 --> 00:03:00,264
is not coming from sunlight behind the viewer,

54
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:04,399
but instead from sunlight reflected from the lake below.

55
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:07,812
Because you can only see a rainbow from a certain angle,

56
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:12,236
if you move your body, you will continue to see that rainbow from the same angle,

57
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:14,826
which means the rainbow will move with you.

58
00:03:14,826 --> 00:03:17,032
It will appear to be following you.

59
00:03:17,032 --> 00:03:22,873
This is particularly apparent when you're flying in an airplane, high above the ground, moving quickly.

60
00:03:22,872 --> 00:03:25,503
Now, because you're so far off the ground,

61
00:03:25,503 --> 00:03:27,920
the rainbow, which is centered around your shadow,

62
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,252
is actually 100 percent completely visible,

63
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,680
which means none of it is hiding below the horizon,

64
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:37,054
which means you see a circular rainbow.

65
00:03:37,054 --> 00:03:39,978
And as you can see, as the plan flies through the clouds,

66
00:03:39,978 --> 00:03:43,899
the rainbow continues to be in
the same apparent position.

67
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:46,610
So if I fired a bullet camera right at a rainbow,

68
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:52,739
the rainbow would not get closer; instead, it would appear to recede just as fast as the camera approached it.

69
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,778
Rainbow is a classic compound word,

70
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:59,953
a word that is made up of two or more words
that can stand on their own.

71
00:03:59,953 --> 00:04:02,584
So let's unpack these a bit beginning  with bow.

72
00:04:02,584 --> 00:04:04,829
A decorative knot.

73
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:07,247
Here are some brand new headphones.

74
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,417
They're perfectly together, everything's fine,

75
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,509
and they're perfectly straight.

76
00:04:12,508 --> 00:04:15,129
But quickly, after being in my pocket or in a backpack,

77
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,218
headphones inevitably tie themselves up into weird knots.

78
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:21,468
The same goes for Christmas
tree lights and electrical wires.

79
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:26,019
Why does that happen?  I mean, are there some kind of like weird evil elf sneaking around

80
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:28,569
when we're not looking tying wires into knots?

81
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:31,275
Maybe, but probably not.

82
00:04:31,274 --> 00:04:34,149
The answer lies in mathematics.

83
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,527
Mathematicians have jiggled strings around inside boxes

84
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:42,403
to determine not only what types of knots will randomly occur, but how often they will.

85
00:04:42,403 --> 00:04:44,790
And of course, what they found is that

86
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,041
it's much more likely for a
string to fall into a knotted position

87
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:51,006
that a relatively rare unknotted one.

88
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:53,881
Furthermore, once a string is knotted,

89
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,923
it resists being untied, which is
pretty much the definition of a knot.

90
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:03,887
So it will remain knotted and twisted up until a person comes along and unties it.

91
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,848
But what about rain?

92
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:10,730
Well, we know that rain is part of what's responsible for the visual experience of a rainbow,

93
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:15,489
but what about the ole factory sensation of rain—

94
00:05:15,488 --> 00:05:18,068
the smell of rain.

95
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:21,278
There's actually a name for the way rain smells.

96
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:23,117
It's called petrichor.

97
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:25,658
Naturalists have given the smell of rain a name

98
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:29,497
because they have found a specific cause for the smell of rain.

99
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:33,043
During dry times, plants exude in oil,

100
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:37,009
and the point of this oil is to slow down seed germination and plant growth

101
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:39,223
so they can wait until there's more water.

102
00:05:39,223 --> 00:05:42,636
But once the rain comes, this oil is washed into the air

103
00:05:42,636 --> 00:05:46,425
and we smell it, creating petrichor—the smell of rain.

104
00:05:46,425 --> 00:05:51,149
So the next time you smell rain, think about this word Petrichorand where it comes from.

105
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:54,021
You're not just smelling nature or certain plant oils,

106
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:58,822
you are smelling by definition the blood of stone,

107
00:05:58,822 --> 00:06:01,574
the blood of the earth, of the ground.

108
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:03,992
And as always, thanks for watching.
