00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,960
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And today we're going to talk about the science

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,969
of the friend zone.
You know, the experience

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,380
of liking someone and then finding out
that they would rather just be friends

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,640
with you.
Why does it happen? If there's

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,320
hope of escaping the friend zone, how can it be done?

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,230
And, more importantly, should you?

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,469
The term "friend zone" was popularized by the TV show

8
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:33,799
Friends on November 3, 1994.

9
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:36,578
In Episode 7 of the first season,

10
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:39,820
Joey tells Ross that Rachel likes him,

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,119
but will never like like him.

12
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,649
Ross is in the friend zone.
Now, of course,

13
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,140
everything turned out fine for Ross,
but we're getting ahead of ourselves.

14
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,570
Back when I calculated how much money love is worth

15
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,390
I discussed the feeling of having a crush on someone.

16
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,579
Those emotions, the nervousness,
the excitement have a name.

17
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,680
What you feel when you have a crush on
somebody is known

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,650
as limerence. It's exciting to feel
butterflies in your stomach whenever

19
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:12,939
you're around somebody

20
00:01:12,938 --> 00:01:16,029
and those butterflies may be caused by the release

21
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:20,049
of adrenaline, which pulls blood away
from things like your stomach

22
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:23,520
and toward the muscles,
where it may be better used. Of course,

23
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,109
this can cause the stomach to shut down
a bit, become upset.

24
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:30,379
It may also explain why people have a reduced appetite

25
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:33,769
when they feel love sick.
Now, whether you are

26
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:36,839
male, female, gay, straight,

27
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,079
everybody can be friend-zoned.
And, biologically speaking,

28
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:44,849
the route of the friend zone may be

29
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:48,759
Bateman's Principle.
Named after

30
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:52,569
Angus Bateman, the principle states that
whenever a species,

31
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:55,969
like us humans, contains two different sexes,

32
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:59,609
each with dissimilar sex cells, for instance,

33
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:05,599
sperm and egg, inevitably one sex will
have to commit more resources to the

34
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,368
production

35
00:02:06,368 --> 00:02:10,739
of offspring.
In mammals this is especially true.

36
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,800
A female can have only a limited number of offspring,

37
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,870
whereas a male can have a virtually

38
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,700
unlimited number.
This causes a biological tendency for

39
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:26,128
one sex to be competitive and for the other

40
00:02:26,128 --> 00:02:29,229
to be choosy.
The newest episode of

41
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:32,598
Earth Touch's "Wild Sex" goes into a lot
more detail about this,

42
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:35,679
so be sure to check it out.
But today,

43
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,189
regardless of whether or not
reproduction is the goal,

44
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:42,259
the roles of pursuer and pursued

45
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:45,840
have extended beyond the Bateman
principle and are now quite

46
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,469
hard-wired into our culture.
Because not every pursuer can win

47
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:54,930
and because not every pursuer is a terrible jerk,

48
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,200
some friend-zoning in is inevitable.

49
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:03,049
It's disappointing when it happens to
you and it's easy to rely on the

50
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,739
"nice guys finish last" excuse,

51
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:10,219
but so far research hasn't found much

52
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:13,568
evidence for it.
What's more likely is that you have

53
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:17,079
idealized the other person as a potential mate,

54
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,360
but a neutral observer could tell you that in reality

55
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,000
the two of you don't have as much
in common as you think.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,068
This is the argument put forward by Jenna Marbles

57
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:30,708
in her fantastic video.
It's called homogamy.

58
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:35,699
We select our mates based on how similar
they are to our own personalities,

59
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:40,488
interests and ideals for the future.
And so when someone is

60
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:45,049
friend-zoned, it's often not because they
were too friendly or too much of a nice

61
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:45,930
guy,

62
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,299
instead, it's often just run-of-the-mill incompatibility.

63
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:53,519
But let's not rule out being

64
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,348
too friendly or too nice from every situation just yet.

65
00:03:58,348 --> 00:04:03,530
Marshall Fine described the friend zone
as a penalty box that you're sent to

66
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,530
when your only crime is not being

67
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,650
buff or unobtainable enough.

68
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,599
Buffness falls into homogamy. It's about
what someone else's interests are and

69
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:14,988
what they want from a mate.

70
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:18,329
But what fascinates me is the part about being

71
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:21,970
unobtainable.
Why would being available

72
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,440
and present and friendly make you less attractive?

73
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:29,850
And why would being kind of a jerk, too cool,

74
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,870
aloof or hard to get make you

75
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,649
more attractive?
Well, Robert Cialdini calls this

76
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:41,870
the scarcity principle.
We desire things that are difficult to obtain,

77
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,290
because we don't like to have our freedom limited

78
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:49,500
and we act before it can be.
This happens all the time in business

79
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,899
and it's equally true when it comes to attraction.

80
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:56,049
Using the scarcity effect yourself

81
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,620
is often cited as a possible escape route
from the friend zone.

82
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,250
Make yourself less available and see if your crush

83
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,560
responds, or try using

84
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,470
the Ben Franklin effect.
Benjamin Franklin wrote about how he was able to

85
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,199
form

86
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,280
relationships with other people by asking

87
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:20,008
them to do things for him.

88
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:24,009
The theory is that by doing favors for
you cognitive dissonance occurs in the

89
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:25,319
person's mind.

90
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:28,629
Why would they be doing favors for you unless they

91
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:32,509
liked you? Now, it's no guarantee
that you'll become more than friends but just

92
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:34,030
by simply becoming

93
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:37,929
friends, you'll be doing something quite special,

94
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,918
because today, we all, on average have

95
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,709
fewer friends, fewer close individuals we can confide in

96
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:50,560
than we did decades ago.
And we hang out with those friends less

97
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,120
than we did before. This phenomenon was
explored famously by Robert Putnam

98
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,360
in "Bowling Alone."
For instance, from 1965 to 1995,

99
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,319
the number of minutes people of all ages
reported spending per day

100
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,810
with informal socializing, hanging out with friends,

101
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,269
going to parties, hanging out at bars or
having informal conversations

102
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:15,439
fell from 85 minutes

103
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,000
to just 57.
In about the same time frame,

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,910
the number of picnics held fell 60 percent.

105
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,410
And the number of times on average we
entertain friends at home

106
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,410
fell from 14 to 15 times a year

107
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,870
to a mere 8.

108
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,918
We spend more time than we used to on entertainment,

109
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,060
sleep, exercise and transportation.

110
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,060
Not bad things, but since the middle of the 20th century,

111
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,439
the two activities that many of us still
do that have decreased the most

112
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,779
are attending worship service and hanging out

113
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:55,138
with friends.
We're also now spending time on this new thing

114
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,829
called the Internet. It's a great tool for
communication and social networks,

115
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:03,609
but like T. S. Eliot said of the telephone before it,

116
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,979
the Internet may simply allow us
to speak to more people

117
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:10,810
than ever before, but be more lonely

118
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,610
doing it.
Social networks have somewhat diluted

119
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,910
the power of the word friend.
But way before MySpace or Facebook,

120
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,400
the word friend was on the way out.
So much so that we had to start using a new

121
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,620
word,

122
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,250
'best friend.'
Robert Wuthnow cautions that

123
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,709
on the Internet what feels social

124
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:35,068
may be less of a way for us to focus on actual

125
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:38,629
interpersonal relationships, and instead more of a

126
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:42,728
stage for us to focus on ourselves

127
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:46,310
in the presence of other people.
To be sure,

128
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,329
virtual communities are often more equal,

129
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:53,348
because we know less information about
our discussion partners, like age,

130
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,430
race or gender.
But what we gain from

131
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,680
anonymity often comes at the cost of an

132
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,418
evening out of interests and values.

133
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:06,459
I can retreat from real-world conversations

134
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:10,529
and hide within niche communities online,
where everyone

135
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:13,978
thinks like me and generally shares my worldview.

136
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:17,060
It's called cyberbalkanization.

137
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,240
It's when online interactions provide a lazy

138
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,050
environment, free from actual discussion
and outside views.

139
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,750
Whereas the real world often forces us
to deal with the greater diversity

140
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,620
of interests and values.
Now, because we choose mates that are

141
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,490
so similar to ourselves, this vital exposure to new,

142
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,639
honest ideas often has to come from

143
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:44,990
friends - a resource that is diminishing

144
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,750
in our society.
And so, although it's disappointing

145
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,980
to be friend-zoned, in a way it might be

146
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,820
where that other person, and all of us,

147
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,940
actually need you the most.

148
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,040
And as always,

149
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,799
thanks for watching.
