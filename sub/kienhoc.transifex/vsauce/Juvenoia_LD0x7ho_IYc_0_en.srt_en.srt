1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,919
Hey, Vsauce.

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:11,330
Michael here. Skeletons are scary and
spooky, but you know what else is?

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,769
Teenagers.

4
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:18,410
Their attitude, the way they dress and
the music they listen to. Can you even call

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:28,808
it music? Pff, kids these days. But what are kids these days? What's with all the concern and what's a generation?

6
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:34,590
Why do we think that coevals, groups of
people of roughly the same age, act so

7
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,629
much alike? The sheer number of articles
and papers and internet posts published

8
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:47,019
daily comparing then and now,
both sincerely and ironically, is astonishing.

9
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:52,530
We can't seem to get enough about kids
these days and just how different and

10
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,750
awesome it was to be a kid back in the
good old days.

11
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:02,409
Generational labels make human history
look ordered and discreet, instead of scary

12
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:07,200
and messy. They also have a delightfully
suspicious tendency to flatter

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,009
those using them. George Orwell put it well.
"Every generation imagines itself to be

14
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:18,478
more intelligent than the one that went
before it, and wiser than the one that comes

15
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,189
after it."
There's a name for this sentiment.

16
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:29,170
Juvenoia. Sociologist David Finkelhor
coined the term. It means "an exaggerated

17
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:34,420
fear about the things that influence
kids these days." Juvenoia is a

18
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:42,099
concerned disappointment that because of
iPhones or the Internet or TV or rock

19
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:47,359
music or those pesky horseless
carriages the world just isn't fit for

20
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:52,730
kids like it used to be.
Generational conflict really has been going on for

21
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:59,050
that long. After all, "honor thy [your] father and thy [your] mother" was an ancient commandant

22
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:01,189
for a reason.

23
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:05,909
In the 4th century BC, Aristotle
remarked that youths mistakes are due to

24
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:11,370
excess and vehemence, they think they
know everything. Here's an engraving from

25
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:19,000
1627 admonishing the 'now,' compared to
the ways of 'old.' In the early 1900's

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,500
Romain Rolland complained that
the new generation of young people were,

27
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:28,830
quote, "passionately in love with pleasure
and violent games, easily duped." New

28
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,940
people and the direction society is
headed in

29
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:36,719
has always been seen with some
disapproval. Xkcd famously collected a

30
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:42,819
brief history of juicy examples. In 1871,
the Sunday Magazine published a line

31
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:48,840
that may as well have been written today
about texting. "Now we fire off a

32
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,640
multitude of rapid and short notes,
instead of sitting down to have a good

33
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:59,609
talk over a real sheet of paper." And the
Journal of Education in 1907 lamented

34
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,160
that at a modern family gathering,
silent around the fire,

35
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:10,599
each individual has his head buried in
his favorite magazine. The point is there's

36
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:16,280
nothing new under the Sun. Not even the
Sun, in fact. The Sun is believed to be a

37
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,150
third generation star. This constant
cycle of generation clashing can

38
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,939
sometimes sound like a broken record.
Are these commentaries really providing

39
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:27,789
insight

40
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:33,718
into the minds of future leaders or
prematurely judging a coeval based on

41
00:03:33,718 --> 00:03:40,158
how it acts as teens? Despite the
incessant concerns otherwise, the

42
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:45,789
proverbial 'kids these days' seem to be
better off than ever before.

43
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:49,949
Drug use is down, exercising is up,

44
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:54,138
math and writing proficiency have
increased, crimes committed by young

45
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:58,540
people have decreased, hate comments
reported by children have dropped, the

46
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:02,090
number of 9th to 12th graders who have
been in fights has dropped, and the

47
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:08,378
number of teens who fear attacks at school
has dropped. But still, juvenoia

48
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:09,819
persists.

49
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,920
But why?

50
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:18,430
Well, it kinda makes sense. I mean,
children are the future of a species, so

51
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:23,660
it's reasonable to assume that nature
would select for features in a species

52
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,750
that cause adult members to prefer the
way they were raised and distrust

53
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:34,939
anything different. After all, parents, by
definition, were a reproductive success

54
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:41,050
for the species. They made new members. So
whatever choices and influences brought

55
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:46,030
them to that point must have been good
enough. Any deviation from that could be

56
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:52,489
a problem. So worrying about the young may
have been naturally selected, just like

57
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:58,269
eyes and fingers and breathing air and
pooping. But here's the thing.

58
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:04,819
Our brains don't accurately remember the
past or apply memories fairly or

59
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:11,219
rationally. That kind of thinking has a
plethora of interesting causes. First, at

60
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:16,450
a social level, concerns for and about
the youth are often exaggerated, because

61
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:21,439
exaggerating is effective.
You'll generate greater mobilization around the

62
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,399
cause if you can convince people that
we're on the cusp of a crisis here, folks.

63
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:31,500
Also, our increasingly connected world
means more potential contacts with

64
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,920
people outside the family, the tribe,
the neighborhood. Even though juvenile

65
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,759
problems often involve people the
juvenile already knows, stranger danger

66
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,959
is a more powerful fear. "My kids have
good friends, who are good influences, so

67
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:53,810
why should I worry?" can be replaced today
with "even so, people you don't know are

68
00:05:53,810 --> 00:06:00,699
threats, so worry." Other reasons for
juvenoia are personal and often it's not so

69
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:06,709
much the world that's changed, it's you.
Are drivers today really worse than they

70
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:10,849
were when you were young or do you
simply have new responsibilities and

71
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:16,770
experience that makes you more aware of
dangers that were always there? We

72
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:22,859
remember the past abstractly. There just
isn't enough room in our brains or a vital

73
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,160
need for complete voracity when
recalling things. Thus, we are more likely to

74
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,020
remember the general way we felt in the
past, without the petty annoyances, more

75
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:35,579
salient still, for the present.
Secondly,

76
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:42,859
loss aversion and the endowment effect.
People perceive a loss as greater than an equal

77
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:47,729
gain. In one famous study, when asked how
much they would pay for a coffee mug,

78
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:52,210
people gave prices that were
significantly lower than what people

79
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:56,259
given the mug first said they'd be
willing to sell it for.

80
00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:01,069
This may play a role in how we value
what we already have - our memories and

81
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:03,180
favorites - over what's new.

82
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:08,180
There's even neuroscience backing up
why new stuff seems so bad to you.

83
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:14,189
It's called the reminiscence bump.
Storage of autobiographical memories,

84
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:16,339
memories about yourself,

85
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:19,549
increases during times of change.

86
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,710
Incidentally, this is why you remember
exciting things as lasting longer than

87
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:29,539
they really did, but rarely remember
times of boredom in detail. I've

88
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:35,090
discussed before the ways in which this
causes us to feel like time slowed down

89
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:40,579
during particularly quick but
significant events. Anyway,

90
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:45,709
adolescence and early adulthood,
particularly ages 10 to 30, are major

91
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:50,229
times of change. Many important things
happened during those years that define

92
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:54,540
your identity. So, it's no surprise that
along with things that have happened

93
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,850
recently,

94
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:01,050
memories from this bump period are
greater in number and more emotional. The

95
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:06,199
books and songs and movies and slang
words and behaviour you loved and used

96
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,949
during this time

97
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:12,969
correlates quite well with what you will,
when you're older, remember the most

98
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,289
fondly.

99
00:08:14,288 --> 00:08:20,188
As we can see, juvenoia is natural.
In fact, a healthy dose of it is

100
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:24,610
important. There are plenty of things we
should be fired up about improving.

101
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:29,788
What's sometimes lost though, when
explaining that juvenoia occurs in every

102
00:08:29,788 --> 00:08:34,979
generation is the fact that the nature
of juvenoia hasn't always been the same.

103
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:42,620
The generation gap of antiquity, or of
the 1300's, wasn't the same as it is today.

104
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,279
The more rapid speed of change may be
one reason, but another is the appearance

105
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:52,929
of a new type of creature around the
turn of the last century - the teenager.

106
00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:01,680
The word teenager wasn't even used as a
stage of life until 1922. John Savage's

107
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:08,550
'Teenage' is a fantastic read on how human
society sort of accidentally invented

108
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:13,849
the teenager. You see, as factories
generated new unskilled jobs,

109
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:19,360
young people could acquire something
neat - their own money. Suddenly, marketers

110
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,870
realized that products could be made for
the youth. They were no longer stuck with

111
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:29,480
what their parents decided on. Also,
the surge in immigration at the time

112
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,259
highlighted for a new generation the view
that identity wasn't something you're

113
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:38,879
stuck with. It's fluid, personal,

114
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,669
decided. Furthermore, calls for
compulsory education around that time,

115
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:47,328
that is, making it the law that children go to school,

116
00:09:47,328 --> 00:09:51,799
further solidified the segmented
identity of children by forcing them out

117
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:57,540
of the world at large and into common
places surrounded mainly by their coevals.

118
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:01,259
In that environment they could
develop behaviors and opinions and

119
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:04,509
culture shared just with themselves.

120
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:09,578
Compulsory schooling also increased
literacy in adolescence, which gave them

121
00:10:09,578 --> 00:10:15,809
all the more power to hear stories written
for them and about them in books

122
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:18,319
they could buy with their own money.

123
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,500
Kids these days suddenly weren't just young
humans waiting for life experience, they

124
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,299
were separate beings with their own
culture and voice. A fact that caused

125
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:33,539
juvenoia to change from the edible
skirmishes of the past into the

126
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:38,699
full-fledged panics we know and love
today. This brings us to a bigger

127
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,660
question, though.

128
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:45,110
Sure, you may say, that makes sense, but
even someone who didn't grow up in this

129
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,810
society could plainly see that in the
old days

130
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:52,149
culture wasn't as dumbed down as it is today.

131
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:56,509
Things used to be made by the elites, for
the elites. Now they're made for the

132
00:10:56,509 --> 00:11:01,179
masses who demand sensational atavistic
pablum instead of rational critical

133
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:08,699
thought, like scholars, and, well, you know, me.
Those examples sure are convincing but

134
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:14,680
the plural of anecdote isn't data.
You can pick different examples and argue

135
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:19,839
the opposite point. Mozart wrote poems
about farts. There is amazing work and there

136
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,490
is simple work made at all times in
history. In fact, as Steven Johnson points

137
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:30,600
out in "Everything Bad is Good for You," if
anything, when given the chance to buy or

138
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,950
participate as they choose, the tendency
we find in humans is a preference for

139
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:42,220
more cognitive demands, for smarter
entertainment. What it takes to keep up

140
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,389
with the increasing density and
intricacies of narratives in media these

141
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,960
days

142
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,060
is impressive. To be fair, of course,
beneath the stimulating organization

143
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:54,829
there is no substance anymore, right?

144
00:11:54,830 --> 00:12:01,389
I mean, here's what one noted critic said of
today's easy brainless mass culture. "We

145
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:05,590
do not turn over the pages in search of thought,
delicate psychological

146
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:10,639
observation, grace of style, charm of
composition, but we enjoy them like

147
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,100
children at play

148
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:20,060
laughing and crying at the images before
us." Wait, sorry, that's something literary

149
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:28,139
critic G. H. Lewes wrote about Dickens in
1872. The point is, taste is subjective.

150
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:33,500
Art to 1 percent is garbage to another.
You may dislike the language or violence or

151
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,070
morals depicted on TV today, but there's
no denying the fact that entertainment,

152
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:43,600
including popular entertainment,
is requiring more and more thinking on the

153
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,080
viewers' part than ever before.
Johnson created this visual comparing narrative

154
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,680
threads in episodes of different TV
shows over time, and this shouldn't be

155
00:12:54,679 --> 00:13:01,139
surprising. Our brains crave stimulation.
A lump that sits and stares into space isn't

156
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:06,710
naturally selected form in the same way
as a brain that learns and synthesizes

157
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:12,200
and organizes. Now that entertainment can
be made for niche audiences and watched

158
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,890
and re-watched on demand and discussed ad nauseam online that natural desire can

159
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:23,250
be sated by media. Johnson goes so far
as to say that reruns have made us

160
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:28,250
smarter. They've enabled entertainment to
be made that rewards being watched and

161
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,799
thought about over and over again.
The names and stories and relationships and

162
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,569
dramas people today have to keep
straight in their heads to be

163
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:40,060
functioning consumers of modern media
are impressive by historical standards

164
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:45,589
and affect more of us than ever before.
Johnson points out that in his time

165
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:53,190
Dickens was only read by 0.25% of his
country's population, while today

166
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,250
innovative shows like 'The West Wing' or
'The Simpsons'

167
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:02,500
easily reach twenty times that
proportion. Okay, but how about this?

168
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,169
Where are the Mozart's and Dostoyevsky's
of today?

169
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:12,159
Well, they're probably here, but the
reputation of Dostoyevsky is built by time,

170
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:17,549
something the judgments of contemporary
artists haven't had enough of yet.

171
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:22,469
Finally, when it comes to judging works
that merely tease the base emotions

172
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,450
let's not forget the quote from

173
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:31,670
Unamuno I've discussed before.
"More often have I seen a cat reason than laugh or weep."

174
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:38,569
Cats and humans are curious and can
problem solve, but only humans can laugh

175
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:46,100
at fart videos. So, what really ought we be treasuring?
There's a problem here, though. Although

176
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,629
writers like Johnson have been able to
put forth convincing arguments that

177
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:55,570
movies and TV have been serving more and
more cognitive complexity, they've failed

178
00:14:55,570 --> 00:15:01,780
to find the same evidence for pop music.
Nearly all studies on the subject have

179
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:07,679
found that, unlike other forms of popular
media, pop music has, in fact, become, since

180
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:12,739
the 1950's, less complex in its
structure and more homogeneous.

181
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:18,329
Mathematically speaking,
more pop songs today sound alike

182
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:21,778
than they used to.
What's up with that, music?

183
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:28,769
Well, here's the thing. Pop music is just
one type of music being made today and

184
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:32,629
it's role, what its its listeners want from
it and who they are

185
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:37,069
are much more specific than the wider
spectrum of genres a movie theater or

186
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:42,789
Netflix caters. A pop song needs to
provoke quick mood, stick into your head

187
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:49,438
and fit anticipation and pay off into a
fairly regular amount of time. There are

188
00:15:49,438 --> 00:15:54,469
only so many ways to do that. So, perhaps,
pop music producers have simply gotten

189
00:15:54,470 --> 00:16:00,519
better at scratching the specific itch
they're challenged to scratch.

190
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:05,419
I mean, imagine criticizing doctors for using
penicillin nowadays.

191
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:08,219
Uh, back in the good old days treatment was innovative.

192
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:14,540
There were leeches and onion plasters, amputation
and good luck charms. Now it's all just

193
00:16:14,548 --> 00:16:20,188
penicillin, penicillin, penicillin.
It's all the same. Criticizing popular music

194
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:27,909
for all sounding the same ignores the
sameness of every pop song's goal. But what

195
00:16:27,909 --> 00:16:34,289
about generations? What are they exactly?
I mean, humans don't have babies all at

196
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:40,028
once every twenty years or so. New people
just keep showing up, about four more

197
00:16:40,028 --> 00:16:41,340
every second.

198
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:46,470
But that said, there are biological
changes humans go through as they grow

199
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:52,870
and age, roughly creating a few life
stages. Alright? Now, this list of

200
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:58,029
generations goes all the way back to the
mid 1400's. It applies mainly to the

201
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:02,699
western world, especially the US, and is
the work of William Strauss and Neil

202
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,910
Howe, whose landmark 1991 book
"Generations," contains one of the most

203
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:13,390
influential and ambitious generation
theories of our time. These are the guys

204
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:17,509
who coined term 'millennial,' by the way.
They set forth and have continued to

205
00:17:17,509 --> 00:17:23,789
expand a theory that society follows a
predictable cycle of moves, each lasting

206
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:28,789
about 20 years - about how long it takes
for everyone in a life stage to move on

207
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:30,089
to the next.

208
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:34,759
The social mood and the common life
stage a coeval experiences it during are

209
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:39,559
what distinguishes one generation from
the next. Strauss and Howe call each

210
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,119
social mood

211
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:46,559
a turning. A turning describes the way
society will act, by either establishing,

212
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:53,359
accepting, challenging or fracturing in
lieu of established customs. To

213
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,689
illustrate the cycle, let's start just
after the American Civil War, in the

214
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:04,110
so-called Gilded Age. Here we find
American society in the first turning,

215
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:09,539
what they call a "high." This is a twenty year
period when society is largely in

216
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:13,250
agreement about the direction it wants
to go in, because it recently

217
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:18,430
coalesced in the face of a crisis.
Institutions are strong and thus young

218
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,660
adults are cautious and conformist.

219
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:27,580
But then people tire of social
discipline and call for reform, a period

220
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:32,359
of awakening occurs. The majority
consensus is attacked in the name of

221
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:38,559
greater and broader individual autonomy.
The distrust in institutions left in the

222
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:45,519
wake of an awakening leads to the next
turning, an unraveling, where in place of

223
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:51,259
broad cultural identity, moral crusades
polarize society over what should come

224
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:52,579
next.

225
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:58,019
Finally, a renewed interest in consensus
that responds to crisis by banding

226
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:02,980
together occurs. Society's mood shifts to
a belief that coalescing and building

227
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:08,569
together are the answer. The cycle then
starts again with a high - the majority

228
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:12,970
agrees on society's directions and
institutions strengthened during the

229
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:19,049
crisis until people tire of this
majority structure and an awakening leaves

230
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:24,230
those institutions week and armed
with less public consensus. This is

231
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:28,500
followed by an unraveling, where
individuals polarize over moral issues

232
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,859
and the youth, raised in the previous two
atomizing moods,

233
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:38,539
feel alienated.
Which brings us to, well, today.

234
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:43,529
Strauss-Haus theory, if true, tells us
that this will be an era where society

235
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:48,509
will band together and build
institutions from the ground up in the

236
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:53,359
face of crisis. It's not clear what that
crisis will be, but if their theory has

237
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:59,839
predictive power, the climax of that
crisis will occur in 2025. The whole

238
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,509
theory is a great way to learn about you
as history.

239
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:06,490
Al Gore once even gave a copy of
Generations to every member of Congress.

240
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:15,049
But it is unscientific and unfalsifiable.
You can find a pattern in anything if you pick and

241
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:16,759
choose the right examples.

242
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:22,109
As for the usefulness of its
generalizations, well, Philip Bump points out that

243
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:28,579
the US Census Bureau only recognizes
one official distinguishable generation.

244
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:36,210
Baby boomers. Do you think you are a
Generation X, a millennial, Generation Z?

245
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:41,130
Well, that's fine, he says, you call yourself
whatever you want. It's all made up. The

246
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:45,920
baby boomers are a cohort, significant
in that no matter where they were born

247
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,410
or who they are,

248
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:52,820
their size alone determines a lot about
their path. But other population segments,

249
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:57,980
based solely on birth year, just don't
mean much. A more useful way to divide them

250
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:02,630
into cohorts might focus on some other less
age-related trade that correlates

251
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,190
better with behavior.

252
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,370
Wealth, region, sexuality, etc.

253
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:11,809
Regardless of its accuracy there's one
thing generational theory and its

254
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:18,899
critics do at least agree on.
People change as they age and the larger

255
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,830
society surrounding people influences
the degree to which generations feel

256
00:21:23,829 --> 00:21:29,619
conflict. So, generational thinking is a
kind of guidance.

257
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:33,829
It's one that helps take us on a journey,
manned by an ever changing and changing

258
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:39,389
crew. Some crews are different than
others, for sure, and you need worry and

259
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:45,460
concern to stay safe. But at the end of
the day, it's still the same boat and the

260
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:52,110
same waters. Generations and juvenoia
are like what Picasso said about art -

261
00:21:52,109 --> 00:21:56,599
they are lies that tell the truth.

262
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,960
And as always,

263
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,620
thanks for watching.

264
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,940
Here's a bonus. While doing research I found a website
that will allow you to find what word was

265
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:26,130
first used the year you were born. It's
pretty cool. It's also a DONG. That's right,

266
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:31,030
something you can do online now, guys.
In fact, here's some DONG news for you.

267
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:35,289
The shows that you know and love on
the Vsauce network now have their

268
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:40,649
own home, where they can flourish and be
who they want to be. The channel's name is

269
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:46,040
DONG. Go over there right now to check it
out, we've got some cool things from the

270
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:49,879
Internet. That's what DONG's all about.
It's an Internet Safari. It's neat things that

271
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:55,980
we all find as we research for these episodes.
So I'll see you over there on DONG.

272
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,940
And thanks for watching.
