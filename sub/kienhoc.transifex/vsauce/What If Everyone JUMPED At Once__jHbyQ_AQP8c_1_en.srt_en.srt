1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:06,950
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And what if every
single person on Earth jumped at the exact

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:12,190
same time? Could it cause an earthquake or
would we not even be able to tell?

3
00:00:12,189 --> 00:00:16,250
Well, first things first,
let's talk about the Earth's rotation.

4
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:21,500
The Earth spins, that's why we have night
and day, and it spins quickly. At the equator,

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,839
the Earth is spinning at more than 1,000 MPH.

6
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:31,839
Now, a spinning ice skater can speed up by
moving mass closer to the center and the

7
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:37,320
Earth is no different. In fact, if you get
down on the ground right now and move your

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,399
mass closer to Earth's center, technically,
you will speed up Earth's rotation, making

9
00:00:43,408 --> 00:00:45,149
this day shorter.

10
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,069
Now, the change that you would make to the
Earth's rotation is way smaller than we could

11
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:54,929
even measure, but it is calculable, and the
impact can be quite impressive when you talk

12
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:58,368
about redistributing more mass than just one person.

13
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:04,319
For instance, last year, the earthquake in
Japan redistributed so much of Earth's mass

14
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:11,319
towards the center, that every day since then
has been 1.8 microseconds shorter.

15
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:19,500
But that was a giant geological event. What
can us humans do to the Earth all on our own?

16
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,049
I mean, there are more than 7 billion of us
now. What if we all got together in one place

17
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:25,530
and jumped?

18
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,049
Well, what would that even look like?

19
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:33,439
Interestingly, if you took the entire human
population of Earth and had them all live

20
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,829
in one place with the same density that people
live in in New York City, you could fit everyone -

21
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:42,510
all of us - into the state of Texas.

22
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:47,099
But that's living, not standing around in
a crowd, which is how we would probably want

23
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:48,010
to do the jump.

24
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:52,109
If every single person alive right now on
Earth stood shoulder to shoulder, you could

25
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:58,219
fit all of us into the city of Los Angeles.
It would be an incredible sight to behold -

26
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:02,879
a mere 500 square miles containing
every single person on Earth.

27
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,379
Ok, so, then we jump. What happens?

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,939
Unfortunately, not much. I mean, we're all
awesome people here on Earth, but our collective

29
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:18,240
mass compared to the mass of the entire Earth?
It's like nothing.

30
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,219
In fact, Dot Physics calculated that if all
of us were to get together in one location

31
00:02:23,218 --> 00:02:28,908
and all jump 30 cm into the air at the exact
same time, we would push Earth away from us

32
00:02:28,908 --> 00:02:31,228
a tiny amount.

33
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:37,868
Earth would only move away from us about 1/100th
of the width of a single Hydrogen Atom. And

34
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:43,479
here's another thing. Because we're all jumping
and then going back to where we started, Earth

35
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:45,718
is just going to move back to where it started.

36
00:02:45,718 --> 00:02:52,138
So, our big jump won't be able to change Earth's
position in space, but, c'mon, 7 billion people

37
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,829
all jumping together? That's gotta be able
to cause some sort of seismic activity, right?

38
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:00,900
So let's say you have a lot of people all
together in one place and you have them all

39
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,640
jump on: 1-2-3!

40
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:09,259
Did you feel that? Well, the BBC did this
with 50,000 people and discovered that a

41
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:14,528
kilometer and a half away, it only registered
a .6 on the Richter scale. You would need

42
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:20,590
7 million times more people than even live
on Earth right now to jump at once to recreate

43
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,759
the earthquake that recently happened in Japan.

44
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:28,399
So, even though we're all awesome, compared
to the size of the Earth, we're not much.

45
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,480
But don't get too discouraged. Our collective
jump would contain a lot of energy. The Straight

46
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:38,079
Dope calculated that even if only the people
who lived in China got together and jumped,

47
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:45,080
their jump would be the equivalent of 500
tons of TNT. Of course, 500 tons of TNT doesn't

48
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:52,300
do much to an Earth that weighs
6 sextillion 588 quintillion tons.

49
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,359
To make yourself feel more powerful, pick
a card. I've got 10 of them here, let's say,

50
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:06,259
hmmm, you choose this one. Boom, congratulations,
we have just decimated this deck of cards.

51
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:11,899
Why? Well because, technically, decimate does
not mean "obliterate completely."

52
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:19,800
Deci=10. It means to take away 1/10th of something.
So, the next time you take a quiz and don't

53
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:26,680
do so well on it, you only get 10%. Well, sure,
that's an "F", but by getting 10% of them

54
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:30,110
right, you DECIMATED that quiz.

55
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,990
And since we've been talking about crowds,
let's talk about YouTube crowds. YouTube audiences,

56
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,810
that view count that you see at the bottom
of every video, and get some perspective on

57
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,480
it.

58
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,080
We'll being with Dunbar's Number.

59
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:48,519
It's an estimation of the maximum number of
people we can have stable, social relationships

60
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:53,359
with at a given moment
and it's based on the size of our neo-cortex.

61
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,040
These aren't just acquaintances, these are
people you have social contact with - a network

62
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,960
where you know how everyone relates to everyone
else. And the number is usually given to be

63
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:10,879
somewhere between 100-230, which means that when
a YouTube video receives more than 230 views

64
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:15,699
from different people, more people have seen
that video than you could ever realistically

65
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:18,500
hope to know well, at a given moment.

66
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,180
If a video has more than 100,000 views from
different people, more people have seen that

67
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:31,319
video than you will ever meet in your life.
And by meet, I mean shakes hands with, learn

68
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:33,060
their name, talk with them for a bit.

69
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,639
I mean, think of it this way. You and me,
we're only statistically expected to live

70
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:47,060
around 28,470 days. So, even if you were to meet
someone, 2-3 people every day of your life,

71
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,139
including when you were a baby, you still
wouldn't meet as many people as have seen

72
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:54,189
that YouTube video with 100,000 views.

73
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,600
But keep this in mind. Even though you, or
even a large group of us, can't do much to

74
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,900
change Earth's location or rotation, we can
affect it a little bit. Newton's Third Law

75
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:11,419
guarantees this. If you weigh 150 pounds,
the Earth is pulling you down with a force

76
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:19,080
of 150 pounds. But you are also pulling up
on the Earth with a force of 150 pounds.

77
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:24,639
If you fall 3 meters, the Earth has pulled
you down 3 meters. But you have also exerted

78
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,300
a equal and opposite force on the Earth.
Of course, it's a lot bigger. So, if you fall

79
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:35,480
3 meters, you pull the Earth up about a billionth
of the width of a proton, which ain't bad.

80
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,920
So the next time you move your body, the next
time you jump, Felicia, think about this.

81
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:46,319
You just affected the Earth as much as it
affected you. You've got that kind of power.

82
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,139
Speaking of power, you all should go check
out "Geek & Sundry", Felicia's new channel.

83
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:52,120
It's one of my new favorite things.

84
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,340
And as always,

85
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:56,339
thanks for watching.
