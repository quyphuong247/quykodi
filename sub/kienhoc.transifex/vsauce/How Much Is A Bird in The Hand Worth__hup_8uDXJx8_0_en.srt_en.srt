00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,149
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And as they say, "a bird in the hand

2
00:00:08,148 --> 00:00:11,199
is worth two in the bush."
What it means

3
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:15,009
is that it's better to have a certain advantage

4
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:18,230
than to have nothing, except the possibility

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,260
of a greater one.
But two birds in the bush?

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,790
Who calculated that?
What really is the value

7
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:27,980
of a bird in the hand?
Well, according to Julian Baggini,

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,240
a bird in the hand is technically worth

9
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,320
2.48 birds in the bush.

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,359
He calculated that number by looking at

11
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:41,178
observations from studies of what psychologists call

12
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:46,198
loss aversion. Loss aversion is a name
given to the tendency we humans have

13
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:50,429
to more strongly prefer to avoid losing
something we have

14
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:54,890
than to gain something that we don't. 
In general, it's been shown that if someone

15
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,658
loses

16
00:00:55,658 --> 00:00:59,079
a hundred dollars, they lose more satisfaction

17
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:02,509
than someone who receives a hundred dollars acquires.

18
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:06,539
Researchers have been able to get more
granular with loss aversion.

19
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:10,420
In one study, they gave half of the
participants something nice, like a fancy

20
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,149
mug,

21
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:14,180
and the other half they gave nothing.
Then

22
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,880
they asked the people
with mugs to come up with a value

23
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:21,530
for the mug were they to sell it and
never have it again.

24
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,180
They also asked the people who never got
a mug how much they would be willing to

25
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:25,618
pay

26
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:29,039
to have a mug.
Now, the people who would never had one,

27
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:34,278
estimated that the value of the muh
would only be about $2.87

28
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:38,259
But those who did have the mug and knew that
they would never have it again if they

29
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:38,920
sold it

30
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,829
estimated its value to be about
two-and-a-half times larger,

31
00:01:42,828 --> 00:01:47,368
around 7 dollars.
So, according to the evidence, in a general sense

32
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:51,500
having is actually slightly more than twice as good

33
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,228
as not having.
But why just cover that aphorism?

34
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:59,299
Let's talk about some other literary
terms, because our language can do some

35
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:00,368
pretty funny things

36
00:02:00,368 --> 00:02:04,060
and those things it does have specific
names. Let's begin

37
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,289
with the blind date murderer.
A meme

38
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:10,509
people create that starts off all scary
and frightening,

39
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:13,988
but then turns out to actually be nice
and cuddling. For instance,

40
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:18,340
I'm going to rip off your face...book
status, you are so funny!

41
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,289
I'm gonna cut you... out some coupons for
that pizza place you like.

42
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,780
If you struggle, it'll only make it worse...
according to this fascinating article

43
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,289
I'm sending you about quicksand.

44
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:32,359
Many other memes use a similar structure
and the reason it's funny

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,790
is that it's an example of what is known
as paraprosdokian.

46
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:39,469
A paraprosdokian is a sentence or
phrase you can use

47
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:42,930
that begins one way,
leading people to think a certain thing,

48
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,670
but then, in the second half, completely
reverses or in some way changes

49
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:50,429
that initial opinion.
I will eat your baby...

50
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,390
carrots if you don't want them.
Syntactic ambiguity

51
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:57,679
is when you can't figure out exactly
what a sentence means,

52
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,019
because the order of the words doesn't
help. It frequently occurs in newspaper

53
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:03,129
headlines.
For instance,

54
00:03:03,128 --> 00:03:07,699
"Police Help Dog Bite Victim."
Well, did the police help a person

55
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:11,589
who'd been bit by a dog or did the
police help a dog

56
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,759
bite a victim?
"Free Hat!" Are you giving away hats for free

57
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:20,018
or are you trying to get a guy named Hat out of jail?

58
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:24,120
Lexical ambiguity, in my opinion,
is often more fun.

59
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,099
This happens when a word has multiple
meanings and figuring out which one is

60
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:29,609
being used in a sentence

61
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,579
is a challenge. The word "buffalo" can mean
a number of different things.

62
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:39,579
It's the name of an animal, the name of a
city and it can also be a verb,

63
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:42,950
which means to bully or confuse or baffle,

64
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:48,408
as in "Hm, this video buffalos me."
I tweeted about this a few months ago.

65
00:03:48,408 --> 00:03:51,500
Because "buffalo" has those three meanings,

66
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,930
it is possible to make it completely sensical

67
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,968
and correct, legitimate sentence using

68
00:03:57,968 --> 00:04:02,530
only the word "buffalo."
Buffalo buffalo

69
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,610
Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo."

70
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,818
You have to think about it for a long time
for it to make sense,

71
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:13,128
but what it's really saying is that bison
from the City of Buffalo,

72
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:16,689
that bison from the City of Buffalo bully

73
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:21,149
also happened to bully other bison from
the City of Buffalo.

74
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:25,349
Tongue twisters.
All I have to say here is that the "she"

75
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,229
inside "she sells seashells by the
seashore" is an actual

76
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:33,719
"she," not just some random girl.
"She" most likely refers to Marry

77
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,860
Anning, a British paleontologist who
collected fossils from beaches nearby

78
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,530
where she lived her entire life

79
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:43,758
and discovered the very first Ichthyosaur's skeleton

80
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,020
when she was only 12 years old.
Now it's time for my favorite literary term,

81
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:52,750
tmesis. This word is great because you
get to spell it with the "T"

82
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,519
and then an "M," and no vowel in between.
Tmesis is a figure of speech

83
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,668
when you stick a word inside another
word. For instance,

84
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:05,389
why say "absolutely,"
when you could say "abso-freakin-lutely?"

85
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:08,900
And why say"you're welcome,"
when you could say "you're wel-diddly-elcome?"

86
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:12,219
And of course, "legend... wait for it...

87
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,770
dary."
Finally, a spoonerism

88
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:18,810
is a specific type of verbal mistake

89
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,689
where you switch the first two letters
of two words.

90
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:27,180
Many of us do this occasionally, but it's
named after William Archibald Spooner,

91
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,850
a reverend who did this a lot.
For instance,

92
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,280
instead of saying that the Lord is a
loving Shepherd, he would tell everybody

93
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,429
that the Lord

94
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,009
is a shoving leopard.
He would get his "merds wixed up."

95
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:42,500
One of my favorite, however,
comes from Sarah Palin.

96
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,560
When you spoonarise her name,
she becomes Parah Salin.

97
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:47,960
And as always,

98
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,359
wanks for thatching.
