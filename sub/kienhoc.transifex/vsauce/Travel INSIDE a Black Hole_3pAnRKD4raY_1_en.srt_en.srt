1
00:00:00,489 --> 00:00:07,668
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And today we are
going to go inside a black hole. It's not

2
00:00:07,668 --> 00:00:13,208
going to be comfortable, but it will be pretty
fun. Now, first thing's first: mathematically

3
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:19,059
speaking, anything could become a black hole,
if you were to compress it into a small enough

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,839
space. That's right, you, me, this camera -
everything in the unvierse has what is known

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,960
as a "Schwarzschild radius." A tiny, tiny amount
of space that, were you to collapse the entire

6
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:38,250
mass of the object into, its density would
be so great that its gravitational pull would

7
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:45,119
be so great that not even light could escape
from it. You would have a black hole.

8
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,280
If you were to compress Mount Everest into
something smaller than a nanometer, you would

9
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,270
have a black hole. And if you were to compress
the entire Earth down to the size of a peanut,

10
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,780
you would have a black hole.

11
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,530
But, fortunately for us, there is no known
way to compress Everest or Earth in that fashion.

12
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:09,858
But a star, many, many, many times larger
than our own Sun, has a much larger Schwartzchild

13
00:01:09,858 --> 00:01:15,569
radius, and when it runs out of fuel and can
no longer keep itself hot enough, it collapses

14
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:20,879
to a single, infinitesimally-small point known
as a "singularity."

15
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,468
Its density will be infinite and so its
gravitational pull will be so strong that

16
00:01:25,468 --> 00:01:29,078
nothing can escape, not even light.

17
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:34,839
But enough about ways black holes form, let's
jump into one. First question: what would

18
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,840
it look like from the outside? Well, we know
that gravitational fields bend space and time.

19
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,840
Stars behind our Sun will actually appear
to be in slightly different locations from

20
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:52,459
Earth, because the Sun's gravitational field
bends the light coming from those stars.

21
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:57,578
When it comes to the gravitational fields
of larger objects, like entire galaxies or,

22
00:01:57,578 --> 00:02:02,548
for that matter, a black hole, the effect
is even nuttier. Light coming from object's

23
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,850
behind them is significantly distorted,
producing smears and smudges.

24
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:13,969
As seen from Earth, the blue galaxy behind
this red galaxy is completely distorted, like

25
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:19,300
a fun house mirror. So, rather than appearing
as it really should, it looks to us like a ring -

26
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,420
a smudge all the way around the red galaxy.

27
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:28,239
This is known as "gravitational lensing."
Now, take a look at this simulation of a black

28
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,200
hole with a galaxy millions of lightyears
behind it. The galaxy's really not in danger

29
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:39,189
of the black hole's "suck," but the light
coming off of that galaxy certainly is. Watch

30
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:45,550
as the galaxy passes behind the black hole
and its light is contorted, twisted and

31
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,280
distorted.

32
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,639
Now here's a really fun demonstration.

33
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:54,679
What if the Earth were to orbit around a black
hole? Looking from the outside, the Earth

34
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:58,909
would look normal at first, but as soon as
it passed behind the black hole, the black

35
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:02,900
hole's gravitational field would warp the
light reflecting off the Earth, producing

36
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,200
this.

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,879
For the sake of simplicity, let's jump into
a simple black hole, one that doesn't have

38
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:14,639
a charge and isn't moving. And, also, isn't
already sucking up a bunch of matter. So it's

39
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,559
just there on its own.

40
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,439
As we approach, the distortion of the sky
grows greater and greater. A larger and larger

41
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:28,250
portion of our field of view looking forward
into the black hole will be filled with darkness.

42
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,680
At this point, where half of our field of
view has been swallowed up in darkness, we

43
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,260
have reached the "Photon Sphere."

44
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:40,359
At this point, light is not going to necessarily
get sucked into the black hole, but it doesn't

45
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:46,620
necessarily leave it either. Instead, at this
magical point in space, light, photons, can

46
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,480
actually orbit the black hole.

47
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,560
If you were to stop here for a moment and
look to the side, you could theoretically

48
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,590
see the back of your own head, because light
reflecting off the back of your head would

49
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,879
travel all the way around the sphere of the
black hole, right back to your face.

50
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:10,650
A gravitational field not only warps space,
it also warps time. Now, for most intensive

51
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,189
purposes here on Earth, we never have to worry
about that. But near a black hole, gravity

52
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:19,918
would be so strong that an observer standing,
watching you jump into the hole, would see

53
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:25,370
something quite strange. They wouldn't see
you get sucked quickly into the hole. Instead,

54
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:31,509
they would see your approach become slower,
and slower, and slower, until you reached

55
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:35,009
a point known as the event-horizon.

56
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:41,319
This is a point in space where, once crossed,
there's no going back. It is at that point

57
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:46,569
that light can no longer escape. And, so,
to a person watching you fall into the hole,

58
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:51,740
that would be where your journey ended. You
would seem almost frozen in space, the light

59
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:58,280
coming off your body becoming increasingly
red-shifted until you simply faded into nothingness.

60
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:02,419
They would never see you cross the event-horizon.

61
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,500
But for you, of course, everything would seem
fine and dandy. You would continue pass

62
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:11,439
that horizon to your now, inevitable, death.
As you continue to approach the black hole's

63
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:16,389
singularity, your view of the entire universe
would get compressed into a smaller and smaller

64
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:18,310
point in space behind you.

65
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,968
If the black hole we're jumping into was large
enough, things actually might be quite comfortable

66
00:05:22,968 --> 00:05:27,360
at that event horizon. We'll know that we're
never going to escape and that our lives are

67
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,919
pretty much over, but it might take us hours
to actually reach a point where things started

68
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:33,060
to hurt.

69
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,389
Why would they hurt? Well, the closer you get
to the singularity, the more significant the

70
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:42,560
difference in gravitational pull is across
space. And, so, parts of me that are closer

71
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,370
to the singularity would be pulled more strongly
than parts that were facing away and my entire

72
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:54,370
body would be stretched toward the singularity.
The effect would be so incredible, scientists

73
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,889
don't usually call it stretching, they call
it "Spaghettification."

74
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:04,050
Once you reach this point, you would be dead.
Your molecules would be violently ripped and

75
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:09,650
stretched apart, and when they got to the
singularity, well, we don't really know what

76
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:14,198
would happen. Perhaps they would completely
disappear in violation of all the laws of

77
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:19,110
physics or maybe they would reappear elsewhere
in the universe. It is believed that a moving

78
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:24,770
or spinning black hole might actually create
what is known as a "wormhole," a way of transitioning

79
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:30,120
across space faster than light. Not in any
way that violates the laws of science, but

80
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,319
in a way that takes advantage of the universe's
dimensions.

81
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:38,959
For instance, if I wanted to get from this
point to this point, I'd have to travel the

82
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:45,959
distance. But, theoretically, a wormhole would
do something really crazy. For instance, this.

83
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:49,758
Now, the two points are right next to each
other and I can travel between them almost

84
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,199
instantaneously.

85
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:56,639
But, again, this is all theoretical. Luckily,
we do have a possible way of analyzing black

86
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,779
holes right here on Earth. Enter the "Dumbhole."

87
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:07,979
Just as a black hole does not permit light
to escape, a Dumbhole is an acoustic black

88
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:14,879
hole. It won't allow sound to escape. It doesn't
have to be nearly as powerful and scientists

89
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:20,968
have been able to create Dumbholes in laboratories
using special fluids traveling at the speed

90
00:07:20,968 --> 00:07:21,579
of sound.

91
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:26,180
A lot of progress still needs to be made in
the world of acoustic black holes, but we

92
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,848
may be able to learn an amazing amount of
information about how black holes work by

93
00:07:30,848 --> 00:07:33,569
looking at how sound is treated in a Dumbhole.

94
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:39,278
Now here's another good question: What would
it look like to travel at the speed of light,

95
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:44,338
say, toward the Sun? Well, surprisingly, you
wouldn't just see the Sun immediately rush

96
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:50,918
up toward you. No, no, no. In fact, initially,
it would look almost as if the Sun were receding

97
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:57,378
away from you. Why? Because your field of
view would vastly increase in size. You would

98
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:01,338
be able to see stuff almost behind you. 
And here's why.

99
00:08:01,338 --> 00:08:05,788
As you sit there, not moving yet, looking
at the Sun, there's light coming from stuff

100
00:08:05,788 --> 00:08:11,509
behind you. But, if you travel the speed of
light, you will actually reach that light

101
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:16,598
coming from things behind you. As you reached
light speed, your field of view would expand

102
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:19,649
like this, concentrating the stuff in the
middle.

103
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:26,598
But where are you in the universe? Or, here's
a better question. Where is the center of

104
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:32,439
the universe? Well, this might sound crazy,
but it's everywhere. This is known as the

105
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,199
"Cosmological Principle." No matter where
you are in the universe, everything else will

106
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:42,809
seem to be moving away from you, expanding,
at the same rate.

107
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:47,149
The universe is expanding, but not like a
balloon getting bigger with all the people

108
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:52,698
inside it. Instead, it's as if we are the
surface of a balloon. If you were to put a

109
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:56,659
bunch of dots on a balloon and then blow it
up, all the dots would move away from each

110
00:08:56,659 --> 00:09:01,719
other at the same rate. And, on the surface
of the balloon, there is no center.

111
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,480
Take a look at these two layers. They are
exactly similar, except the top layer represents

112
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,680
a 5% expansion of the bottom layer.

113
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,698
Let's say that you live on one of these dots,
and you want to measure where everything is

114
00:09:14,698 --> 00:09:20,889
moving away from. Well, watch what happens
when I line up a dot in the past and the present.

115
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:29,519
Boom. It looks like the center of the expansion.
I can do this with any dot. As soon as I choose

116
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,429
a dot to be the frame of reference, it immediately
becomes the center of the expansion.

117
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:41,758
So, while dying in a black hole would be lonely,
and scary, and morbid, when you look up into

118
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,500
the sky think instead about this. No matter
where you are, or who you are, or what your

119
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:53,500
friends or your parents, you really,
scientifically, are the center of the universe.

120
00:09:54,879 --> 00:10:01,879
Finally, what if our universe was a googolplex
meters across? It is nowhere near that large.

121
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:07,889
But, if it was, it would be so voluminous
that, statistically, it would be nearly impossible

122
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:14,620
for there not to be an exact copy of you somewhere
else out there in the universe. To see why,

123
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,750
I highly suggest that you click right there
and check out Brady Haran's new channel "Numberphile."

124
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,429
It's part of the YouTube original channel's,
and I've worked with these guys before. They're

125
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:27,750
amazing, they're my favorite kind of geeks.
So, check out that video, watch their other

126
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,929
stuff, and if you like math,
I highly suggest that you subscribe.

127
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,980
And as always,

128
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,460
thanks for watching.
