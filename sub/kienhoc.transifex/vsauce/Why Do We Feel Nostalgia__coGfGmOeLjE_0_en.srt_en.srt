00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:03,740
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
Music.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,640
Why does music make us feel the way it does?

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:10,669
Why does music make us wanna move?

4
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:15,530
And why do songs sometimes gets stuck in our heads?

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,460
James May, from the YouTube channel Head Squeeze,

6
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:24,960
thanks for the music. Pleasure.
Why can music bring back memories?

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,990
That is a very good question actually.
I've often wondered why it has this power

8
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:32,929
actually to unlock a completely dormant
memory, something that's gone as far as you

9
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:33,460
know

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,808
and then it chooses, usually a pop tune
from say ten or twenty years ago,

11
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:41,759
bang, there you are, wherever you were at the time.
Sometimes it's positive,

12
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:43,169
sometimes it's negative,

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:49,210
but what is nostalgia?

14
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,170
Well, it turns out that nostalgia and

15
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,530
feeling emotions because of music and dancing

16
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,689
and getting songs stuck in your head

17
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:01,729
all orbit around a common theme.

18
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:05,978
Your identity.
Because, really, physically speaking,

19
00:01:05,978 --> 00:01:09,700
who are you? Every single day

20
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,070
you are losing atoms and gaining new ones
from what you eat and drink.

21
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:17,789
It takes about five years to replace
every atom in your body,

22
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,899
which means that the matter that we call you today

23
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:26,439
was not part of you five years ago.
If we speed the process up we start to see

24
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,228
that your physical body,

25
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:31,590
really all of us, every human on earth,

26
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,899
is just a temporary group of atoms and
molecules that, nonetheless,

27
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:40,269
keep the same name the whole time.
Now this is what we think of when we think

28
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:41,289
of our bodies,

29
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:44,519
but to an alien, who could track individual atoms,

30
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,699
and only saw maybe a few frames per decade,
you would appear to be what you really

31
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,890
are.
A bunch of incoming atoms,

32
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,509
making your shape and then leaving.

33
00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:01,728
So, what's consistent here?
What are you?

34
00:02:01,728 --> 00:02:05,890
Nostalgia, fondly remembering the past, what you

35
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,618
used to do and who used to be might
simply be a way for your brain

36
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:15,469
to answer that question or at least cool
down the anxieties it causes.

37
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:19,270
Because even at a macroscopic scale,
you are always changing.

38
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:23,090
You have different friends,
different behaviors, different moods, different

39
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,770
tastes

40
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,950
all the time.
If you grew up

41
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:31,068
in the 80s, and by that I mean 1680s,

42
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:34,369
it would have been possible to have been
nostalgic for a time

43
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,819
before the word nostalgia existed.

44
00:02:37,818 --> 00:02:41,939
That's because in 1688 Johannes Hofer coined the term

45
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:45,439
by combining the Greek words for returning home

46
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:52,430
and pain. Nostalgia was originally seen
as a quite serious medical condition,

47
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,540
affecting soldiers who missed home so much

48
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:59,359
that they broke down and were unable to
fulfil their duties.

49
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,500
The only cure, as Hofer saw it, was to

50
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,710
be sent home, to your home,

51
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,909
because nostalgia is really all about you.

52
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:13,789
Your memories, your past, who you used to be

53
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:19,519
and consequently who you are now, which
makes nostalgia an often healthy way to

54
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,760
answer the question

55
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:26,750
'who am I?' Well, you're a person who
remembers specific events in the past.

56
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,490
You existed in the past and are a continuous

57
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:35,990
being. A popular theory argues that the
psychological effects of nostalgia,

58
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,969
connecting with your younger self and
building a continuous

59
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:44,759
identity, are advantageous,
and so we're naturally selected to be

60
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:47,949
rewarding experiences.
You change

61
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:52,099
your habits, your friends, your job,
you learn things and forget things,

62
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:55,359
but nostalgia allows you to connect all of those

63
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,280
events, which is especially helpful
during times of major life

64
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,550
transitions, like

65
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,880
entering adulthood or aging,
when study showed that nostalgia

66
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,269
is at its strongest. But if tucking in
and lining up all of your life experiences into

67
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,650
a continuous story

68
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,090
is so advantageous, why don't we feel nostalgic for

69
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,839
everything in the past?
Why don't you feel nostalgia for

70
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,159
what happened one minute ago?
Why don't you feel nostalgic for the way this

71
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,889
video began?
Well, the lifespan retrieval curve

72
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:35,019
might offer some clues. It's an average plot of distinct autobiographical memories

73
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:38,068
and it reveals what is called the reminiscence

74
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:43,699
bump. A time between 15 and 30 years of
the age, where more memories are encoded.

75
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:47,210
This time in your life, both while you
are living it and later,

76
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:51,529
is thought to be important because it's
so linked to the formation of our

77
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:55,000
self-identities.
Memories formed during that bump

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,660
tend to be the ones we are most nostalgic for

79
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,889
and because we want our continuous
identities to be positive,

80
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:06,079
we tend to be nostalgic for good memories,

81
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:09,459
not bad ones.
Individually and collectively we also tend to be

82
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:11,359
nostalgic and reminisce

83
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,610
on things as if they were better than at the time they

84
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,210
really were.
Twenty years after leaving his hometown

85
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:21,978
Abraham Lincoln returned to it and
looking upon it remembering it

86
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:23,449
nostalgically,

87
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:27,860
he wrote these lines of poetry.
"My childhood's home

88
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,908
I see again and saddened with the view

89
00:05:30,908 --> 00:05:34,990
and still as memory crowds my brain,
there's pleasure

90
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,490
in it too."
Abraham Lincoln might seem like

91
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:43,129
a quite ancient person,
someone from way back in history.

92
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:46,389
But here's some perspective.
On February 9,

93
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:52,129
1956, a date within the lives of some of
our parents and many of our grandparents,

94
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:55,400
this old man appeared on the television show

95
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:58,968
"I've got a secret."
What made him so special?

96
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:02,759
Well, he was Samuel J. Seymour,

97
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,809
an eyewitness.
Goodnight, Mr. Seymour.
How old are you by the way, Sir?

98
00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:11,849
Ninety six.
Ninety six years old.

99
00:06:11,848 --> 00:06:15,308
He was allive and in attendance at
Ford's Theatre

100
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:19,629
on the very day Abraham Lincoln was assassinated.

101
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,278
And he was alive recently enough to have
appeared on national

102
00:06:23,278 --> 00:06:27,639
television.
Music doesn't have to bring up old memories or

103
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,699
make you feel nostalgia in order to help
you build an identity.

104
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:35,778
Lawrence Parsons in a great interview
discusses the fact that babies

105
00:06:35,778 --> 00:06:40,668
from about six months to one-year
clearly respond to all kinds of

106
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:41,188
different

107
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:45,189
rhythms and chords when only a single note or beat

108
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:48,759
is out of place.
But after one year

109
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:53,038
babies tend to only respond to rhythms and chords

110
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,759
from their own culture, from the world around them.

111
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,229
This makes sense when you consider just
how important it is for our brains to

112
00:07:00,228 --> 00:07:02,218
not only construct a continuous

113
00:07:02,218 --> 00:07:06,939
individual identity, but a continuous
identity within the groups

114
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:10,710
that we belong.
We don't always get along with or

115
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:15,728
understand other people, but when two
people listen to and respond to

116
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:20,378
music, their feelings and emotions can
become more similar than if they were to

117
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:21,490
merely sit

118
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,978
in silence or use words with no rhythm.

119
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:29,490
So, although we are still not exactly
sure why music makes us wanna move,

120
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,598
the desire you have, the impulse you
have to tap your foot or

121
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,889
bob your head or, if confident enough, dance

122
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:40,968
when you hear a rhythm might have less
to do with the behavior you have learned

123
00:07:40,968 --> 00:07:45,748
and more to do with your internal desire

124
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:51,009
to fit it. And as a consequence of our
impressive ability to communicate and be

125
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:51,869
social

126
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:55,610
it even happens when you are alone or
when you want to

127
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,348
dance as if no one is watching.
Speaking of dance,

128
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:03,838
William Michael Brown motion captured
good and bad dancers so he could render

129
00:08:03,838 --> 00:08:05,838
them into digital stick figures

130
00:08:05,838 --> 00:08:09,069
and remove all clues as to their fitness
or looks or health.

131
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:12,729
Now, figures with symmetric movement, 
what we might call

132
00:08:12,728 --> 00:08:17,038
good dancing, were consistently rated
as more attractive

133
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,568
and more desirable as mates.

134
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:25,468
But this may have less to do with music
being some special human behavior

135
00:08:25,468 --> 00:08:29,149
and more to do with communication in general.

136
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:33,429
Sharing a musical experience with
someone else might just be an extreme

137
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,009
form

138
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:37,750
of the communication skills that were
naturally selected into us,

139
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,649
so that we could understand each other,
understand a motion from tone of voice

140
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:46,210
and listen.
Sweet, fatty foods

141
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:50,470
taste good because they signal our brain
that they are full of energy.

142
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,700
Energy that we need to survive.
This is why

143
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,520
cheesecake tastes so incredible.
But it doesn't mean that

144
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,579
cheesecake is necessary for survival.

145
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,020
Music might be the same way.
A happy accident of

146
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:08,659
the communication skills we developed
but fundamentally

147
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:14,278
an unnecessary one or, as cognitive
scientist Steven Pinker famously called it,

148
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:18,789
acoustic cheesecake.
If not properly chewed

149
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:23,019
a bite of cheesecake can get lodged in your throat.

150
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:26,639
But a short repetitive song can get lodged

151
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,459
in your brain.
It's called an ear worm.

152
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:34,349
At best it means that the song is catchy.
At worst

153
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,589
it means replaying over and

154
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:40,730
over and over again the same song in
your head

155
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,870
until you are annoyed.
According to research by James Kellaris,

156
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,948
nearly all of us experience ear worms.

157
00:09:47,948 --> 00:09:52,078
Men and women experience them equally as
often but for reasons we don't quite

158
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:53,549
understand yet

159
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:57,689
ear worms tend to last longer for and be more irritating

160
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,699
to women.
Repetitive rhythms make a song

161
00:10:01,698 --> 00:10:06,528
easier to reproduce in our heads and
unusual time signatures

162
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:11,350
or unresolved or incomplete musical ideas.

163
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:16,278
bother us. Perhaps because we strive to
communicate completely and clearly

164
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:20,970
so we fixate on these little snippets of
songs, replaying them over and over again

165
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,970
in our heads, hoping to resolve them,

166
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,850
which, of course, they don't, meaning that
they are quite literally a

167
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,769
cognitive itch.
An itch that that just gets worse

168
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:34,528
by being scratched.
Our inability to suppress

169
00:10:34,528 --> 00:10:38,419
a simple thought, like the famous 
"quick, whatever you do,

170
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:42,409
don't think of a pink elephant" or

171
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:46,289
the game or a song stuck in your head

172
00:10:46,289 --> 00:10:49,969
might be explained by ironic process theory.

173
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,069
The idea that in our brains there are
two different processes going on.

174
00:10:54,068 --> 00:10:57,559
One, which consciously controls what we think about

175
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:00,869
and the other unconsciously monitoring

176
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:05,639
what we are thinking about.
They share an equal amount of cognitive effort and

177
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,209
they're always in balance and so more
effort put into monitoring

178
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:13,258
what you're thinking about means that
there's less left to actually control

179
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:14,970
what you think about.

180
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,310
Spending that cognitive effort on some
other task that uses working memory like

181
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:20,338
Sudoku or

182
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:24,750
anagrams can often help get
an ear worm out of your head.

183
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:29,149
You can always just replace the ear worm
with another one, using a service like

184
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:32,578
Unhear it[.com].
Ear worms are annoying,

185
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:36,559
but music has the power to conjure up
all kinds of other emotions

186
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:41,758
when we hear it. A major reason for this
is the fact that, like our sense of smell,

187
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,050
music is initially processed in the same
regions of the brain that process

188
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:49,458
memories and emotion, like the amygdala.

189
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,838
So, maybe those are

190
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:58,310
answers - memories. You might not have the same friends and job and house and

191
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:01,659
atoms throughout your life,
but you do have the same memories,

192
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:06,448
so are you just your memories?

193
00:12:06,448 --> 00:12:10,359
Well, unfortunately, that idea is a little
troublesome, because

194
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,110
memory loss doesn't necessarily make you
a brand new different person

195
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,339
and there's also the slight problem of false

196
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:22,139
memories.
These studies always freak me out.

197
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:25,659
Researchers bring in participants and
show them photographs from their

198
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:26,620
childhood

199
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:31,509
and ask him to tell a story about what
happened in the photo,

200
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:35,959
except one of the photos has been photoshopped.

201
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:39,088
It didn't really happen.
But instead of noticing

202
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:42,170
this fake image, people tend to just

203
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:47,209
make up a story and remember it as if it
really happened.

204
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,480
Couple weeks ago I went with Jake Chudnow,
who does the music here on Vsauce

205
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,120
to the Royal Observatory

206
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:58,759
in Greenwich.
We saw the seventh-largest telescope

207
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:02,649
on earth and while there, this song

208
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:06,698
was playing.
It's called "Longplayer."

209
00:13:06,698 --> 00:13:11,289
Composed by Jem Finer, Longplayer is
constructed by combining different

210
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:13,240
recordings of singing bells.

211
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,519
They're combined in different ways,
so as to never repeat

212
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,799
for 1,000 years.

213
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,789
Longplayer began in 1999 and it will not finish,

214
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:27,610
the song will not be over for 1,000 years.

215
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,850
Literally, billions of humans will be born

216
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,009
and die before Longplayer is

217
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:38,429
finished playing.
The sound waves,

218
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:41,849
the compression waves that send Longplayer into your

219
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,899
ear aren't that much unlike you,

220
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:49,698
your waves of atoms, temporarily
organizing atoms or molecules but not

221
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:52,929
really causing any one atom or molecule
to stay along with you

222
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:56,109
for the entire journey.
Just as the ocean

223
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,528
waves and bells ring, as Alan Watts said, the

224
00:13:59,528 --> 00:14:05,519
earth peoples. In a way, you are a slow
compression wave moving through

225
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,940
Earth's matter.
But what is your waves sound like?

226
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,560
Does it make people wanna dance?
It probably won't

227
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,899
echo around for centuries after you're
gone, but maybe, while you are here, you

228
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:17,828
can get

229
00:14:17,828 --> 00:14:21,919
stuck in the head of some other
temporary wave. An ear worm that they

230
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,789
like and don't want to get rid of.

231
00:14:23,789 --> 00:14:27,318
That'd be a nice type of wave to be.

232
00:14:27,318 --> 00:14:31,860
But can music make you smarter

233
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,180
and can I play an instrument?
Well,

234
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:39,489
to find out, follow James and I
over to the YouTube channel Headsqueeze,

235
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,448
where we take a look at those
questions. And as always,

236
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:45,799
thanks for watching.

237
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,250
Thank you.

238
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:59,860
Seriously, follows us over. 
No, seriously. Right now.

239
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,028
There's also a link I'll put in the description,
so it's like a piece of cake guys. Come

240
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:03,230
on.

241
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,409
Well, we'll be over there waiting.
He's over there, I'm over there, I'm with him

242
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:08,769
here and he's with me over there.

243
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:10,179
We won.
