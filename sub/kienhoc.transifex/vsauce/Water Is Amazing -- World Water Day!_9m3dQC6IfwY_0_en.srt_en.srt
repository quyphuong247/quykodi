00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,560
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And today, we're going to talk about water.

2
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:10,349
Because today is World Water Day.
A day about raising awareness of the fact

3
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,849
that, even though, here on Earth, there is
enough clean, safe, drinking water for everybody

4
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:21,649
to have enough, they don't.
In fact, a billion of them don't.

5
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:26,108
But it doesn't have to be that way.
Now first, I wanna cover how water is not

6
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:32,340
just vital and amazing, but to this day, continues
to surprise us.

7
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,430
For instance, the Mpemba effect.
The effect has been observed many many many

8
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:44,128
times, but has never been explained.
In fact, it is so famously anti-common sense,

9
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:47,649
whenever people throughout history have observed
it, they've tended to think that they just

10
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:51,170
did something wrong.
Which is why even though Aristotle himself

11
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:56,579
wrote about it, it wasn't until the 20th century
that it got its name.

12
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,509
Simply put, the Mpemba effect is the observation
that under the right circumstances a glass

13
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:08,329
of boiling hot water inside a freezer can
turn to ice more quickly than a glass of cold

14
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:11,439
water.
It doesn't make a lot of sense, but it can

15
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,730
happen.
A few possible causes have been thrown out.

16
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:20,020
For instance, if you heat up or boil water,
you remove some of the dissolved gas.

17
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:25,689
And having less stuff dissolved in it may
be what makes hot water easier to freeze.

18
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:28,719
It's the opposite of why we throw down salt
during wintery weather.

19
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,480
The salt dissolves into the water, putting
more stuff in it, making it more difficult

20
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,969
to freeze.
But does that account for the entire effect?

21
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:41,150
Well, some other possible explanations involve
convection currents.

22
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:46,290
A glass of warm water will contain more cycling
convection currents, meaning that the top

23
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,040
of that glass of water is warmer.
And a glass of warm water will tend to freeze

24
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,469
from the sides in, whereas the glass of cold
water will tend to freeze all across the top

25
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:01,039
down.
But once that top layer is frozen, it acts

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,150
as an insulator, so all the water below it
freezes more slowly.

27
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:11,640
The point is that we still do not have a complete
explanation of the effect.

28
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,949
Part of the problem is how difficult it is
to control every single variable.

29
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:20,149
Should we be using equal masses of water or
equal volumes?

30
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,319
Should they be in the same freezer or in separate
freezers?

31
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:26,848
And what about evaporation?
The warm water will be evaporating faster

32
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:31,298
and evaporations into thermosis, it's losing
heat more quickly than the cold water.

33
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:33,620
It's tough.
But here's what we do know.

34
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:39,998
Earth has a lot of water.
70% of Earth's surface is covered in it.

35
00:02:39,998 --> 00:02:47,209
And, interestingly enough, excluding fat,
the human body is about 70% water.

36
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,950
But when you were born you were a big old
sack of water.

37
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:55,378
That's right.
A new baby is 78% water.

38
00:02:55,378 --> 00:03:00,949
Now, that number drops to 65% by the time
that baby is 1 year old.

39
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:07,199
And it'll drop even further to about 60% when
you're an adult... man.

40
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:13,209
Adult women are only about 55% water.
This is because women's physiology on average

41
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:17,459
contains more fat, which doesn't hold as much
water as lean tissue.

42
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:23,959
In fact, fat people, regardless of gender,
contain less water than thin people.

43
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,639
Earth has a lot of water, but it's almost all salty.

44
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:36,239
96.5% of the water on Earth is in the oceans.
Another 3.4% of Earth's water can be found

45
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,709
in other large bodies of water or frozen inside
glaciers or ice caps.

46
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:46,748
But you, me, all the other animals we see,
other manufactured products?

47
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:54,590
They all contain water.
About 0.0003% of Earth's total water.

48
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:59,310
And all of the storms and clouds and rain
and thunderstorms happening contain only about

49
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:09,310
0.0001% of all the water Earth has.
That's a lot of water, but despite that fact,

50
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:15,590
almost a billion people on Earth don't have
access to potable water.

51
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:21,139
Potable comes from the Latin for "to drink,"
which means clean, safe water free from disease

52
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:25,159
and contamination.
The number of people on Earth who do not have

53
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:31,580
sustainable access to potable water is equivalent
to the number of people living inside the

54
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:36,810
United States.
Except multiplied by three.

55
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:44,569
And every year 3.5 million people die because
of non-potable water-related diseases.

56
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:48,949
That's equivalent to the entire population
of Los Angeles.

57
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:56,560
So every year, Earth, our planet, looses an
entire city of Los Angeles because people

58
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,050
don't have access to clean water.
So today, on World Water Day, it's worth talking

59
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,060
about organisations that are making a difference,
because things don't have to be the way that

60
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,530
they are.
Organisations like Water.org help local communities

61
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:17,509
build sustainable clean water solutions that
the community itself will own.

62
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:24,289
Now, they gave me a chance to go out to India
to see this in action, along with WheezyWaiter and Strawburry17.

63
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,730
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to go, but those

64
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:31,030
other two people were and they've got videos
over on their channels about their experiences.

65
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:35,809
So go check those out and if you wanna learn
more, got water.org/vsauce to see how you

66
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:36,850
can help.

67
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,220
And as always,

68
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,260
thanks for watching.
