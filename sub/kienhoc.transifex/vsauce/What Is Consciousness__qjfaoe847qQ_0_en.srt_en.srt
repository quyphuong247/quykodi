00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:04,102
Hey Vsauce, Michael here,
and a hemispherectomy

2
00:00:04,102 --> 00:00:07,823
is a surgical procedure
in which half of a person's brain

3
00:00:07,823 --> 00:00:09,983
is removed.

4
00:00:09,983 --> 00:00:13,053
It's usually only ever done
on very, very young patients

5
00:00:13,053 --> 00:00:15,723
because their brains are still plastic enough

6
00:00:15,723 --> 00:00:18,243
that the remaining half
will take on the functions

7
00:00:18,242 --> 00:00:19,952
of the half that was removed.

8
00:00:19,952 --> 00:00:22,932
And it's usually done
because a young child or a baby

9
00:00:22,932 --> 00:00:26,112
is having seizures, and removing
the part where the seizures occur

10
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,353
is the only solution.

11
00:00:28,353 --> 00:00:30,362
But here's my question.

12
00:00:30,362 --> 00:00:32,542
If you can live with half a brain,

13
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:35,173
what if I were to take two empty skulls

14
00:00:35,173 --> 00:00:37,222
and take one half of your brain

15
00:00:37,222 --> 00:00:39,493
and plop it into one body
and the other half

16
00:00:39,493 --> 00:00:41,582
and put it in another body,

17
00:00:41,582 --> 00:00:44,702
which person would be you?

18
00:00:44,703 --> 00:00:48,933
I mean, you are you.
You are conscious.

19
00:00:48,932 --> 00:00:52,222
You are aware of what is happening to you

20
00:00:52,222 --> 00:00:55,722
from the perspective of yourself.
Think of it this way.

21
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:59,082
If you just stare at something
and kind of feel

22
00:00:59,082 --> 00:01:02,283
what it feels like to be you,

23
00:01:02,283 --> 00:01:05,573
it feels a little bit like you're a thing

24
00:01:05,572 --> 00:01:09,442
inside a body looking out through the eyeballs.

25
00:01:09,442 --> 00:01:11,572
And nobody else on Earth

26
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,842
will ever see the world from that position.

27
00:01:14,843 --> 00:01:17,862
This awareness of your own experiences,

28
00:01:17,862 --> 00:01:20,182
the awareness that you are having them,

29
00:01:20,183 --> 00:01:22,953
the awareness that you
are having your own thoughts

30
00:01:22,953 --> 00:01:25,823
makes up what we call consciousness.

31
00:01:25,822 --> 00:01:28,572
But if I were to take your brain
and split it into two

32
00:01:28,572 --> 00:01:30,702
and put it into two different people,

33
00:01:30,703 --> 00:01:32,713
would both of them be new people
who were conscious?

34
00:01:32,712 --> 00:01:36,312
Well, one of the best places to start

35
00:01:36,313 --> 00:01:38,463
when defining consciousness
and understanding it

36
00:01:38,462 --> 00:01:42,322
is to begin with things that we agree
are not conscious.

37
00:01:42,322 --> 00:01:44,872
For instance, Cleverbot.

38
00:01:44,873 --> 00:01:47,043
Cleverbot.com is an amazing website

39
00:01:47,043 --> 00:01:51,783
where a computer program will respond
to your questions really cleverly

40
00:01:51,783 --> 00:01:56,513
but only because it is programmed to do so.

41
00:01:56,513 --> 00:01:58,513
We wouldn't consider it conscious

42
00:01:58,513 --> 00:02:01,133
because it doesn't have a sense of itself.

43
00:02:01,132 --> 00:02:04,533
It doesn't feel anything.
It doesn't have its own inner life.

44
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:09,643
It's just a program that responds
automatically to my inputs.

45
00:02:09,643 --> 00:02:12,862
Now I know that I am not like Cleverbot.

46
00:02:12,862 --> 00:02:16,962
I know that I feel things
and that I have a sense of myself.

47
00:02:16,962 --> 00:02:19,152
I have intentions.

48
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:22,143
But how do I know that you do?

49
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:26,552
For that matter, how do I know
that everybody else that I meet is like me?

50
00:02:27,126 --> 00:02:30,283
How do I know that they're not
just little smart versions of Cleverbot

51
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:32,772
who know exactly what to automatically say?

52
00:02:32,772 --> 00:02:35,492
Now what I'm asking is incredibly philosophical,

53
00:02:35,492 --> 00:02:38,272
but it is a very famous and important question.

54
00:02:38,272 --> 00:02:42,383
I'm basically asking if it's possible
for something to exist

55
00:02:42,383 --> 00:02:46,052
as a philosophical zombie.

56
00:02:46,052 --> 00:02:51,091
That's right, a thing that reacts and responds
and acts just like a normal human

57
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:54,772
but yet doesn't actually feel anything.

58
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:58,102
It doesn't know that it's having its own thoughts.

59
00:02:58,102 --> 00:03:00,891
It just automatically responds like a robot
in the appropriate way.

60
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:04,051
Now what's amazing and heavy about this question

61
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:07,352
is that science doesn't have an answer,

62
00:03:07,352 --> 00:03:10,981
and it's not even clear that science
will ever have an answer,

63
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:13,852
let alone an approach to finding that answer.

64
00:03:13,852 --> 00:03:19,602
About all we have is the psychology
of disorders of consciousness.

65
00:03:19,602 --> 00:03:22,012
Let's begin with anosognosia.

66
00:03:22,012 --> 00:03:25,322
A common example of anosognosia
in psychology classes

67
00:03:25,322 --> 00:03:29,512
is a patient who has, say, lost the ability
to move their left hand.

68
00:03:29,512 --> 00:03:31,532
When asked to raise their right hand,

69
00:03:31,532 --> 00:03:34,052
they'll say, "Yeah, no problem, here you go."

70
00:03:34,051 --> 00:03:36,822
But then when asked to raise their left hand,

71
00:03:36,822 --> 00:03:39,402
they'll say, "Oh, yeah, sure, no problem,"

72
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:45,381
but not move it.
And when asked why they didn't move their left hand,

73
00:03:45,382 --> 00:03:48,152
instead of reporting that they can't,

74
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:50,391
they'll confabulate some excuse.

75
00:03:50,391 --> 00:03:52,391
For instance, "Oh, I didn't feel like it."

76
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:55,831
Anton-Babinski Syndrome
is even more dramatic.

77
00:03:55,831 --> 00:03:59,721
Patients with this syndrome
are cortically blind.

78
00:03:59,722 --> 00:04:01,832
They cannot see anything.

79
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:04,731
But they deny being blind.

80
00:04:04,731 --> 00:04:08,258
If you ask them a question, for instance,
"How many fingers am I holding up?"

81
00:04:08,258 --> 00:04:11,008
they will make a guess,
but if they're wrong,

82
00:04:11,008 --> 00:04:13,808
they'll explain their inaccuracy
with an excuse.

83
00:04:13,808 --> 00:04:16,608
For instance, "oh, well, I don't have my glasses."

84
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:18,628
People who exhibit anosognosia

85
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:21,189
tend to be the victims of stroke,

86
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:24,838
and there's some disconnect
between what they're really experiencing

87
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:27,298
and their conscious awareness of it.

88
00:04:27,298 --> 00:04:29,948
They don't know that they can't see

89
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:32,709
because the part of their brain
that monitors visual input

90
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:35,098
isn't telling the brain anything.

91
00:04:35,098 --> 00:04:37,618
It's not even telling the brain
that there is no visual input

92
00:04:37,619 --> 00:04:39,799
which means that the parts of their brain

93
00:04:39,798 --> 00:04:43,038
responsible for answering questions
or creating speech

94
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:47,038
has to completely create
a confabulated response.

95
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:49,168
Despite the fact that we've been able to study

96
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:52,278
patients with anosognosia,
we still have no idea

97
00:04:52,278 --> 00:04:54,808
how to solve our original problem.

98
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:57,189
In fact, all we've managed
to come up with

99
00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:00,749
are more impossible questions
about identity,

100
00:05:00,749 --> 00:05:03,539
questions that are so befuddling,
the best you can do with them

101
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:06,608
is to answer them yourself
according to what you believe.

102
00:05:07,158 --> 00:05:09,288
Here's another one.
It's called the Swampman.

103
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:11,688
Imagine that I'm walking
around in a swamp

104
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:14,759
and then all of a sudden,
I get struck by a bolt if lightening

105
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,459
and my entire body is burned to a crisp,
dissolved into smithereens.

106
00:05:18,997 --> 00:05:22,949
But the very same moment,
a second bolt of lightening strikes nearby,

107
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:25,299
and it causes a bunch of atoms and molecules

108
00:05:25,298 --> 00:05:29,238
to all arrange themselves
into the exact same configuration

109
00:05:29,238 --> 00:05:33,899
that my body used to have,
making a second Michael.

110
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:36,119
Is that me? Would that be me?

111
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:38,999
Here's an even better one.
Imagine that a surgeon came in,

112
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:43,459
and he started removing cells
from me and from you,

113
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:47,598
replacing them exactly one at a time,

114
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:51,178
replacing my cells into your body
and your cells into my body.

115
00:05:51,178 --> 00:05:55,998
At what point would I
officially have become you?

116
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:59,229
No one on Earth has the definitive answers
to these questions,

117
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:01,798
but you know what we do have?
A lean back.

118
00:06:01,798 --> 00:06:05,778
That's right. I've made a playlist
of some of my favorite clips from all over YouTube

119
00:06:05,778 --> 00:06:07,838
of psychology experiments and illusions

120
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:10,899
and all sorts of fun stuff
that deal with consciousness.

121
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:13,488
All you have to do is click the link
at the top of this video's description

122
00:06:13,488 --> 00:06:17,888
and then lean back and let the automatic playlist
do the work for you.

123
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:20,959
I'll see you over there, and as always,
thanks for watching.

124
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:29,778
Hey Kevin, any new YouTube messages?

125
00:06:29,778 --> 00:06:33,069
Actually yes. I just got this message
over at Vsauce 2

126
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:35,189
from a user who doesn't create videos

127
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:38,079
but he organizes them in his own playlists.

128
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,668
Yeah, yeah, that's excellent
because there's so many videos on YouTube,

129
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:44,378
we need people to help organize them,
especially by type.

130
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:49,519
Imagine a channel of playlists ranging
from cool songs to listen to when it rains

131
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,088
or best explosions ever.

132
00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:54,699
Exactly. If you make a playlist
that you think is really cool

133
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:57,499
and full of stuff that we should know about,
send it to Michael@Vsauce.com

134
00:06:57,499 --> 00:06:59,249
and we'll feature the ones we really like

135
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:02,399
because you have made YouTube
a better more organized place.

136
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,059
And after all, Vsauce is kind of like a carpool lane.

137
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:08,289
We're all going to get
to the cool stuff faster

138
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:10,829
because we're traveling together.

139
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,428
Where did you get that?
