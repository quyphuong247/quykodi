1
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:03,780
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:06,919
What's normal? Are you normal?

3
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:12,919
Well, today let's bathe our brains with those questions and scrub down with things that are surprising

4
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:15,679
and counterintuitive.

5
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:19,608
What does it mean to be normal

6
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:23,359
in the first place?
Well, maybe it just means to be average.

7
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,410
But an average can be a bit weird, a bit misleading.

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,800
For instance, think of this way. The average human has

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,609
one breast and one testicle. Also, the
average person has not climbed to the top

10
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:40,240
of Gangkhar Puensum. In fact, no one has.

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,260
Gangkhar Puensum is considered the tallest mountain on Earth that has yet

12
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,280
to be summited. And it's unlikely it ever will be soon.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,030
It lies on the border of China and Bhutan
and local governments believe the area

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,100
to be holy, and no mountaineering or climbing

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,170
is allowed. But don't worry, there are plenty
more. There are at least

16
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,550
a hundred other recognised peaks that are quite tall

17
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:03,948
and remain unsummitted. That's great.

18
00:01:03,948 --> 00:01:08,140
It's surprising to think that Earth has
so many places that still have yet to be

19
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,939
conquered or explored. At least, we were all
born here on Earth.

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,359
Derek, from the YouTube channel Veritasium,

21
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:17,009
where were you born?

22
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,468
A small Australian town called Traralgon.

23
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,920
But were you really born there?

24
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:31,008
I'm suspicious of Derek's answer because saying that you were born on Earth's

25
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:34,700
surface, is like saying you were born in a taxicab.

26
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,978
The taxicab may still be around, but is
it in the exact same location that it was

27
00:01:39,978 --> 00:01:44,450
at the moment of your birth? Probably not.
Like a taxicab,

28
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,269
the Earth is moving, and it's moving quickly.

29
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:51,959
For one, the Earth is spinning. This is real time
footage of Earth spinning you don't notice

30
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,640
much movement at all, but that's just

31
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,930
because Earth is so large. To a distant observer beyond Earth, two seconds from now

32
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,540
you will be an entire kilometre east
from where you are now.

33
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:05,239
Earth is also orbiting around the Sun, quickly.

34
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,680
Three days ago, I was in Singapore. From
the reference frame of Earth's surface,

35
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:14,009
Singapore is 6,000 kilometres
away from this place.

36
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,829
Sydney, Australia. But, in terms of Earth
orbiting around the Sun,

37
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,519
three days ago I wasn't just 6,000 kilometres away,

38
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:24,539
I was more than 7 million. The point is,

39
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:27,629
where you were born, when you were born,

40
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:31,219
is now just an empty region of space Earth will never,

41
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:37,120
ever return to. My favourite surprise is
the solution to the Three Prisoners problem.

42
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,799
It's related to the Monty Hall
problem but the stakes are higher.

43
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:45,590
Its solution is notoriously
counter-intuitive. Let's say that myself,

44
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,560
Kevin

45
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,539
and Jake, have been arrested. 
And we are told that tomorrow morning

46
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:53,568
two of us will be executed.

47
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:57,078
We don't know which two, so it's a terrible night.

48
00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:01,459
But if I ask a guard to tell me
something about what happens tomorrow

49
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:05,180
and the guard says "Michael, I won't tell
you anything about your

50
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,510
fate and I won't tell you who lives, but I will
tell you this little piece of

51
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:10,438
information: tomorrow morning

52
00:03:10,438 --> 00:03:13,759
Jake is one of the guys who will be executed."

53
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,519
What a relief(!) I used to have a one
in three chance of being the one who lives,

54
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:21,718
but now that I know Jake dies, it's just
between Kevin and I.

55
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:23,938
My chances of living have gone up

56
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:26,759
from 1 in 3 to 1 in 2. This is great.

57
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:30,798
Well, if I thought that I would actually be

58
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,159
wrong. In fact, my chances of living
haven't changed at all

59
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,429
and Kevin's are paradoxically now twice
as good as mine.

60
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,189
How can that be? Well, take a look at this.

61
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:47,799
This circle represents the three possibilities. Either

62
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,299
tomorrow Jake will live, Kevin will live or

63
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,799
I will live. The hearts represent life. Isn't that beautiful? Now,

64
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,979
let's focus on what the guard can tell me.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,639
In the case that Jake is the one who has been
selected to live,

66
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,060
both Kevin and myself will die tomorrow.

67
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,289
But the guard cannot tell me anything
about myself, and he cannot tell me

68
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:14,818
who lives, so if Jake is the one chosen to
survive all the guard can tell me

69
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:18,228
is that Kevin will be one of the guys
who dies tomorrow,

70
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:21,408
that's it. Now, in this case, where Kevin

71
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:25,639
is the guy selected to live, both myself
and Jake will die tomorrow, but the guard

72
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,960
can't tell me about myself

73
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,888
and cannot tell me who lives. So all the
guard can say is that tomorrow

74
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:34,598
Jake is one of the guys who will die.
Here's where it gets interesting.

75
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:37,699
If I am the one who has been picked to
live tomorrow,

76
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:41,090
the guard has a choice; he can either tell me that Kevin

77
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:44,250
is the one who will die tomorrow or he
can tell me

78
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,529
that Jake is one of the guys who will
die tomorrow.

79
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:51,599
Well, look at what we've got here. If the guard tells me

80
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,770
that Jake is one of the guys who will die tomorrow,

81
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:59,228
I'm only faced now with these possibilities.

82
00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:03,899
In one-third of these cases I am the survivor, and in two-thirds of these cases

83
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:07,159
Kevin is the survivor. My chances haven't changed

84
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:10,488
and Kevin's are now twice as good as mine used to be.

85
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:17,920
It is a beautiful day here in Sydney.
Before I arrived in Australia

86
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,949
I was in Singapore, where it was also beautiful

87
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:24,139
but incredibly humid. The air felt

88
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:27,500
thick to move through and breathe, but in actuality

89
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,540
humid air is less dense than dry air.

90
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,720
Derek, tell us about Avogadro's Law.

91
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,980
Well, Avogadro came up with the idea that

92
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,600
in a given volume of gas at a given
temperature and pressure, there will be

93
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,510
always the same number of gas particles.
Doesn't matter what the gas is,

94
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,629
if it's helium or nitrogen or oxygen.

95
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:46,360
And that holds truth for air,

96
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,900
which is a mixture of gases.

97
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:51,179
That's right. So, it's got nitrogen and oxygen principally.

98
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:54,500
But if it's humid air, then you replace
some of those nitrogens and oxygens

99
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,610
with water. And water is wider

100
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,009
than the diatomic nitrogen and oxygen that
exists in our atmosphere.

101
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:04,839
That's right.
Oxygen and nitrogen have masses of 32 and 28,

102
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,230
whereas water is just 18.

103
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,259
Humid air is actually much less dense than

104
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:14,930
dry air. It's lighter and things can move
through it more easily.

105
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,280
This is especially true when it comes to baseballs.

106
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,619
A baseball travels through humid air more easily,

107
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,410
and further, with the same amount of
energy. If air becomes more humid

108
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,220
and decreases drag by only five
percent that can mean the difference

109
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,560
between a fly ball

110
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,680
and a home run. This became a problem

111
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,060
when indoor baseball stadiums started to
play around with the idea

112
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,050
of turning on the air conditioning when
the rival team came up to bat.

113
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,040
Essentially, the air conditioning made the air dryer,

114
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,189
therefore thicker and made the rival team hit baseballs

115
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:50,310
shorter distances.

116
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:55,160
The word normal, by the way, is homological. 
What does that mean? A homological

117
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:59,259
adjective describes itself. For instance, the word

118
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:02,360
tiny is pretty tiny. It's a small word.

119
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,580
The word unhyphenated is

120
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:06,819
unhyphenated.

121
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,120
Normal

122
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,550
is one of the top 1000 most commonly
spoken and written words.

123
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,949
The word normal is normal, it describes itself.

124
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:21,729
But they're also words that are heterological;
adjectives that

125
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:26,360
don't describe themselves.
For instance, the word misspelled.

126
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,220
Yes, well, if you don't misspell it. 
If you don't misspell it. What about abbreviated?

127
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,140
Ooo, I like that one, too.

128
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:35,899
What about German?

129
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:39,739
Not a German word. That's a good one.
How about

130
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:44,179
monosyllabic? That's heterological

131
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,709
because it doesn't describe itself.
But polysyllabic? For sure.

132
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:51,819
I especially love just how homological pentasyllabic is.

133
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:55,779
Yeah, five syllables. That is genius.

134
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:59,789
Well, it's the way words are. The way they

135
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,310
normally are. But what about you, are you normal?

136
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,840
Well, a common way of defining normal

137
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,889
is to say that something about you is
normal, if you fall within just

138
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:16,899
one standard deviation of the average for all people.

139
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:20,000
But there are a lot of things

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,269
about you. You can easily think of, say, 36 different

141
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:27,579
independent variables.
Different things to say about yourself.

142
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:31,930
For instance, how tall you are, how many
friends you have, how bad your breath is

143
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:37,639
or, say, how often you lie. Now, the statistical
probability that you would be normal

144
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:40,689
for all 36 of those different attributes

145
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:45,690
is actually one in a million.
Which means, mathematically speaking,

146
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,960
it is quite abnormal to be normal.

147
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,019
And as always,

148
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:53,019
thanks for watching.
