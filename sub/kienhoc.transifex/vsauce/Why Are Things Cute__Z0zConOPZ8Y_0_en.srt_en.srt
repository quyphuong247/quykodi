00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,859
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And The Pet Collective offers 24-hour coverage

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,618
of puppies and kittens.
It's really cute.

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:16,278
But what is cute, scientifically?
I mean, why do we like soft, cuddly things

4
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:20,390
and why do cute things have a unique effect on us?

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:28,570
Well, the word cute is a shortening of acute,
which originally meant "keen," "shrewd," "perceptive."

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:35,300
About 180 years ago, the word cute began to
be used as slang for a girl, who was pretty.

7
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:42,818
And after that, it accrued a new meaning and
was used to describe cuddly, delicate, quaint,

8
00:00:42,819 --> 00:00:49,989
precious, youthful traits.
Konrad Lorenz studies cuteness in living things

9
00:00:49,988 --> 00:00:54,608
and put together a great specific list of
what we consider cute.

10
00:00:54,759 --> 00:01:02,158
Small body size with a disproportionately
large head, large eyes and round and soft

11
00:01:02,158 --> 00:01:06,000
body features.
But why exactly did these characteristics

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,920
elicit an "ooooohhh" response from us humans?
Well, Lorenz pointed that you could find all

13
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,000
of those characteristics in the human baby,
which makes sense.

14
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:25,560
If merely looking at our offspring makes us
instinctively feel protective and nurturing,

15
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,430
well, that's great for all of us.
A fun consequence of this is that our experience

16
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:36,230
of cuteness can be triggered by things that
aren't human babies.

17
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:42,890
For instance, shells, bunnies, owls and even a hammer.

18
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:47,640
A hammer, how can that be?
Take a look at this interactive tool from

19
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,650
the Exploratorium.
A hammer is boring.

20
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:57,680
But if we apply Lorenz's traits and make it
really round and really squat, it goes from

21
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,210
a utilitarian tool to a cute little tiny hammer.
Oh, he's just a little hammer, don't hurt him.

22
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,520
It is a hammer that has become cute, because

23
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,129
we gave it qualities that we see in our own offspring.

24
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,379
As Daniel Dennett puts it, "if human babies
looked like this, instead of that, we would

25
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:22,089
find this cute."
And whenever we saw something that looked

26
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,189
like it, we would wanna cuddle and snuggle with it.

27
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:29,979
Alright, so we have a pretty good idea about
the how and what of cute.

28
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:36,429
But where is cute?
Well, researchers have shown cute baby pictures

29
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,860
to subjects while using functional MRI to
track activity in the brain.

30
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:47,840
And sure enough, the cuter the baby in the
picture, the more activation found right here

31
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,709
- the nucleus accumbens.
A pleasure centre.

32
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:55,628
When activated, the nucleus accumbens releases dopamine.

33
00:02:55,628 --> 00:03:00,259
It's all part of our internal reward system.
It's the same part of the brain targeted by

34
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:05,900
cocaine and meth.
Cuteness is such a powerful force on the brain

35
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,099
in fact that it can affect our behaviours
- what we like, what we buy.

36
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,900
And so it's no coincidence that the creators
of cartoon characters, like Mickey Mouse or

37
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:20,090
Pikachu, have drawn them more
and more cute over time.

38
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,900
The Japanese concept of Kawaii is a great
example of this and it's one that's fun to quantify.

39
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,060
If you're an adult, how many of your own heads,

40
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,020
stacked on top of each other, do you think
it would take to equal your height?

41
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:38,900
The answer for most of us is around 7.5.
But illustrations of people that are meant

42
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:46,740
to make them look heroic or noble tend to
make the person around 8 to 8.5 heads high.

43
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:51,739
Cute goes the other way.
Manga characters tend to only be about 5.5

44
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:53,718
to 6.5 heads tall.

45
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,180
Back to babies.

46
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,959
There are many other psychological factors
at work that cause us to want to instinctively

47
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,419
take care of our young.
And to be sure, some of them are decidedly

48
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:09,919
not cute.
For instance, poopy diapers.

49
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:16,660
Researchers have found that mothers, when
exposed to soiled diapers, tend to consider

50
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:24,050
the smell coming from their own child's diaper
to be the least terrible, despite not knowing

51
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:29,829
which diaper belonged to which kid.
When something retains juvenile traits all

52
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:36,129
the way through adulthood, it is called neoteny.
And we love it, especially in animals that

53
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:41,089
we keep as pets.
Of course, us humans have selectively bred

54
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:46,168
all kinds of animals to make each generation
more and more useful to us.

55
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:53,969
But the dog may be the animal that've spent
the most time designing, making each generation

56
00:04:53,970 --> 00:05:00,010
better at hunting or better at staying cuter for longer.

57
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:07,900
Dogs like this have been designed by us to
look, grow and behave in ways that we want.

58
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:13,799
Not that dissimilar from how we would design,
say, a DVD player and its features.

59
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,449
So whether it's staying cute forever or just
being a really great hunting companion, the

60
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:25,370
modern dog, more than any other animal, could
be considered not so much a consequence of

61
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:34,060
nature as much as it is a piece of human technology.
As Science Friday puts it, "the dog is man's

62
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:41,740
best friend because it may be man's best invention."
So go pet a cute dog today.

63
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,540
And as always,

64
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,900
thanks for watching.
