1
00:00:01,078 --> 00:00:03,360
Hey, Vsauce. My name

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,339
is Michael.
And my name is Kevin.

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,028
Names.

4
00:00:08,028 --> 00:00:11,210
Humans give each other names

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,559
but so do dolphins. They use

6
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:17,980
whistle sounds and will respond to their whistle name

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,278
even when produced by a dolphin they don't know.

8
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:24,618
Personal names, personalized

9
00:00:24,618 --> 00:00:28,948
things, signifying that the named thing is capable of

10
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,590
feeling. That it's worthy of empathy.
The United Nations

11
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,040
Convention on the Rights of the Child
has declared that every

12
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,450
human child born on earth has the right

13
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,430
to a name.
Every country on earth has ratified the treaty,

14
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:49,750
except for three: South Sudan,
the newest country on earth,

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,649
Somalia, which has no central government, and

16
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:57,219
the United States. Why?

17
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:00,829
Well, some organizations

18
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:03,829
inside the United States believe that the US

19
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:09,650
shouldn't have to listen to another
authority and the treaty prohibits

20
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,630
the death penalty for children.

21
00:01:13,629 --> 00:01:18,449
It's a moot point now but up until 2005 twenty-two states

22
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,909
allowed children to be executed

23
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:27,380
for crimes. The United States follows the
treaty now but won't promise to

24
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:30,789
always do so. Dunce is

25
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,549
a bad name to be called
but an even worse name

26
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:38,009
to be the origin of. Meet Duns

27
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,060
Scotus, born in 1266.

28
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:46,409
Popular in his time, later scholars looked
down on his teachings as

29
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,368
clever but wrong.
They were so critical, in fact, they took

30
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:53,978
Duns and turned his name into a noun meaning

31
00:01:53,978 --> 00:01:57,310
a stupid person - a dunce.

32
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,439
Perhaps you'd rather have had the longest name

33
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:06,879
ever. A record held by a man born in 1904
whose name was 746 letters

34
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,829
long.
You can listen to someone pronounce the entire name

35
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,950
on Wikipedia. What can't

36
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:17,068
a name be? Mononymous people only use

37
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:20,699
one name. You can name your kid Apple or

38
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:24,519
North or Moon Unit. You can name your kid

39
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,090
Football. But not everywhere.
Some countries require parents to submit

40
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,340
their children's names to the government

41
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,590
for approval.
New Zealand enforces a policy in which names

42
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,628
must not cause offence to a reasonable person,

43
00:02:38,628 --> 00:02:42,848
not be unreasonably long and should not
resemble an official title

44
00:02:42,848 --> 00:02:47,459
or rank.
For example, their courts recently forbid a mother

45
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,689
from naming her child "Sex Fruit."

46
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:54,239
But New Zealand has allowed some unusual names.

47
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,920
Right now, in New Zealand, there are children living

48
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,869
whose names are officially "Violence,"
"Midnight Chardonnay"

49
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,539
and "Number 16 Bus Shelter."

50
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:11,030
In 1996 a Swedish couple submitted their child's name

51
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:16,469
for official approval, "Albin."
But in protest of the naming laws in place at

52
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:17,250
the time,

53
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,469
they spelled Albin like this

54
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:24,309
It wasn't accepted.

55
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,879
In the United States you can name your
kid pretty much anything that doesn't

56
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,169
include obscenity,

57
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:34,189
numerals or symbols, which means,
as Carlton Larson points out,

58
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:37,590
you can't name your kid R2-D2.

59
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,780
But you could, say, name your child

60
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,349
Adolf Hitler, which Heath and Deborah Campbell

61
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:48,969
did in 2006. Adolf Hitler Campbell

62
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:53,250
made headlines in 2009 after a bakery
refused to put his name

63
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,370
on a cake for his third birthday. Shortly afterwards

64
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,959
child welfare officials took him and his
other controversially named siblings away

65
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:04,700
from their parents and place them in foster care,

66
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:10,089
where they remain to this day.
His parents are self-identified

67
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,120
Nazis and they live in

68
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,379
New Jersey, the latter of which
makes them New Jerseyans.

69
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:21,668
If they lived in Kansas they'd be Kansan,
if they lived in New York they'd

70
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:25,159
be New Yorkers,
if they lived in Utah they'd be

71
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,000
Utahns. A name based on where something is from

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,589
is called a demonym, which means that even names

73
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:37,799
have names.
An endonym is a name given to a place

74
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,418
by those who live there.
An exonym is the name given to a place by those

75
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:46,478
who live elsewhere.
But my favorite name for a name

76
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,228
is an autoantonym.
A word that can mean the

77
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:53,300
opposite of its other meaning.
For example,

78
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,449
the word "off," which can mean both

79
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:59,529
activated and de-activated.

80
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:02,529
For instance, the alarm went off,

81
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:05,859
so we had to turn it off.

82
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,660
You can track the distribution of your
last name across the entire

83
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,640
earth using the public profiler.

84
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,418
Or visualize the popularity of the US' top

85
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:23,089
1000 names over time.
Studies have shown that your name

86
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:26,089
may influence your behavior.

87
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:29,989
The nameâ€“letter effect is a phenomenon
in which people prefer

88
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,389
words, events, other people and places,

89
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:37,360
which contain letters similar to the
letters inside their own

90
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,210
name.
Measuring a person's preference for such letters

91
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:45,009
has been shown to be a good gauge of self-esteem.

92
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:50,009
Richard Wiseman's Quirkology is a great
read on this topic. He mentions

93
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:55,740
"alphabetical discrimination."
People with last names that begin with the letter

94
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,370
near the end of the alphabet tend to rate themselves

95
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,949
significantly less successful than
people with names that begin with the

96
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:04,930
letter near the

97
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,310
beginning of the alphabet. Perhaps because

98
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,589
all their lives they've been put on the bottom

99
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:16,929
of lists.
Also fascinating is the fact that men and women with

100
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,329
positive initials, like "A.C.E.,"

101
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:23,538
"H.U.G." or "J.O.Y."

102
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:26,819
live 3 to 4.5 years longer

103
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,680
than average.
But men with negative initials, like

104
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,579
"P.I.G.," "B.U.M." or "D.I.E."

105
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:37,379
die about three years

106
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:41,788
earlier than average.
But interestingly, women with negative initials

107
00:06:41,788 --> 00:06:45,168
don't show much difference.
Half of all

108
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:49,329
Americans share the same 1,712

109
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:54,149
last names.
1 percent of Americans have the last name

110
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:57,959
Smith.
In China, 85%

111
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:04,959
share the same 100 last names.
Two-hundred last names cover 96% of the population

112
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:09,019
in Vietnam, 40% of which have the same

113
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:10,299
last name.

114
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,340
This one.

115
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:16,259
Name Colleen can hurt people's feelings.
It's at the very bottom

116
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:20,839
of Graham's hierarchy of disagreement.
And, at the end of the day,

117
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:25,158
names are just words. As the saying goes,

118
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:30,120
sticks and stones may break my bones but
words are merely the smallest element of

119
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,120
language capable of

120
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,110
containing meaning and isolation and, 
as such, could never directly produce the 4,000

121
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,729
newtons

122
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:41,430
of force per square centimetre required to break bones.

123
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,569
And as always,

124
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,500
thanks for watching.
