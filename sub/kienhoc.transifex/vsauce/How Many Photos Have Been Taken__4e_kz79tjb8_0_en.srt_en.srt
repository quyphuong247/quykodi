00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:07,839
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
In 1826 this became the very first photograph

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,940
ever taken.
And in 1992, this became the very first image

3
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:19,969
ever uploaded to the web.
But how many photographs have we all taken,

4
00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:27,250
altogether throughout all of history?
Well, 1000memories investigated this very

5
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,960
question.
They took a look at the number of digital cameras

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,890
currently in use, typical usage of a digital
camera, as well as the amount of analog film

7
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:42,759
and film-developing supplies used by the industry
ever since the 19th century.

8
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:52,170
Tabulated altogether, they estimated that
we have taken 3.5 trillion photographs, 4

9
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:59,030
billion of which were taken this year alone.
We are snapping more photographs than ever

10
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,879
before, because of the proliferation of easy-to-use,
affordable digital cameras.

11
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:10,530
In fact, we take 4 times more pictures per day
than we did 10 years ago.

12
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,870
Or think of it this way.
Today, every 2 minutes, humanity takes more

13
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:22,300
pictures than we took altogether in the entire 1800s.

14
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:28,170
Of course, the 1800s were a long time ago.
But if we take every year from the invention

15
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:36,060
of photography until today, 10% of all of
those images, a tenth of every still image

16
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:42,850
recorded of our world, was taken in the last 12 months.

17
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:45,989
That's a lot.
But even crazier is the fact that a fifth

18
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:51,469
of these images, 20% of them, all wind up
in the same place - Facebook.

19
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:58,060
Facebook is huge.
But to put it in perspective, you Vsaucers

20
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,450
are huge.
If all of us got together in one place and

21
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:08,229
claimed independence, we would become the
152nd largest country on Earth.

22
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:11,819
Right between Guinea-Bissau and 
Trinidad and Tobago.

23
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:19,979
But Facebook, with is 1 billion users, would
be the 3rd largest country on Earth.

24
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:26,649
To take a quick, dark detour, of those 1 billion
people on Facebook, it's estimated that 30

25
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:33,590
million of them are now dead.
And in 100 years, it's estimated that half

26
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,009
a billion of the people on Facebook will be deceased.

27
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:44,250
Facebook stories offers a really neat tool,
where you click on a country and then see

28
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,080
what other countries most of their Facebook
friends live in.

29
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,959
It's fun to see what countries are most connected
to which others, but this whole thing brings

30
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:58,340
up the question of degrees of separation.
If you were to take 2 random people on Earth,

31
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:03,439
how many friend of a friend of a friend of
a friends would you need to connect those

32
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:06,930
2 people?
Well, in the real world, it's a little difficult

33
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,689
to figure out, because we don't know who's
friends with who and there are a lot of people.

34
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:15,990
But, luckily, mathematics has come to our rescue.

35
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:22,699
Watts and Strogatz showed that you could calculate
the average path between any 2 random people

36
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:26,420
quite easily.
In this equation, the "N" stands for the total

37
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:31,579
number of people in the population.
And "K" stands for the number of friends each

38
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,600
person has.
If we assume that each person has, say, 30

39
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:42,139
friends and we assume that 10% of our population
is too young to have actual friends, it turns

40
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:48,439
out that you can connect any two people on
Earth with only 6.6 connections.

41
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:51,598
Theoretically.
Of course, in the real world, we don't all

42
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:56,699
have the same number of friends, we don't
all have 30 friends and isolated groups make

43
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:01,729
the average much, much higher.
Of course, there are non-real world places,

44
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:06,109
where these connections are easier to follow.
For instance, Facebook.

45
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,640
Last year, Facebook's data team released two
papers, showing that amongst all Facebook

46
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:21,159
users at the time, the average distance between
any two random users was only 4.74 friends.

47
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,850
Twitter is even tighter.
It's been shown that any two random users

48
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:31,520
of Twitter are connected by only 4.67 friends,
though some studies have shown it to be as

49
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:37,409
low as 3.5.
Numbers like that can make impersonal crowd

50
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,410
seem quite intimate.
But one of my favorite things about crowds

51
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:48,430
is how smart they are.
Wisdom of the Crowds is a fascinating phenomenon,

52
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:54,430
where the collective knowledge or guesses
or estimations of a big group of people, when

53
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:59,329
averaged, are better than one individual person
working alone.

54
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,519
A good example of this is trying to guess
how many jellybeans are in a jar.

55
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,900
Some people will overestimate, while others
will underestimate, but collectively, each

56
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:16,930
member cancels out the errors of the other
and the group average estimation winds up

57
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:22,500
being smarter than the sum of its parts.
The BBC's demonstration of this is fantastic,

58
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:25,430
I've linked it down in the description, it's worth watching.

59
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:29,680
They had 160 people guess the number 
of jellybeans  in a jar.

60
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:37,250
The guesses ranged from a few hundred to tens
of thousands, but the average of all 160 guesses

61
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:46,470
was 4,515, only 5 beans away from the exact answer.

62
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,759
It's amazing to think that in a large enough
group, the errors and shortcomings of everyone

63
00:05:51,759 --> 00:06:00,519
else, no matter how annoying they are individually,
actually can balance and correct our own shortcomings.

64
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,600
It feels good, though a little bit strange
to think that in a group, it's possible for

65
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:12,120
nobody to be correct, but for everybody to be right.

66
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,000
And as always,

67
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,240
thanks for watching.
