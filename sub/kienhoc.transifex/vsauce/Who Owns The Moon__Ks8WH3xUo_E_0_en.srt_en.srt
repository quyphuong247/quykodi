1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,860
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
Gregory W. Nemitz

2
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:08,470
registered some land containing 492

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,980
quintillion dollars worth of platinum.

4
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:15,359
The land was right here... well,

5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,868
over here - an asteroid

6
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:24,240
named 433 Eros.
Not a single sovereign nation on earth

7
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:29,079
recognizes human claims to
extraterrestrial real estate,

8
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:32,799
but he did it anyway.
And then, less than a year later,

9
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,179
NASA landed a probe on the asteroid.

10
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:39,960
They called it the first asteroid
we had ever landed a probe on.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,679
Nemitz called it "parking space number 29"
and promptly sent

12
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,030
NASA a 20 dollar parking ticket.
But so far,

13
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,109
NASA and the US Attorney General 
have dismissed the fine, saying that

14
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:57,920
his claim to own the asteroid is without legal merit.

15
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,500
But why?

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,310
Plenty of organizations exists that will
gladly take your money in return for

17
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:12,329
land on the Moon, Venus, Mars.
And if you had enough money to go to the Moon,

18
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:16,030
nothing is legally stopping you from moving there,

19
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,609
building a house with a significant
other, having some kids and turning

20
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:21,000
your Moon house

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,090
into a Moon home.
It wouldn't be trespassing

22
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:30,310
or squatting or stealing.
The 1979 Moon Treaty

23
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,228
says that no one can own any part of outer space

24
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:38,310
ever, but only 11 states have signed it.
However,

25
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:44,340
129 nations have signed and/or ratified the 1967

26
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,868
Outer Space Treaty, which says that outer
space is not subject to national

27
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:54,478
appropriation.
It says nothing about a private individual

28
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,189
or a company owning part of outer space.

29
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:03,219
But without the recognition and support
of at least one sovereign nation,

30
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:06,489
what does ownership really mean?

31
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:11,629
I mean, I can claim anything I want.
I can claim to own Prospect Park

32
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:16,289
in Brooklyn, but just saying that I do or
even moving there

33
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:21,000
and living in Prospect Park wouldn't
entitle me to the rights that usually go

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,250
along with ownership,

35
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,719
unless someone with a bunch of power

36
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:30,709
agreed that I owned it and could enforce
that ownership and keep others

37
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:34,050
from claiming to also own it.
In the past,

38
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,400
explorers had few qualms about claiming to

39
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,550
own land,

40
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,140
even if other humans were already there,
because they had

41
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:46,699
power on their side - mainly plenty of guns,

42
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:50,759
Germs and Steel.
To paraphrase con artist

43
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:54,009
Canada Bill Jones, "you know what beats four aces?

44
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:58,439
A gun."
Or as @lawblob pointed out,

45
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:02,489
McDonald's actually does serve
breakfast after 10:30,

46
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:08,640
if you have a gun. If you claimed some
land on the Moon as your own and moved in,

47
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,949
would you also have to hire your own lunar police

48
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:16,209
and Cislunar military to defend it and
to keep others from

49
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:19,969
challenging your claim?
Pretty much.

50
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:23,370
That's kind of the problem.
Currently it is

51
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,920
risky for individuals or corporations to claim

52
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:31,409
and use extraterrestrial territory
because the Outer Space Treaty

53
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:34,739
says that outer space is the common

54
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,909
heritage of mankind.
It belongs

55
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:41,109
to all of us

56
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,270
and only to all of us.

57
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,818
Many interpretations of the Outer Space
Treaty predict that powerful things like

58
00:03:48,818 --> 00:03:49,639
nations

59
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:54,469
would be reluctant to come to your
defense should someone else want to move in

60
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:55,830
or cause trouble

61
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,880
or dispute your extraterrestrial claim.

62
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,620
Maybe you could get the sovereign nation
to weigh in on your behalf by declaring

63
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,489
universal jurisdiction

64
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:10,719
but that would need to be for an
incredibly terrible heinous crime, a

65
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,870
crime against all of humanity, not just

66
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,129
a dispute over a few space rocks.

67
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:19,730
Catherine Doldirina from the
Institute of Air & Space Law at

68
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,780
McGill University suggests

69
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,809
that considering outer space, the common heritage of

70
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,829
mankind, has slowed space exploration.

71
00:04:28,829 --> 00:04:34,079
You see, the Outer Space Treaty was based
on the Antarctic Treaty, which says that

72
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,459
the entire continent

73
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,409
shall never become the scene or object
of international discord.

74
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,979
Discord is not a good thing, but
without an incentive to profit from it,

75
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:48,909
not much has happened there,
as opposed to the

76
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,590
Arctic, where a resource boom is
currently underway.

77
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,280
If people felt safer appropriating and
taking advantage of space, of celestial

78
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,039
bodies,

79
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,780
if technological development was more incentivized,

80
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:06,639
would we already have orbiting tourist attractions

81
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,250
and lunar hotels?
Maybe.

82
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,430
But here is what you can currently own

83
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,459
in outer space: stuff you put there

84
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:20,750
and, to a certain extent, orbits.

85
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,949
The Outer Space Treaty says that the
stuff we left on the move,

86
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:28,329
anything put into space, remains property

87
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:32,219
of the original owner forever.
Orbits around

88
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,790
earth are temporarily granted by the
International Telecommunication Union,

89
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,890
a UN agency;
but they don't work like typical real estate

90
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:44,319
on Earth.
When a group of Equatorial nations

91
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,689
attempted to claim orbits above their
land boundaries, without planning on

92
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:50,160
putting satellites there,

93
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,230
their claim was largely ignored.

94
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,830
So you not only need to ask the UN for an orbit

95
00:05:56,829 --> 00:06:01,120
and get permission,
you also need to use it and fill it.

96
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,310
It's a little disappointing that we
don't know how

97
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,100
lunar real estate works or if it will,

98
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,370
but it's exciting to know that we,
within our lifetimes,

99
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,610
might have a chance to be part of the solution.

100
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,439
A unique generation not visiting space
for the first time,

101
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:21,529
but homesteading it for the first time.

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,879
Here's another unresolved space law quandary.

103
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,360
If an alien landed in your backyard,

104
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:34,509
intelligent life from beyond Earth, and you shot it

105
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:39,199
with a gun, dressed it and then cooked up,
you and your family, some alien meat

106
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,789
fajitas, would that be

107
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,530
hunting or murder?

108
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,948
We literally don't know.
On earth, we have human rights,

109
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:55,080
but there are no alien rights.

110
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:58,180
Maybe it would fall under the category of

111
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:02,699
cultural vandalism, an act that's not necessarily

112
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,740
a legal, but is a giant bummer

113
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,800
to the rest of humanity.
This has happened before -

114
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,079
not with aliens - but with paintings.

115
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:16,699
In 2003, the Chapman brothers purchased
one of the few remaining sets of

116
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:20,300
Goya's Fantastic Disasters of War.

117
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,728
Instead of displaying the works for the
public, they defaced them

118
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:28,158
by drawing clown and puppy heads on the people.

119
00:07:28,158 --> 00:07:31,908
They called the work "insult to injury."

120
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:36,310
In protest, a man threw red paint on
Jake Chapman when he appeared at Modern Art

121
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,009
Oxford,

122
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:40,680
but at the end of the day,
what the Chapman brothers did

123
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,379
wasn't illegal.
They owned the paintings.

124
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,439
Vandalizing the Moon or

125
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:51,020
killing a peaceful alien aren't illegal

126
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:56,299
acts, but just like defacing historical
paintings, they seem wrong on some

127
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,439
deeper level, especially since because in
most museums

128
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:02,620
you usually can't even touch the paintings.

129
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,520
But who was the first person

130
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:11,698
to touch the Moon with their bare hands?

131
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:16,620
I mean, the guys who walked around on the
Moon wore space suits, they had material

132
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,100
in between their skin

133
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,310
and the Moon.
Well, to be sure,

134
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,910
you already have the Moon in your hands.

135
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,180
Well, little Moons.
Lunula.

136
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,900
The crescent-shaped area at the base of
your fingernail,

137
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:35,079
where tissue is thicker and the red
vascular structures underneath are more

138
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,700
hidden,

139
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,360
making it white.
And to be even more sure,

140
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,529
at the quantum level touch is
problematic. As I've covered before,

141
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:49,659
atomically speaking, matter never really contacts

142
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:52,719
other matter in the conventional sense.
You can't

143
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,840
truly touch anything.
MinutePhysics called it

144
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,269
interaction over a short distance.

145
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,379
With that in mind, NASA says the

146
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:06,139
Terry Slezak was the first person to
touch the Moon

147
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:10,740
with his bare hands. He was a technician
in quarantine, who accidentally got lunar

148
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,200
soil smeared

149
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,350
all over his hand while removing film magazines

150
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:20,399
from the astronauts' cameras.
But when Armstrong and Aldrin returned to the

151
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,350
lunar module

152
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:26,240
after their moonwalk and removed their
helmets, they came into contact with

153
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,090
lunar dust

154
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,570
they tracked in on their suits.
They even reported its

155
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,879
odor, saying it smelled of spent gunpowder

156
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:37,090
or ashes, possibly because it oxidized

157
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:41,950
on contact with the air in the cabin.
Point is,

158
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,070
the first few breaths of Moon dusty

159
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:49,000
air that Armstrong and Aldrin took in were our first

160
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,100
fleshly contact with the Moon.

161
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,009
Or were they?
Walking around on earth

162
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:59,389
every day I am surrounded by material that recently

163
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:05,120
was in outer space. Hundreds of metric
tons of extraterrestrial rock falls to

164
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,810
Earth every year.
Some from the Moon, but most from asteroids,

165
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:13,289
ejected by a high-speed impact and
eventually caught by

166
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:16,639
Earth's gravity.
Some pieces are big enough to see,

167
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:21,690
but most are pulverized by our atmosphere
during entry into tiny particles that

168
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,519
disperse

169
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:25,899
in the air, becoming a tiny fraction of the very

170
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:29,899
dust and dirt we clean up and breathe in every day.

171
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,159
There's microscopic space dust,

172
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:36,629
pieces of asteroids and even the Moon all around us.

173
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:39,549
In fact, there might be microscopic
pieces of the Moon

174
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:43,240
under your bed right now or even

175
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:48,679
under your fingernails. Which means the
first human to have fleshly contact

176
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,979
with lunar material

177
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,889
was the first Homo Sapien hundreds of
thousands of years ago

178
00:10:53,889 --> 00:11:00,068
to walk on dirt. We are still studying
exactly how much cosmic dust is in the

179
00:11:00,068 --> 00:11:01,740
air that we breathe every day,

180
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,659
but it's safe to say that every once in
a while you inhale some

181
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:08,870
material that was recently in

182
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:13,379
outer space, some of which thousands of
years ago was on the Moon.

183
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:18,689
Was the Moon. And just like other
particulates in our atmosphere,

184
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:22,149
large enough pieces get trapped in the
mucus that protects

185
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:26,379
our lungs, meaning that picking your nose is gross,

186
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:29,610
but every once in a while,
a booger could literally

187
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,570
be out of this world.

188
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,139
And as always,

189
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:34,950
thanks for watching.
