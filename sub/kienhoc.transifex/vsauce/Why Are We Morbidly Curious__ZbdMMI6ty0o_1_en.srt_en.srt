1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,770
Hey Vsauce. Michael here. In 1924

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,060
psychologist Carney Landis drew lines on people's faces

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,480
and then photographed them in various
scenarios

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,519
to study facial expressions.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,440
But he didn't use actors

6
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:19,000
and he didn't tell the participants to
pretend to feel emotions. Instead,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,079
he subjected them to actual trauma.

8
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:23,509
He had them do things like

9
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,970
smell ammonia, look at pornographic images and even reach their hand in

10
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:30,910
buckets of wet slimy frogs.

11
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,899
His most intense directive

12
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:37,350
involved ordering them to take a knife and while being photographed

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,390
cut off the head of a living rat.

14
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,380
Seriously.

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,940
Most initially refused to cut the head off,
but eventually

16
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:49,960
two-thirds agreed to do as they were told,

17
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,060
including a 13-year-old boy referred to
the psychology department by a doctor

18
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,000
for high blood pressure thought to be
caused by emotional instability.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,270
Many believe his inclusion in Landis' experiment

20
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,430
was an accident.

21
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,880
If replicated today Landis might be arrested

22
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,259
but what is psychologically arresting
about these images

23
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:15,930
is that the unease and disgust and fear they show

24
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,630
is real.

25
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:19,780
It's disturbing

26
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,498
but fascinating.

27
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:26,838
We are paradoxically drawn towards some
pretty repulsive things:

28
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,820
car accidents, car chases,

29
00:01:29,828 --> 00:01:33,038
the possibility of a crash or a fight,

30
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:37,259
or a natural disaster; I mean not one that hurts anyone, of course,

31
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,600
but one that's exciting.

32
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,629
Celebrity scandal,

33
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:43,958
drama, disfiguration, true crime, war

34
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:48,020
and gore, the macarbe. Like the Kangling, a trumpet

35
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:53,920
used during Himalayan Buddhist rituals
that's made out of a human leg bone.

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,799
We often feel guilty for being interested

37
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,759
in these types of things, after all, they are unpleasant

38
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,039
but yet we can't look away. Why?

39
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,360
Well, there is no single reason, there are
many of them

40
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:11,409
but they can be mould into a mnemonic.

41
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:15,128
We like disturbing things because we like

42
00:02:15,128 --> 00:02:16,668
to scream.

43
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,579
They give us strength, catharsis

44
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:23,189
reality, exploration, acceptance and meaning.

45
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,099
Watching someone eat gross tasting jellybeans

46
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:30,568
or a ghost pepper or a spoonful of cinnamon or

47
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:35,030
suffer in more extreme ways, is a kinda
strange thing to like to do

48
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,229
but it's part of what keeps us alive.

49
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:41,719
We are curious, even if the outcome

50
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,609
could be bad.

51
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,980
We often find uncertainty more
unpleasant

52
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:50,539
than unpleasant certainty. At least if we look

53
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:52,039
we know.

54
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:56,000
There's a neurological basis for
exploring in the face of danger.

55
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,379
We become more attentive and alert

56
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,120
when we are frightened, which makes
sense.

57
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,879
Neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine

58
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,519
are released when we are scared

59
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,520
physically and mentally preparing us to

60
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,260
take on a threat or successfully escape from it.

61
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,959
Dopamine is famously part of the brains

62
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:16,250
reward system.

63
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,789
Dopamine is released in response to pleasurable

64
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:22,530
things, like sex and food, but that doesn't mean

65
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:25,769
our brains find disturbing things
pleasurable.

66
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,689
It's more interesting than that.

67
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:29,180
When dopamine systems

68
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,270
are inhibited in laboratory animals, they will cease

69
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,400
to seek out food

70
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,599
and literally starve to death; because
they no longer find food

71
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,359
fun?

72
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:42,959
No.

73
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:44,379
If food is placed

74
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:47,759
in their mouths, they will consume it and express

75
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,539
signs of satisfaction.

76
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:52,419
Evidence like this suggests that the brain contains

77
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:56,519
systems that motivate seeking, approaching and curiosity

78
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,300
for their own sake.

79
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,160
This has implications in the study of

80
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:01,449
compulsive behaviour.

81
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:04,000
Just because you want to do something

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,639
doesn't mean you like it.

83
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,080
The rush of chemicals into our brains and bodies when we are

84
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,140
scared

85
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:14,179
help us. When the threats are real. But if the threats

86
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:17,620
aren't real, or if we are safely distant from them,

87
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,930
and merely spectating, the same chemicals still

88
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,790
appear, making us more attentive, more curious

89
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,910
and making it more difficult to look away.

90
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,139
In the early nineteen hundreds

91
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:35,009
EugÃ¨ne-Louis Doyen published incredible
images of corpses he cut

92
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:38,339
into stackable slices. The images

93
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:41,500
are amazingly macarbe but yet utterly

94
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,870
fascinating and a wonderful reminder of what we are

95
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,370
literally made of.

96
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,490
We often feel like we need an excuse,

97
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:54,509
like Halloween or anatomy homework, in
order to look at things like that

98
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:57,800
without coming across as a total weirdo. I mean

99
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,379
come on if you look too interested in
the macarbe it might look like you are

100
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:06,680
into, approve of or enjoy the gruesome.

101
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,879
Funny enough, that guilt may very well fuel

102
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:13,269
our desire to look in the first place. Sometimes

103
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:17,728
pressure to not do something can
actually make people more likely

104
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:19,529
to do that thing.

105
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:21,969
It's called The Boomerang Effect.

106
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:24,359
There are many different ways for things to

107
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,800
boomerang: one is The Streisand Effect,

108
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,220
when trying to suppress something unintentionally

109
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,080
makes it more widely distributed. In 2003

110
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:38,159
Barbra Streisand sued to suppress a photo

111
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,760
published online, as part of a
California Coastline Preservation Project.

112
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:45,789
One of the photos, the one she was trying to get rid of, showed

113
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,890
her house.

114
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,160
Within a month of the lawsuit going public

115
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,740
nearly half a million people had flooded
the website and downloaded the

116
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,430
picture. Before the suit only six people

117
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,470
had downloaded the image, two of which were her lawyers.

118
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,650
In a similar fashion, social pressures
and tabboos against viewing

119
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:07,759
disturbing things can make them more

120
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,089
interesting,

121
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:12,529
rarer and so a more valuable commodity, and also

122
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:17,500
free, in that deliberately viewing them can demonstrate to ourselves and others

123
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,939
that we are free and can do what we want.

124
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:24,259
Disturbing things can also make us feel

125
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,930
stronger, because their repulsiveness

126
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,189
is a challenge.

127
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,880
Glenn Sparks at Purdue University

128
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:35,379
has studied the way terrifying films affect us.

129
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:39,310
After watching them, viewers often feel stronger,

130
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,939
satisfied that they didn't chicken out, that they made it through,

131
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:46,639
they conquered something disturbing and were able to handle it.

132
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,819
It's almost a form of practice. As Stephen
King put it,

133
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:54,170
"We make up horrors to help us cope with the real ones".

134
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:58,530
On the more negative side, following
celebrity scandals or seeing

135
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:01,819
defeat on the faces of the rival team

136
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:05,120
can make you feel pretty good. It's
called

137
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,639
'Schadenfreude', which means harm joy; getting pleasure

138
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,800
from others misfortunes. Social comparison theory

139
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,460
describes and predicts behavior like this
although grades and

140
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:20,069
rankings cause anxiety, we nonetheless
possess

141
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:23,610
a drive to seek out evaluations of ourselves

142
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,389
in comparison to others, we especially
enjoyed the evaluations

143
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:29,129
that put us on top.

144
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:31,659
Now, causing other people to be

145
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,480
less well off sort of makes sense under this lens.

146
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,500
If its relative happiness you're
concerned with, trolling or harassing or griefing

147
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:44,120
other people sort of works, it doesn't make

148
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,829
you happier but compared to the people
you're annoying,

149
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:50,849
you are less annoyed.

150
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,960
So...

151
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:53,259
yay?

152
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,500
Viewing scenes of

153
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,539
anger and vengeance and violence

154
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,590
that don't even involve us can nonetheless cause

155
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:05,250
our own anger and aggression to burn off, as though they're being

156
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,569
satisfied. It's called catharsis,

157
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:14,620
a cleanser, a purification. Creating images and movies
and stories that play with our

158
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:17,790
emotions might be grasping at low

159
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:22,480
hanging fruit. A task beneath such logical
creatures as ourselves.

160
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,819
Or, it might be a powerful demonstration

161
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:29,189
of the fact that we have control, or at
least a leash,

162
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:32,009
around how we feel.

163
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:33,450
We condemn the actions

164
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,700
of serial killers but nonetheless often
treat them

165
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:41,759
like rock stars. Web sites like RedrumAutographs and Serial Killers Ink

166
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,259
sell autographs, souvenirs, trinkets
and works of art

167
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:48,360
made by real serial killers.

168
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:54,000
Some call it murderabilia. On a spectrum of
petty thrills and morose voyeurism

169
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,360
to complete overwhelming obsession and fear,

170
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,980
our relationship with the morbid is
complicatedm

171
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,139
but it is under our control if we're aware

172
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:08,189
of our actions. One of the most
constructive and socially important

173
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:12,820
uses of the morbid is the facilitation of meaning, acceptance

174
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,060
and empathy.

175
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,120
In his book 'Everyone Loves a Good Train Wreck'

176
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:20,649
Eric G. Wilson says that our attraction
to the macabre is

177
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:23,730
on some level a desire to experience

178
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,470
someone else's suffering.

179
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,649
Morbid curiosity is often about the
imagination.

180
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:33,730
Imagining what it would be like to be that
other person, what if that happened

181
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,990
to me? Could it happen to me?

182
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,120
Empathetic feelings remind us that our
time is limited

183
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,519
and that we are fragile and in doing so
bring us

184
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,360
closer together. Sure enough, the last
movie I watched it made me want to go

185
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,690
out and hug the very first friend I could find

186
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,950
wasn't a happy feel-good comedy. Instead,

187
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:58,420
it was Louis Theroux's somber 'Extreme Love Dementia'.

188
00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:00,299
Viewing unpleasant things

189
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:04,129
doesn't always make them less unpleasant
or any less real

190
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:07,809
but that's not always the point. Morbid
curiosity is

191
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:10,809
also about acceptance. Remember,

192
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:14,599
our brains are wired with motivations
to explore

193
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,200
unpleasant things, because doing so
can be preferable

194
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,879
to ignorance.

195
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:22,939
Gawking at morbidity is often about asking why?

196
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,560
There must be a reason, a meaning behind all of this.

197
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:31,409
When tragedy strikes or horrors are
revealed, we listen to experts give opinions,

198
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:35,199
neighbors describe the killer, we look for
signs that were missed

199
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,280
and confirmation that others feel the same
way we do,

200
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,159
that people are helping or making sure
justice

201
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:45,009
is served. Katelin Dodi the host of 'Ask a
Mortician'

202
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:48,689
here on YouTube just wrote a phenomenal book

203
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,230
'Smoke Gets in Your Eyes and Other
Lessons

204
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,649
from the Crematory'.

205
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,740
In the book she says

206
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,169
"accepting death doesn't mean that you won't be
devastated when someone you love dies,

207
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:04,129
it means you will be able to focus on
your grief, unburdened by bigger

208
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:05,830
existential questions, like

209
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,139
why do people die? And why is this
happening to me?

210
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:12,500
Death isn't happening to you, death

211
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,120
is happening to us all." That's heavy stuff

212
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,440
but acceptance like that is one of the
greatest things morbid

213
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,060
curiosity has to offer and don't worry,

214
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:26,489
there's a funny side to all of this, or at least

215
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,570
a funny side related to this

216
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,800
and how morbidity helps us make sense of the world.

217
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:38,569
A study in Finland found that children were four
times as likely to be scared

218
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:42,850
by their usual television programs if a parent

219
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,790
was in the room.

220
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:47,750
It surprised researchers
but one explanation lies

221
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,339
in the "Uh oh, Mom flinched theory".

222
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:55,500
The idea is that to a young child almost
everything is brand new

223
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,809
but parents are older, they're wiser, they know what's normal

224
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:03,239
and if they are scared of what's on TV

225
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,490
uh oh... How we feel and how we feel about
how we feel

226
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:13,669
is to a large degree learned. There's a
theory about the origin of humor

227
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:19,229
called the encryption theory of humor. It
suggests that one of the great roles humor

228
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:23,039
plays is in measuring who is inside and
who is outside,

229
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,919
who is similar and who is socially
or ideologically

230
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:30,578
too different. Jokes test what
researchers call

231
00:12:30,578 --> 00:12:34,159
unstated common knowledge the teller and
listener

232
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,480
both share.

233
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,579
So might we be

234
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:42,239
morbidly curious for the same reason we
enjoy telling jokes?

235
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,519
Jokes assess underlying shared

236
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,318
attitudes. Morbidity helps us asses shared

237
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:52,328
underlying attitudes of an existential

238
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,360
variety, morality and justice.

239
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,068
Whether it's used for empathetic or
exploitative reasons,

240
00:12:59,068 --> 00:13:02,370
morbidity and laughter may share

241
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:06,669
a similar adaptive role. We are morbidly
curious

242
00:13:06,669 --> 00:13:10,459
because we like to scream but more
strangely

243
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:14,100
the yuk...and the yuk yuk

244
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,920
overlap.

245
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,620
And as always,

246
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,399
thanks for watching.
