1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,589
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:09,800
The loudest clap
ever recorded clocked in at 113

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,740
decibels. And the world record for
fastest clapping was recently set at

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,929
802 claps per minute.
Clapping

5
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:22,379
is the most common human body noise others

6
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:26,288
are meant to hear
that doesn't involve the vocal cords.

7
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:29,750
It's a great built-in percussion instrument.

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,738
But clapping has also become a
collective social gesture that we use in

9
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:36,609
groups to express admiration,

10
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:39,808
approval.
Especially for things that happen

11
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:42,308
on stage.

12
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:48,519
So here I am on stage.
But to show approval, to show that they like

13
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:55,520
things, why do humans clap?
Amazing question!

14
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,560
When applauding, a person creates claps 
at a rate of about 2.5-5 claps per

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,379
second.

16
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:11,390
Kinetic energy from the hands is
converted into acoustic energy,

17
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,879
mainly within the 2200 to 2800 hertz

18
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,829
range, the frequencies clap on, clap off devices

19
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:23,420
detect.
But many other frequencies are created during a single

20
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:28,070
clap.
And different hand positions create different spectra

21
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:32,489
of frequencies, most of which are not
whole number multiples of each other,

22
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:33,978
which is why a clap

23
00:01:33,978 --> 00:01:37,170
can't make a musical note.
A discernible

24
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,700
definite pitch the way a clarinet or piano

25
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,840
or the human voice can.

26
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,879
If vocalisations can be so finely controlled,

27
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:51,719
why clap?
I mean, it's such a crude,

28
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:55,590
messy noise.
Well, at a fundamental

29
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,329
and physiological level the impulse to clap

30
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:03,140
may have originated as a reaction to an overflowing

31
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,450
of enthusiasm, an immediate and primitive reaction

32
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,580
to excitement.
Steven Connor colourfully puts it this way:

33
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,980
"If the distinctive sound of the human is the sound of

34
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:17,738
language, then sound produced
from other places than the mouth,

35
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:21,259
always has the taint of the gratuitous,

36
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:24,780
 the excessive, or the proscribed.

37
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,400
Clapping is the benign superflux of the body,
the diarrhoea

38
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,469
of sound."
He calls it a spilling over

39
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:37,019
of feeling.
A burst of energy unfiltered by language

40
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:41,349
or thought.
It's a way to burn off extra enthusiasm,

41
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:44,650
but if clapping is so natural and involuntary to the

42
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,860
individual,
how did it become coded into western

43
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,430
etiquette? An expected behavior you
sometimes feel pressured to do,

44
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,000
even if you don't want to.
Desmond Morris called

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,019
modern clapping patting a performer on the back

46
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:02,110
from a distance.
And other theories have called clapping

47
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,700
high fiving yourself for something someone else

48
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:09,739
has done.
But in its current form there is another thing

49
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:14,599
besides yourself and the performance
that might be truly driving

50
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:18,478
applause.
A super organism called

51
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,739
The Crowd. A study published in the
Journal of the Royal Society found that

52
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,568
an individual's contribution to applause
seems to have less to do with their

53
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:28,289
actual

54
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:32,000
opinion as to the quality of the
performance and has more to do with

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,189
the behavior

56
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:35,689
of the collective group,

57
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,039
the anonymous.
Group voice aspect of applause

58
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,520
also makes sense, when you consider
the fact that clapping is a great

59
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,650
equalizer. Studies have shown that, as
opposed to vocalizations, which can

60
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,750
betray a lot

61
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:55,400
about the people who make them,
subjects cannot guess better than chance,

62
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,219
whether the clap they hear
is from a man or a woman,

63
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:02,889
nor can they guess the size
of the individual, based solely

64
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:06,159
on the sound of their clap.
Clapping

65
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,530
may have become the standard nonverbal
gesture of admiration, because it is

66
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,129
arguably the loudest, the easiest
and the most democratic.

67
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:19,529
Performers can't here a thumbs-up or

68
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:23,109
a wink.
Not everyone can snap their fingers

69
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,788
and clapping is less disruptive than stomping feet or

70
00:04:26,788 --> 00:04:29,829
waving around big objects.
Moreover,

71
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:33,459
historically, authorities have encouraged

72
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:37,079
clapping.
In the sixth century BC,

73
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:41,000
Cleisthenes came to power in Ancient
Greece as a democratic reformer

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,680
and made behaviors like clapping a civic

75
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,978
duty, the proper way for the masses to express

76
00:04:48,978 --> 00:04:52,990
admiration for their leader.
There wasn't enough time for

77
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,060
everyone to meet and greet his or her leader,

78
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,949
but they could all greet their leader together,

79
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:03,168
as one super organism

80
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:08,310
with one voice - applause.
By the early 19th century

81
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,800
the desire to code appropriate group reactions and

82
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,408
encourage them by example was quite official.

83
00:05:15,408 --> 00:05:18,839
Agencies offered claques for hire,

84
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:21,839
professional applauders, who would memorize operas,

85
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,359
attend them, like normal opera goers, and clap,

86
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,830
cry or laugh at appropriate times, so that the

87
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,930
actual audience would know when to properly

88
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,478
do what.
It's interesting that five or

89
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:40,930
six months after being born human babies
begin to realize that their hands

90
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:46,540
can work together.
Clapping is a natural reaction to this realization

91
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,360
but parenting books have to advise parents to teach

92
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,569
their children to connect clapping with group

93
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:56,889
happiness and celebration.
The connection itself

94
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,389
not being inevitable.
To this day,

95
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:05,030
applause signs reinforce audience
behavior, simply because those with the

96
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:08,589
authority are requesting it.
Not because

97
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:12,319
it is a natural reaction
but because it can be, and

98
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,219
historically has been, socially imposed.

99
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,479
So, what's the future

100
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:23,849
of applauds?
Well, last week

101
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,050
I hung out with the guys from Grand Illusions,

102
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:31,870
really fascinating channel.
And they pointed out something strange.

103
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:38,120
How many times have you listened
to your favorite song?

104
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,610
Probably quite a few, right?
You've listened to songs you

105
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,030
don't like plenty of times.
But as recently

106
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:48,089
as a 150 year ago, people

107
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:51,849
only heard their favorite symphony

108
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:56,009
maybe two or three times in their entire

109
00:06:56,009 --> 00:07:00,229
life.
If you wanted music, you had to go to a concert

110
00:07:00,228 --> 00:07:04,050
or pick up an instrument or sing.
There was no other

111
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,228
way.
But now, because of recorded music,

112
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:11,258
MP3 players and phones and tablets and
personal computers and digital libraries

113
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:12,639
allow us to be an

114
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,120
audience of one.

115
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,900
An audience all by ourselves,
not just when professionals get together

116
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:23,448
and draw a crown.
In the 1990s,

117
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:27,379
Faith Popcorn gave this broader phenomenon a name:

118
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:30,600
cocooning.
The Internet, home entertainment,

119
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,770
cell phones, alarm systems, self-checkout,

120
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:36,959
filters for our personal air and water

121
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,978
are all paraphernalia of cocooning.

122
00:07:39,978 --> 00:07:45,360
A tendency toward more lonely,
solitary experiences in the last

123
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,229
30 years.
In my episode about the friend zone,

124
00:07:49,228 --> 00:07:52,430
I talk about how cocooning might be making

125
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:57,030
friendship, meeting new people
and new unexpected ideas

126
00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:00,459
a veining experience.

127
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:04,739
But applause is safe, right?
I mean, applause isn't about meeting new

128
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,199
people, it's about becoming them.

129
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:11,179
Becoming a super organism
that speaks with one

130
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:16,220
unindividuated roar.
And concerts and live performances are still

131
00:08:16,228 --> 00:08:20,019
big parts of our lives.
But what's fascinating

132
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:23,469
is that more entertainment is more available

133
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,400
than ever before.
And despite being TV shows,

134
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:30,469
movies, games and music, this

135
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,899
new entertainment is increasingly consumed

136
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:37,029
like books.
In solitude,

137
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:40,578
alone.
You don't need to applaud alone

138
00:08:40,578 --> 00:08:44,719
in a cocoon, but to be sure,
alone on the Internet we don't applaud but we do

139
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,069
like and share and favorite and retweet.

140
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:51,679
Those actions might be a sort of ersatz

141
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,129
applause.
In real life your clap is

142
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:58,529
lost in the crowd,
aggregated into the total sound.

143
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:02,549
And online, so are your likes and favorites.

144
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:05,719
They join a collective gesture as a sort of

145
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,449
digital applause. A pessimist might feel
like these new collective gestures are

146
00:09:11,448 --> 00:09:15,659
hollow, lonely, a sad replacement for actual

147
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:19,838
social experiences.
But what's really happening?

148
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,959
Because a like is not necessarily

149
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:27,179
lonely.
A retweet by its very nature isn't a clap

150
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:30,509
lost in the crowd, it's a clap that joins the crowd,

151
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:34,399
but is also traceable directly back to you.

152
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,129
Maybe cocooning, maybe the rise of applause

153
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:41,379
substitutes, like digital applause, is something

154
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:46,110
to be worried about, or maybe it's the
natural result of having so many

155
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,808
applause-worthy things just a few clicks away.

156
00:09:49,808 --> 00:09:54,129
We can't applaud all of them,
so we have evolved more scaleable

157
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:58,759
reactions, which, incidentally, are more personal,

158
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:01,779
instead of being pathetic clicks

159
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:06,350
from an increasingly isolated, cocooned population.

160
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,170
Digital applause might be like something
else that comes from cocoons

161
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:13,568
and having more of them.
Something beautiful.

162
00:10:13,568 --> 00:10:14,848
Butterflies.

163
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,480
And as always,

164
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,470
thanks for watching.
