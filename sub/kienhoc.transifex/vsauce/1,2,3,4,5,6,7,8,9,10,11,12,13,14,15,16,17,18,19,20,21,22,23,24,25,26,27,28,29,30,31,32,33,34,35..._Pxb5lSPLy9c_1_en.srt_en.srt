1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:05,519
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
Let's take a moment to recognize

2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,849
the heroes who count.
Canadian

3
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:12,769
Mike Smith holds the world record for
the largest number

4
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:16,730
counted to in one breath - 125.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,039
But the world record for the largest number

6
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,109
ever counted to belongs to Jeremy Harper

7
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:27,580
from Birmingham, Alabama.
In order to set the record,

8
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:31,500
Harper never left his apartment.
He got regular sleep,

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,579
but from the moment he woke up in the
morning until the moment he went to bed

10
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:35,280
at night,

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,079
Harper did nothing but count.
He streamed the entire process

12
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,329
over the Internet and raised money for
charity while doing it,

13
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:46,549
but after three months of counting

14
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:50,839
all day, every day, he finally reached the world record -

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,870
1 million.
Now, a million might not sound

16
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:58,759
like a lot, but think of this way.
One thousand

17
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:02,030
seconds is about 17 minutes,

18
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,650
but a million seconds is more than 11

19
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,100
days.
And a billion seconds, well,

20
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:15,298
that's more than 31 years.
There's no full video online of Harper counting all

21
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:16,400
the way to a million,

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,350
but you can watch John Harchick count
all the way to 100,000, if you have

23
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,298
74 hours to spare.

24
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,680
John also has some other channels.
One involves more than 300 videos

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,009
of himself eating carrots.
Another, more than 3,000 videos of himself

26
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:37,500
drinking water.
Many of John's videos

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,140
literally have no views.
They are as lonely as a video on YouTube can get.

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,450
A great way to find such videos is a website made

29
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:51,530
by Jon van der Kruisen.
This website auto plays videos on YouTube that no one

30
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,879
has yet watched.
John and Jeremy,

31
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,060
as well as Mike, the one breath counter
counted like this.

32
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,280
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and so on.
But that's not the only way to count.

33
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,259
And it doesn't seem to be the one we're
born with. Additive counting is the one

34
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:10,419
we're all familiar with,

35
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:13,859
where each next step is just one added

36
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,950
to the last.
But what if we multiply it by a number instead?

37
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:21,419
Well, that kind of counting is logarithmic, from

38
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:25,369
"arithmos" meaning number and "logos" meaning ratio,

39
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,689
proportion.
On this scale, similar distances

40
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:32,560
are similar proportions.
One is a third of three

41
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,769
and three is a third of nine.
Four is a third of 12 and so on.

42
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:42,090
Our brains perceive the world around us
on a logarithmic scale.

43
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,680
It's believed that almost all of our
senses are multiplicative,

44
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,590
not additive.
For example, how loud we perceive a sound to be.

45
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,909
Two boomboxes playing at the same volume
don't sound

46
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:59,319
twice as loud as one.
In order to make a sound that is perceived as being

47
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:02,680
about twice as loud as one boombox,
you actually need

48
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,290
ten times as many, so 10.
And to double that loudness,

49
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:10,349
you would need a hundred.
And to double that loudness,

50
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:13,870
you would need a thousand.
Having an intuitive sense

51
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,659
of logarithmic scales built into your brain
is probably an advantage when it comes

52
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:19,989
to natural selection

53
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:23,189
and survival, because often proportion

54
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:26,889
matters more than absolute value.
For example,

55
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:30,009
"is there one lion hiding over there in the shadows

56
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:33,289
or two?" is a very different question

57
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:36,289
than "are there ninety six lions about to attack us

58
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:41,679
or ninety seven?"
Sure, in both cases I'm just talking about one extra lion,

59
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,800
but adding one lion to one lion, doubles the threat.

60
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,400
Adding one lion to 96, well, that's basically nothing.

61
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,000
Logarithmic thinking and feeling may
explain why life

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
seems to speed-up as we get older.
It seems like I was a child

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,909
for ever.
And in college, in my early 20's, just whizzed by.

64
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,989
And logarithmically, that makes sense,
because each new year that I live

65
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:10,939
is the smaller fraction of all the other
years I've already lived.

66
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:13,949
When you turn 2 years old, the last year of your life is

67
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:18,039
half your life.
But when you turn 81, that last year that you've lived,

68
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,510
well, that's just a tiny part of the
other 80 that you know.

69
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,120
Logarithmic thinking isn't always helpful,

70
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:30,339
especially in scenarios where proportion
doesn't logically matter

71
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:33,389
but we, nonetheless, act like it does.

72
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:36,659
One of my favorite examples is
the psychophysics of price

73
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,820
paradox.
This is something almost all of us do.

74
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:43,449
Researchers found consistently that
people are willing to put a lot of

75
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,360
effort into saving

76
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,270
5 dollars of a 10 dollar purchase,
but they won't put much effort into

77
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:49,609
saving 5 five dollars

78
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,100
of a 2,000 dollar purchase.

79
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:57,760
It's 5 dollars saved either way,
but our natural obsession with proportion

80
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,269
leads us astray.
Take a look at these pictures.

81
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:07,769
Can you tell how many objects are in each of them?
You probably can.

82
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:11,719
It's like really easy.
You can tell if there are

83
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,830
zero, one, two, three or four objects in a photo

84
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:18,569
without even needing to count.
How are you doing that?

85
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,849
Is it some sort of sixth sense?
No.

86
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,510
Psychologists call it "subitizing."
We can, intuitively,

87
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:31,719
at a glance, determine whether there are
about four or fewer objects in a photo.

88
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,490
This has been part of human culture
for a very long time

89
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,310
and it may be the reason so many tally
systems from all over the world all

90
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,129
through history

91
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:44,079
wind up having to do something different
when counting the number five.

92
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,860
When estimating or comparing amounts above 4,

93
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,560
the brain uses what's known as an
approximate number system.

94
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,538
It's a psychological ability we have.
It's about 15 percent

95
00:05:55,538 --> 00:05:59,719
accurate. It two amounts are at least 15
percent different, we can tell.

96
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,280
So, for example, 100 objects and 115

97
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,609
or a thousand and 1,150 or 1,200.

98
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,509
If you wanna test the accuracy of your
approximate number system

99
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:13,560
Panamath has a pretty good test.
We often take

100
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,329
linear additive counting for granted,
but it's not granted to us.

101
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:21,329
We aren't born with it.
We are, however, born with the ability to subitize

102
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:25,449
and use an approximate number system.
Children younger than the age of three

103
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:29,288
can tell, without counting, that this line of 4 coins

104
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:32,719
contains fewer coins than this line of 6, even

105
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,190
if you spread the 4 coins out into a
line that is physically bigger,

106
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:41,170
longer than this line of 6.
However, mysteriously,

107
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,920
around the age of 3.5, children lose this ability

108
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,930
and begin saying that this line of 6 coins

109
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,439
contains fewer coins than this long line

110
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,879
of just 4 coins, possibly because around this age

111
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,540
the physical world of objects,
physical sizes, is more salient in their minds.

112
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,710
But then, when they begin to learn linear counting,

113
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:07,029
they reverse back and begin again
correctly saying that this line of 6

114
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:09,849
contains more coins than this line of 4,

115
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,460
around the age of 4.
The smallest

116
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:18,129
physical thing science could ever hope
to observe is the Planck length.

117
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:21,360
In order to look at anything smaller,
you'd need to have so much

118
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,480
energy concentrated in such a small area
a black hole would form and you would lose

119
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,700
whatever you were looking at.

120
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,660
Okay, with that in mind, here's a question.
What number

121
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,490
is halfway in-between 1 and 9.

122
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:38,459
5 seems like the obvious answer.

123
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:42,149
There are four numbers on either side of 5,
it's halfway between,

124
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:45,769
right?
Well, if you ask this question of a young child

125
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:50,168
or a member of a culture that doesn't
teach a linear additive number line,

126
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:54,079
their answer will be 3.
You see,

127
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,199
they are exhibiting the human mind's
natural logarithmic tendency,

128
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,250
because 3 in that sense makes sense.
Three

129
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,930
is three times larger than 1,
and 9 is three times larger than 3.

130
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:11,000
Three is in the middle, proportionately.
But what if we took that logarithmic number

131
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,668
line

132
00:08:11,668 --> 00:08:15,370
and change the one to be
the smallest thing we can observe,

133
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,379
the Planck length, and the nine to be the
largest thing we can observe,

134
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:22,649
the observable universe.
What would go

135
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:27,888
in the middle?
Well, as it turns out, we would.

136
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:31,319
The number of Planck lengths you could
stretch across a brain cell

137
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,838
is equal to the number of your brain
cells it would take to stretch

138
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:37,899
all the way across the observable universe. sold

139
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,479
So,

140
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,038
welcome to the middle.

141
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,538
And as always,

142
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:44,360
thanks for watching.

143
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:55,699
Hello again.

144
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:59,929
The YouTube channel Field Day recently
gave me an opportunity to explore

145
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:03,609
Whittier, Alaska, one of the strangest places

146
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,250
humans call home.
To see why and to see me investigate,

147
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,639
talk to the locals, click the link in
this video's description or on the

148
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,269
annotation here on this video.

149
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:15,769
It was really fun, so give it a little

150
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:16,278
lookie look.
