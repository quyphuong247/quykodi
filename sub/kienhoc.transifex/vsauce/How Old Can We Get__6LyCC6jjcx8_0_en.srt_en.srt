00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,429
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And today we are going to talk about time, specifically, how

2
00:00:06,429 --> 00:00:13,429
much time we have. What's the oldest a person
can ever be? Well, the world record for the

3
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:20,559
world's longest living person belongs to Jeanne
Calment, a French woman who lived to be 122.

4
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,969
Right now, at this very moment, there are
only 37 people alive who were born in the

5
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:34,119
1800's. Those 37 people have lived in three
different centuries. But, as medical knowledge

6
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:40,619
expands and our understanding of biology improves,
people are living longer, and longer. In fact,

7
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:45,679
scientists believe that, based on statistics,
the first person who will ever live to be

8
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:52,689
150 has already been born. It could be one
of you. But, according to the math, it's probably

9
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:56,169
someone who was born last year.

10
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:02,170
Here's the thing. As humans get older, the
likelihood of them dying increases, but there

11
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:08,820
are some types of animals that have what is
called Negligible Senescence, also known as

12
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:14,969
biological immortality, and these types of
animals have never been observed to actually

13
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:22,760
age. Animals, like the Hydra, can only die
because of accidents, disease, or predators.

14
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:30,609
The world's oldest living individual tree
has clocked in at more than 4,600 years old.

15
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:36,439
It's called the Methuselah Tree and it exists
somewhere in this forest. Government officials

16
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,710
won't actually release its exact location
to protect it from vandalism, but it's out

17
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:41,899
there.

18
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,160
The lifespan of an organism can be even longer
than that if you include clonal colonies.

19
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,019
For instance, these Quaking Pines all look
like individual trees, but they're actually

20
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:57,640
all clones of one genetic code. They all share
a root system, and the root system continues

21
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,170
to make more trees, meaning that these trees
are all part of the same organism, and experts

22
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:08,219
have calculated, based on the roots system,
that this one, male Quaking Pine has been

23
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:12,169
around for at least 80,000 years.

24
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:17,409
But let's get back to humans, and rather
than talking about how time is, let's talk about

25
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:24,139
how time feels. Intense moments of your life
are remembered as lasting much longer than

26
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:29,599
times that were relatively dull. Psychologists
say that the reason for this is that our brains

27
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,439
take deeper and richer memories of events
that are novel, or events that are intense,

28
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,719
than ones that aren't.

29
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:40,159
When your experiences are intense and novel,
you're not remembering more things about it,

30
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,859
but you are making more copies. Rather than
just making normal memories, during stress

31
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:49,330
the amygdala gets involved and also remembers
things, and many people believe that is why

32
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,969
intense moments are remembered as lasting longer.

33
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:58,609
This phenomenon becomes quite mind-blowing
on a macro-scale. Think of it this way: when

34
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:05,420
you are a one-year-old baby, one year represents
100 percent of your life, but when your turn

35
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:10,539
two years old, that second year was only half
your life, and the next year you live through

36
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:16,179
is only a third of your life, and by the time
you turn 80, one year only represents an 80th

37
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,360
of your life. Those percentages are important
because they may explain why your childhood

38
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,000
feels like it took so long, but as you get
older, the years seem to fly by.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You have more novel experiences when you're
young. You first learn a language, you first

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,740
see your mother, you first learn to walk,
you have your first kiss. These are all deeply

41
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:43,060
and richly remembered by your brain, and so,
later on, it feels as if they took longer

42
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,989
to happen.

43
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:47,909
Now, here's what's really mind-blowing. Let's
look at a graphical representation of the

44
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:53,969
percentage of your life that each successive
year is. The first year is 100 percent, the

45
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:59,000
second year is only half, the third year is
a third, and so-on will go all-the-way out to

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,300
80. Now, using this representation, under
this model, when you turn 80 years old and

47
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,540
look back at your life, the point that feels
like the middle isn't your 40's, it's your

48
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:10,739
early 20's.

49
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,920
The good news here is that the more novel things
you do, and things you see, and places you

50
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:19,560
visit, and people you meet, the slower time
feels, and the more rich it feels. So, go

51
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,519
out there and do something cool, do something
weird, do something new. Subscribe to Vsauce

53
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,920
And as always,
