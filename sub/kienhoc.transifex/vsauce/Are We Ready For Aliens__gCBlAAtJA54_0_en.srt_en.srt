1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,120
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
But what could be

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,919
out there?
The likelihood of extraterrestrial intelligence

3
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:12,500
has been the subject of an equation and the current lack

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,580
of any communication with aliens the subject

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:21,660
of a paradox.
But here's a different question. If we were to hear

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,339
from intelligent life beyond earth, what would really

7
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:28,778
happen next?
Well, no government

8
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:32,380
has ever officially adopted a post-detection policy.

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,460
And when asked how they would deal with
a confirmed message from

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,359
extraterrestrial intelligence,

11
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,619
the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs

12
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:44,759
simply said that their job does not
include any issues regarding

13
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:49,039
the question you pose.

14
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,210
So are we unprepared? Would chaos ensue?

15
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,539
These things are unlikely but the way

16
00:00:55,539 --> 00:01:00,789
we prepare for, and anticipate our
species encountering one from beyond

17
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:04,510
earth, is important and illuminating even though

18
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,868
improbable.
Historically, we have

19
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:11,750
acted as though alien life exists.
Back

20
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,629
contamination is a concern that a
man-made object returning from space

21
00:01:16,629 --> 00:01:20,509
could carry with it undiscovered alien
life forms, especially

22
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:23,989
viruses and bacteria that could wipeout

23
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:28,118
life on earth.
This was a serious concern

24
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:31,290
dealt by serious people when we first sent

25
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,520
humans to the Moon.
When Neil Armstrong,

26
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:37,798
Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin
returned from the lunar surface,

27
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,460
they didn't immediately hugged their
families and join a public parade.

28
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:46,859
Instead, they were sealed up in
biological isolation garments and flown

29
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,679
to a quarantine facility to be locked
away for three weeks,

30
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,790
in Houston, Texas.

31
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,729
By Apollo 15 the practice was
discontinued but forward contamination

32
00:01:57,728 --> 00:01:58,450
has also

33
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:04,680
been a real concern. When NASA sent the
Galileo spacecraft to serve a Jupiter

34
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,750
and its moons, it got amazing data

35
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,849
but there was a problem.
It had never been

36
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:14,810
sterilized.
Because life, even liquid water, could exist

37
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,840
on these moons, NASA made the decision to
avoid contaminating an

38
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,310
alien biosphere and the mission was over,
steered Galileo

39
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,280
into Jupiter, where it burned up and was destroyed,

40
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,310
along with any Earth life possibly.

41
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:35,689
on board.
So protocols and decisions have been officially made in

42
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:36,519
the past

43
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:40,269
under the assumption that aliens might exist.

44
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:43,539
When it comes to actually hearing from aliens,

45
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:47,109
receiving a message from
technologically advanced life forms,

46
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,350
capable of sending us

47
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:51,750
say, a radio signal, groups like SETI,

48
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,659
the search for extraterrestrial
intelligence, are other ones actively

49
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:56,469
listening.

50
00:02:56,469 --> 00:02:59,989
They have an ear to the sky.
And they

51
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:05,000
are prepared. The SETI committee of the
International Academy of Astronautics

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,489
created a declaration of principles
concerning activities following

53
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:13,110
the detection of extraterrestrial intelligence.

54
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,420
No government has officially adopted
any of its recommendations,

55
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:22,219
but if something were to happen,
it would likely be the first place

56
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:25,389
authorities went.
It's one of the only handbooks

57
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:30,078
they'd have. Seth Shostack explained the
philosophy in atmosphere at SETI,

58
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:33,680
predicting that because verifying a signal is slow,

59
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,700
and the media are fast, you will be media
blasted about a possible detection

60
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:42,229
days before the people who find it are
certain it's for real.

61
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:45,280
In the midst of rampant media speculation,

62
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,409
elation and panic on the part of the public,

63
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:51,659
the most likely string of official events,

64
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:55,479
after the discovery of a message from
extraterrestrial life,

65
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:58,639
would follow SETI recommendations.
First of all,

66
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,708
the individual or team who discovered the message

67
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:05,489
would continue to assess the credibility of the message

68
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,650
and alert all parties to SETI's declaration.
Next,

69
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,139
once they were certain the message was
real, the Central

70
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:16,489
Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams would be alerted,

71
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:19,529
so as to inform observers all over the world.

72
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:22,859
They would also inform the secretary-general

73
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,110
of the United Nations, because article 11

74
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,189
of the treaty on principles governing
the activities of states in the exploration

75
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:31,839
and use of outer space,
including the Moon and other bodies

76
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,679
says they should.
The first official news

77
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,439
we got, the public, would likely be in terms

78
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,839
of the Rio Scale.
First presented to the International

79
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,569
Astronautical Congress, the Rio Scale measures

80
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:52,339
the significance of consequences of
evidence of extraterrestrial life,

81
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:56,959
making it a likely tool to be used,
because it neatly manages public

82
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,668
reaction. There's a great online
calculator you can play with to see how

83
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:01,870
the Rio scale

84
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,949
works.
It takes into account the credibility of the message

85
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:09,280
on a scale from believed extraterrestrial origin to

86
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,388
hoax, how repeatable the observation is,

87
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:16,389
what type of message it is, for instance,
is it uninterpretable

88
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:19,990
or clearly for us and how far away it is.

89
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,460
Is it extra galactic or near enough that
we could respond and hear back

90
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:28,899
within the length of a human lifetime.
Seth Shostak and Ivan Almar

91
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:32,418
applied the Rio scale to fictional and historical

92
00:05:32,418 --> 00:05:36,159
events. It's a great way to get a feel for
how the Rio scale will affect

93
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,280
vocabulary

94
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,799
authorities use when reporting on an extraterrestrial

95
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,000
message.
They considered the Moon monolith,

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,310
discovered in 2001: A Space Odyssey, a

97
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,560
6 on the Rio scale - noteworthy.

98
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,720
In the movie Independence Day,
the initial unidentified signal would be

99
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,150
about

100
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:58,289
4 to 8, moderate too far-reaching.

101
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,740
Once the message is confirmed to be no
further than the Moon and moving,

102
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,079
it would be an automatic 10, extraordinary.

103
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:09,788
In real life, the Martian Face, discovered in 1976,

104
00:06:09,788 --> 00:06:15,839
was a 2 - low. Until high resolution
images from 2001 revealed it was

105
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,369
nothing, just a thing that looked funny
under the right conditions

106
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,348
and was immediately downgraded to zero, no

107
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:27,529
significance.
So if we were to receive a message from

108
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:31,948
extraterrestrial intelligence,
those things in those words

109
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:36,319
would likely be used.
But who would be in charge?

110
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,449
Although she denies ever being selected
or prepared for such a role,

111
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:43,900
Mazlan Othman, the director at the
United Nations Office for Outer Space

112
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:45,370
Affairs

113
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,468
is a pretty good candidate.
As is Paul

114
00:06:48,468 --> 00:06:52,560
Davies, the chairman of SETI's post
detection task force.

115
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,228
Were it to be necessary, both of those
people are in positions to become

116
00:06:57,228 --> 00:07:00,318
ambassadors for earth-alien

117
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,629
relations.
So what do we say back?

118
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:07,180
Well, if we want to show that we are
intelligent, perhaps we should send back

119
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,259
a string of information representing Pi

120
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:14,580
or the Fibonacci sequence.
Or

121
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:17,870
maybe we shouldn't say anything at all.

122
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,030
Stephen Hawking warned, quote,

123
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:24,609
"If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much

124
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,590
as when Columbus landed in America,
which didn't turn out well

125
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:32,839
for the Native Americans."
And professor Simon Conway Morris,

126
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:36,179
a Cambridge University palaeontologist has said that

127
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,300
if the cosmic phone rings,

128
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,780
we shouldn't pick it up.

129
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,860
Observations like that

130
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:50,000
are at the core of the importance of
this video's question. We can learn a lot

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,930
by looking, not just at how we prepare for
a space message,

132
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:57,660
but how we imagine actual contact with aliens

133
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,110
going.
Anthropologist Katherine Denny

134
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,689
frequently points out that the ways we
imagine a contact with aliens

135
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:09,279
happening often says more about ourselves

136
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,299
than it does any hypothetical aliens.
We do this

137
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,840
all the time.
When we project our own
modern-day ambitions and fears onto

138
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,439
prehistoric people,

139
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,579
Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jethá call that

140
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:26,620
"flintstoning."
So let's piggyback off of that phrase

141
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:31,449
and label any projection of modern human
behaviors, desires, anxieties

142
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:35,809
onto futuristic, technologically advanced
beings capable of visiting us

143
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:40,119
"jetsonsing."
Some examples of jetsonsing involve

144
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,120
thinking that any aliens out there
trying to contact us

145
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,149
might want to hurt us. Maybe that's
simply because whenever we have met new

146
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:49,799
people,

147
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:52,899
we often enslave them or

148
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:57,870
pity them or take advantage of them.
It's also possible to think that aliens

149
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,950
will be friendly.

150
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,040
They'll want to help us.
The ways we imagine them helping us

151
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,169
say a lot about the kind of help we
think we need.

152
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:09,169
There's a poetic idea that from space Earth

153
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:12,769
looks peaceful.
All of the boundaries we have put

154
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:16,929
up don't exist, you can't see them.
But that's not

155
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:21,899
entirely true.
The old boundary between East and West Germany

156
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:25,750
is still visible from space,
each side using different

157
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:30,120
lightbulbs.
And this is the boundary between Pakistan

158
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,399
and India.
You can see from space India

159
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:37,620
flooding the border with lights to
deter smugglers from bringing across

160
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,639
weapons

161
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,000
and ammunition.
We don't all get along together here

162
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:46,809
on earth, we are afraid of each other,
we don't trust each other

163
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:49,899
and the wrinkles and scars that causes

164
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:52,919
are visible from space.
Imagining how

165
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:56,669
aliens would interpret that,
communicate with us and how we would

166
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:59,729
or should respond teaches us

167
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,149
a lot about ourselves.
It makes our struggles

168
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:07,809
strange again.
Less ignorable. And that is the entire point

169
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:13,250
of fantasy. G. K. Chesterton said that the
function of the imagination is not

170
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,169
to make strange things settle,
so much as to make

171
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:20,879
settled things strange.
