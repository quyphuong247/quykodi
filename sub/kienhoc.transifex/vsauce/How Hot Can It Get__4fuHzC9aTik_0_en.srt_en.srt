1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:03,969
Hey, Vsauce.

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:09,309
Michael here. And my tea is quite hot,
but it's not the hottest thing in the

3
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:10,109
universe.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,960
So what is?
I mean, we know that there is an absolute zero,

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,868
but is there an absolute hot?
A point at which something is so hot

6
00:00:19,868 --> 00:00:23,899
it can't get any hotter.
Well to find out, let's begin

7
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:28,189
with the human body.
Your internal temperature

8
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:32,090
is not constant.
37 degrees, 98.6.

9
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,960
Sure. But those are averages.
Your body's internal temperature fluctuates

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,780
by about one degree Fahrenheit -

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,980
half a degree Celsius - throughout the day in a cycle.

12
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:46,369
Assuming you sleep at night, at 4:30 in the morning

13
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:50,409
your body reaches its coolest natural
healthy temperature.

14
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:54,279
And at 7 p.m. it reaches its highest.

15
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,629
But a dangerous fever is not good.

16
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:01,269
108 degrees Fahrenheit is almost always

17
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,079
lethal.
The highest recorded air temperature across

18
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:08,349
all of Earth has happened four times in Death

19
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:12,640
Valley, where it has reached 129

20
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,228
degrees Fahrenheit.
180 degrees Fahrenheit is the recommended

21
00:01:17,228 --> 00:01:18,640
temperature for water

22
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,019
when brewing coffee.
And at 210 degrees Fahrenheit,

23
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:23,920
a cake is done.

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,739
2,000 degrees Fahrenheit is the
temperature of lava

25
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:32,789
fresh outta the ground.
But come on. Make your own lava

26
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,020
like Green Science Pro. This guy uses
Fresnel lenses to focus the sun's

27
00:01:38,019 --> 00:01:42,158
energy onto whatever he wants.
This is a small piece of obsidian,

28
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,340
volcanic glass, which he can melt into actual lava

29
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,909
right in his backyard.
Keep in mind that the Sun is having that effect

30
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,450
even though it is 93 million miles away from

31
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,899
Earth.
Right up on the surface of the Sun is a different story.

32
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,379
The surface clocks in at 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit,

33
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:06,000
but the centre, where fusion occurs, is ridiculous.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,139
Temperatures there reach 28

35
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:12,759
million degrees Fahrenheit, which is also known

36
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:16,068
as 15 million Kelvin.
The Kelvin scale

37
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:19,369
has units that are the same size as a Celsius degree,

38
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,709
but it's an absolute scale, where 0 is

39
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:27,390
absolute zero. When matter reaches
temperatures as high as those found in

40
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:28,609
the centre of the Sun,

41
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,989
an enormous amount of energy is radiated

42
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:35,319
away.
If you were to heat only the head

43
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:38,619
of a pin to the temperature of the centre of the Sun,

44
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,879
it would kill any person within 1,000 miles of it.

45
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,709
Speaking of which, the energy emitted by an object

46
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:50,219
often tells us a lot about the temperature

47
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:54,060
of that object.
Any object over absolute zero

48
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,318
emits some form of electromagnetic radiation.

49
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:00,759
You and me, we don't glow visibly, but we do emit

50
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:05,250
infrared light.
We can't see it, but infrared cameras

51
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,639
can.
WBT has great videos

52
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,639
and here he is, hiding inside an opaque black

53
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:15,449
trash bag.
Now, we can't see him, but his body is

54
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:19,658
infra-redly glowing through it.
If you want something to be the right

55
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,269
temperature to glow in the

56
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:24,739
visible spectrum, you'll have to reach the Draper point,

57
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:29,849
about 798 Kalvin.
At this point almost any object

58
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:33,878
will begin to glow a dead red.

59
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:37,179
We can calculate the expected wavelength of radiation

60
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,900
coming off of an object because of its
temperature and that wavelength

61
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,408
gets smaller and smaller the hotter and
hotter the object gets.

62
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:50,120
It goes from radio waves to microwaves
up through infrared divisible,

63
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,069
all the way to x-rays and gamma-rays,
which are created in the middle

64
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:57,318
of our Sun.
At temperatures as hot as the Sun,

65
00:03:57,318 --> 00:04:02,378
matter exists in a fourth state.
Not solid, not liquid, not gas,

66
00:04:02,378 --> 00:04:06,840
but instead, a state where the electrons
wander away from the nuclei

67
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,549
plasma. If you've watched my temperature
lean back you know that you could make

68
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:14,269
plasma by microwaving fire

69
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,500
But don't do it. Besides, our Sun isn't
even close to being the hottest thing in

70
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,490
the universe.

71
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,410
I mean, sure, 15 million Kelvin is pretty incredible,

72
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,760
but the peak temperature reached during
a thermonuclear explosion

73
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,050
is 350 million

74
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,470
Kelvin, which hardly counts,
because the temperature is achieved

75
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,389
so briefly.
But inside the core of a star,

76
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:46,560
8 times larger than our Sun,

77
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,139
on the last day of its life,
as it collapses in on itself,

78
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:54,340
you would reach a temperature of 3

79
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:58,289
billion Kelvin.
Or if you wanna be cool,

80
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,810
3 GigaKelvin.
But let's get hotter.

81
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,509
At 1 TeraKelvin, things get weird.

82
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:10,079
Remember that plasma we were talking
about that the Sun is made of?

83
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,909
Well, at 1 TeraKelvin, the electrons
aren't the only thing that wander away.

84
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,010
The hedrons themselves, the protons and
neutrons in the nucleus

85
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:22,389
melt into quirks and gluons,

86
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,500
a sort of soup.
But how hot

87
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,399
is a TeraKelvin?
Frighteningly hot.

88
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:33,149
There's a star named WR

89
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:37,049
104, about 8,000 light years away from us.

90
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,168
Its mass is the equivalent of 25

91
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:44,319
of our Suns, and when it dies,

92
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:49,060
when it collapses, its internal
temperature will be so great

93
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,910
that the energy emitted,
the gamma radiation it flings out into space

94
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,360
will be stronger than the entire amount
of energy our Sun

95
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,080
will ever create in its entire lifetime.

96
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,160
Gamma ray bursts are quite narrow,

97
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,479
so Earth is most likely safe,
but what if it wasn't?

98
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:10,788
Well, when WR 104 collapses,

99
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:15,139
even though Earth is 4,702 trillion miles away,

100
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:17,610
the energy it releases

101
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,639
would still be bad news.
Exposure for 10 seconds

102
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,949
would mean losing a quarter of Earth's ozone layer,

103
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:28,908
resulting in mass extinction, food chain depletion

104
00:06:28,908 --> 00:06:30,509
and starvation

105
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,560
from 8,000 light years away.
Closer to home,

106
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:39,639
right here on earth in Switzerland,
scientists have been able to smash

107
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,560
protons

108
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,759
into nuclei, resulting in temperatures much

109
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,229
larger than 1 TeraKelvin.
They've been able to reach the

110
00:06:47,228 --> 00:06:50,318
2 to 13 ExaKelvin range.

111
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,509
But we are okay, because those temperatures last

112
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:57,699
for an incredibly brief moment and only
involve a small number

113
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:03,460
of particles. Remember how we could
calculate the wavelength of the

114
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:06,430
radiation emitted by an object based on its temperature?

115
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,069
Well, if an object were to reach a temperature

116
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:14,039
of 1.41 times 10 to the 32

117
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:20,389
Kelvin, the radiation it would admit would
have a wavelength of 1.616

118
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:24,490
times 10 to the -26th nano meters,

119
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,179
which is tiny.

120
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,699
Like so tiny, it actually has a special name.

121
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:37,568
It is the Planck distance,
which according to quantum mechanics

122
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:41,550
is the shortest distance possible in our universe.

123
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:45,459
Okay, well what if we added

124
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:50,180
even more energy?
Wouldn't the wavelength get smaller? It's supposed to,

125
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,750
but yet it can't.
This is where we've got a problem.

126
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,478
Above 1.41 times 10 to 32 Kelvin,

127
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:01,689
the Planck temperature,
our theories don't work.

128
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:05,339
The object would become hotter than

129
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:08,758
temperature.
It would be so hot

130
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,759
that what it is would not be considered a

131
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,879
temperature. Theoretically, there is no
limit to the amount of energy we could

132
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:17,278
keep

133
00:08:17,278 --> 00:08:21,430
adding into the system.
We just don't know what would happen

134
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,250
if it got hotter than the Planck temperature.
Classically,

135
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,639
you could argue that that much energy in
one place would instantly cause a black

136
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,569
hole to form.

137
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:34,588
And a black hole formed from energy
has a special name -

138
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:38,419
a Kugelblitz.
So basically, what I'm trying to say

139
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:42,908
is when you want to tell someone you
like that you think they are

140
00:08:42,908 --> 00:08:46,740
hot, so hot that not even science can
understand it,

141
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,299
just call them a Kugelblitz.
Finally,

142
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:54,370
here is something fun.
The Sun

143
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,870
is about 4.7 billion years old,
about halfway through its life cycle

144
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,589
and so far it has burned 100

145
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:04,010
Earths worth

146
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:07,620
of fuel, which sounds like a lot, but the Sun

147
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,259
is the size of 300,000 Earths.

148
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:15,860
Because of that discrepancy, you can
have a lot of mathematical fun comparing

149
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:20,850
your energy output to the Sun's.
The Sun is way hotter than us

150
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,399
and it puts out way more energy than us.
Bad Astronomy had a lot of fun with this one

151
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:29,379
and although it doesn't really mean
anything, it is technically true,

152
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:32,480
because of the Sun's enormous size, that one

153
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,570
cubic centimeter of human puts out more

154
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:39,480
energy than an average cubic centimetre of

155
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,460
the Sun.
Which should make you feel

156
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,600
quite warm inside.

157
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,840
И, как всегда, спасибо за смотрящий.
[I, kak vsegda , spasibo za smotryashchiy.]
