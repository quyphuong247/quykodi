1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,220
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
Ten

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,730
centimeters - about four inches.
This

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,809
is how much taller on average people

4
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:13,039
are today than they were 150

5
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,339
years ago.
Better nutrition and medical care

6
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:20,670
early in life has allowed us to better
take advantage of the blueprints

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,830
within our genes.
Blueprints that carry plans for just how

8
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:28,139
big a healthy human being can get given

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,670
an optimal environment.
In terms of height, those plans

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,170
rarely exceed 7 feet 6 inches.

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,239
But individuals with endocrine disorders,
for instance a tumour,

12
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:44,030
near the pituitary gland in the brain
can experience growth that occurs more

13
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,450
rapidly and for a longer period of time

14
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,500
than usual.
For instance, Igor Vovkovinskiy,

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,058
who at 7 foot 8 inches is the
tallest man currently living

16
00:00:55,058 --> 00:00:59,078
in America.
The tallest living person anywhere on Earth

17
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:02,948
is Sultan KÃ¶sen, who at 8 foot 3 inches tall

18
00:01:02,948 --> 00:01:06,459
also holds the Guinness world record for largest hands

19
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:09,529
and feet.
But the tallest person

20
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,849
ever officially recorded was Robert Wadlow.

21
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:17,239
He was the size of an average adult male
when he entered

22
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:21,158
kindergarten at the age of 5.
When he died

23
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,219
in 1940 at the age of 22, he was

24
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:27,989
8 foot 11 inches tall.
Andre the Giant

25
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:30,989
was 7' 4".
And this

26
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:34,309
is me holding a 12-ounce can.

27
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,840
Here's Andre doing the same.
Human size variation

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,590
is fascinating, but what's the maximum, biologically

29
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,219
how big can a human get?
And more importantly,

30
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:51,618
how big are you really?

31
00:01:51,618 --> 00:01:55,060
It turns out that today, now

32
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,450
in history, average human height

33
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,630
is probably quite near the genetic

34
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:06,359
limit.
By manipulating the very genes responsible for height,

35
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,318
we may be able to add an extra 15
centimeters or so to that

36
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,119
average, but beyond that we are likely to hit

37
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,659
a ceiling.
In order to regularly produce

38
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:21,250
people over 8 feet tall, 2.44 meters,

39
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,259
those people would probably need to be

40
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:28,299
a different shape.
Not human shaped.

41
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,300
This is because of the square-cube law.

42
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,819
As a shape grows, say, taller,
its volume increases at a greater rate.

43
00:02:36,818 --> 00:02:41,119
Take a look at this cube.
If we make it 10 times larger,

44
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,610
well, sure, it's 10 times as tall,
but the area covered by its faces

45
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,209
is 100 times larger and its volume,

46
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:53,400
the space within it, is 1000 times larger.

47
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,900
Now, since weight is connected to volume, this cube

48
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,090
only has one hundred times the
cross-sectional area to support itself,

49
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,950
but one thousand times the weight to support.

50
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:08,199
So, if you were ten times larger,

51
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:12,359
and still shaped like a person, that is
your proportions were the same as they

52
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,129
are now,

53
00:03:13,128 --> 00:03:17,639
you would need to either have a skeleton
made out of something stronger than bone

54
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:22,359
or bones that were monstrously thick,
like way out of proportion.

55
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,159
But even if you solved the bone and
muscle strength problem,

56
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:29,650
there would still be a whole host of
other issues. For instance, your heart

57
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,099
wouldn't scale up fast enough to
keep blood pumping throughout a body

58
00:03:33,098 --> 00:03:37,488
that large.
Animals can get that big,

59
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:41,549
because their proportions
and organs are quite different.

60
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:45,290
Chris Howard from Earth Unplugged 
tipped me off to the

61
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:48,298
giant, not human proportioned, legs

62
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,610
of the largest land animal ever known to
have existed with

63
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,680
the certainty of a complete skeleton,

64
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,950
the awesomely named giraffatitan.

65
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:04,188
Discovered in Tanzania and now mounted
in Berlin's Humboldt museum

66
00:04:04,188 --> 00:04:08,699
it probably weighed 20 to 30 thousand kilograms.

67
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:13,268
The Bruhathkayosaurus may have been even larger,

68
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:17,470
but this is controversial because we
only have a few of its bones.

69
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,650
Estimates put this guy at 140,000

70
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:24,409
kilograms.
Any larger than that,

71
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,490
and in order to survive long enough to reproduce,

72
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,970
an animal would need more buoyancy to
counteract its weight

73
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,630
than air can provide.
This is one of the reasons

74
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:37,959
blue whales love the water so much.

75
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:41,599
The heaviest blue whale ever measured by NMML

76
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,699
weighed in at 177,000 kilograms,

77
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:49,750
making it the heaviest animal we are aware of

78
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:54,189
that has ever existed.
It might be the heaviest

79
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:59,079
possible, because animal size is limited
by simple geometry

80
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:02,139
and the gravity of our planet.

81
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:07,060
Theoretically, humans born on Mars could
grow a few inches taller,

82
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,800
because gravity there is only one third
of what it is on earth.

83
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,250
The trade off of course being that their
bones and muscles wouldn't grow strong

84
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,038
enough

85
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,228
for them to ever visit Earth and

86
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:23,360
enjoy it. The point is, in order to have
the same shape and proportions that we

87
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,639
have now,

88
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,810
we can't really get that much bigger.

89
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,009
Some of the higher estimates of the upper
limit up

90
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:34,879
average human height are around 7 feet tall.

91
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,319
A person who is more than 9 feet
tall would struggle to move around.

92
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:42,870
aAd up in the 12- to 15-foot range, it would be

93
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,709
difficult to live very long at all.

94
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:49,839
But what does size mean?

95
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:52,939
Where do you really begin

96
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:57,180
and end?
So far we have been measuring people using

97
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,759
their rigid boundaries.
It's a good one to use,

98
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,860
it's very common, but of course, when I speak

99
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,740
I can fill an entire room and when I shout

100
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,009
I can fill city blocks.
That's

101
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:15,930
huge.
Of course, my voice is not a part of my physical body.

102
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,470
It's not part of the matter that fits
within my skin container.

103
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,680
But it's relevant to the question of how big

104
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,810
a person is.
How large of an

105
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,310
impact on their environment can a person
have using what comes directly

106
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,189
from their bodies?
Well, Guy Murchie illustrated this quite well

107
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:38,810
in his tome "The Seven Mysteries of Life."

108
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,000
The little solid dogs are small,

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,550
but their sound and smell extend into
shapes and sizes no creature could even

110
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,389
dream

111
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:50,650
of filling up with their bodies on earth.

112
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:53,709
Let's begin with sound.
How far

113
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:58,129
can your loudest shout travel?
How much bigger are you?

114
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:02,240
The volume of space within which people
are aware that you exist

115
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,550
when you shout.
Well, the loudest shout a human can make is about

116
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,990
88 decibels from 30 centimeters away.

117
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,280
A shout like that will die out down below
the threshold of human hearing

118
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:17,848
in our atmosphere, after traveling about 5

119
00:07:17,848 --> 00:07:22,379
kilometres or 3 miles.
A person standing downwind from you

120
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:25,449
might be able to make you out a little
further than that,

121
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:28,919
but the point is, in space no one

122
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:34,098
can hear you scream.
And on earth, from 5 kilometres away,

123
00:07:34,098 --> 00:07:38,000
no one can hear you scream.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,038
But could they see you scream?
Really, could they see you

125
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:45,038
at all?
Well, on the surface of the earth,

126
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,050
the furthest you can see another person is

127
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,800
the horizon.
If you and another person are standing on the ground,

128
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,930
that distance is about 5 kilometers

129
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,579
or 3 miles. Any further away than that
and you will literally be hiding

130
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:03,029
behind the curvature of the earth.
So what about

131
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:08,568
in, say, outer space, where moving away
from another person doesn't mean

132
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:14,098
eventually hiding behind the earth.
Well, as an object moves farther and farther away,

133
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:17,259
it becomes smaller and smaller.
Of course, the

134
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:21,210
actual size of the object doesn't change.
What does change to you

135
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:27,068
is its angular size.
This brilliant measurement describes how much

136
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:31,020
space in your visual field an object takes up.

137
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:34,179
Imagine your visual field as a complete

138
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:38,918
circle, 180 degrees of which go from the
horizon in front of you

139
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:43,240
to the horizon behind you.
So, an object with an angular size

140
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,709
of 90 degrees would have to be big enough

141
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:51,129
and close enough, so as to take up all
the space from the horizon

142
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:54,320
to right above you.
Interestingly, your

143
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,269
thumb held at an arm's length away from your face

144
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:02,620
takes up about one degree of your visual field.
Its size

145
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,730
is 1 degree.
The Moon takes up about

146
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,980
half a degree at all times.
It sometimes appears

147
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,820
larger at the horizon, but that's because
of an illusion that AsapSCIENCE

148
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,610
covered

149
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,820
really well. 
Te smallest angular size we can see with the naked eye

150
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,980
is about one arc minute, a sixtieth

151
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,759
of a degree. But given enough contrast,
we can see things like Sunspots,

152
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:30,929
a mere 20 arc seconds across,

153
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:35,620
a third of a sixtieth of a degree.
Plugging in numbers to do the math

154
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,028
will tell us that with perfect conditions:

155
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:43,809
outer space, no air, no obstructions,
a lot of contrast, because you are wearing

156
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:47,069
bright white, the farthest away

157
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,510
a person could see you with their naked
eye would be about

158
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:53,879
10 to 15 kilometres.

159
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:57,000
Any further away than that and they will
have passed the edge

160
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,759
of your naked eye visibility existence.

161
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,789
But... do you smell that?
It might be

162
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:10,028
you.
If we consider the senses of other animals,

163
00:10:10,028 --> 00:10:14,200
your smell, your scent, might be your

164
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,390
largest earthly dimension.

165
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:20,909
You know how animals like cats and dogs
have those cute little

166
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:23,958
wet noses?
It's called

167
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:28,389
a rhinarium.
Rhinariums allow mammals to smell

168
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:32,769
really really well.
They don't just pick up molecules that float by,

169
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:36,549
they localize them.
Air cools the wet nose,

170
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:40,549
allowing the animal to tell the source of the smell.

171
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:43,289
It's the same as when you wet your
finger and stick it in the air to tell

172
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:44,969
the wind's direction.

173
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,410
A Bloodhound can pick up and trace to you

174
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:51,740
a scent trail that is days old,

175
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,379
making your scent imprint on the earth

176
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:58,970
about as large as you can move in a couple days.

177
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,759
But the Silvertip grizzly has a sense of smell that is

178
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:06,419
seven times stronger that a Bloodhound.

179
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:10,629
These guys can smell things from 18 miles away,

180
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:14,559
nearly 30 kilometres.
That's probably

181
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,469
the largest bubble we could draw around you

182
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:22,209
and still call you, because it contains

183
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:26,449
things that you omitted that can be
traced back to you by other living

184
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,050
things.

185
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:31,419
But if we include everything you emit,

186
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:35,389
well, fundamentally we're limited to the edges of earth's

187
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:39,169
atmosphere,
because with the exception of a few light molecules,

188
00:11:39,169 --> 00:11:42,360
hydrogen, helium, which escape into space,

189
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,870
not much else leaves. There's no medium in
space for your sound and smells to

190
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,500
travel through.

191
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,559
Which brings us back to light.

192
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:57,109
The human body emits light,
electromagnetic radiation.

193
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,200
Most of it is infrared light,

194
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,399
heat.
But some of it lies within the visible spectrum,

195
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,639
though it's about 1,000 times dimmer than
the dimmest light

196
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,620
the eye can see.
It seems that what little visible light you

197
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,269
do emit is tied in some way to your circadian rhythms,

198
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,730
meaning that around 4 p.m. everyday,

199
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,430
you are literally visibly the brightest

200
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:28,799
you will be all day.
But here's the thing about light, about

201
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,799
electromagnetic radiation.
It doesn't need a medium to travel through. It just

202
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,069
keeps going

203
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:39,490
out into and through space,

204
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,129
which of course brings us to Australia.

205
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:46,990
If you're not subscribed to Derek's channel Veritasium

206
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,990
I don't know what you're doing with your life.
It is amazing

207
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,019
and he recently made a video that I have
not been able to stop thinking about.

208
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:57,570
The smallest possible piece of light

209
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,680
is a photon and the human eye can

210
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:05,039
kind of perceive individual photons,
a bit better than chance.

211
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:10,149
But some frogs can see individual
photons quite well.

212
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:14,250
Now, in his video he explains that,
as you move away from the Sun,

213
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:19,100
its angular size gets smaller and
smaller and smaller, until eventually

214
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,120
you're so far away from the Sun that you
can no longer see it.

215
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,519
But it's still there and it is still emitting light

216
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,679
that can reach your eye, except now

217
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:35,379
that light has been spread so thin
it's not big packets of light you can

218
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:36,309
see,

219
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:39,319
it's just individual photons.

220
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,360
The Sun is still there, it's just less frequent.

221
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,409
Sometimes a photon hits your eye,

222
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:49,969
sometimes nothing and sometimes a photon again.

223
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:53,720
Well, the same thing happens to radiation emitted

224
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,899
by you.
I Skyped with Derek this afternoon

225
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:05,899
and he calculated that the human body,
seen at a distance of 168,000 kilometres

226
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:08,419
would also be reduced to merely

227
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:11,879
a few individual photons.

228
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:15,528
Further than that and your size would

229
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:18,639
no longer get smaller, it would just

230
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,620
remain individual photons flying through space,

231
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,889
they are, after all, indivisible.
So,

232
00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:29,778
your physical size is limited by geometry

233
00:14:29,778 --> 00:14:33,009
and biology and gravity.
Your

234
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:36,360
vocal and fragrant size can be bigger

235
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,970
but it still limited by the size of Earth.

236
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,490
But your light, your personal

237
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:47,528
glow, isn't really bounded by anything.

238
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:52,000
The photons that you are emitting right
now, the ones that don't get absorbed by

239
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
anything,

240
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,149
have no reason to ever really stop.

241
00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:00,458
And they can continue conceivably past
even the observable

242
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,578
universe, making you,

243
00:15:03,578 --> 00:15:07,039
in a way, completely huge

244
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,480
and kind of immortal.

245
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:11,000
And as always,

246
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,539
thanks for watching.
