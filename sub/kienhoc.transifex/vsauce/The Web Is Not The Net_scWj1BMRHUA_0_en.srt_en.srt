1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,330
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,540
Mimas is one of Saturn's cutest moons.

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:10,650
Its entire surface area is about the
same as

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,798
Spain but its giant crater makes it look like the

5
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:18,618
Death Star. And when NASA made a temperature map

6
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:22,868
of Mimas, they found that the warmest
regions, shown here in yellow,

7
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:26,278
resemble Pac-Man eating the crater

8
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:29,518
like a dot. I learned about Mimas whilst

9
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,939
surfing the world wide web like a true internaut.

10
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:35,960
But the Web and the

11
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,899
Internet are different things. The World
Wide Web

12
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,329
and the Internet have names that are
similar shapes but they

13
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:47,878
catch different things. And, as we will see,

14
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:51,269
surfing the world wide web is radical

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,690
but it's also apropos. Metaphorically speaking

16
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:58,509
the web is pretty wet.

17
00:00:58,509 --> 00:01:01,878
Before the web existed, and before the Internet existed,

18
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:05,088
there were computers but they were big

19
00:01:05,088 --> 00:01:08,260
and lonely. They couldn't really talk to one another.

20
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,100
I mean, sure, you could connect similar
pieces of hardware that spoke similar

21
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:13,879
protocols but that was just

22
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:18,438
a network. To connect disparate global machines

23
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:22,069
you would need a network of networks.

24
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:26,459
And in the 1960s a bunch of
brilliant minds collaborated on just

25
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:31,599
such a thing. Now, at the time, the phone
companies weren't very interested

26
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,438
and because no single institution could
foot the entire responsibility

27
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,039
and computing power needed for dedicated lines... Well,

28
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,530
more innovative and efficient methods were used.

29
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,739
A system spanning many nations is international.

30
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,780
So, a system spanning many networks

31
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:54,979
is an Internetwork. It wouldn't be until 1974,

32
00:01:54,978 --> 00:01:58,000
in this very document, that the word Internetwork

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,868
would be officially shortened to what we
use today - Internet.

34
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:05,450
On October 29th, 1969,

35
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,580
exactly 100 days after we first

36
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,730
landed on a distant rock across space,

37
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:14,738
we first landed a letter on a

38
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:20,230
distant screen across the Internet.
Leonard Kleinrock and a team at UCLA

39
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:21,929
decided to send the word

40
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,459
'login' to a different model of computer at Stanford.

41
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:29,778
They sent the 'L' and it arrived. They sent the 'O'

42
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,599
and it arrived. And then the system crashed.

43
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,400
But still, the first message sent over an Internet

44
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,120
was a big deal. On a list of
technological achievements it would rank

45
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,300
quite high, even though it was literally

46
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,400
lo... Fast-forward

47
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,110
two decades. CERN is working on a lot of
different projects with different people

48
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,110
and technologies

49
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,110
to figure out who or what is doing what...

50
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:02,379
You can just look it up on the Internet.
But the way information was organized on the internet

51
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:06,128
was illogical. Based on hierarchies, 

52
00:03:06,128 --> 00:03:10,158
linearly, it was lame. And this annoyed a guy

53
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,359
named Tim Berners-Lee. You see,  you could follow a
tree for a really long time

54
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,500
only to reach a person or technology
involved in some other project

55
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,680
and for information on that you have to
go back to the beginning and start all

56
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,580
over again.

57
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,129
So, in March of 1989, Tim Berners-Lee

58
00:03:25,128 --> 00:03:29,560
wrote a powerful paper simply titled
"Information management:

59
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,840
A Proposal." He argued that notes with links,

60
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,039
like references, between them is far more
useful than a

61
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,378
fixed hierarchical system. Instead of trees,

62
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:43,889
Berners-Lee was proposing a web.

63
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:49,900
Webbed systems that connect documents
in nonlinear ways already existed.

64
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,658
They were called hypertext.
But Tim Berners-Lee

65
00:03:53,658 --> 00:03:57,739
officiated the marriage of hypertext
webs and the Internet

66
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:03,150
to produce a web that was worldwide.
It was the vast connected logical and

67
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,860
useful partnership needed to make the
Internet the most quickly adopted

68
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,959
form of communication in our species' history.

69
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,120
The Internet connects participants,

70
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,019
the web connects information.
Specifically

71
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,250
hypertext documents accessed via the Internet.

72
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:26,040
You can see the computer Tim Berners-Lee
created the world wide web with

73
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,860
in the London Science Museum.
Twenty-five years ago

74
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,740
if you had unplugged this computer you
would have literally shut down

75
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,280
the entire web. The first website

76
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:43,809
was info.cern.ch. Today it
provides a simulator that allows you to

77
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,009
view the web

78
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:48,160
as it appeared as a baby. We've come

79
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,810
a long way since this.
If you really want your mind blown,

80
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,389
check out Onesecond[.designly.com] on the web.
You can see how many

81
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:00,280
Facebook likes, Tweets and even e-mails
are sent every second

82
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:05,049
and how many have been sent since you
first opened the page.

83
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,740
Isaac Asimov once said that Earth should
have been named

84
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,129
ocean because the sea is its dominant

85
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:15,509
feature. Our oceans are vast

86
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:20,180
and dangerous and deep and mysterious.
So, it's no mystery that when people needed

87
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,410
a metaphor to describe the Internet

88
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,090
and the seemingly endless and often uncharted

89
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:30,198
web of hypertext it delivered, they ran for the sea.

90
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,310
We surf the web, navigating

91
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,100
streams of data. There are pirates and
floods and phishing.

92
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,820
Even blogs and vlogs have their
linguistic origins

93
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:45,560
in logs - records originally kept by
captains at sea.

94
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,199
Like liquid water, the web is a phenomenal solvent.

95
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:53,089
It makes material widely accessible and available.

96
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:56,679
It has been estimated that every web
page is an average

97
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,910
of only 19 clicks away from every

98
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,970
other web page. Like our oceans,

99
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,370
the web is really just one global

100
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,740
sea. And like our oceans, the web

101
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,870
is an ecosystem we need to be careful to protect.

102
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,168
It is flexible and flowing, and as we are finding out,

103
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:23,079
the web, like liquid water, is something
you can see yourself in.

104
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:26,818
In the 1990s, Douglas Rushkoff coined the term

105
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:31,050
screenagers to describe a generation
that for the first time ever was growing

106
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,569
up to think that images

107
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:36,210
on screens weren't just something to passively stare at,

108
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:39,879
but, instead, were something to be manipulated.

109
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:42,969
Well, today it's even more extreme.

110
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,389
The tools and connectivity, provided by
the Web, allow us to think

111
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:49,400
of images on screens not just as things to manipulate

112
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:54,089
but as things to project our own identities onto.

113
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:58,219
Not everyone who does this is a
professional storyteller

114
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,090
or acclaimed poet or coherent.

115
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:08,359
But, content aside, hyperlinked webs of
human expression are incredibly rich enviroments

116
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,759
and they exercise the brain, more so than books?

117
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:15,839
Well, for the sake of argument,

118
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:19,589
let's read from "Everything Bad is Good for You,"

119
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:22,689
a book by Steven Johnson. Now, in this passage

120
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:26,009
he imagines a world in which books were invented

121
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:29,479
after video games and the World Wide Web.

122
00:07:29,478 --> 00:07:32,839
Kids everywhere are starting to read
these new fangled

123
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:37,299
books and teachers and parents are
concerned. He imagines

124
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,530
they might say something like this:

125
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:43,709
"Perhaps the most dangerous property of these books

126
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:47,159
is the fact that they follow a fixed linear path.

127
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,680
You can't control their narratives in
any fashion. You simply sit back

128
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,900
and have the story dictated to you.

129
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:58,228
For those of us raised on interactive
narratives, this property may seem

130
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,418
astonishing. Why would anyone want to
embark on an adventure

131
00:08:01,418 --> 00:08:04,529
utterly choreographed by another
person?

132
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:07,918
But today's generation embarks on such
adventures

133
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,409
millions of times a day. Reading is not an

134
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:15,310
active participatory process, it's a submissive one.

135
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,389
The book readers of the younger
generation are learning

136
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:22,610
to follow the plot instead of learning to lead."

137
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,759
Interesting. But you might be thinking, come on,

138
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,080
Michael, you can't set content aside that easily.

139
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:32,639
What about all the dumb and superficial
stuff the web propagates?

140
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:37,098
I mean, surely a lot of it is just completely
useless. We're humans, after all, we should

141
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:42,019
be valuing reason. Maybe.

142
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:46,278
But is that really what makes us special?
As Unamuno said,

143
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:49,490
"more often I have seen a cat reason

144
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,750
than laugh or weep. Perhaps it weeps or laughs

145
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:57,649
inwardly. But then perhaps, also inwardly,
a crab resolves equations

146
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:03,409
of the second degree." What if cheap
laughs and sappy poems and gossip and

147
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:06,028
whining and drama and selfies really are

148
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:10,789
the most human thing the web has allowed us to do?

149
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:14,759
That's deep. But not as deep as the Deep Web,

150
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:18,220
the hidden web. The part of the web invisible

151
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:23,379
to search engines. Now, most of this stuff
is innocuous content hidden behind pay

152
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:25,220
walls or password protection

153
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,980
or dynamically created web pages. But we haven't

154
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,000
even indexed this stuff.
And it's not 1% of the web,

155
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,350
it's not 10%. It's 80%

156
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,459
of the entire World Wide Web.

157
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:42,708
The web is a deep ocean

158
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:46,939
and we are frantically making waves in it.
For instance, take a look at real time

159
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,940
emoji usage on Twitter and say a few
words of encouragement to be

160
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,519
least popular emoji.
We are also exploring the web

161
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,690
frantically. It's an entirely new
frontier. Every single day

162
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,399
Google receives 500 million search queries

163
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,669
it has never been asked before.

164
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:12,278
Where will all of this exploration lead?

165
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:17,620
Who knows? But to go back to our metaphor,
the very same suits we built to explore

166
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,600
the depths of the ocean

167
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,909
inspired and enabled the suits we would later use

168
00:10:22,909 --> 00:10:27,208
to go beyond Earth. So, keep exploring,

169
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,488
keep surfing.

170
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:29,539
And as always,

171
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:31,199
thanks for watching.
