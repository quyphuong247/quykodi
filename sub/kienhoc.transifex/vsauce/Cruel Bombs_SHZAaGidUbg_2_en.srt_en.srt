1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,129
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:03,379
Every cloud

3
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:05,679
has a silver lining.

4
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:10,719
Except nuclear mushroom clouds,
which have a lining of Strontium-90,

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,589
Caesium-137 and other radioactive isotopes.

6
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:18,149
Upon detonation, atoms are literally gutted

7
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:21,839
and glutton at temperatures exceeding
that of the surface

8
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,868
of our Sun.
In the 1950s, Harold Edgerton's

9
00:00:25,868 --> 00:00:29,250
rapatronic camera caught nuclear fireballs less than a

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,200
thousandth of a second after detonation.
Using a special magnetic shutter,

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,190
each exposure lasted only a billionth
of a second and captured

12
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:44,859
an other-worldly creature,
its energy vaporising the metal wires

13
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:48,439
supporting its tower into stringing legs

14
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:51,659
of plasma. Watch the target

15
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,948
on the ground.
Now, roughly visualized, here is a conventional

16
00:00:55,948 --> 00:00:59,509
TNT explosion. Now, on the same spot,

17
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:03,099
a similarly sized bomb that uses nuclear

18
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,299
fission.

19
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:17,539
When 'Little Boy' was detonated over

20
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,830
Hiroshima only 1.38% of its uranium

21
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:25,439
actually fissioned.
The rest was blown away before

22
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,319
that could happen, which means, as
Eric Schlosser points out, the

23
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:32,379
fission of merely 0.7 grams

24
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:37,299
of uranium, that's less than the weight of
a banknote, was enough to kill

25
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:41,239
80,000 people and destroy two-thirds

26
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:47,799
of city's buildings. When a country has
tens of thousands of nuclear weapons

27
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:48,640
ready to go,

28
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,049
accidents are a possibility.

29
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,799
This was a problem during the Cold War and it still

30
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,030
is a problem. What if there is a fire
or a miscommunication or a rogue

31
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,310
officer decides to

32
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,379
set one off. Or what if someone just drops

33
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:09,609
a warhead? How much risk

34
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,920
is too much, I asked Schlosser.

35
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:16,379
The acceptable probability of a nuclear weapon

36
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,280
accident? What is it now?

37
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,799
The acceptable probability

38
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:24,939
of the detonation of a nuclear weapon
in an accident is one in a million.

39
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:28,459
In 2012, the odds of your dying

40
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:32,229
in a commercial airliner accident
were about one in forty

41
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:36,949
million. So that's even more remote than
the accidental detonation of a nuclear weapon.

42
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:41,149
There have been 'oopsie daisy' moments
with nuclear weapons

43
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,480
on US soil. Luckily, none that
resulted in critical mass

44
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,069
but accidents nonetheless.
Just like when you

45
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:53,650
pee your pants, except your pants
are the entire planet

46
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,170
and the "P" stands for Plutonium.

47
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,820
Eureka comes from ancient

48
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:04,409
Greek, meaning "I have found it!" And in

49
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:07,489
Eureka, North Carolina you can find

50
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:10,750
it. A giant sign that says

51
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,409
"Nuclear mishap". On my birth date

52
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:19,009
the year my father was born,
a US B-52 bomber carrying

53
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:22,560
two 4 megaton thermonuclear bombs

54
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,670
over North Carolina tumbled

55
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:30,708
from the sky. A loose lanyard in the
cockpit snagged the bomb release

56
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:35,409
switch.
Each bomb contained a greater explosive yield

57
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:38,789
than all munitions ever detonated by mankind

58
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:43,289
combined.
Lieutenant Jack ReVell discovered that only

59
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:46,739
one safety mechanism didn't fail that day.

60
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,250
A single low voltage arming switch remained

61
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,259
untouched during the crash.
And that one switch is why,

62
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,310
he explained in 2011, we don't have

63
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,729
a bay where North Carolina is today.

64
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:04,429
The bombs were recovered... mostly.

65
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,230
The uranium-rich Secondary
of one of the bombs was

66
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:11,829
never found. To this day it remains buried

67
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:17,340
underground in North Carolina.
Here's something you can try

68
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,329
at home.

69
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,729
Build a nuclear reactor.

70
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:27,459
In 1994, a 17-year-old David Han attempted to build

71
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,700
a nuclear reactor in his mother's backyard

72
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:34,120
in Michigan. It wasn't that difficult. For instance,

73
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,079
common everyday smoke detectors
contain small amounts of

74
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,000
radioactive Americium.
And old glow in the dark paint

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,139
contains Radium. His reactor never
reached critical mass but it did succeed

76
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:49,009
in exposing his neighborhood

77
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:52,500
to 1000 times the regular dosage

78
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,759
of background radiation. It was declared a
Superfund hazardous materials cleanup

79
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,279
site

80
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:01,989
and all of his work was confiscated by
authorities and buried

81
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,120
in Utah. It didn't end

82
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,920
there. In 2007 David Hahn was

83
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,230
arrested for stealing smoke detectors
from an apartment building.

84
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:19,009
His face was covered with sores believed
to be caused by constant exposure to

85
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:20,810
radioactive materials.

86
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:26,079
Three days after Little Boy was dropped
on Hiroshima by the Enola Gay

87
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,639
Charles Sweeney was ordered to drop Fatman

88
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,389
on Kokura. He flew boxcar over the city for nearly an

89
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:36,909
hour with the bomb bay doors open,
but it was cloudy.

90
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,740
Sweeney couldn't achieve visual
confirmation of the target and was

91
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,540
forced

92
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,760
to go to the secondary target - Nagasaki,

93
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,969
where 75,000 people died instead.

94
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,230
Kokura was spared because of the clouds.

95
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,350
We can build a weapon

96
00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:01,150
that mimics the furnace of our Sun
and the winds of Neptune but yet we can't

97
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:06,709
predict the weather more than
a few minutes ahead of time.

98
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:10,359
During World War 2
Japanese soldiers spot for their

99
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,490
emperor in ways that made allied troops speechless.

100
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,680
Kamikaze planes and torpedoes,
driven by a single pilot,

101
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,310
lost after use. When outnumbered,

102
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,439
without hope, Japanese soldiers were
reported to have thrown themselves

103
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:30,519
off clips or swam out to sea to drown

104
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:33,758
rather than surrendered. Even after two

105
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,930
atomic bomb attacks,
the Japanese Minister of War

106
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,050
urged his people to continue fighting.

107
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,560
But on August 14th, 1945, the Emperor of Japan

108
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,959
overruled that decision and unconditionally

109
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:51,870
surrendered. Men had leapt of off cliffs

110
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,478
for him, but in his own words, 
the enemy has for the first time

111
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:59,508
used cruel bombs.

112
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:02,780
The heavy casualties are beyond measure.

113
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:07,098
Richard Feynman received
the Nobel Prize in Physics

114
00:07:07,098 --> 00:07:11,969
in 1965. He also helped develop
the first atomic bomb

115
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:16,070
at Los Alamos.
In "The Meaning of It All," he wrote

116
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:19,139
"Is science of any value?"

117
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,400
And below that,
"I think a power to do something

118
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:26,978
is of value." He elaborates by talking

119
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:32,149
about keys. Everything we learned about
the universe, everything we invent or

120
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:33,560
discover within it,

121
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,449
is a key to the gates of heaven.

122
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:40,750
But the same key will

123
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,009
also open the gates to hell.

124
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:47,060
The Titan II Missile is great for delivering

125
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,740
lethal nuclear warheads.

126
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,970
But it also sent Gemini astronauts to space,

127
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,229
preparing us for a mission to the Moon.

128
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:59,529
Science doesn't tell us how to use

129
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:02,888
keys. It finds them or predicts them.

130
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:07,730
How we use keys is up to us.

131
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,920
And as always,

132
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,860
thanks for watching.
