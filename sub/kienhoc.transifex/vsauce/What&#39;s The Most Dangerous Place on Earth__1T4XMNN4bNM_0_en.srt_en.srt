00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:10,699
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. 93% of all the
humans who have ever lived are dead. For every

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:19,010
person alive right now, there are 15 people
who are no longer alive. The Earth is dangerous...but

3
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:26,280
where is the most dangerous place on Earth?
Ignoring freak occurrances, where is the most

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,230
persistently perilous place on the surface of our planet?

5
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:37,969
Well, let's being with temperature. Extreme
heat and extreme cold can kill within hours,

6
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:45,429
if not minutes. In cold environments, without
clothing, the human body, by itself, doesn't

7
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:51,219
do a very good job of maintaining a high enough
temperature to live. It just takes too much

8
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:58,219
work. Even when you feel comfortable and warm,
nearly half of your daily caloric intake is

9
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:02,928
used merely to keep your body's temperature
where it should be.

10
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:08,200
If you took a human and stripped them naked
and put them in an environment at 0 degrees

11
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:15,200
Celsius, they would die from having too cold
of an internal temperature within about 20

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:24,079
minutes. We need warmth. But one thing we
need more immediately than that is oxygen.

13
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:30,140
And that brings us to the summit of Mount Everest.
This place on the surface of Earth

14
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:36,430
has incredibly thin air. At the top of Mount Everest
there is only one third as much breathable oxygen

15
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,990
as there is down at sea level.

16
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:44,519
Climbers can endure the conditions for short
periods of time if they acclimate for months,

17
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,269
but if you were to teleport from wherever
you are right now directly to the summit of

18
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:55,590
Everest, you would most likely die within
only 2-3 minutes because there isn't enough

19
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,010
oxygen.

20
00:01:57,379 --> 00:02:02,239
Death would come even more quickly if you
were at the bottom of the Mariana Trench.

21
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:09,830
There, you would be submerged under nearly
7 miles of water, about 11 km, causing the

22
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:15,890
pressure around your body to exceed 15,000
pounds per square inch.

23
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:21,279
At normal swimming depths you can always
hold your breath, but that far down, with

24
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,378
that much pressure, your lungs would collapse
immediately, and without oxygen your brain

25
00:02:26,378 --> 00:02:32,768
would go unconscious in 15 seconds,
and you'd be dead in under 90.

26
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:38,299
You would die pretty much just as quickly
as someone who walked into outer space without

27
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:39,679
a suit on.

28
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:47,460
But falling into a molten lake of lava is
probably the most spectacular way to go. Contrary

29
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:52,379
to what you see in many movies, your body
wouldn't just burn a little bit and slowly

30
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:59,018
sink as if it were in quicksand. 
Instead, there would be a lot of fireworks. Hot, molten

31
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:06,019
lava is liquid rock, 4 times as hot as your
oven can ever get. And the human body is

32
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:13,080
mainly made up of water, which, when exposed
to that kind of heat, turns into steam...explosively.

33
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,579
There's a fantastic video right here on YouTube
where a guy throws a bag of organic material

34
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:24,859
containing a lot of moisture into hot lava.
It doesn't just sink in, it causes a miniature

35
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:28,480
eruption. I highly suggest you go watch it.

36
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:34,168
But what if we want to measure danger not
by how quickly you would die, but by the actual

37
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:40,029
total number of fatalities caused. Well, for
this, we're going to need to get much, much

38
00:03:40,028 --> 00:03:43,508
smaller. Like, microscopic.

39
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:51,980
In 1918, influenza killed nearly 100 million
people, which, at the time, was 3% of the

40
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:59,959
world's entire population. But places where
and when the plague has spread rapidly are

41
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:10,239
even scarier. Between 1347 and 1353, a third
of everybody in Europe died because of the

42
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,260
bubonic plague,
an infection caused by Yersinia Pestis.

43
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:20,699
It's easy to think of the plague as something
from way back in the past, but it is still

44
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:26,449
here. Of course, now we have antibiotics, which
can help in most cases, but, believe it or

45
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:34,629
not, in America alone, 5 to 15 people
still get the plague every year.

46
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,918
In terms of total fatalities, however, the
plague and influenza are nothing compared

47
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:45,538
to the danger caused by this guy: plasmodium.

48
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,720
It's a micro-organism that can get into our
blood because of mosquito bites, and causes

49
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:58,520
Malaria. Across the totality of human history,
the number of deaths attributed to Malaria

50
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:04,740
is unbelievable. Researchers like Nobel laureate
Baruch Blumberg have studied the history of

51
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,810
the human genome and human migration, and
determined that of all the humans who have

52
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:16,629
ever existed, it is likely that half died from malaria.

53
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:23,158
So, in terms of total fatalities across all
of human history, a place where plasmodium

54
00:05:23,158 --> 00:05:28,098
could enter the blood stream because of a
mosquito bite, statistically speaking, could

55
00:05:28,098 --> 00:05:32,079
be called the most dangerous place on Earth.

56
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,639
But let's switch gears for a moment and talk
about places that are dangerous not because

57
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:43,799
of Earth, or Earth's creatures, well, actually,
just one specific creature: us.

58
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:51,280
La Oroya is a mining town in Peru where the
murder rate is low but pollution is high.

59
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,439
The town's smelter emits pollution into the air
and temperature inversions in the atmosphere

60
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:04,659
above the town trap gasses within,
causing the town to have 85 times more arsenic in

61
00:06:04,658 --> 00:06:07,278
its air than is deemed safe.

62
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:13,040
But that's nothing compared to Lake Karachay
in Russia. It was named the most polluted

63
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,430
spot on Earth by the World Watch Institute
on Nuclear Waste.

64
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:24,439
The lake contains so many radioactive pollutants
that you can receive a lethal dose of radiation

65
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:30,149
merely by standing for one hour near certain
parts of the lake.

66
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,579
The Global Peace Index ranks countries by
how safe they are. It takes into account a

67
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:42,688
number of factors including crime and political
corruption. The safest country, according

68
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:47,709
to the Index, is Iceland.
And the least safe is Somalia.

69
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:53,360
But for the highest murder rate you'll have
to go to Juarez, Mexico, where out of every

70
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:00,360
1 million inhabitants, each year 1,477
of them are murdered.

71
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:05,860
I've always found it amazing just how many
serial killers Miami seems to have on the

72
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:12,000
show "Dexter." But Miami is a big city and
so despite all those serial killers, it's

73
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
murder rate in the show is not the highest
of any fictional town from a TV show. That

74
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
honor goes to Cabot Cove, the town where "Murder
She Wrote" occurred. An analysis of "Murder

75
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:35,439
She Wrote" episodes revealed 274 murders,
but a population in the town of only 3,500,

76
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:42,228
making Cabot Cove's murder rate
1,490 per million inhabitants.

77
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:48,419
Until recently that number was unmatched by
reality, but last year, the city of San Pedro

78
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:57,389
Sula in Honduras reported a murder rate of
1,588 murders per million inhabitants.

79
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:05,680
Let's conclude by revisiting pollution, specifically
the Chernobyl accident, and a certain oxymoronic

80
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:14,499
danger. For 10 days in 1986, radioactive isotopes
spilled out of a blazing reactor core, forcing

81
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:20,550
mass evacuations. It's more than 25 years
later now and many parts of the exclusion

82
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:28,020
zone remain incredibly lethal. But without
humans there, many parts of the exclusion

83
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:35,759
zone have seen wildlife flourish, especially
endangered species which can go to the exclusion

84
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:44,840
zone, live, reproduce, and be safe...from us.
We managed to ruin a place to the point

85
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:50,659
at which it endangered our lives and we had
to leave and in doing so we left parts

86
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:56,278
of it a little bit safer for other forms of life.

87
00:08:56,278 --> 00:09:00,200

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:01,959
Keep learning.

90
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,420
And as always,

91
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:04,659
