00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,919
Hey, Vsauce.
Michael here.

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,798
And I'm in Los Angeles, but today we're going
to talk about love.

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,960
You can't buy love, but what if you could?
I mean, what if I had a machine that could

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,860
make you fall in love with someone for the
rest of your life?

5
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:19,778
What should I charge for the use of that machine?
Well, we should, first of all, be clear about

6
00:00:19,778 --> 00:00:23,698
what we mean when we say "love."
I'm not talking about the love you have for

7
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,759
your BFFs or your love for your family or
your love of learning.

8
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:32,959
I'm also not talking about lust, an immediate
attraction we have towards other people mediated

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,439
by hormones like testosterone and oestrogen.
I'm talking about what happens later, when

10
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:43,549
you begin to associate an immediate reward
with one other person - what we call passionate

11
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:46,439
love.
This is what you see in new couples, where

12
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:49,489
they wanna be with each other and are almost
obsessed with each other.

13
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,370
Well psychologists have a really great term
for that kind of love.

14
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:56,549
They call it limerence.
That's right.

15
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:00,939
Whenever you're in this state and you do things
like wake up super early to get a bagel with

16
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:04,079
the person and even though you're gonna miss
class just because you wanna see them that

17
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:10,079
badly, you're exhibiting limerent behaviour.
Okay, that sounds great.

18
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,319
But if I wanna sell love, I'm gonna have to
find a way to measure it and it turns out

19
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:20,239
to be quite a difficult task.
We do have a tool called the passionate love

20
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,688
survey.
It was developed by psychologists and it's

21
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:27,568
been found to be quite reliable when it comes
to analysing other behaviours we associate

22
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:31,909
with passionate love.
For instance, we found, using the survey,

23
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:36,840
that men and women both experience the same
amounts of passionate love when they're in

24
00:01:36,849 --> 00:01:41,099
a relationship.
We've also found that men tend to fall in

25
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:45,519
the love faster and sooner than women, who
appear to be more cautious.

26
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:52,939
But we're here to talk about money.
Interestingly, a UK study once looked at people

27
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:57,340
who heard that someone else loved them.
They heard the phrase "I love you" for the

28
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,939
first time and they took the amount of happiness
those people felt and compared it to the amount

29
00:02:01,938 --> 00:02:05,518
of happiness gamblers feel when they win large
sums of money.

30
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,359
Their conclusion, that hearing that someone
loves you for the first time is the equivalent

31
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:18,459
happiness level of receiving 267,000 dollars.
But when you go beyond passionate love to

32
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:23,378
committed long-term love, there's all kinds
of practical benefits marriage brings.

33
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:29,000
In fact, it's been estimated that tax breaks
and health care costs all together mean that

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,419
being married is the equivalent of receiving
an extra 100,000 dollars a year.

35
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:40,199
Now we have a lot of ways of visualizing the
effect having money has on a person.

36
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:45,159
For instance, we know that in wealthier countries
people report feeling respect more often.

37
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:48,419
They also report eating tastier foods, for
instance.

38
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:53,119
But here's what's really awesome.
Take a look at the graph of wealth against

39
00:02:53,128 --> 00:02:53,989
love.

40
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,879
It doesn't matter.

41
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,659
Love is democratic, no matter who you are
or how much money you have, people all over

42
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:05,000
the world are feeling it.
It should be noted that having more money

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,780
does not necessarily equate to being more
happy.

44
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:13,739
This is what's known as the hedonistic treadmill.
Getting more money helps with happiness, but

45
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:18,349
only up to a certain point.
In United States that point is about 75,000

46
00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:21,789
dollars a year.
At that point, more money has diminishing

47
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:26,429
returns on how happy it makes you.
Another thing that correlates to having more

48
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,810
money, more wealth, is living longer, having
a larger life expectancy.

49
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,479
But you know what else correlates to living
longer?

50
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,639
Love.
But not just passionate love, the kind of

51
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:41,939
love that follows it - committed, long-term
love.

52
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:48,920
In fact, people who form life-long pair bonds
with another person live, on average, 15%

53
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:53,199
longer.
So if you wanna be really non-hard-scienc-y

54
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,079
about it, all other things being equal and
assuming that you're not already super super

55
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:03,959
rich, finding a pair bond, finding a relationship
that lasts for life is the equivalent of making

56
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:08,709
about an extra 30 to 40 thousand dollars a
year.

57
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:12,069
Now, like I said, that's not hard science,
but you know what is?

58
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:18,180
Vasopressin and oxytocin, the chemicals that
are exuded in people's brains when they

59
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:23,410
look at photos of people that they formed
committed, long-term relationships with.

60
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,500
These chemicals are incredible.
We've also seen elevated levels of them in

61
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,860
dogs that have been pet for really long time.
And we also know that couples who receive

62
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,229
high levels of these chemicals resolve conflicts
faster.

63
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:42,029
And, people who struggle to produce these
chemicals in their brain have a similar struggle

64
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:49,429
when it comes to forming long-term relationships.
In fact, you can raise your levels of oxytocin

65
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:55,129
or vasopressin inside your own brain by simply
looking into someone else's eyes.

66
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,300
That's right.
So, in a way, looking into the eyes of somebody

67
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:08,649
that you like is the administration of a psycho-active
drug that's addictive and the long-term consequences

68
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:09,889
are living longer.

69
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,879
Thanks for watching.
