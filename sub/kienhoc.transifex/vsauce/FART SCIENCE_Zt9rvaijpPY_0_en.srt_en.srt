00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,259
Hey, Vsauce Michael here, and
today we are going to talk about farts.

2
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:11,141
What are they, how do they define us,
and how much weight do we lose

3
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:12,980
every time we fart?

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,059
Now, it's easy to think that talking about farts is immature,

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,111
but they are incredibly complicated,

6
00:00:18,111 --> 00:00:22,733
and by analyzing them because they're funny,
you could accidentally learn a lot of science.

7
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:24,865
Plus, we are in great company.

8
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:28,533
Mozart wrote songs and poems about flatulence,

9
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:32,698
and even Benjamin Franklin once wrote
an essay titled, "Fart Proudly."

10
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:35,878
So first things first, where do farts come from?

11
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:38,539
A lot of the gas that makes up a fart

12
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:42,542
comes from the outside, because you swallowed it.

13
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:46,341
That's right, you swallow a lot of air when
swallowing spit or food or beverage.

14
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:48,881
Now, some of this will come back up as a burp,

15
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:51,512
but if it doesn't soon enough, it will go deeper

16
00:00:51,512 --> 00:00:53,848
into your digestive system.

17
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:58,725
But it's where the other portion of the gas that makes up a fart comes from that makes farts so unique.

18
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,682
No two people's farts smell alike.

19
00:01:01,682 --> 00:01:05,237
The pungent part of a fart is unique to you,

20
00:01:05,236 --> 00:01:07,949
and it comes from things that are inside you

21
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,408
and are not you.

22
00:01:10,408 --> 00:01:14,582
Inside your intestines are completely separate organisms,

23
00:01:14,582 --> 00:01:18,962
bacteria and microbes that digest food you haven't or can't.

24
00:01:18,962 --> 00:01:22,710
Now, these little guys have
a great collective name—gut flora.

25
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:25,838
And because they are so  much smaller

26
00:01:25,838 --> 00:01:28,926
than the average human cell, their numbers are staggering.

27
00:01:28,927 --> 00:01:32,056
Believe it or not, your body contains about

28
00:01:32,055 --> 00:01:35,052
ten trillion cells,

29
00:01:35,052 --> 00:01:38,597
but the number of bacteria and microorganisms inside your intestines

30
00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:42,234
is nearly 100 trillion.

31
00:01:42,234 --> 00:01:46,319
As these microorganisms digest food that you haven't or can't,

32
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,737
they produce helpful things like vitamin K,

33
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:53,663
but they also produce chemicals that
lead to the reason that farts smell.

34
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:59,078
And we all fart every day about a pint of fart every day.

35
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:02,999
And if you say that you don't fart, you probably release that gas when you're in the bathroom,

36
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:06,757
or at night when you're asleep and
your muscles are more relaxed.

37
00:02:06,757 --> 00:02:11,096
But if this amount of gas used to be
inside you and now it's not,

38
00:02:11,096 --> 00:02:14,387
that must mean that every time you fart, you lose mass.

39
00:02:14,387 --> 00:02:16,885
You lose weight, but how much weight?

40
00:02:16,885 --> 00:02:19,974
Well, luckily, some researchers have already figured this out.

41
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:23,478
Assuming this average chemical makeup of a fart,

42
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:26,730
and what studies have shown is the typical volume of a fart,

43
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:30,149
it can be calculated that the average fart weighs

44
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:33,572
about three hundredths of a gram,

45
00:02:33,572 --> 00:02:39,707
and the part of it that actually
stinks only weighs .0008 grams.

46
00:02:39,707 --> 00:02:43,080
Okay, so a fart weighs three hundredths of a gram,

47
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,667
I mean, what does that really mean?
Well, here's a fun way to think about it.

48
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:50,507
As you move further away from the center of the earth,

49
00:02:50,507 --> 00:02:53,473
the gravitational attraction between
the two of you decreases,

50
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,596
and your weight decreases.

51
00:02:55,596 --> 00:02:59,477
In fact, according to this fantastic
book about the scale of things,

52
00:02:59,477 --> 00:03:02,473
your weight decreases by about .5 percent

53
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:05,978
for every six miles you are above earth.

54
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:11,312
In fact, the average fart causes you to lose an amount of weight equivalent

55
00:03:11,312 --> 00:03:15,111
to being about a third of an inch further from earth.

56
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,500
The way your gut flora process the food that you eat

57
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,612
and influence how your farts smell

58
00:03:21,612 --> 00:03:25,412
is established within the first
two to three months of your life.

59
00:03:25,412 --> 00:03:28,754
When you're first born, your gastrointestinal tract

60
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:30,836
is completely sterile.

61
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,091
There are no microorganisms living in it.

62
00:03:33,092 --> 00:03:35,134
In fact, unlike the rest of your life,

63
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:40,477
the very first poop that you take is almost completely sterile.

64
00:03:40,478 --> 00:03:44,052
It's so significant it has a special name, meconium.

65
00:03:44,052 --> 00:03:46,441
Now, I will spare you any pictures,

66
00:03:46,441 --> 00:03:50,819
but if you ever want to call someone a poop head,
try instead calling them a meconium head.

67
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:53,439
It's like a poop head, but with no experience.

68
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:59,372
As soon as you leave your mother, you begin collecting microorganisms inside your digestive system.

69
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,790
In fact, within the first five to ten minutes

70
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,705
of being born, the gut flora that you have

71
00:04:04,705 --> 00:04:08,169
are almost exactly equivalent to the microorganisms living

72
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:10,252
in your mother's birth canal.

73
00:04:10,252 --> 00:04:14,884
Now later, these microorganisms come from your environment, especially from what you eat—

74
00:04:14,884 --> 00:04:20,093
milk or formula. This early in your life, microorganisms train your immune system

75
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,973
to not attack them, and so, within the first two or three months of your life,

76
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:25,974
whatever microorganisms are there

77
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:31,735
have largely established themselves as the exact colonial makeup of your gut flora for your entire life.

78
00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:35,992
That's all cool, but how loud can a fart get?

79
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:39,872
Well, the Guinness Book of World Records doesn't know.

80
00:04:39,872 --> 00:04:41,955
In fact, there are a lot of records it doesn't keep,

81
00:04:41,954 --> 00:04:44,331
some of which it doesn't keep because they're dangerous.

82
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:46,002
For instance, speed drinking.

83
00:04:46,002 --> 00:04:51,711
It's possible to open up your throat and literally pour liquid straight down your esophagus into your belly,

84
00:04:51,711 --> 00:04:55,337
but it is really dangerous and
should never be done by anybody.

85
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:58,467
Now, burping they do have records of.

86
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:02,052
The world record for the largest burp belongs to Paul Hunt

87
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:06,725
from the United Kingdom whose
burp registered 109.9 decibels,

88
00:05:06,725 --> 00:05:08,736
about as loud as a car horn.

89
00:05:13,108 --> 00:05:16,776
Oh, and also, many of these microorganisms that live inside your gut

90
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:19,031
and digest food and make farts smell bad

91
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:22,108
also create gases that are flammable.

92
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:26,660
We've all seen this, and it is very, very true.

93
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,713
The Mythbusters even did an episode where they prove that farts can be lit on fire,

94
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:34,127
but the episode was deemed too gross and never aired.

95
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:36,677
Another thing you should know about farts

96
00:05:36,677 --> 00:05:39,887
is that when you hold them in,
many of the gasses inside them

97
00:05:39,887 --> 00:05:44,223
will get reabsorbed back into your blood stream
through the intestinal lumen.

98
00:05:44,223 --> 00:05:47,098
Now, the smelly stinky stuff doesn't travel this way,

99
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:49,812
but the nutrient stuff like oxygen will.

100
00:05:49,812 --> 00:05:53,733
And the blood stream brings these gasses back to the lungs

101
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:56,648
where you exhale them, so if you hold in your farts a lot,

102
00:05:56,648 --> 00:06:00,946
you, in a way, will have literal fart breath.

103
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:03,983
The Fitzroy River Turtle does one better.

104
00:06:03,983 --> 00:06:06,908
It can do what I like to call a reverse fart.

105
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,999
Because it spends so much time under water,

106
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:13,125
it's developed a way to breathe through its butt.

107
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:17,005
It actually can get up to 68 percent of the
oxygen it needs

108
00:06:17,005 --> 00:06:19,129
by simply opening up that cavity

109
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,384
and getting oxygen from the water.

110
00:06:21,384 --> 00:06:25,265
Finally, I want to leave you with the art of the fart.

111
00:06:25,266 --> 00:06:29,847
The way your farts sound is determined by the speed and the shape of their exit.

112
00:06:29,846 --> 00:06:32,396
But a select few cannot only make themselves

113
00:06:32,396 --> 00:06:35,728
create flatus on command, but can also modulate

114
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,401
the pitch and tone of their farts.

115
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:41,031
These people are known as flatulists.

116
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:44,079
And one of the most famous right now is Mr. Methane.

117
00:06:57,713 --> 00:06:59,460
Amazing, right?

118
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:02,801
Well, now that we've talked about farts,
let's move on to outer space.

119
00:07:02,802 --> 00:07:06,093
On YouTube.com/Spacelab, go over there now

120
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:10,725
and you can ask me any question about outer space that you want, and every week I will answer

121
00:07:10,725 --> 00:07:13,274
three of them. So what are you waiting for?
Go check that out.

122
00:07:13,274 --> 00:07:15,428
And as always, thanks for watching.
