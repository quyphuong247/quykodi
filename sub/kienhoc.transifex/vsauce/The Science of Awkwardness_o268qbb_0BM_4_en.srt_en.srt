1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,310
Hey, Vsauce.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,710
Michael here.

3
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:08,638
Not knowing what to do with your hands

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,980
or offering a handshake

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,690
when the other person offers a fist bump.

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,640
Forgetting someone's name...

7
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,280
Not having anything to say and
forgetting your phone at home so you can't

8
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:39,320
be distracted by it.
Getting caught staring at a stranger.

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,939
Striking up a conversation with someone
you don't know in a bathroom.

10
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:46,488
Someone oversharing, telling a group

11
00:00:46,488 --> 00:00:51,799
too much information.
Overhearing a couple breaking up.

12
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:56,789
Noticing food in someone's teeth but not
telling them and, well, now it's been too

13
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,530
long and bringing up would be weird.

14
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,390
Smelling a fart in an elevator that wasn't yours

15
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,689
but, well, now you can't even react to it
or mention that you've noticed it

16
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:10,879
or pretend to even know what a fart is.
All of those things

17
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,759
are awkward.

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,260
We don't like

19
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:18,890
awkwardness. It makes us uncomfortable, cringe.

20
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,480
But what is awkwardness?

21
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:28,039
Why is it good and who is the main character

22
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:30,760
of the universe?

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,830
To really understand awkwardness we need
to put it in context with the entire

24
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,890
family of forces that guide social behaviour.

25
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:43,419
Think of this sheet of cardboard as a
list all possible behaviours.

26
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:47,270
It's not infinite because of
the limits of science and biology.

27
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:51,369
You can't move faster than light
or be in two places at once.

28
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,800
You can't wear pants made out of molten lead.

29
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,920
Next, there are legal limits - the laws of the state.

30
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,340
They delineate what you agree
not to do, lest the authorities

31
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,430
punish you - murder, stealing, speeding. What's left

32
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,469
is molded by the finder tool of social expectations.

33
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:15,000
It's not illegal to chew with your mouth open or

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,210
not cover a sneeze on a crowded bus or

35
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,590
act disrespectfully, but it is frowned upon.

36
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,459
Punished not by the police, but by social ostracism,

37
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,170
public opprobrium. Being called rude,

38
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:32,179
gross, mean, annoying.

39
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,010
Awkwardness is the finest tool. It sands

40
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:40,818
social dynamics by smoothing out what
even etiquette doesn't rule on.

41
00:02:40,818 --> 00:02:45,689
It's not a violation of the laws of physics
to accidentally hug someone

42
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:49,090
for longer than they expected.
It's not against the law

43
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,750
either. And the etiquette
for how long a hug should last

44
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,280
isn't black-and-white. But it is

45
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,780
awkward. Like touching a hot stove or
getting a parking fine or losing friends,

46
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,870
awkwardness nudges us to
avoid certain actions in the future

47
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:10,599
and smooth things out when they happen.
People who demonstrate

48
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:12,568
self-consciousness when needed

49
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:15,979
are communicating cooperative intentions,

50
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:20,530
which helps them get along well with
others. It's no coincidence that brains,

51
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,780
susceptible to feeling occasional
awkwardness, would become so common.

52
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,949
They're successful at cooperating,

53
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:32,798
at social life. Feeling awkward shows
that you understand

54
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,810
and are keen on smooth social exchanges.

55
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,969
Now, too much or too little concern for social rules

56
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:44,599
isn't healthy, but researchers found that just the right

57
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,659
amount is great.

58
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,930
When a person shows remorse or embarrassment or

59
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,069
awkward discomfort, when appropriate,

60
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:57,459
others perceive them as being more
trustworthy, and their actions as

61
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,670
more forgivable. And it's not just perception.

62
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:05,459
Such individuals also tend to be more
objectively prosocial when tested.

63
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:11,719
Kinder, more generous. Even when a person
is completely oblivious to a faux pas

64
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,680
they've committed,

65
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,899
awkwardness still arises.

66
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,239
People around them can feel uncomfortable. It's called

67
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,519
vicarious embarrassment and it's a function

68
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,219
of empathy - the ability to feel what others feel

69
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,350
or will feel, when

70
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,340
or if they realize what they've just done.

71
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:37,539
The more 'EEE' someone is, that is

72
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,430
easily sympathetically embarrassed,
the harder it is for them to sit through

73
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,920
other people's cringe-inducing moments,

74
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,100
even fictional once like in cringe comedy.

75
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,939
Researchers found that being more easily
and pathetically embarrassed

76
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:55,469
does not correlate to be more easily
embarrassed yourself.

77
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,180
Instead, it's linked to being more empathetic,

78
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,699
an important capacity for social creatures to have.
Our seemingly

79
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:07,550
counter-intuitive attraction to viewing cringing moments

80
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,840
like, say, bad American Idol auditions,
is perhaps then just a light form

81
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:16,479
of morbid curiosity. You may think that

82
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,810
awkwardness is totally different from physical pain

83
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,209
or outright name-calling.

84
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:25,149
But your brain would disagree. You see,

85
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:29,629
researchers found that social missteps
activate, among other regions,

86
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:33,110
the secondary somatosensory cortex and

87
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:37,780
dorsal posterior insula - areas of the
brain that are also connected

88
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:41,479
to the sensation of physical pain. Our brains

89
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,460
process the breaking of social standards
and the breaking of

90
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:49,449
bones through similar neural pathways. Likewise

91
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:53,680
the same sympathetic nervous system that
mobilizes you to deal with physical

92
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,290
threats,

93
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:58,680
"fight or flight", is activated by social challenges

94
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,840
where awkwardness or embarrassment

95
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,969
might be at stake.
Like events where you are very aware

96
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:10,460
of being watched. Speaking in front of a group or

97
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:14,569
embarrassing yourself in front of
onlookers or having nothing to say

98
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:15,990
on a first date.

99
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,680
Awkward silence...

100
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,120
Your blood pressure increases, causing you to overheat

101
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,740
and sweat.

102
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,560
Oxygen is needed for

103
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:33,949
fighting and running, so breathing
increases and digestion shuts down, causing

104
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:37,310
nausea and butterflies in your stomach.

105
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,660
Your body instinctively contracts into a
protective fetal position and

106
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,120
fighting that reaction to act natural makes you shake.

107
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,790
Blood vessels in your extremities
contract to prioritize major organs

108
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,500
leaving you with cold fingers

109
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,279
and toes and nose. These symptoms don't

110
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,509
alleviate awkwardness, they compound it.

111
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:01,240
But that's history's fault.

112
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,079
Long before human social dynamics
were complicated enough to involve

113
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:08,859
"is it one kiss or two?" or politics

114
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,870
at Thanksgiving dinner,
we developed primitive reactions to

115
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,389
physical threats and haven't had
enough time yet to evolve

116
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:19,750
newer ones. Self-conscious

117
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:24,139
anxiety can be tough to get out of our
minds after we've done something

118
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:27,589
awkward. Fixating on social blunders is

119
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:30,369
easy and hard to overcome.

120
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,560
Why was I so unsure, so unconfident,

121
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,009
so awkward? Well, some of the blame

122
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:42,029
may lie with the neurotransmitter oxytocin.

123
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,259
Oxytocin is sometimes called "the love hormone"

124
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:48,430
because it modulates prosocial feelings, like trust

125
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,610
and attachment, which it does. In fact,

126
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:55,139
nasal sprays of oxytocin are being used to increase

127
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,969
trust during couples therapy
and in the reduction of anxiety

128
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:03,470
and depression. Though there are fears
that it could also be used to

129
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,520
deviously increase trust and make a
person more susceptible

130
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,060
to con artist schemes. But oxytocin

131
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,439
also modulates negative social feelings like

132
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:17,689
fear and anxiety. A dose of it

133
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:21,910
makes people better at recognizing the
facial expressions for disgust

134
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,630
and fright. It's also involved in the
feelings that make us

135
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:30,269
approach or avoid certain social stimuli.

136
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:33,610
And it may play a role in making positive and negative

137
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,860
social interactions more salient

138
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,289
in our memories; that is, stand out more,

139
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:43,490
command more of our attention after the fact, make us

140
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,200
think about them more. Negative ones

141
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,270
especially because of what psychologists call

142
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:54,110
negativity bias. All things being equal,

143
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,870
negative social interactions and negative emotions

144
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,399
have a greater impact on our mental
states than positive ones.

145
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,100
In fact, we have more words for negative emotions

146
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,879
than positive ones and a richer vocabulary

147
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:15,120
to describe them. Thus such memories and
thoughts can be tough to just

148
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,909
get over. What does the other person think of me?

149
00:09:18,909 --> 00:09:24,009
I was so awkward. Are they telling other people?
We replace social encounters in

150
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:26,299
our heads over and over again.

151
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:30,069
Surely, the person we were awkward with
remembers us the same way

152
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,300
we're remembering ourselves
and is equally fixated on that

153
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:37,889
awkward thing we did. Or are they?

154
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:43,039
A great wet blanket for smothering the
fire of self-conscious anxieties

155
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:47,969
is perspective.
Consider the famous advice of Eleanor Roosevelt:

156
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,300
"You wouldn't worry so much
about what others think of you

157
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,519
if you realized how seldom they do."

158
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,039
As much as you

159
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:01,699
obsess over yourself, you're not the
first thing on everyone else's minds.

160
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,770
They're worried about themselves, what

161
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:08,519
you think about them.
And, more importantly, what they think about

162
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,079
themselves.

163
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,350
You're not the centre of their world.

164
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:18,269
Another famous old piece of advice tells
us that in your twenties and thirties

165
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:23,169
you worry about what other people think
about you. In your forties and fifties

166
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:26,919
you stop worrying what other people
think about you. And then

167
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:31,079
finally in your sixties and seventies
you realize that they were never

168
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,270
thinking about you

169
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:34,370
in the first place. 

170
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:40,420
The tendency to act and think as though you are the
true main character of the universe

171
00:10:40,429 --> 00:10:43,529
has been called protagonist disease.

172
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:47,199
It seeps into our behavior all the time.

173
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,430
For instance, the fundamental attribution

174
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:53,620
error. When evaluating actions you

175
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,039
often view yourself as a complex
character, acted upon by

176
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:01,299
various challenges and antagonist, whereas

177
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:05,649
other people are seen as just
one-dimensional background characters

178
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:07,230
with simple unchanging

179
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:12,389
roles. The guy who took way too long
ordering in front of you this morning,

180
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:15,970
well, he's obviously just innately annoying person.

181
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:20,550
That's his entire purpose.
But when you take too long ordering,

182
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:24,729
it's because the staff was unhelpful
or you were flustered,

183
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:27,830
preoccupied by an earlier conversation.

184
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:32,540
You are the main character after all.
You know a lot more about what's going on

185
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:35,870
in your life. It's easy to live like that.

186
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,429
There isn't time or mental space to
consider every other person

187
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:43,809
as complicated and fully flushed out.
But they are.

188
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:49,059
The realization of this has a name.
A name given to it by The Dictionary

189
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:53,349
of Obscure Sorrows, one of my favorite resources

190
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:59,029
and now, YouTube channels. They wrap
profound concepts up in tiny little word

191
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:00,459
packages.

192
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,320
To be sure, giving something a name
doesn't show that you know it or

193
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,580
how to feel about it but nonetheless
words put handles on things,

194
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,990
so we can manipulate them,
hold them down, offer them to others,

195
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,149
feel bigger than the concepts they label.

196
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:19,329
Now, their word for acknowledging that you are just

197
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:24,080
an extra in other people's stories,
not even cast in most of them,

198
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,770
is 'sonder'. This is their definition of it.

199
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:31,779
"Sonder - the realization that each

200
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:35,379
random passerby is living a life as vivid

201
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:40,019
and complex as your own—populated
with their own ambitions,

202
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,539
friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness—

203
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:48,740
an epic story that continues
invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling

204
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,259
deep underground, with 

205
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:53,669
elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives

206
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:56,839
that you’ll never know existed, in which you might

207
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,910
only appear once,
as an extra sipping coffee in the background,

208
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:05,759
as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a 

209
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,000
lighted window at dusk."

210
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,230
Acknowledging this makes your awkwardness

211
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:15,500
looks small. But it also makes

212
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,690
all of you look small.

213
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,250
Tiny. A needle in a giant haystack,

214
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,710
but nonetheless in possession of a big

215
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,070
idea. Your blemishes are

216
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:32,960
lost from far away, and so is your uniqueness,

217
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,850
but the view from way up here... Well,

218
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,000
it's unbeatable.

219
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,590
And as always,

220
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,649
thanks for watching.
