1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,589
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. If you threw

2
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:07,790
every single human alive today into
the Grand Canyon,

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,519
we would not fill it up.

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,289
We could make a pile about this big

5
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:20,618
That's it. That's all of us. All 7.159 billion of us

6
00:00:20,618 --> 00:00:24,028
in one place. A species

7
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:27,089
portrait. It kinda puts humanity into perspective

8
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:32,308
and you. So does this. Everyday you
produce about one to two litres

9
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:36,509
of spit, which means, in your entire
lifetime

10
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:40,670
altogether, you will not produce enough spit

11
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,210
to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool.

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,140
So far, 560 billion Lego parts

13
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,460
have been manufactured and the total
number of grains

14
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,719
of sand on Earth is estimated to be 7.5 times 10

15
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,120
to the 18th. But here's the thing:

16
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:06,500
how many things are there... total?

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,299
Well, how do you define a thing?
Well, let's say it's a thing

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,228
if you can think about it or talk about it.
If you can call it a thing,

19
00:01:14,228 --> 00:01:18,269
it's a thing.
This is going to be a lot of things.

20
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:21,359
Things can be real, imaginary,

21
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:27,579
impossible, ideas are things, things can
be looked forward to and things can be in the past

22
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:31,599
or yellow or concrete or abstract things can

23
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:34,739
happen and some thing's probably won't.

24
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:38,188
Making a video about how many things there are.

25
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:41,328
That's a thing... that I'm doing right now.

26
00:01:41,328 --> 00:01:44,328
Let's count everything.

27
00:01:44,328 --> 00:01:47,898
Right away, the answer seems obvious. The word

28
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,509
'thing' is so vague, the answer is clearly infinite...

29
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,618
possibly... not.

30
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:59,519
All we have to do is take the maximum
number of physical things,

31
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,579
things out there in the real
world, beyond our minds we could

32
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:07,349
in theory measure and add to that the
total number of things we

33
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:11,370
could imagine. The total number of thoughts possible.

34
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,230
For the purposes of this video let's
assume that numbers and math

35
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:18,389
and the laws of physics exist as part of the way

36
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:23,500
our universe is. But the names and
representations they've been given

37
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,099
are the products of thinking minds and those things

38
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:30,539
are, well, things that we can count.

39
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:34,759
And there's no reason to double count.
All of the indivisible

40
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:38,560
pieces that make up me, particles or strings or whatever

41
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,879
are the same as the thing that has been named me.

42
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,180
Abraham Lincoln has a great quote about this.

43
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:48,539
"How many legs does a sheep have if you call

44
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:50,859
its tail a leg?"

45
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,219
Four.

46
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:55,639
Because calling a tail a leg doesn't make it one.

47
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:59,409
Okay, let's begin. When counting the number of

48
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:03,039
physical things in the universe we hit an unknown.

49
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,048
How big is the universe?

50
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:09,400
The entire universe could be infinite

51
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,739
or it could be finite, but edgeless for a
variety of reasons. There could also be

52
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:19,739
other universes. But it's unclear whether
we'll ever be able to actually see all these

53
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,489
things. Instead, what we are stuck with,
and what we usually mean when we say

54
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:28,450
'the universe', is the observable universe

55
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:32,959
whose future visibility limit has been
estimated to be only 62

56
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,239
billion light-years in any direction.

57
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,170
That's it. This is likely the only
inventoryable space we'll ever need

58
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:45,559
to worry about. And it contains roughly,

59
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,560
on average, ten to the eighty elementary
particles. Particles with no

60
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,969
further internal parts as far as we currently now.

61
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:56,819
So that's our answer, right? There are ten to the eighty

62
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,819
physical things that exist out there,
beyond our own minds.

63
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:03,229
Any other physical thing - water, dogs,
planets,

64
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:08,399
saxophones - are just names given to
particular arrangements of those same

65
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,709
ten to the eighty particles. But wait, what if,

66
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:16,048
in the future, we discover that what we
call elementary particles today

67
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:19,750
are actually just made out of smaller
things we should have counted

68
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,860
instead? Well, to cover ourselves let's count

69
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,379
the maximum possible number of the
smallest measurable thing.

70
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:31,639
Something the size of a Planck volume.

71
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:34,949
10 to the power of 183

72
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:38,870
things that small could fit within our observable universe.

73
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:44,139
I like this number, 10 to the power of 183.

74
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:47,519
You couldn't easily argue there 
were more things than that

75
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,839
in the physical, real-world.
But you could imagine.

76
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,879
A Planck length, a Planck volume.
That's just

77
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,509
the smallest measurable amount of space,
not the smallest

78
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:02,269
possible. You could imagine a

79
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:05,658
half Planck volume, a 10,000th of a Planck volume.

80
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:09,259
But, that would just be a thought and only ever

81
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:12,779
a thought. So, how many possible thoughts

82
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:17,149
are there? It's probably safe to say that
the number of possible

83
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:20,439
thoughts is, indeed, infinite. For example,

84
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:24,759
numbers. You can't say there's a limit to
the biggest number we can imagine.

85
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,490
But, unlike physical things that exist
whether or not we have

86
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,668
discovered them, do unthought thoughts

87
00:05:32,668 --> 00:05:38,478
already exist? It seems more like
the pool of possible

88
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:43,509
thoughts is really just one thing an
actual elements from that set don't

89
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,180
become things by themselves until we thing them

90
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,500
that is we or some other mind thinks
about them

91
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,990
or talks about them and there's a limit to
how many things

92
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,168
we or anything else could ever thing

93
00:05:57,168 --> 00:06:01,899
our observable universe is only so big
and it will contain usable energy

94
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:07,329
for only so long. After about 1 trillion
to a hundred trillion years

95
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:11,050
the supply of gas needed to form new
stars will be

96
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,550
exhausted and the lights will start
going out

97
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,620
one-star at a time. After a

98
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,598
Google years the amount of usable energy
left in the universe will be

99
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:27,188
0 and nothing will be able to happen

100
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:30,349
to calculate the maximum number up
thoughts that could be

101
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,848
thought inside our observable universe
let's take

102
00:06:33,848 --> 00:06:37,319
all of its mass and turn it into human
brains

103
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,300
that just think new and random thoughts
from the beginning of time

104
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,990
until the universe runs out of usable
energy, a Google years

105
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,000
of thinking. But wait, what if there are

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,199
alien brains or for all we know Earthling
brains that

107
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,610
think faster than we can okay well to be
safe

108
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,870
let's not turn all of that mass into
human brains let's use it to build a

109
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,740
giant hypothetical machine that computes at
the fastest speed possible given the

110
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,468
speed of light

111
00:07:04,468 --> 00:07:07,769
in the uncertainty principle; Bremermann's
Limit

112
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:12,728
its 1.36 times ten to the fifty bits
per second per kilogram

113
00:07:12,728 --> 00:07:17,889
of material, now a high-end estimate for the
total mass of the observable universe

114
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:21,400
is 3.4 times ten to the the 60 kilograms

115
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:26,459
which used exclusively for the best
possible computing machine could altogether

116
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:30,288
process 4.624 times ten to the 110

117
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:36,468
bits per second. Now with 3.154
times 10 to the 116

118
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:40,348
seconds available from the beginning of
time to the heat death of the universe

119
00:07:40,348 --> 00:07:44,038
and an assumption that the average
thought takes about a sentance worth

120
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:45,810
of information to describe

121
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,050
say about 800 bits we get a total

122
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,069
of 1.458 times

123
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:55,610
ten to the 227 things that could

124
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,908
ever be thought or imagined. That number

125
00:07:59,908 --> 00:08:04,300
is huge. In the observable universe

126
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,439
the universe as we will ever
know it the number of thoughts that can be thought

127
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:12,338
is so much larger than the number of physical
things there can be with out

128
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:16,360
imagination and if you were to combine the
two totals

129
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,419
the number of physical things would
barely

130
00:08:19,418 --> 00:08:23,068
make a difference. So, funny enough

131
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:26,370
when it comes to every thing in the universe

132
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,519
it really is the thought that counts.

133
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:31,500
And as always,

134
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,279
thanks for watching.
