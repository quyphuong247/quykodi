00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:05,769
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. If we turned

2
00:00:05,769 --> 00:00:09,120
the Moon into a giant disco ball,

3
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,259
day and night would not

4
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:17,359
be a disco party. Instead of diffusely
reflecting sunlight onto

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,920
all of us, a mirror-tiled moon would reflect

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,910
specularly. You would be lucky to momentarily

7
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,469
catch a single reflected beam of sunlight.

8
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:33,560
Now, with the help visuals by Nick from
Yeti Dynamics, who you should subscribe to

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,500
immediately, let's see what would occur
if a disco ball moon actually happened.

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,909
Here's the Earth with an imaginary
screen behind it, so we can track the

11
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,308
path of reflections

12
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:49,629
from a disco ball Moon. It's 3,012 mirror
tiles are ten kilometres thick

13
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,940
and between 100 and 150 kilometres

14
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:56,738
across. And, as you can see, the beams of sunlight they

15
00:00:56,738 --> 00:01:00,299
reflect would only intersect with Earth briefly

16
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:06,700
and rarely - a few every month or so would
race past at more than 20,000 kilometers a second.

17
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:10,859
From the surface of Earth, they'd just be
tiny flashes in the sky

18
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:14,310
0.1 percent as bright as the regular Sun

19
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,219
and would last a fraction of a second.
The Earth, Sun and Moon just

20
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:21,959
aren't an ideal locations for disco ball effects.

21
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,319
But, if our disco ball moon was closer

22
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,500
and orbited earth not 384,000 kilometers away but

23
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,640
less than 450, as far as the
International Space Station does,

24
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,680
it would be torn apart by gravitational

25
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,140
title forces. Shoot. Also, the Moon doesn't really

26
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,310
rotate from our perspective like a fun disco ball.

27
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:50,820
It liberates, but it's starting to look
like instead of an awesome lunar party decoration,

28
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,739
a disco ball moon would just be a lunar party pooper.

29
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:59,739
So, for the sake of investigation, let's
allow this disco ball Moon to not be torn apart

30
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:03,390
and allow it to spin in the sky. Now we're talking.

31
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,228
Occasionally we would get glittery
reflections of a dimmer image

32
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:10,579
of the Sun. From the surface of Earth,

33
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:17,579
this is what we would see.

34
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,169
You know, being able to see

35
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:57,780
Earth reflected is almost cooler. It's like being

36
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,520
a bacterium on a giant's face who's looking into a mirror.

37
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,730
You can see the giant, but not yourself.

38
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:07,409
It kinda makes you feel small.

39
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:11,000
But it would be a great way to take planetary selfies.

40
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:16,399
So, let's watch a mirror the width of the
Moon orbit as close as the ISS does.

41
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,900
From the surface of Earth, it would look like this.

42
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:25,819
The strobe lights around the edge, by
the way, are ten kilometres across.

43
00:04:23,668 --> 00:04:24,979
Pretty cool.

44
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:30,560
Now finally, let's take a look at the
Moon as a rotating disco ball from low orbit.

45
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:28,839
The Moon is not a disco ball

46
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:31,959
and likely never will be. It's just

47
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:35,418
a diffuse source of illumination. But it's

48
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:39,258
illuminating in a different way to imagine
what would occur

49
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:41,699
if that actually happened.

50
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,020
Woah.

51
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:45,049
And as always,

52
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,730
thanks for watching.
