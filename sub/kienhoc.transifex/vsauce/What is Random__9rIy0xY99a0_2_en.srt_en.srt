1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,629
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here and Derek.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,480
Generate(!)

3
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:11,179
78? That's so random. Or is it?

4
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:14,208
What does it mean to be random?

5
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:18,028
Can anything really be random? 
What's the most random thing ever?

6
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:23,839
Today let's stop being random and become 'ransmart'.

7
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,039
If something is unpredictable,

8
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,259
and contains no recognisable patterns, we
call it random.

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:35,280
So let's begin our hunt for the most random thing with a coin toss.

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,219
The Australian 50 cent coin is one of the largest coins

11
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:42,899
currently in circulation.

12
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:47,599
Coin flips and rolling dice are not
intrinsically random,

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,600
they are only random because of our

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,670
ignorance. If we could know every initial condition

15
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,870
the exact forces and properties that play
for a particular flip or roll,

16
00:00:58,869 --> 00:01:02,000
we could theoretically calculate the result before it

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,099
even happened. And, sure enough, researchers
have built coin flipping robots

18
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:10,780
that can precisely control a flip to get
the result they want

19
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,079
100 percent of the time.

20
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:19,579
So here is our question. Is there anything you couldn't predict

21
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:23,859
even if you knew everything? A process determined

22
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:27,049
by nothing? And how can you be sure they're

23
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:30,149
aren't any patterns in what you're
looking at? Maybe you just haven't looked

24
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,500
for the right pattern yet.

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,650
Or maybe you have already seen true
randomness

26
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,120
but didn't know it because you didn't
look for long enough.

27
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,170
As if protected by a sort of camouflage,

28
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:47,820
a random process can, and will,
occasionally produce patterns.

29
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:50,019
YouTube URLs are pretty much

30
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,510
random. A unique one is made for every
uploaded video, but sometimes,

31
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,770
like the proverbial monkeys typing away
on typewriters,

32
00:01:57,769 --> 00:02:02,899
YouTube generates a URL that contains, by chance, a word.

33
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,020
The official music video for 50 Cent's

34
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,080
'In Da Club' contains a synonym for bottom.

35
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,460
This video was assigned 'hello',

36
00:02:11,468 --> 00:02:16,060
there are some 'sexies' and a sauce. If you
want to find out if a particular word

37
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,030
has been randomly assigned to a video
yet, you can search for it

38
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,669
by using this string in Google.

39
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:27,738
The point is, randomness is difficult to identify.
It is easier to be certain that something

40
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:33,900
is not random than that it is. But despite this elusiveness something interesting

41
00:02:33,908 --> 00:02:37,560
is going on right now. Increasingly, we,

42
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,568
especially young people, are calling
clearly predictable

43
00:02:40,568 --> 00:02:43,068
things random.

44
00:02:43,068 --> 00:02:48,079
Like randomly running into your best friend at a popular restaurant.

45
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,260
Or hilariously bizarre combinations of things that we call

46
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:56,108
totally random because they are
seemingly unrelated,

47
00:02:56,109 --> 00:03:00,680
even though, of course, they were chosen
not in random but in a very determined way

48
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,159
because they are all unrelated.

49
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:07,539
Those guys that showed up at the party last night you didn't know,

50
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:11,598
they weren't randos in a mathematical sense.

51
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,758
They knew about the party, we're in
the mood to go to a party and we're in the area.

52
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,908
Pretty predictable, actually.

53
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:23,188
This non-statistical use of the word random annoys

54
00:03:23,188 --> 00:03:26,620
some people but it's not that far off
from the original meaning

55
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,099
of the word. In the 1300s, random

56
00:03:30,098 --> 00:03:33,199
meant running or at great speed.

57
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,959
Later, it would be used to describe
things that have no definite purpose.

58
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:44,098
It wasn't until the 1800s that random
took on a particular mathematical definition.

59
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:48,318
Then in the 1970s, MIT's student paper

60
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:54,058
popularised the use of the word random
to simply mean strange.

61
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,900
Of course, just because
something is strange doesn't mean it has

62
00:03:56,908 --> 00:04:01,929
no discoverable cause. Why have we started
calling so many predictable things

63
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,299
random? Well, many theories revolve around

64
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:09,019
the amount up information and new people
we are confronted with

65
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:12,400
at an increasing rate; now more than ever
before.

66
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,789
Perhaps it's just easier, almost a bit of a relief

67
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:18,829
to call things random, so that we can move on

68
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,889
to synthesise other information.

69
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,660
Take a look at this die.

70
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:27,300
Now, as you can see, it rolls a five most of the time

71
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,319
but not all the time. Over time

72
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,750
a sequence of its results will contain
less randomness.

73
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:39,279
But it is still random. Any face is
possible and I have no guarantee beforehand

74
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,009
of knowing which face will show up. The
outcomes I'm selecting from make the

75
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:44,409
resulting sequence less full of

76
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,280
randomness but the process is still random.

77
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:53,379
Even though a die and a coin are
extremely sensitive to their initial conditions,

78
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:56,560
and, over the course of normal use, are
quite

79
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,560
unpredictable, they do over time

80
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,009
exhibit certain biases. Biases that make them

81
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:06,199
a bit more predictable and a little less random

82
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:11,069
than you might think. First of all, dice. Even
precision dice are only quality

83
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:14,029
controlled within a few micrometers.

84
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,199
You can check this out yourself. Make

85
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,879
two stacks of ten or more similar dice.

86
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:24,959
Now, if you orient each die every which way,
you should pretty much get two equally sized stacks

87
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,500
But, if you arrange each stack

88
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,269
along a shared axis, so that every die
faces the same way,

89
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:37,889
any regular imperfections caused by the
manufacturing process may become visible.

90
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:39,319
But what about coins?

91
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:43,409
Well, some fantastic research has been
done on what happens when they spin

92
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,730
and flip. For instance, it has been found that US
nickel is just the right diameter and

93
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,550
thickness to wind up landing

94
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,900
not heads up or tails up when flipped,
but on its

95
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:57,269
side, about once every six thousand
times it's flipped.

96
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:01,129
But what about the fairness of flipping
a coin? Well, if you flip a coin like

97
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:04,699
this, for statistical and physical reasons
the side facing up

98
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:09,659
before the flip begins, doesn't actually have
a fifty percent chance of being the result.

99
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:14,900
Instead, as researchers at Stanford have
found, it actually has

100
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:20,399
a fifty one percent chance. In this case it was the other side though.

101
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:22,049
Still pretty random.

102
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,060
If you want a coin flip to be as fair as possible,

103
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:28,849
you should just catch it in your hand. Don't
allow it to hit the ground, bounce, tumble

104
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:33,090
and spin. That's because researchers have
found that when a coin spins

105
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:36,339
larger biases come into play. The shape of its edge,

106
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:40,369
its centre of gravity. The heavier side tends to go down

107
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,560
quite often. In the case of some coins as often as

108
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,079
eighty percent of the time. It's been
found that a one euro coin

109
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:50,859
will spin, and land heads up, more often than not,

110
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,949
and a US penny will land tails up

111
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:57,038
more often than not when spun. But like I said

112
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:01,269
earlier, theoretically if we knew
everything about the initial conditions

113
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:03,490
of a coin flip or a die roll, we could

114
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,620
calculate beforehand their outcome.

115
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,480
Why don't we do that more often?

116
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,840
Well, it's extremely difficult.

117
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,979
Insane amounts of precision would be required because the smallest

118
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,389
difference between two initial
conditions can be magnified over time

119
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:26,259
leading to chaotic, extremely difficult
to predict, results.

120
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:28,920
Random.org, the service Derek and I used

121
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,240
at the beginning of this video to generate a
random number, uses

122
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,050
atmospheric noise. It's extremely hard to predict,

123
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,680
but technically still a deterministic system.

124
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,870
All that noise came from somewhere and
if we could just find out those initial

125
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,250
conditions we could,

126
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,199
theoretically, predict their outcomes.

127
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,140
If we want a system more random

128
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:56,939
than that we will need to find one that
is determined by nothing

129
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:02,439
and for that let's look closer. Quantumly close.

130
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:06,000
Quantum mechanics may have our answer.

131
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:09,490
It describes the properties of quantumly
sized things

132
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,470
as probabilities;

133
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:17,360
just chances. Not because we don't know enough
yet to be certain,

134
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,598
or predict, but because, well, the idea is

135
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:24,000
there's nothing there to predict.

136
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,098
There is no beforehand we could know.

137
00:08:27,098 --> 00:08:31,788
Whether or not a particular individual
radioactive atom will decay or not,

138
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:34,908
or whatever the spin of an electron is,

139
00:08:34,908 --> 00:08:39,559
is only knowable once we look. They're
determined by a deep-seated

140
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:43,039
randomness woven into the universe itself.

141
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,639
Einstein couldn't believe this.
He refused to accept, as he said,

142
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:50,958
that "God played dice with the universe."

143
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,159
But... experiments

144
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:58,309
with entangled particles have shown

145
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:01,819
violations of Bell inequalities.

146
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,079
Entangled particles are particles that
exhibit similar properties

147
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:09,189
even when separated by large distances.

148
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,959
Now, if they agreed on those shared
properties to have, or are somehow

149
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:17,189
determined beforehand to have them, their behaviors

150
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,959
should satisfy Bell's famous inequalities.
But experiments have found

151
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:27,078
that instead the likelihood of what a
machine will see when measuring one particle

152
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:32,349
determines how the other machine will
measure the other particle.

153
00:09:32,349 --> 00:09:38,860
It is here, when we look that the chance is
determined. Explanations for this

154
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,740
are even weirder but what the results
suggest is that

155
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,930
the chance of seeing particular quantum qualities

156
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,539
don't pre-exist.

157
00:09:48,549 --> 00:09:52,149
They happen when you look.

158
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:55,740
So, if you are ever feeling boring or

159
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,458
predictable, just remember that you are
made out of octillions

160
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:03,639
of quantum probabilities. Dice that don't
tumble in any

161
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:06,720
analysable way we could ever predict.

162
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,940
They are the most random thing.

163
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,920
God may play dice with the universe, but they are

164
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:17,948
the best dice in the universe.

165
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,160
And as always,

166
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,759
thanks for watching.

167
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,378
But what does it all mean?

168
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:30,820
Well, true randomness doesn't mean anything.
I mean, for us to have meaning we need

169
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:37,640
structure, predictability and that is what I'm
exploring over on my channel, Veritasium.

170
