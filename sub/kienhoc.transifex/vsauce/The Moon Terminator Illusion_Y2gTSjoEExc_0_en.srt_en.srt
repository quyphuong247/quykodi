1
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:07,759
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
This

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,899
is called the dolly zoom effect
and the optics that make it possible

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,250
are also responsible for what's called the moon

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,429
terminator illusion.

5
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:23,629
A terminator is the line between an illuminated

6
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:26,689
and dark side.
Light arrives

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,300
perpendicular to the terminator but it
doesn't always

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,039
appear to.
Maybe you've noticed this before. When the Moon

9
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:37,509
and the Sun are up at the same time,
and a good distance apart

10
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:40,750
in the sky, the direction the Moon is being lit

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,808
from won't always appear to line up

12
00:00:43,808 --> 00:00:48,068
with the position of the Sun.
What's going on here?

13
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,878
The answer lies

14
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,728
in visual angles.
The further away from you something is,

15
00:00:54,728 --> 00:00:59,978
the smaller it will appear to be.
In psychophysical terms, its visual angle

16
00:00:59,978 --> 00:01:04,370
shrinks - the angle within your field of
view that it stretches across.

17
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:08,210
Now, this means that everything
we look at is foreshortened,

18
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:12,099
that is it diminishes incise towards the horizon line.

19
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:15,539
A line infinitely far away.
Things that far away

20
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,630
are foreshortened to the point at which
they have no height

21
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:21,719
whatsoever.
This distortion

22
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,789
affects everything that we look at.
But it doesn't confuse us, because

23
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:30,219
our brains know about it.
We can look at an object that is foreshortened and

24
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:33,390
figure out what it probably actually looks like.

25
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,800
For example, a door is a rectangle,

26
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,950
but it's wrecked by foreshortening when

27
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,710
opened.
Closer distances appear larger. The whole shape

28
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:48,500
is different, but your brain isn't
freaked out every time a door opens,

29
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,709
because it understands

30
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,109
that different sensations don't necessarily mean

31
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:56,450
different actual things.
It's called subjective

32
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,579
constancy.
Our brains cleverly factor in previous

33
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:04,569
experience and perspective clues from
the surrounding world

34
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:07,729
to calculate in real time whether changes

35
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:11,110
in what we sense are because of actual changes

36
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:15,989
in the things we're looking at or are
just merely products of their positions

37
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:17,789
or the surroundings.

38
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:21,219
For example, I, right now on this video screen,

39
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:25,129
am vulnerable to foreshortening.
But I probably look

40
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:28,990
okay to you.
However, if we frame in really closely

41
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,730
and remove surrounding perspective clues,
I can be made to look

42
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:36,519
weird, strange, a little scary,

43
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,530
distended.
I'm foreshortened without the necessary tools

44
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,509
around me for you to mentally adjust.
This

45
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:48,090
is probably the crux of the Moon terminator

46
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,340
illusion.
Take a look at this.

47
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,420
The line where that wall meets the ceiling

48
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:57,629
is a straight line.
Seriously, take a look.

49
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:01,269
If you look to the left and right,
it continues to look straight

50
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,590
and trust me, this building was built with level straight

51
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,780
ceilings.
But that's not what your eye

52
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,890
senses.
A camera will help

53
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:15,129
demonstrate this. It doesn't add in the
post sensation processing that our

54
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:15,930
brains do

55
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,890
and we can also frame in to remove other
clues telling us what to think.

56
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:23,250
Now, sure enough, right in front of us the line is

57
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,599
level with the screen of the camera -
it's a straight line - but

58
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:31,039
if we move our eyes across the line,
look what happens. If I pan this way,

59
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,209
the slope changes and now the line
appears to be going

60
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:38,319
up and to the left.
And if I panned

61
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,919
this way, the line appears to be moving
up and to the right.

62
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:47,539
What's going on here?
A straight line can't have changing slope,

63
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:51,098
that's what a curved line does.

64
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:54,858
Just like the curve we think we see
between the Sun

65
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,859
and the Moon.
But wait. If

66
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:01,150
the line between the Sun and the Moon is
curved because of foreshortening,

67
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,920
why don't we see lines like this one as curves?
Well,

68
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:08,328
here's a clue.
Clues.

69
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:12,658
We know what rooms are supposed to look like.
We know how they're built. We have

70
00:04:12,658 --> 00:04:15,280
experience with them and there are other
things in the environment

71
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,029
helping us. But when you look at the sky,
there's not much to help you.

72
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:24,369
In the absence of clues about distance
and perspective, our brains assume that

73
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,788
whatever we're looking at is

74
00:04:25,788 --> 00:04:29,569
equidistant from us, making the sky a sort of

75
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,668
dome surface, like a planetarium screen.

76
00:04:32,668 --> 00:04:36,788
The only clue we have then is the horizon,
but it's a red herring,

77
00:04:36,788 --> 00:04:41,110
because the horizon doesn't foreshorten.
It's just a place where

78
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,770
due to foreshortening everything becomes infinitely flat.

79
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:48,728
Brian Rogers and Olga Naumenko 
demonstrated that these things result

80
00:04:48,728 --> 00:04:52,399
in the terminator illusion by using a planetarium.

81
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,239
They projected two dots onto its dome,
mimicking our perception of the Sun

82
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,389
and the Moon. They've then asked
participants to place a third dot on the

83
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:02,860
straight line connecting them.

84
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,259
But just as in the Moon terminator illusion, people

85
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:10,689
incorrectly placed the third dot.
They were influenced by a desire to stay

86
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:12,579
parallel to the horizon,

87
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:17,168
as if it was subject to the same foreshortening rules.
Our brains also

88
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:21,579
often fail to factor in foreshortening
when it comes to crepuscular rays,

89
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:24,579
light beams streaming through gaps in clouds.

90
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:28,569
They appear to converge from a common point,
as if the Sun is only

91
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:32,560
a few thousand meters above Earth, but, of
course, in fact, the Sun is extremely

92
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,459
far away

93
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:38,779
and these lines are actually pretty much exactly parallel.

94
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:42,889
It's true. They look like they converge
for the same reason railroad tracks

95
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:44,079
appear to converge.

96
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,339
The visual angle of the distance separating them

97
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:51,089
shrinks the further down you look.
Sometimes

98
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:54,849
our brains do the opposite.
They assume

99
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,180
and consider foreshortening even when it isn't

100
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,259
really there, like in this illusion, where

101
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,990
the cars seem to be different sizes but
in actuality on the page

102
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:11,210
are all the same size. Everything else in
the image is affected by foreshortening,

103
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:15,859
so our brains assume that the cars
are too and decide that in order for them

104
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,189
all to have the same visual angle, which they do,

105
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:22,800
the more distant ones must be literally larger

106
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,259
in real life.
The rate at which the visual angle

107
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:30,110
of something you are looking at changes as
you move toward it, or away from it,

108
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,340
is not constant.
In order to cut the visual

109
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:36,719
angle of an object in half, its distance from you

110
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,840
must double.
That means objects

111
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,879
really really far away require a lot
more movement to have their visual angle

112
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,600
changed compared to nearer objects.

113
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,160
This is called parallax and it's a major reason

114
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,210
moving allows us to learn so much about

115
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:57,289
depth.
It's why stuff on the side of the road

116
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:01,800
whizzes is by you as you drive past,
while distant features of the landscape

117
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,319
appear to only crawl past.
A really distant thing, like,

118
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,480
say, the Moon, 384,000 kilometers away

119
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,629
appears to move so little as you do, it can seem

120
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:16,639
to be following you.

121
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,859
It's not, of course. It's just geometry.
For the same reasons,

122
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:26,308
moving a camera through space will
affect the visual angle of nearer

123
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:26,859
things,

124
00:07:26,858 --> 00:07:29,998
like the Vsauce mug here much more dramatically than

125
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:33,609
distant things,
like Jake Chudnow's album against the wall.

126
00:07:33,608 --> 00:07:36,688
It is barely changing size as we move back

127
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,499
and forth.
But unlike moving, zooming

128
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:43,539
increases the visual angle of
everything equally,

129
00:07:43,538 --> 00:07:46,918
regardless of depth.
Notice that when zooming,

130
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:51,959
the distant album grows and shrinks
right along with the mug. Now, if you move

131
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:55,168
IN while zooming OUT, or vice versa,

132
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:58,338
the zoom will be most apparent when looking at distant

133
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:01,939
things, while the move more apparent on near things.

134
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:05,939
The result can be trippy.
Here I've been placed where both

135
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:09,838
effects cancel each other out,
so everything around me changes

136
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:14,139
instead. Another great illusion that
takes advantage of parallax

137
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:17,598
is the popular star field or hallway illusion.

138
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,178
Cover the middle of the video
and you'll appear to be moving

139
00:08:21,178 --> 00:08:25,468
much faster.
But you if cover the edges, you'll appear to be moving

140
00:08:25,468 --> 00:08:29,629
much slower. All you're doing is altering
the perspective clues your brain

141
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:30,289
receives

142
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:33,620
about movement.
The nearer stuff at the edge

143
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,959
changes position faster
than the distance stuff way ahead.

144
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,989
So if you cover the slow distance stuff your brain

145
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,970
only has the faster moving stuff to
judge speed from. But cover the faster

146
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,290
near stuff and the slower stuff becomes the new

147
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:52,349
near.
Your brain assumes that you've slowed down.

148
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,059
The optics and mathematics behind all of these effects

149
00:08:56,059 --> 00:08:59,328
were understood at least thousands of years ago.

150
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:02,958
During the Renaissance, artists used that
knowledge to produce

151
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,989
paintings that imitated reality really

152
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,299
well.
I mean, the perspective is quite realistic.

153
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,000
But... the renaissance?

154
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:17,939
Why did it take so long for us get there?

155
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,660
I mean, look at this pre-Renaissance painting.

156
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:24,659
What the heck is going on here?
The perspective is all wrong. That's not at

157
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:26,709
all what such a scene would actually

158
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:31,920
look like.
Artists and viewers contemporary to works like that

159
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,189
saw the world just like we do, they

160
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,350
saw foreshortening - they couldn't help but
see it. Foreshortening is right there in

161
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,149
plain sight.

162
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:43,329
No, foreshortening is

163
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:46,600
plain sight.
So, what gives?

164
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,700
Were medieval artists all just a bunch of five year olds?

165
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,290
No.

166
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:56,929
No in the sense that the question is wrong.

167
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,340
Realistic-looking perspective was used
way before the Renaissance.

168
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,660
Now, it might not have always been
mathematically formal perspective,

169
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:09,819
but foreshortening was understood.
Western art went from this

170
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,470
to this, not because humans all of a
sudden became smarter,

171
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,639
but because of a difference in desire.

172
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:21,259
What to us today might look unrealistic and thus

173
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:24,460
bad, was, in its time,

174
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,399
deliberate and popular.
The shift

175
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,620
to imitating the world mathematically,
as if seen through a window,

176
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,470
was more about cultural interests and objectivity and

177
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,190
the individual than it was about artists
all of a sudden becoming

178
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,610
smarter.
Furthermore, perspective illusions shows that what we

179
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,789
think we see isn't always what we're seeing.

180
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,900
A child's drawing may seem crude

181
00:10:50,909 --> 00:10:54,319
in terms of objective mathematical imitation,

182
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,810
but there are other things about the world and

183
00:10:57,809 --> 00:11:01,729
our experience of it worth imitating.
Teasing out

184
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:05,039
the less plainly obvious to show
something personal

185
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,789
is sometimes even harder than following
perspective grids

186
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:12,819
Picasso put it this way it: "It took me four years

187
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:17,850
to learn to paint like Rafael,
but a lifetime to learn to paint

188
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,290
like a child."

189
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:21,120
And as always,

190
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,500
thanks for watching.
