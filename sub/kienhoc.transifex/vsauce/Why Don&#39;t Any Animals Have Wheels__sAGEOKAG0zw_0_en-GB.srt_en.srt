1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,379
Hey, Vsauce, Michael here,
and today we are going to ask a question—

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,583
why don't any animals
have wheels?

3
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:17,272
I mean, animals use a plethora
of complicated locomotive techniques—

4
00:00:17,272 --> 00:00:21,917
slithering, fins, legs, wings—

5
00:00:21,917 --> 00:00:25,376
but yet, no animal has wheels.

6
00:00:25,376 --> 00:00:28,395
What's really paradoxical
about this question

7
00:00:28,394 --> 00:00:32,016
is that us humans seem
pretty technologically advanced.

8
00:00:32,017 --> 00:00:35,775
We've mastered the wheel,
but we have yet to design something

9
00:00:35,774 --> 00:00:38,817
that fully takes advantage
of the limb,

10
00:00:38,817 --> 00:00:42,996
which is why this contraption seems
so eerie.

11
00:00:42,996 --> 00:00:45,825
It may be the closest we have come
to mimicking

12
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:49,888
what nature is already
quite natural with.

13
00:00:49,887 --> 00:00:53,602
Of course, nature,
the source of these miraculous limbs

14
00:00:53,603 --> 00:00:55,832
that we have yet
to adequately reproduce,

15
00:00:55,832 --> 00:00:58,920
doesn't use wheels.

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,401
The wheel gives a mechanical advantage
to the user,

17
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:06,280
allowing them to move heavy things
more easily,

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,387
but if the wheel is so simple
and seems like such a no-brainer,

19
00:01:10,387 --> 00:01:12,974
why don't any animals have them?

20
00:01:12,974 --> 00:01:16,991
Well, to be sure, let's take a look
at the wheel spider.

21
00:01:16,992 --> 00:01:20,774
When escaping from a predator,
this spider will turn its body

22
00:01:20,774 --> 00:01:24,368
into what is essentially a tire
rolling downhill.

23
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:26,969
And who can forget tumbleweeds?

24
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:30,359
These things roll around in the wind,
spreading seeds everywhere.

25
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:33,745
An even crappier example
is the dung beetle,

26
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:37,716
who takes pieces of poop
and turns them into rollable balls

27
00:01:37,715 --> 00:01:39,715
that can be easily moved.

28
00:01:39,715 --> 00:01:42,813
But those are examples of rolling,
not wheels

29
00:01:42,813 --> 00:01:44,813
as we are looking for them today.

30
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:48,781
Wheels on axles—
something that's a part of a whole,

31
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:51,242
but yet exists independently of it

32
00:01:51,242 --> 00:01:53,815
and can spin indefinitely
in one direction

33
00:01:53,816 --> 00:01:55,905
without having
to wind itself back again.

34
00:01:55,905 --> 00:02:00,284
Bacterial flagella
actually operate in this manner,

35
00:02:00,284 --> 00:02:03,581
but we don't see it
in any larger life form,

36
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:07,459
which brings us to the first problem
of finding wheels on animals.

37
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:11,685
How can a living wheel
be completely separate from the animal

38
00:02:11,685 --> 00:02:14,725
and still receive nutrients
and expel waste?

39
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:17,954
Or, if that wheel was made
out of a dead material

40
00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:20,600
the animal produced,
like fingernails or hair,

41
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,387
how would it build
into the shape of a wheel

42
00:02:23,387 --> 00:02:26,706
while maintaining separation
from the host?

43
00:02:26,706 --> 00:02:30,584
For that matter,
how does developing a wheel

44
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:33,348
on your body
help you along the way?

45
00:02:33,348 --> 00:02:36,158
I mean, look at a giraffe—
having a neck

46
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:38,981
that's just a little bit longer
still means

47
00:02:38,981 --> 00:02:41,350
that you'll be able to reach food
that's a bit higher,

48
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,765
you'll have more food,
will live longer,

49
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:47,456
and will have more babies,
making longer necks more common.

50
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:52,055
But if your mutation is a wheel
that's only a little bit round,

51
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:54,236
it doesn't provide the same benefit.

52
00:02:54,236 --> 00:02:58,694
It doesn't equal you making
more babies.

53
00:02:58,694 --> 00:03:01,016
And as much as I hate
to admit it,

54
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:04,778
the wheel may be
a bit overrated.

55
00:03:04,778 --> 00:03:07,519
Think of it this way—
in order for a wheel

56
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,420
to be useful for movement,
it sort of requires

57
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,438
a prior invention—
roads.

58
00:03:13,438 --> 00:03:16,573
Without a smooth surface
to roll on,

59
00:03:16,574 --> 00:03:19,987
like a road or rails,
the wheel falls short,

60
00:03:19,986 --> 00:03:23,656
and wings and fins and limbs
do a better job

61
00:03:23,656 --> 00:03:26,137
for the terrain found
on Earth.

62
00:03:26,137 --> 00:03:28,830
Even when humans knew
about the wheel,

63
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,756
they had little use for it
across rough terrain

64
00:03:31,756 --> 00:03:34,867
or muddy, debris-ridden streets,

65
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:37,212
which is why wealthy people
in the past

66
00:03:37,212 --> 00:03:40,811
simply got carried around
in litter—

67
00:03:40,812 --> 00:03:43,505
no, not rubbish—
a litter,

68
00:03:43,504 --> 00:03:48,149
a vehicle that uses no wheels
and is carried by people or animals.

69
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:50,378
Fancy, rich people
would get carried around

70
00:03:50,377 --> 00:03:53,070
in chair sedans,
but another type of litter

71
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,415
was simply a sling
made out of fabric

72
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:57,598
that would help you carry, say,
wounded soldiers

73
00:03:57,598 --> 00:03:59,828
across the terrain
of a battlefield.

74
00:03:59,828 --> 00:04:03,473
The modern-day stretcher is an example
of a litter.

75
00:04:03,473 --> 00:04:07,557
Okay, so in order for the wheels
on your body to be useful,

76
00:04:07,556 --> 00:04:09,556
you have to build roads.

77
00:04:09,556 --> 00:04:13,060
So what gives, animals?
Why didn't you ever build roads?

78
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,009
I mean, you guys are capable
of some pretty awesome things—

79
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:19,399
complicated burrows,
nests, dams—

80
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,744
why didn't you ever build roads?

81
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:25,389
Well, this question is fundamental
to Richard Dawkins' analysis

82
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:27,478
of the wheeled animal problem.

83
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:30,032
He says that the problem
with roads

84
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:33,376
is that they're not selfish enough.

85
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:37,462
A nest, a burrow, a dam—
these are things that you can defend;

86
00:04:37,463 --> 00:04:40,225
that you can build
and then only use for your own benefit.

87
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:44,266
Because hey, you were smart enough
and industrious enough to build it,

88
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:47,703
but roads can be used
by anything that stumbles upon it.

89
00:04:47,702 --> 00:04:52,415
I mean, you lost energy
and resources to build that road,

90
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:55,433
while a moocher can just come up
and use it anyway

91
00:04:55,434 --> 00:04:59,219
and have time left
to make a bunch of babies and prosper.

92
00:04:59,218 --> 00:05:04,230
So the road is a really cool example
of how humans got benefits

93
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,290
from breaking the mold
and doing things

94
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,866
not just for themselves,
but for everyone.

95
00:05:09,865 --> 00:05:12,837
In fact, of all the animals,
only humans

96
00:05:12,838 --> 00:05:16,878
have ever invented taxes—
money that we force others to pay

97
00:05:16,877 --> 00:05:19,640
to build services
that they might not even use.

98
00:05:19,641 --> 00:05:23,193
So the next time you see a wheel,
say, "Thanks, wheel.

99
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:26,096
"You're a great symbol of the fact
that humans can cooperate

100
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:28,096
and be unselfish."

101
00:05:28,096 --> 00:05:30,298
And as always,
thanks for watching.

102
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:32,480
I wheel-y mean that.
