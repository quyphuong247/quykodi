00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:10,558
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. I am

2
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:13,959
distorted. The pixels you are watching have been

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,179
time displaced. They've been mapped onto a gradient

4
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:21,778
and the darker the region they're mapped to,
the further behind

5
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:25,589
they lag. The effect is really fun but it's certainly

6
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:28,589
not realistic. Or is it?

7
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,820
Many, many popular digital cameras suffer
from lag induced distortion,

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,020
like what you just saw, though much,

9
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,460
much more subtle. Usually completely

10
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,710
unnoticeable. It's called a rolling shutter.

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,789
Instead of snapping a full exposure at once

12
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:52,198
they quickly scan strips of each frame. It's

13
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:56,710
usually undetectable. But when the
subject changes faster than the camera

14
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,550
scans,

15
00:00:57,549 --> 00:01:03,209
you get the famous geloey wobbly rolling 
shutter effect. Really fast

16
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,799
things, like vibrating guitar strings and
airplane propellers,

17
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,709
are famous victims, but people can be too.
Luke Mandel submitted this photo

18
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:16,618
to Boing Boing[.net]. His camera scans left to
right and, in this instance,

19
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:20,209
managed to capture a blink, eyes closed

20
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:25,169
when the scan began and then open in the
reflection scanned a fraction

21
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,739
of a second later.
But the rolling shutter effect

22
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:32,699
is not just a neat curiosity. It represents

23
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,130
a fundamental and inescapable distortion that

24
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:39,709
affects everything we see. Rolling shutter

25
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:44,118
or not. First things first, let's talk about distortions.

26
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:47,409
A hallucination is a distortion of reality

27
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:51,390
when there is no apparent stimulus. If you are merely

28
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,700
misinterpreting an actual stimulus, that is an illusion.

29
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,909
But some distortions occur before our sense organs

30
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,180
and minds get in the way. They are called

31
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,340
optical phenomena. They are not the
result of sensation or perception gone wrong.

32
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,659
Instead, optical phenomena are distortions
caused by the mere properties of light

33
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:14,500
and matter

34
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,969
in and of themselves. If you look up at the sky

35
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:21,639
and see a giant vivid drinking gourd,

36
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:24,899
you are hallucinating. But if you see a flat

37
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,000
two-dimensional connect-the-dots
Big Dipper, you are seeing

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,289
an illusion. It's an illusion because those dots merely

39
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:37,509
appear to be on the same plain, like
holes poked in the dark roof of the sky.

40
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:40,608
In reality, those dots are stars

41
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:44,730
lightyears apart from one another in three dimensions.

42
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:48,840
As Celestron's brilliant free real-time
3D visualization of space

43
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,439
shows, from different perspectives, besides our own,

44
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,409
they look a lot less like a dipper or plough.

45
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:59,659
In fact, all constellations and asterisms

46
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:03,650
are geocentric illusions. From a wider perspective

47
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,730
their outlines point inward,

48
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:09,789
to the single lowly point in space

49
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,560
that gave them their names. But you can't blame us.

50
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,400
I mean, Earth is the only perspective any
human has ever had.

51
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:22,199
And even Voyager 1,
the most distant man-made object,

52
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:26,060
is still not even close to being far
enough away for the constellations to look

53
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,759
even remotely different than they do here on Earth.

54
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,569
It's also not our fault, our eyes' and brains'

55
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:37,108
fault, that distant, distant stars weren't included

56
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:40,810
in our early cosmic connect-the-dot game.

57
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,079
Sure, our eyesight could be better,

58
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:47,129
but optical phenomena are also to blame.

59
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:52,349
If it weren't for red shifting and the
inverse square law and light extinction,

60
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:55,599
distant things could be seen in all their glory.

61
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,819
The night sky would look phenomenal. Many structures

62
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:03,150
up there are huge. They're just

63
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,849
too dim for their hugeness to be appreciated.

64
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:11,870
When we see Hubble Telescope images of
distant objects, like the Helix Nebula,

65
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,509
it's easy to think that, without a telescope to zoom in,

66
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:19,289
the object must just be a tiny point in the sky.

67
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:23,419
But in reality, even though the Helix Nebula is

68
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:26,680
700 light years away, it's

69
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,160
3 lightyears across. If we could make the Helix Nebula

70
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,340
less dim, if our eyes could take a

71
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:37,728
really long exposure of it,
we would see the Helix Nebula

72
00:04:37,728 --> 00:04:42,839
as it really is - nearly 70% the apparent diameter

73
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,379
of our Moon. This is a serious picture.
That is how large

74
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:50,800
the Helix Nebula would appear in the
night sky from Earth

75
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,360
if it just wasn't so dim. Our Moon is

76
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,199
tiny in the sky, by the way. It's easy to
think of the moon as this huge

77
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,909
baseball-sized thing up there in the sky,
but that's an illusion.

78
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,960
Try this the next time you see the
Moon. Grab a sheet of notebook paper

79
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,299
and you will notice that the angular
diameter of the Moon

80
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,840
is the same size as a hole punched in a
sheet of notebook paper held

81
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:19,879
in arms-length away. Seriously, try it
sometime. It shows just how

82
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:23,620
cute and tiny our little moon is.
The Orion Nebula

83
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,100
would appear even larger, if we saw all of its light.

84
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,180
And the Andromeda Galaxy? Just

85
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,970
a smudge in the sky to our eyes. But if our
eyes were better at collecting

86
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,420
dim light, we would see Andromeda's true extent

87
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,689
in our sky. Of course, our

88
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:44,719
night sky doesn't look like that. Distant objects

89
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,520
are dimmer, that's a bummer. But light still
wins when it comes to speed.

90
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:55,319
Light travels at the fastest speed.
In fact, in a vacuum, light travels

91
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:57,969
300,000 kilometres a second.

92
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,400
That's fast.

93
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,629
But not really. I mean, not compared to how far apart

94
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:08,199
things are in the universe. Sydney, Australia

95
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,279
is 1/14th of a light second away from London.

96
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,919
But the Andromeda Galaxy is

97
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,540
2,500,000 light years away from London.

98
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:22,829
To put that in perspective let's take a
light speed journey from London

99
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:25,810
to Sydney. It would look like this... Ready?

100
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,550
Three, two, one, go!

101
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,230
Nice! Alright, alright. Here's the Andromeda Galaxy.

102
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:40,520
Okay, now, relativistic effects aside,
let's take a look at what it would look

103
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:43,180
like to travel toward the Andromeda Galaxy

104
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,019
at the speed of light. Are you ready? Alright.

105
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:50,539
Three, two, one, go!

106
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,439
Yeah. I mean, seriously, it's

107
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:01,349
pretty lame. Even at the speed of light,

108
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,230
the fastest speed possible, a year from now

109
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,000
we won't even be a millionth of the way there.

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,319
That's how far away

111
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:14,979
Andromeda is. It's almost sad

112
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:20,290
in a way. But this brings us back to
the rolling shutter effect.

113
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:25,960
The Andromeda Galaxy is huge. It's more
than a hundred thousand light years across

114
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:29,589
and our view of it is tilted.

115
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:33,819
Which means that, on the plain we view it in,
light from the back

116
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:39,240
represents what Andromeda looked like
thousands and thousands of years before

117
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,329
what light from the front represents.

118
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:45,689
Changes in its appearance reach us 
sooner from the front

119
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:50,269
than from the back. Andromeda is rotating,
spinning at hundreds of kilometers per

120
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,909
second in some places.

121
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,670
Now, a lag between light coming from near

122
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,879
and far points on a spinning object, results

123
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,689
in a skewed image. The rolling shutter
effect on a cosmic scale

124
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:06,699
applied to, say, a chessboard, seeing the front

125
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:10,409
ahead of the back is pretty trippy and dramatic.

126
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:13,779
So, does that mean we see

127
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:18,200
wobbly, funhouse mirror, rolling
shutter effect versions of Andromeda

128
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,670
and other distant galaxies? Well, technically

129
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:26,660
yeah, but the distortion is negligible. It may as well be

130
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,020
ignored. Why? Well,

131
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:33,669
the speeds used in these visualizations are not

132
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:38,250
to scale. On average, yes, matter within galaxies

133
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,700
orbits the galactic center at hundreds
of kilometers per second

134
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,560
but galaxies are so huge it takes them

135
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:49,209
hundreds of millions of years to complete just one

136
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:53,740
rotation. In other words, the lag between light

137
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,000
reaching you from near and far points on a galaxy,

138
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,289
is nothing compared to how much time it takes

139
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,860
matter in the galaxy to travel that same distance.

140
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,990
In the case of Andromeda, if you insisted

141
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,379
on seeing Andromeda as it really is,

142
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:15,559
that is, corrected for any lag caused by
the fact that the speed of light is

143
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:18,799
finite, the most extreme points on the Galaxy

144
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:23,039
would only need to be adjusted by about a 10,000th of

145
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,419
the width of any image. In this case, less than a pixel.

146
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:30,799
So, it's not a big deal. But it's not a nothing deal.

147
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:34,529
It's real. In fact, everything we look at is,

148
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:37,669
in some way, distorted by the fact that the speed of light

149
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:40,750
is finite. Your own feet are about

150
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:47,139
5 to 6 light nano seconds away from your
eyes, which means when you look at your feet

151
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:50,949
you are seeing where they were 5 to 6

152
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:55,230
nano seconds ago. 5 to 6 nanoseconds in the past.

153
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,250
Of course, a delay that brief is pretty
much undetectable

154
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,879
but it is calculate-able. If it makes you feel

155
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:05,220
a little sad to know that even with the sharpest mind

156
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,550
or the best instruments, appearances still depend on

157
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:13,139
where you are. That optical phenomena insure

158
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:17,679
appearances are always relative(?) Don't feel bad.

159
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:21,669
We call the people closest to us our relatives.

160
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:25,069
We're really just a family, a big family

161
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,480
of reference frames that,
like a family, don't always agree

162
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,570
but do have plenty of cool things to look at.

163
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:35,490
I'd like to thank my editor, Guy, for help with the

164
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,930
rolling shutter effect in this video.

165
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:54,448
And I'd like to thank you, because, as always

166
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:57,068
thanks for watching.

167
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,009
Oh, here's something cool.

168
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:26,039
I will be at YouTube Fan Fest with HP

169
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:29,579
in India very very soon. Check the
