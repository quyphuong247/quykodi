00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,480
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
Earlier this month

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,349
I travelled to Kourou in French Guiana 
with euronews

3
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:10,609
to watch the launch of Vega Rocket,

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,660
if it happened

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,350
while I was there. Waiting at the
observation point with only minutes to go,

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,310
the launch was postponed because of weather.

7
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:25,469
Even though the rocket scientists were

8
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:28,969
using Comic Sans, the rocket it didn't take off

9
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:32,948
until the day after I had to be back in London.

10
00:00:32,948 --> 00:00:36,409
But it made me think.
We can send satellites into orbit

11
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:39,968
and people to the moon and predicts solar eclipses

12
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:43,408
thousands of years into the future but yet

13
00:00:43,408 --> 00:00:47,859
we cannot reliably predict which way the
wind will be blowing

14
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:53,559
in the next our or so. How can such
monumental cosmic movements

15
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:57,530
light minutes or light years away from
us be understood,

16
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:02,618
whereas the weather, which happens in the
very same layer of the atmosphere we

17
00:01:02,618 --> 00:01:04,368
live in every day,

18
00:01:04,368 --> 00:01:07,609
remains such a mystery?
Well,

19
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,670
it has to do with the limits of what we know

20
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,170
and what we can know.
Planetary positions

21
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:19,359
and terrestrial weather in the future
are determined by their

22
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:21,400
initial conditions.

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,359
But over a short time scale predicting
the future position of a planet

24
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,620
involves fewer variables than the weather.

25
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,990
In order to accurately predict the
weather, you need to know the complete

26
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:34,229
and exact conditions

27
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,460
of every molecule of air on Earth.
How those molecules will interact with each

28
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:39,019
other

29
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:43,979
and the earth and how they will feedback
and influence themselves by changing

30
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,630
other molecules. This makes it incredibly
difficult to predict the weather more

31
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:49,310
than a week

32
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:53,129
in advance.
And this problem isn't going to go away.

33
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:57,409
It is fundamental to our relationship with the universe.

34
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:01,250
Given enough time small, unnoticeable,

35
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,599
unmeasurable, unknowable factors get magnified

36
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:08,929
again and again slowly

37
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:13,030
until eventually their impact is vastly significant

38
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,959
and our predictions today are hopeless.

39
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,520
Neil deGrasse Tyson mentions this in his
brilliant "Death by Black Hole,"

40
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,659
where he points out that the recoil
from the launch of a single

41
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:29,500
space probe can influence our future in
such a way

42
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,150
that in about 200 million years

43
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,650
the position of Earth and its orbit around
the Sun will be shifted

44
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,659
by nearly sixty degrees.

45
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,629
Edward Lorenz gave this phenomenon
its popular name.

46
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:47,939
"Predictability; Does the Flap of a Butterfly's wings

47
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:52,139
in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?"

48
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,529
The butterfly effect.
A small change,

49
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,159
like a butterfly deciding to flap its wings,

50
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,199
can lead to a whole chain of events
were bigger

51
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,379
and bigger processes change just enough
to leave the even more significant

52
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:09,810
changes until finally an entire storm

53
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,310
occurs somewhere different or not

54
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,719
at all.
The discipline that such thinking

55
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,000
kick-started is known as chaos theory.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,810
When the present determines the future,
but the approximate

57
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,819
present does not approximately determine the future.

58
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:32,169
To us the universe is full

59
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:38,798
of "if". But all things considered, we
are pretty good at predicting the future

60
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,290
and preparing for it, but some things

61
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:47,229
are or were prepared for a future
that hasn't occurred yet

62
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:51,250
or never did.
And knowing more about those things

63
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,370
sheds amazing perspective on the limits of our knowledge.

64
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:59,259
Speaking of limits, let's begin with your life,

65
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:04,129
carpe diem.
An online tool that when given your birth date

66
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:07,769
uses the latest life expectancy data to
give you back

67
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:11,829
a grid of squares.
One square represents

68
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:16,970
one week - seven days. The lighter ones are
the weeks that you have already

69
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,989
been alive, the darker ones are what you have left.

70
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,500
Check "sleep" to see how many of your previous

71
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,579
and future weeks will be spent

72
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:32,199
sleeping.
Of course, it's just an approximation,

73
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,759
it's difficult to know if you will have more

74
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,009
or fewer weeks to come.
It's hard to know when it will all end.

75
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:43,709
It's even more difficult to document, unless you are

76
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:47,069
Reynaldo Dagsa, a councilman from the Philippines,

77
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:50,889
who took this photo of his family on New Year's Day

78
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:54,810
at the very same second that he was

79
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,389
assassinated.
The photo was later used

80
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:02,230
to catch the killer.
We can't predict everything,

81
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,460
but in the event of an anticipated catastrophic

82
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:09,459
event - severe weather, an incoming nuclear attack or

83
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:12,918
asteroid - how would we all know what was going on?

84
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:17,668
Well, many countries have systems in
place to allow them to speak to as many

85
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:19,979
people as quickly as possible.

86
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,379
The United States has the Emergency Alert

87
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:26,469
System.
When triggered, the system

88
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,610
interrupts all programming on radio and television

89
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,000
with messages generated using text-to-speech

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,779
automated voices.
The warning tones are known,

91
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:40,658
so what's kind of scary is that today

92
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:43,668
we can take a peek

93
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:48,098
and see what it would look like and what
it would sound like

94
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:52,000
if a catastrophic event occurred.
In this example

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,149
a nuclear attack that threatened life
across the entire country.

96
00:05:56,149 --> 00:06:00,529
First of all, you would likely here sirens

97
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:03,829
and then, as you went tune into, say TV,

98
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:08,500
this is what you would hear and see.

99
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,019
We interrupt our programming.

100
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:21,359
This is a national emergency.
The following message is transmitted at the

101
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,980
request of the United States government.

102
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,569
This is not a test. A nuclear attack is
occurring against the United States.

103
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:32,540
Four nuclear missiles have been 
launched from unknown locations

104
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,750
and are expected to strike the United
States within the next 15 minutes.

105
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:41,050
Due to the uncertain facts of these
missiles, all residents of the United

106
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,560
States should seek out

107
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,709
and prepare to take shelter immediately.

108
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:52,759
Stand by for a message from
the President of the United States.

109
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:59,019
If a catastrophic event occurred of global proportions,

110
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:02,979
what would humanity do next?
Well,

111
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:08,200
there might be survivors. People hidden
away in fortresses that we have built,

112
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:08,620
like

113
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,689
the North American Aerospace Defense Command,

114
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:15,000
NORAD.
Built into solid

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,029
granite, shielded by steel plating to
protect computer systems from

116
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:20,509
electromagnetic pulses

117
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:23,709
and supported on springs, so as to

118
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:28,159
safely sway in the event of an earthquake,
NORAD can protect

119
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,520
humans and equipment from a 30

120
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,310
megaton nuclear blast just a mile away.

121
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,709
After the event, it's places like this

122
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:43,669
that would literally be humanity's last,
best chance of continuing life.

123
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:47,310
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is on
the Norwegian island

124
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,689
of Spitsbergen.
Buried 390 feet

125
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:54,569
inside a mountain, it safely stores and protects

126
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:59,240
250 million individual seeds

127
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,250
for growing plants and crops, if their vulnerable

128
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,949
living relatives on the surface are all destroyed.

129
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,579
Soviet technology existed to put people on the Moon,

130
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:14,849
of course, they never did.
If

131
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,920
Russia had sent men to the Moon,
they would have walked around on it

132
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:24,720
looking like this. The Krechet-94
was designed in 1967 but

133
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,650
never used for Soviet manned lunar excursion.

134
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:31,370
Russia did, however, sent the first man into space

135
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,470
and the first woman into outer space.

136
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:38,860
They also sent the first dog into orbit
around the Earth.

137
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,779
Unfortunately, the dog died too soon
after launch due to overheating.

138
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,279
But later they sent Belka and Strelka,

139
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:49,409
dogs on a rocket full of living
organisms that became

140
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:52,699
the very first to orbit the Earth and return to

141
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,050
Earth alive.
You can still see them

142
00:08:56,049 --> 00:09:00,889
today.
The Moscow Cosmonautics Memorial Museum
has the two dogs

143
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:04,330
preserved.
Stuffed and on display as

144
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:08,610
physical relics of earthlings growing up

145
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,570
and leaving their planet.
I was also lucky enough to visit a restaurant

146
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,879
in Moscow with menus - yep - that used Comic Sans.

147
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,419
Oh, and I ate a star dog, which in the cyrillic

148
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:23,599
alphabet looks like it's called crap dosis.

149
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:27,740
The United States of course did send
people to the Moon,

150
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,680
but recently we have learned that NASA
at the time didn't know

151
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:34,679
with the same certainty as other variables

152
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,759
whether the first man on the Moon would be able

153
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:43,909
to leave. Just two days before humanity's
historic moon landing

154
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:47,889
William Safire was asked to prepare a speech

155
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:51,179
for President Nixon to read on television to the world

156
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:55,609
if Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong

157
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,230
became stranded on the Moon.
Thirty years later

158
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,000
William Safire explained that Aldrin and
Armstrong were supposed to reunite with

159
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,110
the command module

160
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,960
orbiting the moon,
but if they couldn't and there was a

161
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,060
good risk that they couldn't, then they would have to be

162
00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:17,729
abandoned on the Moon, left to die there

163
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,190
and

164
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,020
mission control would then have to use
their euphemism

165
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:26,789
"close down communication"
and the men would have to either

166
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:30,240
starve to death or commit suicide.

167
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,470
And, so, we prepared for that with the

168
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,540
the speech that I wrote and

169
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:40,990
the President was ready to to give that.
Luckily,

170
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,409
Nixon never had to deliver the Moon disaster speech,

171
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:48,419
but to read it today, thinking of those two guys

172
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:51,740
still alive on the surface of the Moon

173
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,549
knowing that they will never get back to Earth

174
00:10:55,549 --> 00:11:00,019
is chiling.
Included in that speech

175
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:03,809
were these lines: "fate has ordained

176
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:07,039
that the men who went to the Moon to
explore in peace

177
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,559
will stay on the Moon to rest in peace.

178
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,449
These brave men, Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin,

179
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,310
know that there is no hope for their
recovery but they also know that their

180
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:21,639
is hope for mankind in their sacrifice.

181
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:26,769
In ancient days men looked at the stars
and saw their heroes

182
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,909
in the constellations.
In modern times we do much the same,

183
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:34,458
but our heroes are epic men of flesh

184
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:38,139
and blood.
For every human being who looks up at the moon

185
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:41,409
in the nights to come will know that there is some corner

186
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:47,870
of another world that is forever mankind."
And that's what I took away most from my

187
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,509
trip to Kourou.

188
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:55,179
Space isn't just a place for zero-g
tricks or imagining sci-fi technology,

189
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:58,219
space is ever-expanding

190
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,450
and full of corners of other worlds that could
one day become mankind's,

191
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,910
if we choose to.
And that doesn't minimize Earth.

192
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:10,909
The Vega rocket I went to see sent up
satellites designed to

193
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:14,919
test electric solar wind sails for
interplanetary travel,

194
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:18,809
as well as satellites built to analyze
the health of Earth's

195
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:22,799
vegetation or to predict natural disasters.

196
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:27,909
Just as our bodies benefit from having
doctors and instruments beyond them that

197
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:28,350
can

198
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:32,340
probe, investigate and diagnose, so does the earth.

199
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,540
Launch pads, like the one in Kourou I got to visit,

200
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:39,469
are really just hospital waiting rooms for

201
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:44,480
earth. A place where our planet can wait
for researchers and scientists

202
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,909
to put their tools, their instruments into use,

203
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:51,110
into orbit.
We may never know

204
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,590
if something will or will not happen, but by

205
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,149
pursuing space, corners of other worlds,

206
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:01,259
we gain a perspective that can help us shrink

207
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:04,980
the size of that mysterious and often
frightening

208
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,899
if.and as always

209
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,180
And as always,

210
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,170
thanks for watching.
