00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,381
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And today we are going to talk about why we dream.

2
00:00:05,381 --> 00:00:07,128
What's going on inside our brains?

3
00:00:07,128 --> 00:00:11,263
The scientific study of dreaming is called oneriology.

4
00:00:11,263 --> 00:00:14,189
And for most of history, it didn't really exist,

5
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:16,810
because you can't hold a dream.

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,818
It's difficult to measure a dream, you can't taste it.

7
00:00:19,818 --> 00:00:22,317
You can't see other people's dreams,

8
00:00:22,317 --> 00:00:24,277
and if you ask them to tell you what they dreamt,

9
00:00:24,277 --> 00:00:27,243
the results are almost always unreliable.

10
00:00:27,243 --> 00:00:31,541
In fact, it's estimated that we forget 85 percent

11
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:35,573
of the dreams we have, especially within the first ten minutes of having them.

12
00:00:35,573 --> 00:00:39,545
But then, in 1952, something amazing happened.

13
00:00:39,545 --> 00:00:43,619
Researchers at the University of Chicago found this.

14
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:46,672
It's a unique type of electrical activity

15
00:00:46,673 --> 00:00:50,634
that occurs during a certain stage of a person sleeping.

16
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:53,518
When researchers awoke people during this stage,

17
00:00:53,518 --> 00:00:56,851
they almost always reported that they had been dreaming.

18
00:00:56,851 --> 00:01:01,310
Also, at the same time, during this stage, people's eyeballs are going crazy,

19
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,439
rapidly darting all over the place underneath their eyelids.

20
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,903
You can actually see this happening if
you watch people sleep like I usually do.

21
00:01:07,903 --> 00:01:10,911
During REM sleep, some pretty bizarre stuff happens.

22
00:01:10,911 --> 00:01:13,207
If you look at the electrical activity of a brain

23
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:16,243
that is in REM sleep, it almost exactly mimics

24
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,459
the way the brain acts when it's awake.

25
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:22,207
The biggest difference being that the production of chemicals inside the brain

26
00:01:22,206 --> 00:01:25,549
like norepinephrine, serotonin, and histamine

27
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:27,834
is almost completely blocked,

28
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:30,476
and that causes the muscles to stop moving,

29
00:01:30,477 --> 00:01:33,504
which is why you can dream about flying or running around

30
00:01:33,504 --> 00:01:36,521
or fighting ninjas, but your body doesn't move.

31
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:40,269
People who have a disorder achieving complete REM atopia

32
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:42,890
move around in their sleep and act out their dreams.

33
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:45,816
They can even get out of bed and sleep walk.

34
00:01:45,816 --> 00:01:48,326
Oh, before we move forward, I should say two things.

35
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:52,530
One is that it's possible to wake up and not be able to move your body

36
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:55,284
because you're still in REM atopia.

37
00:01:55,284 --> 00:01:57,377
You're completely conscious and you know that you're awake,

38
00:01:57,376 --> 00:01:59,418
but your body is not ready to move.

39
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:03,085
On the flip side, you can also be inside a dream

40
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:05,250
and know that you're dreaming.

41
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,002
This phenomenon is known as lucid dreaming,

42
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:11,375
and it's particularly attractive, because
while in an illusive dream,

43
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:14,219
I can make conscious decisions about what I do.

44
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:18,395
I can go fly to wherever I want, or I can
have a tea party with Abraham Lincoln.

45
00:02:18,395 --> 00:02:23,189
I'm in control, but achieving illusive dream is quite illusive.

46
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:25,728
Howcast has a great video, which
I've put in the description

47
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,401
that gives some tips and tricks on how to achieve one.

48
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:34,364
Researchers were able to deprive
mice of REM sleep by using this

49
00:02:34,364 --> 00:02:38,914
inverted inside a tub of water way up to the tippy top,

50
00:02:38,914 --> 00:02:41,372
meaning that the mouse was only able to sit

51
00:02:41,372 --> 00:02:44,085
right on top of this little tiny surface.

52
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:48,170
When that happens, the mouse can still
fall into non-REM sleep,

53
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:50,759
but as soon as they reach REM sleep
and their muscles relax,

54
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:53,715
they fall off the platform into
the water waking up.

55
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,727
What they found was that when mice
are not allowed to achieve REM sleep,

56
00:02:57,727 --> 00:02:59,729
they have an incredibly amount of trouble

57
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:01,598
remembering things.

58
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,315
This happens in humans too.

59
00:03:03,314 --> 00:03:06,402
If you have people remember word pairs and then you don't allow them to sleep,

60
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:09,774
the next day, their memory for that stuff is incredibly terrible.

61
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:12,396
But memory and REM does not stop there.

62
00:03:12,395 --> 00:03:15,118
If a person learns a difficult new task during the day,

63
00:03:15,118 --> 00:03:18,288
say a new instrument or a new type
of difficult puzzle,

64
00:03:18,288 --> 00:03:20,787
you can measure the electrical activity in their brain

65
00:03:20,787 --> 00:03:23,876
while they do that, and then while they sleep that night,

66
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:27,045
whether they know it or not, their brain replays

67
00:03:27,044 --> 00:03:29,340
those electronic impulses.

68
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:31,504
Many popular theories about why we dream

69
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:34,257
are variations on the idea that while we sleep,

70
00:03:34,258 --> 00:03:37,844
the unconscious part of our
brain is busy organizing memories,

71
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:41,349
and strengthening connections from the day before that we need in the future

72
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:44,264
while getting rid of the junk that would otherwise clog the brain.

73
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:46,479
Now, so the theory goes,

74
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,846
these electrical impulses are detected by

75
00:03:48,847 --> 00:03:51,736
our conscious brain, and our cortex freaks out.

76
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:56,105
It doesn't know what it means, and so it tries its best to create a cohesive story,

77
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:58,532
creating a dream.

78
00:03:58,532 --> 00:04:02,200
This would explain why dreams are often so
fantastic and seemingly random.

79
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,710
They're not supposed to make sense,
they're  not an actual message from our brain.

80
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:10,008
It's just the results of our cortexes trying to synthesize the noise

81
00:04:10,008 --> 00:04:13,004
coming from all the work being done back in the unconsciousness.

82
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:17,002
Under this way of thinking, dreams are an epiphenomenon.

83
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:19,846
They're not a primary process that has a purpose.

84
00:04:19,846 --> 00:04:23,555
Instead, they're the accidental result
of a more important process

85
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,225
going on behind the conscious brain.

86
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,360
But some researchers don't believe that.

87
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,528
They believe the dreams serve a primary purpose,

88
00:04:31,528 --> 00:04:34,648
and that purpose is to prepare us for threats.

89
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:40,205
They think this because the most prevalent emotions felt during dreams are negative.

90
00:04:40,204 --> 00:04:44,664
Abandonment, anger, and the most common of all, anxiety.

91
00:04:44,665 --> 00:04:48,789
Theory goes like this: back when we were early humans especially,

92
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,877
we had no idea what kind of threats we might encounter during the day.

93
00:04:51,877 --> 00:04:53,877
And so, to prepare us,

94
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,966
our brain would simulate anxieties while we slept

95
00:04:56,966 --> 00:05:00,846
to make us better prepared for that feeling in the real world.

96
00:05:00,846 --> 00:05:02,757
So people who had terrifying dreams

97
00:05:02,757 --> 00:05:05,641
were better at dealing with anxiety in the real world,

98
00:05:05,641 --> 00:05:07,683
and had stronger genes.

99
00:05:07,684 --> 00:05:10,894
All right, so the theories we discussed today are quite popular,

100
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,985
but they don't really enjoy a consensus.

101
00:05:12,985 --> 00:05:15,942
Not everyone agrees on them, and they barely scratch the surface

102
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:18,075
of scientific thought about dreams.

103
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:20,992
But that's kind of the cool thing about dreams.

104
00:05:20,992 --> 00:05:22,983
Think of it like this.

105
00:05:22,983 --> 00:05:26,872
Here is the eagle nebula—a giant structure in outer space

106
00:05:26,872 --> 00:05:29,829
6,500 light years away.

107
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,332
Despite its distance, we pretty much
know what it's made out of.

108
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,963
We know that it's 100 trillion kilometers tall,

109
00:05:35,963 --> 00:05:40,514
we know what caused it, and we know
where it's going to be in 750 million years.

110
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:43,471
But last night, I had dreams,

111
00:05:43,471 --> 00:05:47,514
and no one really knows why or for what reason.

112
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:51,019
And that's pretty cool, and that's why—
thanks for watching.

00:05:57,906 --> 00:06:00,567
If you want to learn more about the world, I highly recommend

114
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:04,276
Smarter Every Day, it's a show here on YouTube
by a guy named Destin

115
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:06,540
who I've met, he's awesome, I've learned a lot from him.

116
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,908
He's the guy who did the chicken thing
from the lean back.

117
00:06:08,908 --> 00:06:11,538
He's also studied what causes poop splash,

118
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,875
slow motion water balloons,

119
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,831
and has a lot of guns and explosions.
