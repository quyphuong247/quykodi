1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,500
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
But you are

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,628
actually right there.
Well, at least

3
00:00:06,628 --> 00:00:10,308
the camera is.
Mirrors are amazing.

4
00:00:10,308 --> 00:00:13,599
In fact, the word "mirror" comes from Latin "mirari",

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,019
meaning "to wonder at, to admire."

6
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:21,528
It's also where we get the word miracle.
Mirror-

7
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:26,618
-acle. Like when mirrors face each other
and transform a toilet room

8
00:00:26,618 --> 00:00:30,359
into infinity.
I love this kind of stuff.

9
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,590
But what if instead of a rectangular prism,

10
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,700
the room was a sphere, mirrored

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,820
all the way around?
What would it look like?

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:46,340
What would you see floating around in
such a room? The first question we should

13
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,480
ask involves

14
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:52,198
the light source. If you were in this room
using a flashlight and you turned the

15
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:53,619
flashlight off,

16
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:58,679
would the light keep bouncing around off of
the mirrored walls,

17
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:02,429
illuminating the room until your body
absorbed all of it?

18
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:06,728
Or if you left the flashlight on,
would light continue

19
00:01:06,728 --> 00:01:09,938
bouncing around, building up, getting
brighter and brighter until you lost

20
00:01:09,938 --> 00:01:11,099
your vision and cooked?

21
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:15,069
Probably not.
Every time light

22
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:18,149
hits a mirror and reflects off,
a tiny tiny amount

23
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,359
is absorbed. Even if your mirror
spherical room was the size of a

24
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:25,819
giant stadium and its walls reflected

25
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,989
99.99% of light

26
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:33,408
on each reflection, light speed is just too fast,

27
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:37,280
meaning that the reflections will happen
rapidly, a little bit of light being lost

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,118
each time.

29
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:43,030
The room will go dark in a fraction of
a fraction of a second. To you and me,

30
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:47,560
it would seem instantaneous.
As for what it would look like,

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,310
let's pretend you begin with your face
up against a wall of

32
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,920
the sphere and float backward
toward and past the centre.

33
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,399
At first, you would see your face quite clearly.

34
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,460
The surrounding reflections would be
very distorted. As you moved away,

35
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:06,548
at a certain point your face would cease
to shrink away in appear smaller

36
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:10,649
in mirror and instead would grow larger
and become magnified

37
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,068
until you reach the center at which
point your face would fill

38
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:19,839
your field of view. As you continued on past
the center, your image would flip

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,120
upside down and continue receding away.

40
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:27,809
It would look a bit like this.
But don't get too enamoured

41
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,479
with your reflection because mirrors
don't show you

42
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:35,818
as you really are.

43
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:39,048
Have you ever wondered why you liked the
way you look in a

44
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:42,909
mirror but don't like how you look in
photographs or

45
00:02:42,908 --> 00:02:45,929
video?
It might be because of the

46
00:02:45,929 --> 00:02:50,599
mere-exposure effect.
You prefer what you are used to

47
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:54,099
and most mirrors you look into don't show

48
00:02:54,098 --> 00:02:57,840
the real you, the you that other people in cameras

49
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,598
see.
Instead, a mirror shows you a reversed

50
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,638
version of yourself and you've become
more comfortable with that version

51
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:09,389
of you.
A version of you that is flipped left to right.

52
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:14,310
Mirrors reverse along axes perpendicular
to their surfaces,

53
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,579
like left and right. They don't also flip
things upside down, they don't also

54
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:21,040
reverse up and down because those directions

55
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,468
are parallel to the surface of the mirror.
When it comes to the way you and

56
00:03:25,468 --> 00:03:26,509
other people look,

57
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:31,620
the difference can be startling. 
NPR pointed out that Abraham Lincoln

58
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,359
looked like

59
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:35,639
this.
Mirrored he would have looked like

60
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,669
this. Now to us, something seems
noticeably strange about it but it is

61
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:41,639
the Lincoln

62
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,180
Lincoln would have preferred.
It's what he saw every day

63
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,810
in the mirror.
But here's something really cool.

64
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,098
You can take a flexible mirror and

65
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:55,209
unreverse its image by folding the mirror

66
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:58,408
into a cylindrical shape.
Take a look at this.

67
00:03:58,408 --> 00:04:01,408
Here I am with a reflective material and there

68
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:05,598
is the camera with some text taped underneath,
as you can see everything is

69
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,959
flipped left to right.
But as I fold the sheet into a cylindrical shape

70
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,069
the image separates, revealing an unreversed

71
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:17,738
version.
It becomes a true mirror.

72
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:21,089
Finally, here is one last piece

73
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:26,310
of every day mirror trickery.
When you look into a mirror,

74
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,240
how big is your reflection, your image

75
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,430
on the surface of the mirror to you?
Surely,

76
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,569
it depends on how far away you are from the mirror.
But it doesn't.

77
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:42,300
When you look into a mirror your
reflection on the surface of that mirror

78
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,750
is

79
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,209
always the exact same size.
In fact, it is always

80
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:51,288
about half of your actual size.
This is because

81
00:04:51,288 --> 00:04:54,370
when light reflects off a mirror,
it comes in

82
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,990
and reflects back out at the same angle,
which means that

83
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,360
in order to reach your eyes at the top of your body,

84
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,629
light from your feet at the bottom must hit the mirror

85
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:09,038
halfway between the two.
The triangles you form

86
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,218
with a mirror are similar, regardless of

87
00:05:12,218 --> 00:05:15,658
where you stand.
You can demonstrate this effect by

88
00:05:15,658 --> 00:05:20,379
outlining the size of your own head as
it appears on the surface of a mirror

89
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:23,918
using a bar of soap.
Now, because you aren't here

90
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:27,918
let's pretend that this phone is your
head and its camera

91
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,899
is your eye.
We begin up close. The camera looks

92
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:35,168
really big from this perspective.
Let me just

93
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:40,728
carefully trace around the outside,
so we can compare later.

94
00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:46,870
Good, good, good. Okay.
Now, I'm going to pull away from the mirror. Clearly

95
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,899
the phone is smaller, right?
Well,

96
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:54,899
if I reach out and once again carefully
trace the edges.

97
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:59,439
There we go.
I will find that I have drawn a

98
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,610
rectangle that is the exact same size.

99
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,770
Your image on the surface of a mirror

100
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:10,168
from your own perspective is always the
same size, whether you are a few

101
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:11,759
centimeters away from the mirror

102
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,860
or a few kilometres away.
Your image on the surface of a mirror in fact is

103
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,750
always half your actual size.

104
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,149
Okay, enough about light returning to our eyes.
What about light

105
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:27,799
that never returns?

106
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,930
Could we use a telescope to resolve individual

107
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,180
aliens on a planet light years away?
Well, over on Vsauce3,

108
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,750
Jake investigates this question with Star Wars.

109
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,500
And my friend Rusty investigates the
potential for Star Wars

110
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,199
becoming real in his episode of Science Friction.
And

111
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,029
Vsauce2 has a brand new lÃ¼t all about cool

112
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:52,849
Star Wars stuff.
Check them all out.

113
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,680
And as always,

114
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,439
thanks for watching.
