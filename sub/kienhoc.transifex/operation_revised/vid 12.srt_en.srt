hello again welcome back to operations
management

00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:08,030
in this session we're going to be
looking at little's law again
hello again welcome back to operations
management

4
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:11,419
in this session we're going to be
looking at little's law again

5
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:15,000
from the financial perspective we're
going to do some worked problems

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,980
if you recall from our last session we
were able to use

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,929
information found on accounting
statements to determine how long

8
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:28,899
a dollar travels through a process we're gonna
be doing more of that in this session

9
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:33,689
look at this flow diagram

10
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:38,058
we can actually take information that we
can find on an accounting statement

11
00:00:38,058 --> 00:00:42,159
and take a look at it in terms of the
process flow

12
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:48,169
if you're looking at cost of goods sold many
times it's broken down by how much is

13
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:48,979
being spent

14
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:48,980
on raw materials how much is can be
spent on purchase parts and so forth
being spent

15
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,500
on raw materials how much is can be
spent on purchase parts and so forth

16
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,640
and we can also take a look at how much
is left in inventory

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,280
in the last one we looked at total
inventory

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,489
and in this one we're just gonna look at the
inventory for the raw materials

19
00:01:06,489 --> 00:01:09,618
to here our cost of goods sold

20
00:01:09,618 --> 00:01:14,900
entering into the process of just raw
materials it's costing us forty three

21
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,349
thousand dollars a year

22
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:16,350
so that would be our throughput rate if
we just tracking raw material dollars
thousand dollars a year

23
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,109
so that would be our throughput rate if
we just tracking raw material dollars

24
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:24,900
the inventory is how much raw material is

25
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,759
left at the end of the year and that
turned out to be 3.5 thousand dollars

26
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,969
well we're going to be converting our raw
materials

27
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:37,859
into some other kind of work in process
we do apply labor and resources

28
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:41,629
so sometimes you'll see that as well on
your counting statement

29
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:45,640
but in this case eventhough it's there
we're not going to be using that

30
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,560
for our little's law analysis we're really
going to be concentrating on our

31
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,009
throughput rate and our inventory
because if you want to find out

32
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:59,840
how long it takes for a raw material
dollar to get through the process

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,019
so how long does it take

34
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:03,020
we're going to take a look at little's
law we're going to use the calculation
so how long does it take

35
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:08,199
we're going to take a look at little's
law we're going to use the calculation

36
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:13,098
of a flow time equalling our inventory
divided by a throughput

37
00:02:13,098 --> 00:02:18,348
in this case our inventory is a raw
material inventory which was posted as

38
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:22,159
3.5 thousand dollars and our throughput
rate

39
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,489
is the cost of goods sold of just the raw
materials

40
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:28,560
which was forty three thousand dollars
in a year

41
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,169
so when we calculate

42
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:32,170
the flow time it's going to be flow
time
so when we calculate

43
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:36,369
the flow time it's going to be flow
time

44
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,569
equals inventory divided by the
throughput rate as you can see by the

45
00:02:40,568 --> 00:02:41,780
calculations

46
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,889
we end up with the flow time of .081
years

47
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:45,890
now a lot of people can't get their
heads around .081
we end up with the flow time of .081
years

48
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,559
now a lot of people can't get their
heads around .081

49
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,110
so we're going to convert it into
weeks and there's 52 weeks in a year so

50
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,650
we're just going to multiply  .081

51
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,979
times 52 and that gives us 4.23
weeks

52
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:00,980
so what we're saying here is a dollar
times 52 and that gives us 4.23
weeks

53
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,219
so what we're saying here is a dollar

54
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:08,340
of raw material entering into the
process

55
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,628
will sit there for 4.23 weeks

56
00:03:11,628 --> 00:03:14,649
by the time it gets out of the process ok

57
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,900
now we can do this for all different kinds
of processes within our overall

58
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,080
organization

59
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,289
we can do this for the raw materials in
a fabrication setting

60
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:25,290
we can take a look at items going
through
we can do this for the raw materials in
a fabrication setting

61
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,759
we can take a look at items going
through

62
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:31,870
assembly we can take a look at items

63
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:37,250
going through packaging and when we do that
we can determine the flow time

64
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,818
at each of sub-process which tells us

65
00:03:40,818 --> 00:03:44,708
which sub process is taking the longest
to recall

66
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:48,000
one of the reasons why we're taking a
look at these processes

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,959
is to make them more Ã¨ficient and more
cost-effective

68
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,780
so by using Little's law by a valuating
the sub-processes

69
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,378
we can figure out what is taking the
longest and

70
00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:05,120
also how much it's costing us so when we
go and look

71
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,110
at process improvement we're gonna start
targeting those sub processes that are

72
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,169
taking the longest

73
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:11,170
and those are costing us the most we can
even apply little's law
taking the longest

74
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:16,449
and those are costing us the most we can
even apply little's law

75
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:21,079
to take a look at how long it takes for us
could get our money back from customers

76
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,100
once we've billed them

77
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,529
in this case the cost of

78
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:25,530
throughput rate is our net sales
in this case the cost of

79
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,529
throughput rate is our net sales

80
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:33,478
we're billing to our customer in this
case eighty thousand dollars in the year

81
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:36,550
but sitting in our accounts receivable

82
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,160
are inventory things that have not yet
been paid

83
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,750
it's nine point six thousand dollars so
we can use

84
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,189
the throughput rate of net sales and our
inventory

85
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:52,639
of accounts receivable to determine on average
how long it takes for a billed

86
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,829
order to be paid so here we have it

87
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:00,879
our flow time is our inventory divided
by our throughput rate

88
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:05,478
and that we're going to calculate our
accounts receivable was 9.6

89
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:09,800
thousand our net sales was eighty two
thousand per year

90
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,788
so it takes .117 of a year

91
00:05:13,788 --> 00:05:18,879
for us to get paid but Iagain we're
going to convert that to weeks so we

92
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,159
multiply that by 52 and it takes us over six

93
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,810
weeks from the time we bill our customer
on average to the time we get it back

94
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,930
that a long time so what we can actually
do is say well

95
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,720
if this is taking us a long time why
don't we take a look at the process

96
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,449
itself

97
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:39,870
and see if they can be shorten but by
using

98
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,220
Little's law we can actually figure out
how long it takes from the

99
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,600
time we put a dollar out to

100
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,649
start manufacturing something to the time
we actually get money back from the

101
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:51,650
customer
start manufacturing something to the time
we actually get money back from the

102
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:52,659
customer

103
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,669
which is known as the cost to cash time

104
00:05:55,668 --> 00:05:59,069
so we figure out how long it takes to
get through the factory

105
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:02,079
how long it takes for an invoice to be
paid we

106
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,728
add that together and that gives us how
long it takes

107
00:06:05,728 --> 00:06:10,758
overall from cost to cash

108
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,038
this sensor sequence on Little's law
from the financial perspective as well

109
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:15,818
as

110
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:19,800
flow perspective but we're going to be
coming back to it later in the semester

111
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,550
as well

112
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,769
but next time we'll be talking about
critical path method and

113
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:24,770
and flow charting a process diagrams I'll
see you then
but next time we'll be talking about
critical path method and

114
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,180
and flow charting a process diagrams I'll
see you then
