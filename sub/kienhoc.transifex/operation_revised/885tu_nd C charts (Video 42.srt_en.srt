00:00:06,948 --> 00:00:08,179
hello again welcome back

2
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:12,009
operations management we're continuing
with statistical process control

3
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:16,388
and now we're going to be looking at how we
create control limits for P charts and

4
00:00:16,388 --> 00:00:19,768
C charts if you recall P charts and
C charts

5
00:00:19,768 --> 00:00:23,039
are used for attribute inspection in terms

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,600
up is there a defect is there not a
defect

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,160
a P chart is used to monitor the percent
or fraction

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,010
of defective units within a sample so
when you thinking about

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,280
P charts think percent defective we have
a total number

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,390
items in the sample and we're just counting how
many of them

11
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,489
are defective when we go to create

12
00:00:45,488 --> 00:00:49,289
the upper and lower control limits just
like we've done before we're going to

13
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:49,929
take

14
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:54,289
the mean and we're going to add the number
of standard deviations

15
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:59,649
above the mean and then we're going to 
take the mean and subtract the number

16
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:02,780
of standard deviations below the mean

17
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,549
for the lower control limit one thing to
remember with the P chart is we

18
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:10,408
actually have to calculate the standard
deviation of

19
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,439
3 and to do that we need the

20
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,679
mean percent deffective or the average
percent deffective

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,799
and we also need the mean sample size

22
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,409
so in this case it would be the square
root of p bar 

23
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:26,430
times one minus p bar over in bar

24
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,000
now typically we use 3 for z

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,549
because we typically used three standard
deviations away from the mean

26
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:36,570
so here we have an example

27
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:41,169
the LRDR company is trying to monitor
the number of defective batteries that

28
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:41,978
they make

29
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:45,390
it's been determined that the average
percent deffective

30
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,849
in a sample of 50 is two percent so
we're gonna use 3 sigma control

31
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:53,129
limits and calculate and upper and lower
control limit for

32
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:58,699
a P chart so the first thing we need to do
is we need to calculate

33
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,040
that standard deviation of p we know that
the average percent deffective

34
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,490
is two percent which is .02

35
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:09,670
and our sample size was given is 50

36
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:13,378
so we make those substitutions p bar
.02

37
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:17,289
and n is 50 and we can calculate that

38
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:21,409
samples standard deviation for the
percent deffective

39
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:25,359
from there we can creat  upper and
lower control limits

40
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,690
p bar plus three times the standard
deviation

41
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:31,919
p bar minus three times the
standard deviation

42
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,859
and so our upper control limit is
.0398

43
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,480
and our lower control limit is 
.0002

44
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,789
so when we have our control limits

45
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:48,449
and we have a control chart that lower
control limit is our lower line on the

46
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:49,089
chart

47
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,700
and the upper control limit is our upper 
line on that chart

48
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:57,129
as long as our data points we're going to be
collecting samples

49
00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:01,329
of data calculating the percentage
deffective in that sample

50
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:05,829
as long as that percent deffective falls
between these two limits

51
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:09,560
we consider the process in control if it
falls

52
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,818
outside the control limits we say it is
not in control

53
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:18,979
and we start looking for an assignable cause
a C chart is a little bit different

54
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:22,509
in stead of  like a percent deffective
we're actually looking

55
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:25,699
at the count of defects within a sample

56
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:29,189
which means there can be more than one
defect

57
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:34,669
in a particular product for example for
looking at a car there could be a flaw

58
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:37,939
in the paint there could be a flaw in the
windshield

59
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:41,139
there can be the flaw in a light

60
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:44,769
that would be three separate flaws and
each one of them

61
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:49,269
counts towards this C chart so there
can be more than one

62
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:56,269
defect on the unit so we calculate the
upper control limit by using c bar plus

63
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:02,719
z times square root of c bar and the
lower control limit

64
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,169
of c bar minus z times
square root c bar

65
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:11,430
and typically again z is three so we
have three standard deviations from the

66
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:11,959
mean

67
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,009
and c bar is the average number of defects

68
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:18,279
or the mean

69
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,879
so here we have another example this
one

70
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,870
is concerned with the number defects in
painted panels

71
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,329
and the average number of defects in a
sample of 100 is 2

72
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:32,800
the company wants to monitor the process
we're going to use

73
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,650
3 sigma control limits and now we're going to
calculate the upper and lower control

74
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:39,079
limits for C chart

75
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:42,279
we know the average number of defects

76
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:47,669
2 so that's c bar and then we simply create
the upper and lower control limits

77
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,930
by taking c bar plus three times the
square root of c bar

78
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,009
and c bar minus three times the square
root of c bar

79
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:58,089
are so we have 6.24

80
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:01,929
is our upper control  limit 
and negative 2.24 is

81
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,949
lower and you can't have a negative
number of

82
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:09,529
defects so in this case we converted
that lower control limit

83
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:13,949
to 0 and in fact anytime we have a control
limit

84
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:18,689
where it's negative and it is possible to
have a negative number

85
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:23,500
we convert that to 0 that's all there
is to creating the

86
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,660
control limits for C chart and for R
charts

87
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,380
when we use them on a control chart the

88
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:34,879
upper control limit is the upper line the
lower control limit is the lower line

89
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,860
and then we just plotting the data in between
as long as that data points stays between

90
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,110
those lines our process is in control

91
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,360
if it falls outside we say it's not in
control

92
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,120
that's it for control charts have a good
day
