00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,789
hello again and welcome back to  operations
management

2
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:12,568
in this session we're gonna be continuing our
discussion on statistical process

3
00:00:12,568 --> 00:00:13,330
control

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,929
and talking about inspection and control
charts

5
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:20,320
the purpose of inspection

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,500
is so that we can actually monitor

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,809
what is happening with the process what
we can do

8
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:30,059
is we can take samples of product or
we can take a look

9
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:34,299
the service that's happening during our
process and then we're going to evaluate

10
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:35,460
that

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,770
against a series of standards that's
what we're doing with inspection

12
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,820
if you're thinking about levels of 
quality cost

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,750
this would be part of the appraisal cost
now inspection

14
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,308
can be performed any point in the
process but it's very important to

15
00:00:52,308 --> 00:00:54,709
remember that you can't inspect

16
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,649
quality into a product or service all
inspection does

17
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,420
is identify whether or not there're
areas in your process

18
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,270
we can be talking about two different
kinds of inspection

19
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:11,680
one is attributes inspection and the
other one is variables inspection

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,220
and attribute inspection is a simple

21
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:19,879
good versus defect we're going to be
looking at the product or the service

22
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,199
and identifying whether there're  defects
in the product

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,400
whether the product itself is defective
now

24
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,850
variables inspection is a little bit
different because

25
00:01:30,849 --> 00:01:34,319
not only are we trying to figure out
whether there's a problem with the

26
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,059
process

27
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,200
we're looking at it on a continuum scale
up a dimension

28
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,380
we're going to be looking at the overall
length wat

29
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:47,099
time thickness something that we can
actually measure numerically

30
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:50,959
so those are the two different kinds of
inspections that we will be looking at

31
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,009
some common control charts

32
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:58,719
when we do inspection for variables are

33
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,259
The X bar and the R chart now the

34
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:06,930
X bar tracks the mean of samples so
that would give us a measure of

35
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,310
central tendency

36
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,319
the R chart will track the range

37
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,519
of the samples so that will give us a
measure of dispersion

38
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,850
so if are looking at a dimension we want
to see

39
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:23,090
what the average of the dimension is as
well as

40
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,849
the range of numbers in that dimension

41
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:31,210
that's why the X bar and the R
chart always used together

42
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:34,950
because the X bar gives you the
measure of a central tendency

43
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:40,250
and the R chart gives us a measure of
dispersion for

44
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,789
the attribute charts we're looking at the 
P- chart

45
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:46,879
and a C-chart a P-chart can

46
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,919
track percent or fraction defective

47
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,309
in a sample so that'll tell us

48
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,810
out of a sample how many or what
percent

49
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,270
of defective unit we actually have where
is the C- chart

50
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,290
just tracks the number or a count of

51
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:09,449
defects in a sample the big difference
between the P-chart and C-chart

52
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:13,099
is the C-chart allows us to count
defects

53
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:17,159
that occur on a product and there can be
more than one

54
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:22,239
defect on a product so that's a big
difference between the P-chart and the

55
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,060
C-chart

56
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,709
so if you trying to figure out what kind
of control chart to use

57
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:31,770
the first thing you have to identify is
are you measuring

58
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,680
variables such as a size weight or
something like that

59
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,870
much case you are you looking at the
variables control charts

60
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,640
in which case would be using X-bar
and in our chart

61
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:48,619
always together but if that's not what
we're doing are we just counting

62
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,920
or trying to figure out a percent
defective then we're looking at accurate

63
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:53,939
control charts

64
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:59,500
so if we're measuring a fraction or
percent defectives wouldn't be looking at

65
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,659
P chart and if we're just counting the
total number of defects

66
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,120
then we're going to be looking at C
chart

67
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,170
on our next video we gonna be taking a look at
exploring our charts and how we can

68
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:13,280
actually developed to control limit

69
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,068
I'll see you then
