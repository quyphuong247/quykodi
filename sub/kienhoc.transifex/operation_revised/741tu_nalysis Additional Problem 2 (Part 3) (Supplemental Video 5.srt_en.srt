1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,039
operations management we are in capacity
analysis and working on that

2
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:18,469
supplementary problem number two and
this is our last part as you recall from

3
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:23,649
the previous parts we were working with
the amazing shed company that produces

4
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:28,750
three different kinds of sheds the basic
the superior and premium each of the

5
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:33,849
sheds uses the same resources
fabrication teams assembly teams paint

6
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:41,719
teams and inspection teams the profit
per shed is $190 for  basic 224 for

7
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:47,850
superior and 234 for premium given their
current resources which shed is most

8
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,590
profitable we're gonna head back to the
original information for the problem

9
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,250
where we found out what the unit load
 for each of the different

10
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,349
types of sheds and the number of teams
available and the number of available

11
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:10,368
hours per day per team so you can see
here each of the different sheds has

12
00:01:10,368 --> 00:01:17,269
different unit loads for fabrication
assembly paint and inspection so what

13
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:21,408
we're going to do is we're going to take
a look at the total number of shed

14
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:28,990
that can be made of each type assuming that
that's the only kind of shed we make so

15
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:34,929
let's start with the basic shed the unit
load for a basic shed of fabrication is

16
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,170
two hours

17
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:43,049
assembly is 3, paint 1, inspection
1.5 now using the number of

18
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:49,899
teams available per day and the number of
hours available per team we calculate

19
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:55,250
the amount of time available for each
resource so in fabrication we have

20
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,728
28 hours

21
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:04,109
assembly 22.5 paint 14
and inspection 12 so now we know how

22
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:09,490
much time we have and the amount of time
needed which is the unit load gives us

23
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:16,329
our capacity per day 28 hours available
to needed for fabrication so in the

24
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,450
fabrication area

25
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:23,268
we could produce 14 sheds now we gonna take a
look at assembly which is seven and a

26
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:24,450
half

27
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:32,378
paint 14 and inspection 8 so when we're
going to calculate the Profit just on

28
00:02:32,378 --> 00:02:37,810
basic sheds we'll take the maximum
number of sheds that we can produce

29
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:43,959
which in this case is seven and a half
because of bottleneck that is the assembly

30
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:50,409
resource and then we're going to multiply that seven
and a half by the hundred and ninety

31
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:57,669
dollars that we would earn as profit so
that gives us 1425 now gonna take a look

32
00:02:57,669 --> 00:03:03,539
at these superior shed and we do the
same set of calculations now we're using

33
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:09,689
the unit loads just for superior sheds
we still have 28 hours available per day

34
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:15,699
in fabrication 22.5 in
assembly 14 in paint 12 in inspection

35
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:22,608
but now a capacity per day is different
because our unit load is different so we

36
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:25,030
have twenty eight hours available a day

37
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:31,549
divided by two and a half hours needed
in fabrication yielding 11.2

38
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:37,219
sheds if we do that for each of the
resource pools fabrication assembly

39
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:44,099
paint an inspection we see that the
bottleneck remains in assembly and this

40
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:50,219
time we only have 6.43
sheds that we could produce since that's

41
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:55,530
the maximum number we're going to
multiply that by the $220 profit we

42
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:04,239
would get per superior shed which yield
$1414 so now let's look at the

43
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,439
premium shed with the premium shed
the unit load again

44
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:15,818
changes and our available time per day
stays the same so our capacity per day is now

45
00:04:15,818 --> 00:04:25,439
different now in fabrication it's 11.2
sheds assembly 5.92 paint 11.2 and

46
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,259
inspection 8

47
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:34,009
so our bottleneck happens to still be
assembly and we can only produce 5.92

48
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:39,899
sheds so if that is the maximum number
of shed that means we multiply that by

49
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:49,329
the profit per share of $230 yielding
$1362 now we compare all three

50
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:55,879
profits which is most profitable well in
this case it's the basic shed even

51
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:01,120
though it is the lowest priced shed by
the one that gives us the least amount

52
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:11,590
of profit $190 we cannot produce many of
the premium sheds at so that yields only

53
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:18,439
$1362 so we can produce a lot of basic
sheds but not a lot of superior or premium sheds

54
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:25,839
so our overall profitability is keen on
basic sheds so when we think about

55
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:31,269
profit and capacity analysis we have to
think about not only how much we're

56
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:38,870
learning per item but also how many of
that item we can produce thank you for

57
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,699
joining me and I'll see you in another session
