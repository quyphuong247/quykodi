Hello again and welcome back to Operations
Management

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,500
We are continuing our series on 7 tools of
quality.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,980
And this time we are going to talk about scatter
diagrams

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,150
Scatter diagrams are also known as scatter
plots or scatter charts

5
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,780
Those terms are used interchangeably.

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:23,980
In essence, what we are doing is plotting
two variables against each other on a graph

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:30,210
to look for relationship between those variables
So to … to scatter plot, we are trying to

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,700
think are two variables related,
we plot the variables coordinate on a graph,

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,230
and then look for trends,
and possible correlation between those variables

10
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,220
So let’s see what a couple of these plots
look like

11
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:51,100
Here we have one on the left to show the relationship
between car weight and gas mileage.

12
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,190
The weight of the car being presented by the
X axis

13
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:59,649
and the Y axis represents the gas mileage
using X-Y coordinate

14
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:05,970
For each car weight there is a corresponding
gas mileage and it is plotted there on the

15
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:06,970
chart.

16
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:11,240
It looks kind of scatter, so that’s why
it’s called a scatter plot.

17
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,170
Even though they’re kind of spread out,
we can see that there is some sorts of relationship

18
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,040
between them
and it kind of looks like as the the weight

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,310
of the car increases the gas mileage will
decrease

20
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:31,299
The plot on the right is showing the relationship
between the stopping distance of a vehicle

21
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,810
and how fast it is traveling.

22
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,840
The speed is being shown on the X axis,
the stopping distance on the Y axis just like

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,900
with the car weight one,
we have a little dot that are scattered across

24
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:49,520
this chart for each vehicle speed with the
stopping distance.

25
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,880
And again we can kind of see that there is
a relationship between the two variables.

26
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,579
This time as the speed increases so will stopping
distance

27
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:04,950
To help this look a little bit better we can
add trend line.

28
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,470
These trend lines are linear lines that show
the relationship between these two variables.

29
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:16,459
We don’t expect the trend line to fit exactly
to those dots

30
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:23,180
but it does take all the dots into consideration
and create a linear line

31
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,879
So what does all this mean?

32
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,840
When the trend line goes down,
it show that there is a negative correlation

33
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,810
between variables
Negative means as one variable increases the

34
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,959
other one decreases.

35
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,769
So in the case of the car weight going up
that means the gas mileage goes down

36
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:48,409
The trend line going up means that there is
a positive correlation between the variables

37
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:53,829
which means as one variable increases so will
the other one

38
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:58,549
As the speed increases on the vehicle so does
the stopping distance

39
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:00,290
Now there can be other possibilities.

40
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,750
There can be no correlation, there can be
cyclical, there can be pattern.

41
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,829
All of those things can happen with the scatter
plots.

42
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:12,019
I just showed you a couple of them, but how
do we go about making a scatter plot?

43
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:16,459
Well, in Excel we can enter the data in two
columns.

44
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:21,699
One will present the X coordinate and the
other one will present the Y coordinate

45
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:25,819
So in this case we have batch size and the
number of defects.

46
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:32,339
We would have the batch size as one coordinate
and defect as the other

47
00:03:32,339 --> 00:03:37,829
Once that’s in place we will select the
X, Y or the scatter plot from chart tools

48
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:43,019
and it would create the chart for us and then
we can add it to edit the axis titles.

49
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:49,939
You can see those data points sitting there
on the chart

50
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:56,939
then we would add a trend line or in addition
to that we can add R square (coefficient of

51
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:00,900
determination)
And that trend line typically will start with

52
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,769
the linear trend, that’s the default,
and that shows how the relationship works.

53
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:11,420
So in this case as batch size increases so
will the number of defects

54
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:17,180
It’s a positive line going upwards and so
we have a positive relationship between those

55
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:24,370
two variables
We will look at R square Coefficient of Determination.

56
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:29,020
It must fall between 0 and 1 and the higher
values indicate that

57
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,210
the trend line that we added explains the
relationship between the variables

58
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:39,210
We can also look at the correlation coefficient
which is R which is also known as

59
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,900
the square root of the coefficient of determination.

60
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:48,680
The greater value of R the stronger the relationship
between the two variables.

61
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,960
So we can consider it strong if it is greater
than point 8 and if it less than point 5 we

62
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,370
can consider it weak
So that’s all there is to scatter plot,

63
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,120
we are looking at the relationship between
two variables

64
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:08,840
and see if what relationship it is and next
time we will look at another one of 7 tools

65
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,419
of quality.

66
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:11,539
Take care.
