00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,570
hello again a welcome back operations
management

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,310
and in this session we could be talking
about flow diagrams. It's

3
00:00:12,309 --> 00:00:16,469
one of the seven tools of quality if you've
looked  the previous

4
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:21,308
videos you notice that we had one on
drawing simple process flow diagrams

5
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:25,560
this kind of goes with that in this case
though we could be looking at how to

6
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:29,209
analyze this flow diagrams as well as
just drawing them

7
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,000
if you can recall a flow diagram

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,539
is a series of blocks that graphically

9
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:41,469
describe the process or system when we
think about it in terms of the seven

10
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:41,840
tools

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,680
quality or Six Sigma it's very very
useful with

12
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:51,759
SIPOC  S- I- P- O-C because we're looking
at suppliers providing

13
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,519
input that go into our process and then
we are looking at the

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,840
outputs from that process going to
customers and

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,579
another thing about flow diagrams is
that we use specific symbols for each

16
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:08,710
aspect of the process if we think about

17
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,969
a symbol for flow diagram

18
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:16,329
think about it as a specific language. There're
certain words that have to be used that

19
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:19,750
everybody understands and that's what we
do with these

20
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:24,239
key symbols. A rectangle will always
represent an activity

21
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,819
a diamond always represent decision

22
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:32,589
a triangle a buffer a circle is a
starting point ending point or

23
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,700
connection

24
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,350
and arrow always indicates the direction
of the flow

25
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:41,559
you would never use a triangle to
represent an activity

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,079
or a decision you always want to use
these

27
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:48,359
same key symbols to represent these

28
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,790
items so that no matter who is looking
at your diagram

29
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:56,509
they can follow what is actually
happening. So here's a sample

30
00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:00,069
sample flow diagram we have a beginning
point

31
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:03,728
and now we have the first activity
things leaving from the first activity

32
00:02:03,728 --> 00:02:04,789
to second

33
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,109
then there's a decision point

34
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:11,409
an at that decision point things can go
in one direction or another

35
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:16,030
and so forth. As you can see it without
words we have an idea of what is going

36
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,229
on with that flow diagram.

37
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:22,859
so we're going to evaluate a flow diagram

38
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,030
what we're really looking for are things
where

39
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:30,000
activities are repeated. If it to
repeated activity

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,539
perhaps there's a reason why it's
there

41
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:37,750
or maybe it's something they can be
eliminated we also want to look for

42
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,960
point to delay

43
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,510
what is stopping an activity, we also
wanna look for complexity that's

44
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:48,370
unnecessary why are things happening in
a certain order

45
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,800
maybe there's an easier way to do it
because when we look at flow diagrams

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,540
what we're looking at is a way to try
and streamline a process

47
00:02:56,539 --> 00:03:00,459
get rid of things that don't need to
be there

48
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,820
make things as simple as possible that's
all there is to flow diagrams

49
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:10,099
and I'll see you again while we continue
talking about Six Sigma and the tools

50
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:10,509
quality
