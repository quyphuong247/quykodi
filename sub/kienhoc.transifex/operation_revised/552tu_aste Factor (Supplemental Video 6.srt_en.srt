00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,230
hello again and welcome back to
operations management in this session

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,949
we're going to be talking about capacity
waste factor so this session is

3
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:22,170
associated with capacity analysis as we
know the effective unit load of a

4
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,650
resource is the actual amount of time
required to process of flow unit which

5
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:31,489
means the effective capacity is the
actual number of units 

6
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:38,109
processed per period of time now when we
talk about effective capacity that means

7
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:42,460
this is the realistic capacity we know
that there's waiting we know that there

8
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,450
are some issues that go on and so this
is what's actually happening in the

9
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:54,780
workplace now we also have a theoretical
capacity and that's based on the

10
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,939
theoretical unit load of a resource
which is the minimum amount of time

11
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:05,149
required to process a flow unit if we get
rid of all that waste so we get rid of

12
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:10,430
the waiting time we get rid of the
extremist activities so our theoretical

13
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:15,799
capacity is the maximum number of
units process if all of that waste was

14
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:20,939
eliminated so what we're looking for
here is looking at that comparison

15
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:27,949
between our effective capacity and our
theoretical capacity so the capacity

16
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,689
waste factors is actually a percentage it
is the percentage of the theoretical

17
00:01:31,688 --> 00:01:37,639
capacity that is waste so we can look at
it three different ways one is if we had

18
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,540
theoretical capacity and the capacity of
waste factor also known as CWF we can

19
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,700
calculate the effective capacity if we had
the effective of capacity and the waste

20
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:54,409
factor we can calculate the theoretical
capacity and lastly if we have the

21
00:01:54,409 --> 00:02:00,500
effective capacity and theoretical capacity
we can calculate the capacity waste

22
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:07,859
factor so what I do is a simple problem to
illustrate this for example a company

23
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:13,949
requires an inspection team to evaluate
every product to produced each team spends

24
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:16,409
an hour and a quarter on each 

25
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:21,460
product the inspection team can only work
six hours per day on inspecting products

26
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,900
even though the teams themselves work
eight hours a day

27
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,370
the 2-hour difference is due to
additional paperwork clean up and

28
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:36,349
meetings and other words non value-added
time so what is the capacity of waste

29
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:41,849
factor so we're going to first calculate
the effective capacity effective

30
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:47,299
capacity is what actually occurred we
have six hours available each product

31
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,380
needs an hour and a quarter so we know
that are effective capacity is four

32
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:58,019
point eight products now we calculate
the theoretical capacity we remove those

33
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:03,740
two hours of meetings and paperwork so
now our maximum hours available is

34
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:09,159
eight the same number of hours per
product one and a quarter so now

35
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:15,419
theoretical capacity is six point four
products so now we have both the

36
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:21,009
theoretical capacity and the effective
capacity we can now calculate the

37
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:23,620
capacity waste factor

38
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:30,349
capacity waste factor CWF is equal to 1 minus the
effective capacity divided by the

39
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:38,639
theoretical capacity which gives us one
minus .75 which is 25% so what we're

40
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:47,250
saying here is that we have a waste
factor of 25% so if we're trying to

41
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,699
improve our situation we're going to try
and get our effective capacity closer to

42
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:59,659
our theoretical capacity so this is how
you calculate capacity waste factor and

43
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:01,379
I hope to see you again for another
session
