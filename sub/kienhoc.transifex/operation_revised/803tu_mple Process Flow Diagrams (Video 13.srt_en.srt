00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,710
hello again welcome back operations
management in this session we're going

2
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,028
to spend a little time

3
00:00:11,028 --> 00:00:17,629
looking at process flow diagrams process
flow diagrams are needed because they

4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,469
show us what is actually happening

5
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:24,259
inside the process first things you need
to understand

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,130
are there are key symbols to a process
flow diagram

7
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:32,500
activities are always represented by
rectangles

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,768
waiting areas known as buffers are
always represented by

9
00:00:36,768 --> 00:00:41,719
triangles use arrows to show the
direction of the flow

10
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,160
from the input to the output and
sometimes you see a

11
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:48,299
circles or ovals representing
starting and ending

12
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:51,549
it's very important that you use the
correct

13
00:00:51,549 --> 00:00:55,159
symbol for the correct activity or
buffer or so forth

14
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:59,179
that way anybody who is looking at a
process flow diagram

15
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:05,390
knows what's happening a second thing
that's very important when we deal with

16
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,079
process flow diagrams

17
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:10,579
is the concept precedence precedence

18
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:13,890
implies what activity must come

19
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,769
immediately before another what this
does is it tells us what activities are

20
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:21,500
required to be completed

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,680
before another activity can be done for
example

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,950
here we have activity C and if you
notice

23
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,810
there are two activities to come right
before it preceding

24
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,990
activity C activity A

25
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:40,179
and activity B both have them are
needed

26
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,900
in order for activity C to start
that's what we mean by precedence

27
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,920
activities that are preceddding
other activities

28
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,049
sometimes you'll see precedence in a
table

29
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:56,189
so here we have four activities A through D

30
00:01:56,188 --> 00:02:00,228
And on notice there's a precedence listing
activity

31
00:02:00,228 --> 00:02:03,909
A with that dashed their shows nothing
has come before

32
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:07,310
it but activity B requires

33
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,478
A activity C nothing's needed before it

34
00:02:11,478 --> 00:02:15,280
but activity D needs both B&C

35
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,729
so when we look at the diagram you
notice that

36
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:22,439
A&C which have no preceding activities

37
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:26,128
are starting it off be requires

38
00:02:26,128 --> 00:02:29,229
A so there's that arrow coming from A into
B

39
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:32,419
an activity D requires both

40
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:36,488
B and C so those two arrows come
together into D

41
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,628
let's look at something a little bit

42
00:02:39,628 --> 00:02:45,329
more realistic that we can relate to
here let's say you gonna go paint a door

43
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,860
so in order to paint that door you need
to gather door

44
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,519
you need to paint and you need to get the
brushes so that would be our first

45
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:53,310
activity

46
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,409
other things that have to happen you
need to sand the door

47
00:02:57,409 --> 00:03:03,318
you need to clean the door and then dry
it also the paint has to be next

48
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:06,399
the brushes have to be prepared and then

49
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,250
of course you can paint the door but if
you think about a few things

50
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,699
you can mix the paint without having

51
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:18,318
the door sanded or cleaned yet you can
prepare the brushes

52
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,609
without having to mix the paint so when
we look at the precedents

53
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:26,840
we see that the first activity says
let's get everything together

54
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,049
gather the door the paint and the brushes
and nothing comes before that

55
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:35,219
but in order to sand the door you
have to have the door in the first

56
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:35,759
place

57
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,098
so activity B sand door requires
activity A

58
00:03:40,098 --> 00:03:44,929
and if you going to mix paint you need
the paint as well so activity

59
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:49,569
E requires A and if you need to
prepare brushes you have to have the

60
00:03:49,568 --> 00:03:50,169
brushes

61
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:56,039
so activity F requires A in order to
clean the door

62
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:59,348
you need to sand it first so activities
C

63
00:03:59,348 --> 00:04:04,068
clean door requires activity B
once cleaned

64
00:04:04,068 --> 00:04:08,079
you have to dry so following
clean door

65
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,459
activities C is dry door

66
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,128
so you can see the item that precedes dry
door

67
00:04:15,128 --> 00:04:18,449
is clean door and the we go to

68
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:22,488
paint the door we need dry door
activity

69
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:26,649
D we need mix paint E and brushes

70
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:31,649
F so you can see the precedents all line
up there

71
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:34,719
so if you want to stop the video now try
and draw

72
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,800
out what that activity flow diagram is
gonna look like

73
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,889
and see whether it matches what we've
got coming up next

74
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:45,620
here it is we started right at the
beginning

75
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,319
gather the door get paint and the
brushes

76
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:53,529
from there we can't sand at the door we
can mix the paint

77
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:59,399
and prepare the brushes following
sanding the door we have clean the door

78
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,609
then drying the door and then once we
have the door

79
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,639
that's dry and the paint mixed and the
prepared brushes

80
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:12,310
the all come together for the final.
activity of painting the door

81
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,750
that's it so when we're thinking about
process flow diagrams

82
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,360
what you want to do is make sure you're
using the correct symbols

83
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,699
and that you're paying attention to the
activities themselves

84
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:28,538
what has to come before something else
then you show the directional of the flow

85
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:31,849
using arrows next time we're going to be

86
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,939
adding times to these activities and
going through something called critical

87
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:37,069
path

88
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:37,538
see you then
