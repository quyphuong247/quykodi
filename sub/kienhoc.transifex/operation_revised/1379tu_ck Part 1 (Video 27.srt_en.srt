00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,440
hello again and welcome back to
operations management and we're

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,490
continuing with inventory in this
session we're going to be working on

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:19,579
calculating safety stock and I know that
I say part 1 because safety stock is a

4
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:21,800
long thing to talk about

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,800
so we're going to do it in two parts
let's get started

6
00:00:25,368 --> 00:00:31,399
as we recall inventory has cost
associated with it in terms of holding

7
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:37,070
on to it as well as capital costs which
means if money is tied up in inventory

8
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,200
we can't use it for anything else

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,200
we also know that if we don't have
enough inventory

10
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:46,850
it caused a disruption in our
manufacturing because we may not be able

11
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:52,129
to have enough inventory to manufacture
goods or we won't have the product to

12
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:54,259
provide customers with it

13
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:59,718
so we won't be able to meet demand so
what we have to figure out is how much

14
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:06,530
safety stock to keep to do this we need
to understand a few terms first is stock

15
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:11,659
out stock out means that we are not able
to meet demand

16
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:14,780
it's just not there it's not on the
shelves it's not in the warehouse

17
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:21,710
another term the cycle service level
sometimes just call the service level is

18
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:26,750
that the probability that we will not
run out of items so the probability that

19
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:32,180
there will not be a stock out is our
service level and safety stock which is

20
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:37,939
a term I've used before is just extra
inventory that we hold onto beyond what

21
00:01:37,938 --> 00:01:46,099
we expect to use when we go about
calculating safety stock we tend to make

22
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:49,929
the following assumption and that is
that the lead time demand

23
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:54,880
and can be represented by the normal
distribution and it's represented by

24
00:01:54,879 --> 00:02:00,909
using the mean of that distribution and
its standard deviation so we'll actually

25
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:05,769
get two terms when we're thinking about
safety stock will get the lead time

26
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:10,000
demand which is the average amount we're
going to use and the standard deviation

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,240
of the lead time demand which represents
the variation in demand and when we

28
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,189
think about service level

29
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:22,719
it's the probability that the amount we
use is actually going to be less than or

30
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:27,849
equal to the amount we have on hand
which is a reorder point which also

31
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:33,280
means that our service level equals one
minus the probability of running out the

32
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,289
probability of a stock out

33
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:39,489
so if we take a look at that normal
distribution you'll recognize the

34
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:43,480
standard bell curve but we're going to
add a few things to it

35
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:48,699
the center line of this curve is the
average amount that we use this is our

36
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:50,289
lead time demand

37
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:55,719
this is what we expect to use during the
time we place the order to the time it's

38
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:01,539
received but there's also the
probability of a stock out and what we

39
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:07,269
need to do is we need to have extra
inventory which becomes our safety stock

40
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:10,599
to prevent the probability of a stock
out

41
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:15,609
so if the red area is our probability of
a stock out then the other area the

42
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:21,280
light green area is our service level
because if you recall the entire area

43
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,459
under the curve equals 1 so 1 minus the
probability of a stock out is our

44
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:28,810
service level

45
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:36,939
so what we do is to calculate that extra
inventory our safety stock sometimes

46
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:39,579
known as ISIL  or ice of safety

47
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:45,459
we need to use the standard deviation
and we're trying to figure out how many

48
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,789
standard deviations above the mean which
is there a Z statistic

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,810
so when we get to re-order . we're going
to have our lead time demand

50
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,680
Plus that safety stock so our safety
stock equals the number of standard

51
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,260
deviations above the mean

52
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:10,769
so that our lead time demand plus our
safety stock equals the  reorder point and so

53
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,900
that entire area under the curve

54
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,900
not the red part is our service level

55
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:22,079
so to recap our service level is our
probability that the amount we use is

56
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,389
going to be less than or equal to the re
order point and the service level equals 1

57
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:30,209
minus the probability of a stockout

58
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:36,899
so to determine our safety stock we're
going to need a value for Z because we

59
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:40,019
need to know how many standard
deviations above the mean

60
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:46,229
so we're going to have to use either a
normal distribution table or Excel my

61
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,430
preference is always for Excel because
it's a lot easier to plug in the numbers

62
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:57,269
use the formula and get your calculation
for Z as opposed to looking up tables so

63
00:04:57,269 --> 00:05:02,069
the formula we are going to use is norms
inverse NORMSINV

64
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:07,168
I'm going to input the
probability of not having a stock out

65
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:10,319
which is the service level and that
will give us a Z statistic

66
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:17,759
so our safety stock becomes Z times the
standard deviation of the lead time

67
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,389
demand now sometimes we already know the
safety stock and standard deviation of

68
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:29,339
lead time demand and we need to
calculate what the service level is so

69
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:34,079
we need to work backwards in this case
if we know the safety stock and the

70
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:39,839
standard deviation of the lead time
demand are Z equals our safety stock /

71
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:47,909
that standard deviation and once we know
the Z statistic we can again use a table

72
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:52,080
or Excel to calculate the service level

73
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:59,459
so our service level equals the norms
distribution NORMSDIST of Z

74
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,959
statistic

75
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,759
once we use excel so let's do a problem

76
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:10,870
Jordan is trying to figure out how much
extra inventory of cables to keep during

77
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:17,379
the past year the mean lead time demand
ltd for the cable was a hundred and five

78
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:19,839
with a standard deviation of 12

79
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,139
Jordan would like to maintain a
ninety-percent service level

80
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,100
so what is the recommended safety stock

81
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:33,220
what is a reorder point and if Jordan
keeps 20 cables safety stock

82
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:39,550
what is the service level so here you
see that we have a value for our mean

83
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:45,490
lead time demand of a hundred and five
and we have a standard deviation of 12

84
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:51,280
and we're trying to maintain a
ninety-percent service level using this

85
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,519
information we can calculate the safety
stock

86
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:58,959
we're going to calculate the Z statistic
and then multiply by the standard

87
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,889
deviation of the lead time demand going
to excel

88
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:09,699
we're going to use the norms in formula
and use ninety percent as our service

89
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:17,439
level to get a Z statistic equaling 1.28
so we calculate the safety stock 1.28 x

90
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:20,529
12 and that's 15.37

91
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:27,370
we always round up when we're dealing
with safety stock so 15.37 becomes 16

92
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:32,719
so our reorder point is our lead time
demand

93
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,610
plus the safety stock so when you lead
time demand is a hundred and five

94
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,610
we add to it the safety stock of 16

95
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,699
so we get a total of a hundred and
twenty-one

96
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:47,990
so when we're thinking about it we're
watching the inventory as soon as we get

97
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:54,170
down to a hundred and twenty-one cables
in inventory we place our order for a

98
00:07:54,170 --> 00:08:01,460
new set of inventory now let's say
Jordan wants to keep 20 on hand

99
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:07,609
how does that safety stock of 20 mean in
terms of our service level

100
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:12,889
so now that we know that the safety
stock is 20 we can go backwards and

101
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:18,319
calculate the Z statistic safety stock
divided by the standard deviation of the

102
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:27,409
lead time demand is 1.67 now we use the
NORMSDIST norms distribution

103
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:35,029
function within Excel using z of 1.67
now we find out that the service level

104
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:37,250
is point nine five two two

105
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:43,940
so holding a safety stock of 20 is going
to increase our service level the more

106
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,330
safety stock you have the higher service
level will be

107
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,910
now in our next session we're going to
figure out how to calculate the standard

108
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:55,250
deviation of lead time demand

109
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:59,750
sometimes it's not given sometimes we
just know that there is a variation in

110
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:05,240
demand and sometimes there's a variation
in both the lead time and the demand so

111
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,370
we'll cover that in the next session

112
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:07,970
I'll see you then
