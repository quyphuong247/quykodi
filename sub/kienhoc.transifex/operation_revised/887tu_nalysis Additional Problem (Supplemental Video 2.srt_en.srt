00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,879
hello again and welcome back to operations
management in this session we're going

2
00:00:09,879 --> 00:00:14,669
to talk about capacity analysis and I
have an additional problem for you

3
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:19,740
several people contacted me asking for
additional problems in different areas

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:26,480
and this is one of them so let's get
started in this problem we're dealing

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,480
with a group of people who are building
charity food boxes so they are a local

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,500
charity that makes up food boxes for the
elderly volunteers are only available

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,259
for five hours a day four days a week
but they want to make a hundred and

8
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:47,649
fifty boxes each week there are three
components to making a food box they

9
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:53,250
have to select the canned goods they
have to pack the good into the box and

10
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,840
seal and stack the box there are two
volunteers assigned to each task now you

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,390
can see the amount of time required for
each of these activities and now based

12
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,759
on this information

13
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:11,849
what is the process capacity per day can
they meet their target of a hundred

14
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:14,239
fifty boxes per week

15
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:19,048
what is the current bottleneck of this
operation and if you assume that every

16
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,790
volunteer is capable of doing every job
how would you reassign the volunteers and

17
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:30,210
what is your new process capacity
per day so what we're going to do is

18
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:36,039
walk through this problem and you can
see that these are the key pieces of

19
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:42,140
information they are available five
hours a day four days a week so this

20
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,829
helps us figure out our time available

21
00:01:44,828 --> 00:01:50,469
our goal is a hundred and fifty boxes we
have the time required which is the 

22
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,780
unit

23
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,500
load for each one of the resource pools
we have a resouce pool for selecting

24
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:02,078
the canned goods one for packing the goods
and one for sealing and stacking boxes and we

25
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:06,349
have how many resources that are
available in each poor there's two

26
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:08,360
volunteers for each task

27
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:15,310
so now we're going to put it into a grid
so that we can analyze the capacity so

28
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,140
we have a resource pools the unit load
an hour

29
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:24,789
the time available per person per day
which was given as five hours per day we

30
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:30,389
have two volunteers for each of the
resources and they work four days a week

31
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:34,279
so what we're going to be doing is going
to be calculating the total time

32
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,890
available per day then the effective
capacity per day and then the effective

33
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:47,329
capacity per week so when we look at the
total time per day we have 2 resources

34
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:53,850
2 volunteers working five hours a day
so there's ten hours available for each

35
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:59,969
of the resource pools so when we
calculate the effective capacity per day we

36
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:02,000
take the time available

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,379
divided by the time needed which is a
unit load and we can see that selecting

38
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:12,989
canned goods yield 28.57 boxes per day

39
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:19,009
83.33 for packing and 40 for sealing and
stacking but that's per day and we're

40
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:24,250
trying to meet a hundred and fifty in a
week and they work four days a week so

41
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,919
we're just going to multiply the effective
capacity per day by the four days a week

42
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:37,159
so we can see our smallest number of
boxes per week is in the selecting

43
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:44,009
canned goods we can only do 
114.28 so that

44
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:52,048
is our bottleneck right there so answer
to her question based on this

45
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:58,760
information what is a process capacity
per day it's 28.57 boxes can they meet

46
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:05,090
their target of 150 cannot and our
current bottleneck is selected canned

47
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:12,019
goods now the last one was if we assume
that every volunteer is capable of doing

48
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:16,950
every job how'd you reassigned the
volunteers and what is your new process

49
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:20,149
capacity per day so let's take a look at
this

50
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:26,389
this we have excess capacity and that
excess capacity is in the area of

51
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:32,449
packing goods notice it more than double
our intended 150 because it's

52
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:37,949
over 300 so since we're over double
their what if we move one of the

53
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:43,120
resource units one volunteer from
packing goods and move it to selecting

54
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,970
canned good and when we do that and we
recalculated our effective capacity per

55
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:56,120
day and then our boxes per week we see
that now we can meet that hundred and

56
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,129
fifty requirement we have a hundred
seventy-one in selecting canned goods

57
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:07,418
166.67 in packing goods and our 
sealing and stacking box

58
00:05:07,418 --> 00:05:12,709
is a hundred and sixty now we look at
this we realize that our bottleneck has

59
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:17,680
now moved it's no longer selecting
canned goods it is now seal and stack

60
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:25,189
boxes so by moving one person from the
packing to the selecting we reduce the

61
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:31,569
excess capacity from packing and added
it to the bottleneck so that yielded an

62
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:36,908
overall effective capacity of 40 per day
because we have a new bottleneck in the

63
00:05:36,908 --> 00:05:43,110
seal and stack and we have a weekly
capacity of 160 so one of the big things

64
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:48,620
about capacity analysis is once we
identify the bottleneck and see whether

65
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:54,329
we have excess capacity we can move that
excess capacity over to the bottleneck

66
00:05:54,329 --> 00:06:01,439
to be able to increase their overall
throughput it'll be another operations

67
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,209
supplemental problem in capacity analysis and I
hope to see you for that one
