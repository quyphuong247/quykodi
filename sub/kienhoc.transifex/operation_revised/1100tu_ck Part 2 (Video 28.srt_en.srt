00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,609
hello again and welcome back to
operations management and we're still

2
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:15,230
calculating safety stock only this time
when we're trying to calculate the

3
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:20,420
safety stock were not given a lead time
demand and a standard deviation of the

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:26,899
lead time demand what we are given are
demand and standard deviation of demand

5
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:31,219
and sometimes the lead time is variable
sometimes the lead time is not variable

6
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:36,528
so we're going to have to do is
calculate that lead time demand as well

7
00:00:36,528 --> 00:00:42,200
as the standard deviation of the lead
time demand so sometimes you know that

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:48,469
the lead time is static it's l and it's
very constant but the demand itself is

9
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:52,879
variable so we have to calculate that
lead time demand and the standard

10
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:58,339
deviation of the lead time demand so we're
typically given the demand

11
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:05,270
how much is expected to be used per given
time of day week month etc as well as

12
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:10,880
the standard deviation for that demand
and we're also given a lead time so to

13
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:15,349
calculate the lead time demand we're
just going to multiply the lead time by

14
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:20,658
the demand very simple and to get the
standard deviation of the lead time

15
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:22,609
demand it's  a little bit different

16
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:26,840
we're going to take the square root of
the lead time and multiply it by the

17
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:34,430
standard deviation of the demand so what
we use a simple example here Riley is

18
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,540
trying to figure out how much extra
inventory of ink cartridges to keep and

19
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,729
during the past year the demand per day
was variable with a mean of 20 and a

20
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:48,709
standard deviation of three and the lead
time was constant at five days

21
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:53,509
Riley wants to maintain a ninety-percent
service level we want to figure out the

22
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:59,118
safety stock and the reorder point
notice in this problem we know that the

23
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:04,459
demand itself is variable because we're
given a mean and a standard deviation

24
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:12,530
with the lead time is constant at five
days so let's do those calculations the

25
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:16,848
lead time demand is going to be just
equal to the lead-time times the demand

26
00:02:16,848 --> 00:02:18,459
we know the lead time is

27
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:25,689
five the demand is 20 so we expect to
use 100 ink cartridges between the time

28
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:30,189
we place the order and the time we
receive it but for the standard

29
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:36,009
deviation of the lead time demand we're
going to take the square root of five x

30
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:43,149
the standard deviation of the demand and
we end up with 6.708 so now we've

31
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,340
calculated the ltd the lead time demand
and the standard deviation of the lead

32
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,319
time demand which means we can just go
back to the material from the last

33
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:58,569
session to calculate safety stock or Z
statistic times the standard deviation

34
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:04,780
of lead time demand we calculate that Z
statistic using the service level that

35
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:11,560
we were given which was 90% and we use
Excel to use the norms inverse formula

36
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,860
and we get 1.28 and we multiply that
1.28 by the standard deviation of lead

37
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,860
time demand we get 8.6 and as
always when dealing with safety stock we

38
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:30,430
always round up so our safety stock is
going to be nine ink cartridges and a

39
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:35,500
reorder point we take our lead time
demand add our safety stock and we had a

40
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,930
hundred and nine so when we look at the
inventory and we realize we're down to a

41
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:47,530
hundred and nine ink cartridges we place
our order but sometimes the lead time is

42
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:52,659
also variable not just the demand we
still have to calculate that lead time

43
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:57,669
demand and standard deviation for the
lead time demand so we're typically

44
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:05,500
given a value for the demand R and
standard deviation of the demand and

45
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:13,150
will also be given a lead time L and the
standard deviation of the lead time now

46
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,850
using all four of those values we are going
to end up calculating the lead time

47
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:24,819
demand which is just the lead-time times
the demand and the standard deviation of

48
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:29,349
that lead time demand now notice this is
a much different formula than what we

49
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,400
had before

50
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,199
it's a little bit complicated

51
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:38,050
and when you use that you have to be
very careful that your you take the

52
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,160
square root of the whole equation and
make sure your parentheses and so forth

53
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,430
are in the correct place so when we look
at an example here we have Robin trying

54
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,449
to figure out how much extra inventory
of boxes of imported chocolate to keep

55
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:58,389
during the past year the demand per week
was variable with a mean of 85 and a

56
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:04,629
standard deviation of 12 lead time was
also variable with a mean of six weeks and

57
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:11,860
a standard deviation of two so now we
have a value for the demand along with

58
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,610
its standard deviation amvalue for the
lead time along with that standard

59
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,689
deviation now we know what the service
level in this case again ninety percent

60
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:27,040
we want to calculate the safety stock as
well as the reorder point we're using

61
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,860
the variables that we were given and we
calculate the lead time demand to be 510

62
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,600
and the standard deviation that lead
time demand is a hundred and seventy

63
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,650
two point five two again we go back to the standard
safety stock equation Z times the

64
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:51,009
standard deviation of lead time demand
we calculate Z statistic we calculate

65
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:56,920
our safety stock always round up so
we're up to 220 in our safety stock

66
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:06,009
and a reorder point is a lead time demand
plus the safety stock 510 plus 222

67
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:13,089
so when our inventory level goes down to
732 boxes of chocolate

68
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:20,079
we're placing our order so when do you
know when to use the right model for

69
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,699
calculating safety stock the first
question are the demand and the lead

70
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:31,959
time constant yes no safety stock is
needed is the lead time demand variable

71
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:37,389
yes we're going to calculate the safety
stock using the Z times the standard

72
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:43,029
deviation of the lead time demand is the
lead time constant with the demand

73
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:45,848
variable we calculate the lead time demand

74
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:50,168
and the standard deviation of the lead
time demand then calculate safety stock

75
00:06:50,168 --> 00:06:55,628
if both lead time and demand variable
again we're going to calculate that lead

76
00:06:55,629 --> 00:07:00,968
time demand and standard deviation of
lead time demand then calculate the safety

77
00:07:00,968 --> 00:07:06,490
stock now we've been talking a lot about
service level we've been using ninety

78
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,379
percent a lot but in the next session
we're going to talk about what drives

79
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:15,459
that service level how we try and
calculate what that service level should

80
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:16,749
be i'll see you then
