hello again and welcome back to operation management. 
In this supplemental lecture, we're gonna be taking about process
throughput, try to figure out what controls the rate of units going through
a particular process.

2
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:39,380
So we're gonna particularly look at the arrival rate of the unit vs process rate itself. 
Won't you remember what we've talked about what is the average throughput rate?
We know that it is the average number of units that flow through the process in 
a specified period of time. So for example, it could be 10 units per hour, 50 units per day


3
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:55,490
12 units per minute, 100 per week, 100 per hour, 3 per second
 and so forth. So we're looking at units per period of time. So what affects
 the throughput. As i said earlier, it is

4
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:21,730
the arrival rate, which is how many units that arrive and enter 
the process, and it also affects the private process rate, which
is how many units can be processed. So again we're looking at 
units per period of time. Now, there're 3 different situations. One is 
the arrival rate can exceed the process rate.

5
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:26,260
In this case, there are more units arrive in than the process can handle. 

6
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:47,820
The second situation is that the arrival rate is less than the 
process rate, which means the process is capable of handling 
more units than all the arrive in. And the third situation 
is when the arrival rate is equal to the process rate. We're going
through each of these situation independently.

7
00:01:47,819 --> 00:02:03,459
In the first on, when the arrival rate exceed that of a process rate, 
if you look at this diagram, you can see that units are building up 
inventory, because as units are arriving, but the process is 
not ready to accept these new flow units.


8
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:11,879
So it's going to build up. So in this case, 
The output of the process of throughput rate 
9
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:22,159
is going to be limited to the capability of the process itself. 
This process is going to be used all the 
time. It is 

10
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:29,120
100% untilized, which means if you have the arrival rate
 exceeding your process rate, here is no 
downtime for that process

11
00:02:29,120 --> 00:03:03,590
It's been used 100% capacity. And it's high arrival rate is going to
increases work in process inventory. Because if you want an unit going
through your arriving, waiting for the process to handle it and the process
it's just slow. It can not handle all of those units. So when we're thinking 
about increasing throughput rate of a process, we always have to consider
how quickly the process can handle these new units

12
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,509
The second situation is the arrival rate is less than process rate. 

13
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:26,759
And here you that we have almost no build-up inventory in practice.
 None here. And on average, the process is waiting for the arrival of units. 
Now we can get some small inventory build-up 
because there is variability in arrival of units. 

14
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:36,598
Remember when we talk about

15
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:43,829
And also variability in processing of the units. So in this case,
 when the arrival rate is less than
process rate, 

16
00:03:43,830 --> 00:04:11,189
then average throughput rate is going to be controlled by the 
arrival rate of the units. So this meansthe output of process 
is limited to the arrival rate. And average utilization of the process itself is
going to be less than 100%. 'Cos there will be period of time when the 
process is waiting for units

17
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:19,879
to arrive. And our work in process inventory is low or non-existent
because the process is faster than the units can arrive. The third 
situation when arrival rate equals to process rate

18
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:27,089
Well, here, it's similar to that of the previous situation when the 
arrival rate is less than process rate


19
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:47,339
But although the arrival rate and the process rate is the same, there 
is some variability in units coming. So we can have some small inventory 
build-up and there can be times when the process is waiting. So the arrival rate
 equals to process rate, which equals to throughput rate

20
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:55,500
So the ouput is limited to capability of the process itself. 

21
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:17,879
And here our capacity utilization can be
just about 100%, which means that process is working almost all of
the time and we may get some work in process inventory increases
 over time due to variability of arrival and process rates themselves.
So when we thinking about throughput of a process,

22
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:39,000
remember you have to consider the arrival rate and the process rate
itself . If the arrival rate exceed than the process, then the process is 
controlling the throughput rate. If the arrival rate is less than
the process, then it is the arrival rate that is controlling the throughput 
rate. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time.
