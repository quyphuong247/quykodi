00:00:05,788 --> 00:00:09,068
welcome back operations management in
this session we're going to talk about

2
00:00:09,068 --> 00:00:10,660
process metrics

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,269
metrics is just fancy a word for

4
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:18,949
measurements when we have a process

5
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:22,509
we need to understand whether that
process is actually working

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,820
that's it that's why we use process metrics

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,879
its some think that we measure

8
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,768
about the process to ensure that

9
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:37,729
it's going to meet the goals of the
process competencies

10
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:40,779
or the product attributes that we're
trying to achieve

11
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,329
to determine what kind

12
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,660
up metrics we want we have to take into
account the customer expectations

13
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:52,769
as well as the company's strategic goals

14
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,820
so when we're looking at the process
competencies

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,840
and the goals of the organization and
what

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,239
product attributes are we have to come
up with ways

17
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,718
of measuring things let's

18
00:01:05,718 --> 00:01:09,588
let's take this little bit further we
want to make sure that what we're

19
00:01:09,588 --> 00:01:10,618
measuring

20
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:13,829
is not influenced by external factors

21
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:18,099
we wanted it to be solely attributable to
know the process itself

22
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:22,118
very important that we do that so for
looking

23
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:25,659
at a certain process competencies such
as cost

24
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:30,340
on metrics could be how much our
inventory costs or

25
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,259
how much it costs to actually produce
a unit or maybe

26
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,319
how often our equipment is down

27
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:40,709
these are things that would attribute to
cost

28
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:45,158
and that is a process competency
that we want to be aware of

29
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,350
for flow time if we try to track how
long it takes

30
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:52,559
then how long is something sitting in
inventory

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,000
how long does it take to produce a unit
how long does it take for us to actually

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,879
deliver completed unit

33
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,000
if we're concerned about flexibility one
of the things we

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,868
would be concerned about is how quickly
we can change over equipment

35
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:11,540
from one product to another or 
throughout for that customization to occur

36
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,209
and for quality obviously

37
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:19,128
we don't want to have defective units we wanna
track how many things that

38
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:22,848
are incorrectly made maybe the number of
complaints that we're getting from

39
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,759
customers

40
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,289
if we're going to be looking at metrics from

41
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:32,239
strategic goals what of
a strategic goal could be

42
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,459
we need increasing throughput so let's
keep track of how many

43
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:41,159
unit a day we can make and again how
much downtime equipment has

44
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:45,000
if you wanna track our customer
satisfaction

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,870
let's look at the number of complaints
or the marks on a customer satisfaction

46
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,920
survey

47
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,369
if we're also having a strategic goal that we
want employees

48
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,939
and satisfaction then we want to be
concerned about employee turnover

49
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:04,189
and again on satisfaction surveys so you can
see that the metrics that are listed

50
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:05,039
the samples

51
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,199
are directly related to either goals

52
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:11,259
or competencies and there solely

53
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:15,500
related to process they're not really
influenced by anything

54
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,310
outside one thing I want to caution you
about

55
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,840
is price and market share and sales

56
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,120
these are not process metrics a lot of
people get confused about this

57
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,700
price is not the same as the cost to
manufacture

58
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:36,839
price is actually one of the 4 P's of
marketing

59
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,030
and as you understand the marketing the
price point that is set for our product

60
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,818
it's not necessarily directly related to
how much it costs

61
00:03:46,818 --> 00:03:50,658
and is also dependent on what your
competitors are doing

62
00:03:50,658 --> 00:03:54,658
what the economy is doing whether you using it
as a loss leader

63
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:57,859
whether you are you trying to set a
certain

64
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,860
image about the product so price

65
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,959
is not a process metric because you're
not

66
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,019
using price to evaluate

67
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,908
a process same thing with market share
and sales

68
00:04:10,908 --> 00:04:13,969
they are dependent on many external
variables

69
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:17,289
so be careful that you don't think about
price

70
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:22,978
market share and sales as process
metrics once you've determined what your

71
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:23,519
metrics

72
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,189
are you need to identify specific
targets

73
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:32,918
that way you can say we are making
progress towards our goals

74
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:37,609
and if we're not making progress towards our
goals then we need to evaluate

75
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,410
and determined why that's happening it's
not enough just to have metrics

76
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:47,540
but in order to ensure process success
you have to use those metrics

77
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:53,500
you need to monitor and evaluate your
processed by those metrics to make sure

78
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,649
you're achieving your process success

79
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:02,359
next time we're gonna be talking about
specific ways that we can start looking

80
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,300
at processes

81
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,728
this actually wraps up the basics

82
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:10,599
we've talked about what a basic process
is we've looked at

83
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,180
how it relates to strategy we've looked at
metrics

84
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,418
we've looked at the operational frontier
and different architectures

85
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:22,219
the next step is looking at the process
itself

86
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,590
not delving into it. See you then
