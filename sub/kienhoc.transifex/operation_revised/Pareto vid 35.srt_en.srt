00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:03,900
Hello again and welcome back to Operations
Management

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,830
We are continuing the series of 7 tools of
quality and in this one,

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:14,049
we will be talking about Pareto Charts
Very simply a pareto chart is just a vertical

4
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:18,480
bar graph where we take the bars,
rearrange them from the longest bars on the

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,910
left to the shortest to the right
and create a great visual aid when we’re

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:30,890
discussing problems or causes of situations
We use pareto charts when we try to analyze

7
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:36,360
the frequency of problems or causes
and if we try to find the most significant

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,020
problems or causes
So let’s take a look at a couple of pareto

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,020
charts.

10
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,670
The one on the left is just indicating the
reason for people being late

11
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,960
where we have the reasons coming from the
alarm not going off to sleeping

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,330
through the alarm, traffic, cramp problem,
no hot water

13
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:02,220
As you notice that the frequency bars are
ranged from largest to smallest

14
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:08,600
but then you notice there is a second line
on this chart and this is the cumulative percentage

15
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,280
line,
this is where we’re taking the sum total

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,510
of each of the reasons and ending it up to
get 100%

17
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,140
The other one on the right is particular points
to return software.

18
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:27,860
Then again we have the highest to the lowest
and we have cumulative line but this time

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,370
we have a second line.

20
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,000
The green line there is showing 80%.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,540
A lot of time when we use pareto charts,
what we looking at is what is creating the

22
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:44,530
most problems,
we want to look at the top 80% so in this

23
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:53,470
case 80% hit right at the Changed mind
So we take together Not compatible, Does not

24
00:01:53,470 --> 00:02:01,299
perform as expected, Found at a cheaper price,
and Changed mind together that create 80%

25
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:09,030
of the reasons for software being returned
So when we use the pareto chart, we know that

26
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,909
the most frequent issue is on the left,
the least frequent is on the right and a cumulative

27
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:19,900
line in addition to the bars
can provide information and that information

28
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,879
is combination of issues, and we look for
80% of all problems

29
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:31,640
When we go about building of pareto chart
in Excel it is really simple.

30
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,239
We enter the data and we sort the highest
to lowest.

31
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:38,480
So we have categories with the frequency.

32
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,720
And then we add the cumulative percentage
so that we can see that

33
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,650
the Missing belt makes up a total of 38% but
the Missing belt

34
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:54,239
and the Wrong size together make up 64% and
so on

35
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,959
Then we take the data and we select the column
chart from chart tools

36
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,170
and then we edit the chart to convert cumulative
data to line chart

37
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:09,340
and we put in on the second axis
That’s generally how it goes.

38
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,400
Very simple to do, we may take a look at the
practice

39
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,309
but it is a straightforward way of taking
a look at causes,

40
00:03:17,309 --> 00:03:22,529
the most frequent causes of the situation
we are trying to correct.

41
00:03:22,529 --> 00:03:25,400
I’ll see you again when we talk about another
tool
