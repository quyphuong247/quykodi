00:00:06,078 --> 00:00:08,120
welcome back to operations management

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,919
in this session we're gonna talk about
how process strategy

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:17,039
can be evaluated through something known
as the operational audit

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,789
as we've talked in the past

5
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,948
about process architecture and so forth
if we're starting from scratch

6
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:28,529
it's very easy to say this is where I
want

7
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:33,250
organization head and these are the
kinds of process competencies we need to

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:33,948
develop

9
00:00:33,948 --> 00:00:38,429
and also this is the way we're going to
build their processes

10
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:41,850
but what if we already have an existing
organization

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,570
what we need to do is who want to take a
look at where we want our business

12
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,759
to go that's our desired business strategy

13
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:56,509
and along with that we have what kind of
capabilities want to have as well

14
00:00:56,509 --> 00:01:01,159
as what kind of strategy in the
operations and marketing

15
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:05,448
finance areas and so forth so remember
first looking ahead

16
00:01:05,448 --> 00:01:08,599
this is what we'd like to have and

17
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:12,349
what we'd like to have also is an
operational structure

18
00:01:12,349 --> 00:01:15,739
our process easier infrastructure that
matches

19
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:21,280
our particular business strategy but if
we already have an existing organization

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,379
we already have things in place

21
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:26,420
we have existing capabilities

22
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,500
we have existing processes and
infrastructure

23
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,680
and they may or may not be able to
produce

24
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,570
are desired business strategy if we
already have

25
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:42,199
a an assembly line setup then

26
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,189
suddenly trying to make very
customizable product

27
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:50,039
is not exactly feasible on the

28
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,560
other side if we have a job shop
structure suddenly trying to be a

29
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,149
low-cost high-volume provider

30
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:02,009
might be very very difficult so we need
to do is take a look at our existing

31
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:03,009
strategies

32
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:06,040
as well as our desired strategies

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,090
and see where the gaps are basically
we're looking at

34
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:16,840
what is feasible given what we currently
have versus what we want to have

35
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,039
whether capabilities are in now what we'd
like them to be

36
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,280
and in terms of processes and
infrastructure

37
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,840
what we have now where should it be

38
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,959
that's what an operational audit gives
us

39
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,000
tells us where our problems are and what
we need to change

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,150
we either have to change are desired
business strategies

41
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,439
or we will have to change our
capabilities

42
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:48,810
in order to meet that so this brings us
to the area up strategic fit

43
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,878
by strategic fit were saying that we
want to make sure there's consistency

44
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:54,939
between

45
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:58,209
our strategic position in the industry

46
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:01,500
where the market and the competencies

47
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,650
are our process architectures and our
current policies

48
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,219
so that's what we need to do and in our
next session

49
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:12,408
gonna take a little bit further at the
strategic fit

50
00:03:12,408 --> 00:03:15,509
by taking a look at how different
strategies

51
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:19,018
are come about or we're gonna look at them
from different perspectives

52
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:19,830
we'll see you there
