00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,528
hello again and welcome back to
operations management we're continuing

2
00:00:09,528 --> 00:00:14,539
with capacity analysis we have our
supplementary problem number 2 this is

3
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:20,259
part 2 I'm going to be continuing with
their amazing shed company if you recall

4
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:25,350
from the part 1 the amazing shed company
produces three different kinds of shared

5
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:31,130
basic superior and premium now what we
did in the last session was re-

6
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:36,858
determined that where their current
resources that they were not able to

7
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:42,760
make their 40 sheds that they had been
required now in this particular

8
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:47,670
situation we're still gonna work with
the same basic information but now we're

9
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,170
told that the profits per shed are
given as follows

10
00:00:52,170 --> 00:01:00,448
basic $190 superior two hundred and
twenty dollars and premium $230 now the

11
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:05,628
company is making twenty basic 10
superior and 10 premium sheds to

12
00:01:05,628 --> 00:01:10,280
complete it to be completed in one week
so how much profit is the company

13
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:18,780
actually making in a week . Also if it
costs company $800 to add one team should the

14
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,530
company add the team and if yes where
should the team be assigned so take a

15
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:30,769
look this is the basic information that
we came up with in the last session we

16
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:37,849
found that the bottleneck was with the
assembly resource pool they could only

17
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:45,140
do 33.8 sheds per week and they could not make
that forty sheds in a week so given

18
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:52,599
that we only have 33.8 sheds the maximum
profit we can make a seven thousand

19
00:01:52,599 --> 00:02:02,819
thirteen dollars and fifty cents this is calculated by taking
fifty percent of that 33.8 basic sheds that

20
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:12,339
earned $190 apiece way to 25 percent as
superior sheds to $220 and 25 percent of

21
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,500
premium share to 230 you can

22
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:23,289
not use of total 40 because our maximum
number of shares per week is 33.8 so

23
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:29,759
what happens if we add a team we know we
should be putting it in the assembly

24
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:34,750
area because that is the bottleneck area
instead of being able to get forty

25
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:40,090
sheds a week out we can only do 33.8 so
what we're going to do is we're going to

26
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:46,159
increase the number of teams in the
assembly area by 1 so now that we've done

27
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:53,259
that we can actually get 45.1 sheds out
in a week and that's no longer the

28
00:02:53,259 --> 00:03:01,870
bottleneck the bottleneck has moved to
inspection the inspection area can only do

29
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:07,849
40 sheds in a week so when we fix a
bottleneck in one area most likely will

30
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:14,930
create a bottleneck in a second area so
now our maximum number of shares per

31
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:22,959
week is 40 and we calculate the Profit
using 50% basic sheds 25% superior sheds

32
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:30,930
and 25% premium sheds we have a total
profit of $8300.00 now our old profit when we

33
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:37,890
can only make the 33.8 sheds were $7013.50
so there is a difference

34
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:44,958
of $1286.50 which is significantly
greater than the eight hundred dollars

35
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:52,409
spent for the team so we definitely
should increase the team by one in the

36
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:56,609
assembly area we will meet our
requirements of four sheds in a week

37
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:02,450
and we've increased our profits I hope
to see you in part 3 of the session
