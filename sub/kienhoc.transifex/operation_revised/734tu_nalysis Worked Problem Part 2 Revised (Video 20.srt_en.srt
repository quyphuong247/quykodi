00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,259
hello again and welcome back to operations
management

2
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:11,990
in this session we're going to continue
with the problem that we started in the

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,870
last one

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,399
about the LRDR laundry company

5
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,670
and in this one instead of trying to
determine whether or not we could meet

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,368
a particular capacity we're going to try
and figure out how many

7
00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:28,410
resources we actually need to meet
capacity

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:34,439
still a little bit different let's get
started if you recall the LRDR 

9
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:37,200
laundry company provides a commercial
laundry service

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,640
to businesses whose employees wear
uniforms approximately 10 percent of all

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,179
loads

12
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:45,590
considered heavy loads the rest are
considered normal

13
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,730
a normal though takes 30 minutes in the
washer eighty

14
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:53,968
in the dryer a heavy load takes 45
minutes in the washer and 120 minutes in

15
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:54,590
the dryer

16
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,620
they have two washers and four dryers
washers and dryers can run

17
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:05,209
22 hours a day seven days a week and the
original question was can they meet

18
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,359
their weekly demand a 500 loads

19
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,900
when we 

20
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,780
worked on the problem in the last
session the bakkie was

21
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,359
identifying the bottleneck the
bottleneck

22
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:21,810
is the resource pool that is the slowest
it is

23
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,400
what actually preventing us from meeting
our 

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,000
 demand requirements in this case

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,299
when we looked at it we saw that the
washer

26
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:37,159
resource pool could meet the requirement
of 500 loads per week

27
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,909
in fact it could complete 586.7
loads per week

28
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,240
but the dryer couls only do

29
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:50,239
429.8 so the dryer capacity

30
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,368
being lower than that of the washer
capacity said

31
00:01:54,368 --> 00:01:58,390
this is our bottleneck even though there
were four dryers

32
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:03,269
the amount of loads that could be
done in that resource pool

33
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:07,989
was lower than in the washer

34
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:13,019
so we need to do is determine how many
dryers are actually needed

35
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:16,620
in order to meet the required 500
loads per week

36
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,930
so if you recall

37
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,280
we put in the information degraded to
determine how many

38
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,469
minutes we needed per load

39
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:32,080
we used the weight average between
heavy load and the normal load

40
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,330
to get the average unit load the washer

41
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,750
took 31.5 minutes on
average for a

42
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:44,909
load where's the dryer took 86 so the
next point need to do is figure out how much

43
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:46,889
time is actually needed

44
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:53,039
to do 500 loads in a week so five hundred
loads

45
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,590
times the average unit load is

46
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,829
what is going to give us that time so
the time needed

47
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:04,069
is the unit load times the 500 loads

48
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:07,268
so it took 500 times 31.5

49
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:13,349
we came up with 15750 minutes for
the dryer

50
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:17,349
86 minutes per load times 500

51
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:20,608
said we need 43000

52
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:24,629
minutes in a week of dryer time in order to
get this

53
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:27,969
500 loads done

54
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:32,500
now we also know how much time is
available per resource unit

55
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,500
per week we had 22 hours

56
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,560
a day each one worked sixty

57
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,009
minutes is an hour and there are
seven days a week so is 22 hours a day

58
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:48,759
time 60 minutes per hour time seven
days in a week

59
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:53,789
so a single washer could do 9240
 minutes

60
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:58,889
a single dryer could do 9240 minutes

61
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:02,689
so how to determine the number Resource
Units needed

62
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:08,310
we're going to take the amount time that
needed for 500 loads

63
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,670
divided by the amount of time available

64
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,929
per resource unit and that will tell us
how many we need

65
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,269
so there it is the number of units
needed

66
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,780
is the total amount of time needed

67
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:28,399
divided by the total time available

68
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,788
per resource so it took up 15750

69
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:36,819
divided by 9240

70
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:40,629
and they told us we needed 1.7 washers

71
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:44,848
and we had 2 so obviously we met the
requirement there

72
00:04:44,848 --> 00:04:47,959
for the dryers we needed

73
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:51,989
43,000 minutes to do 500 loads

74
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,228
divided by 9240

75
00:04:55,228 --> 00:05:00,300
minutes per resource unit said we
needed 4.65

76
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,430
we only had four so that would explain
why the dryer

77
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,160
is the bottleneck we need to increase
the number dryers

78
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,680
in order to meet the capacity
requirement of 500

79
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,650
units per week

80
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,959
in our next session we're gonna be
talking using the same

81
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:23,839
problem where I'm going to be adding
dollar values to it

82
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,779
we're going to take a look at the
profitability op the LRDR company

83
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:28,500
I'll see you then.
