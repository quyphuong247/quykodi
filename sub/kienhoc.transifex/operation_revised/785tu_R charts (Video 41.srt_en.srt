00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:08,730
hello again and welcome back to operations management

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,220
we're continuing our sessions on
statistical process control

3
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:15,558
and this session we're going to be
talking about how we can create the

4
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:16,888
control limits for both

5
00:00:16,888 --> 00:00:20,170
X bar and R charts if you recall

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,420
X bar and R chart always used 
together they're used for variables

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,109
inspection and the X bar chart
indicate

8
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,260
changes in the mean which is the central
tendency of the process

9
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:36,868
whereas the R-chart tracks the range
within a sample so that monitors the

10
00:00:36,868 --> 00:00:37,839
dispersion they're

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,280
always used together so we have a much
better view of the process

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,329
when we look at the X bar chart

13
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:48,609
we're going to create an upper
control limit by using

14
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:51,850
the mean plus three standard deviations

15
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,730
above the mean and for the lower control
limit it's gonna be

16
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:59,359
the mean minus three standard deviations now

17
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,369
you see I have Z here because sometimes
people use

18
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:06,780
number other than three standard
deviations although

19
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,118
3 is normal for this kind of 

20
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:13,868
chart now when we do the standard
deviation

21
00:01:13,868 --> 00:01:16,950
were actually using the standard error

22
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,689
which is the sampling distribution of
the mean standard deviation

23
00:01:20,688 --> 00:01:25,569
and that's calculated by taking the
population standard deviation

24
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:29,169
and dividing it by the square root of
the sample size

25
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:34,340
so it's too an example here we have the
LRDR company

26
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,579
and produces a candy bar that has an
average weight of

27
00:01:37,578 --> 00:01:40,719
10 ounces with the standard deviation of


28
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,269
.2  the company wants to monitor the
process that makes these bars

29
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:50,719
so they're going to collect data samples
they're going to use a sample sizes 16

30
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,519
and they want to create control limits
of three standard deviations

31
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:58,060
so we'll  calculate both the upper and lower
control limit

32
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,820
for this X-bar chart the average
weight

33
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:06,739
mean is 10 ounces the standard deviation
of the population is point

34
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:10,819
two ounces and we'reusing a sample sizes of 16

35
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:14,030
so to creat the upper and lower control limits

36
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:18,870
we're going to take the mean and add to
it three standard deviations above the

37
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,450
mean

38
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:23,629
but remember we have to calculate
standard deviation

39
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:27,590
by using the population standard
deviation of .2

40
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,990
and dividing it by the square root of
the sample size of

41
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,510
16 so we have 10 plus

42
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:38,269
3 times .2 divided by the square
root of 16

43
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:44,880
which is 10.15 the lower control limit
is calculated in a similar fashion

44
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,049
only was starting with the mean and
we're subtracting

45
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,110
the three standard deviations so that
gives us

46
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,510
9.85 so now you can imagine

47
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:59,109
a control chart that has a lower line
of 9.85

48
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,320
an upper line of 10.15 when we collect

49
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:06,569
data and we take the means of those samples

50
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:09,599
and we plotted on the chart

51
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,329
as long as those data points fall
between 9.85

52
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:20,330
and 10.15 everything looks fine but in
conjunction with the X bar chart we

53
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,100
have to take a look at the range

54
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:26,349
at the gate so we're going to calculate
the upper and lower control limits

55
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:30,639
of the range in a similar fashion to
the X bar chart

56
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,759
we're going to take the range means plus three
standard deviations at the range

57
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,969
standard deviation

58
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:40,939
so we have R bar plus

59
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:44,430
three times the standard deviation of  the
range and R bar

60
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,620
minus three times standard deviations of
the range

61
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,340
using the same process

62
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,219
now we know that the average weight
range of the candy bar

63
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:59,250
is .15 ounces with the standard
deviation of the range

64
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,259
being .03 ounces now the company is

65
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:08,090
monitoring this process for the range
ranging the same sample size of

66
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,539
16 and we're still going to use three
sigma control limits

67
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:14,879
so we're going to create the upper and
lower control limit

68
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,500
for the R chart the average weight

69
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,089
ranges .15 ounces and the standard
deviation

70
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:25,909
of that ranges point 03 and our sample
size

71
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,169
is 16 so we're going to creat upper
and lower control limits

72
00:04:30,168 --> 00:04:33,930
so it's .15 plus 3 times

73
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:39,978
.03 which is 24 and a lower control
limit is .15

74
00:04:39,978 --> 00:04:44,399
minus 3 times .03 which is .06

75
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,439
so again a margin to control chart

76
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,149
the lower line it's .06 the upper
line is 

77
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:56,399
.24 as long as we calculate the ranges of
our samples

78
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,629
those data points fall between .06 and
.24

79
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:04,810
we say a our process is doing fine but
remember

80
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,410
X-bar or R-chart  always used in
conjunction

81
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,660
with each other so if there's even one
data point that falls

82
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,840
outside the control limits on either
chart

83
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,199
then the process is not considered in
control

84
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,839
we have to go look for a cause for that
variation

85
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:26,538
in our next session we're gonna be
taking a look

86
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:30,959
control charts for attributes which
would be the C chart

87
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,549
and the P chart. I'll see you then
