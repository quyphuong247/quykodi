00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:09,379
welcome back to operations management in
this session we're gonna talk about

2
00:00:09,379 --> 00:00:11,140
process analysis

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,449
and I'm going to introduce you to the
concept of Little's

4
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:19,879
law up until this time we've been
thinking theoretically about processes

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,100
I've talked about why we need to study a
process

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,868
and the importance of relating our
operational strategies to our

7
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:29,839
organizational strategy and

8
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:33,849
so forth but now we need to start
looking at processes

9
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:40,488
in detail and that's what we're gonna
start now we study operations management

10
00:00:40,488 --> 00:00:41,929
from a process view

11
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:46,039
because when we look down into an
organization

12
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,058
it is this series of interconnected
events

13
00:00:49,058 --> 00:00:52,979
from moment an order is received the time
that it goes

14
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:58,038
out to the customer we just have one bit
long process that when we look down into

15
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:58,359
it

16
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,229
it's actually a series of interconnected
smaller processes

17
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,709
activities tasks buffers now

18
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,058
in order for us to improve on that
process

19
00:01:09,058 --> 00:01:12,629
we need to look at it we need to take
a

20
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:15,780
look at it from the moment that
orders received

21
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,670
and start looking at what can we do to
shorten how

22
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,180
shorten the amount of time it takes to
complete unit shorten the amount of time

23
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,880
it takes to get to the customer

24
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:30,289
how can I make it less costly how can we
make it higher quality

25
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,710
we can't figure that out unless we
understand the process itself

26
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:39,399
so what we need to do is we need to look
at every step in that process

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,590
and trying new things that don't need to
be there

28
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,780
things that don't need to be that there
are considered

29
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,950
but we call non value added

30
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,990
when things have to wait that's non-value
added

31
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:56,069
when we have additional steps that don't
need to happen

32
00:01:56,069 --> 00:02:00,219
that's also non-value added so when we
look at that process view

33
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:04,489
we're carefully analyzing every step in
that process

34
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:07,868
and trying to get rid of things that
don't add the value

35
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:12,500
when we analyze the process

36
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,848
we need it to be considered what we call
stable

37
00:02:15,848 --> 00:02:18,979
a stable process says the

38
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:23,539
units that come in on average the rate of
flow coming in

39
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:27,919
equals the rate of flow going out that

40
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,519
average inflow equals average outflow

41
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,980
we all know that

42
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:39,060
averages are not actually what is
happening

43
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,939
on moment-to-moment basis we also know that
when you flip the coin

44
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:47,930
on average you're going to get 50
percent heads

45
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,750
50 percent tales but on an individual
coin flip

46
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,389
or three in a row or four in a row
you're not going to get

47
00:02:55,389 --> 00:03:00,579
50 percent heads 50 percent tails but we
can't study a process

48
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,230
on individual transactions we can only a
study a process

49
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:11,268
using averages So we know the
fluctuations happen all the time

50
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:14,890
but we're going to be looking at a
process by averages

51
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:19,609
we need to look at three particular

52
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,450
operational measures one is flow time

53
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:27,378
we characterize that by the variable T
T for time

54
00:03:27,378 --> 00:03:32,079
and it indicates how long does it take to
get through the process

55
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,390
so flow time how long it takes to
get through the process

56
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:39,979
we have inventory inventory

57
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:43,009
are how many units are in

58
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:46,889
the process at any given time again
we're looking at averages

59
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:51,079
so if we were to take a snapshot and say
on average how many units are in the

60
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,890
process

61
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:56,518
that I for inventory our throughput
rate

62
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,039
what is processing in and out

63
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,158
of the process at any given time

64
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:07,188
that our throughput rate how many are coming
in and going out

65
00:04:07,188 --> 00:04:11,620
rate R now these three variables

66
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,438
these three operational measures can
be

67
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:18,750
connected and that this Little's law

68
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,399
Little's law connects the three we take our

69
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,069
average inventory and if you look inside
the box there that's the

70
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:29,680
units that are sitting inside the
process equals to

71
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,139
average throughput rate that's the
flow rate of items going through the

72
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:35,560
process

73
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,259
units per hour or units per minute or units
per second

74
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,419
and we multiply that by our average flow
time

75
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:46,448
the length of time it takes for an
average unit

76
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:50,680
to get through the process itself so
little's law says

77
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,900
average inventory equals average throughput
rate

78
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:57,250
times average flow time I equals

79
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,850
R times T very very powerful

80
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,900
because as long as we know that the
values

81
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:08,409
of 2 of these variables we can always
caculate the third

82
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,479
so let's just do a very simple example

83
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:15,629
A toy manufacture has throughput rate of
30 toys per hour

84
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:19,370
and it takes a half an hour for a toy to
go through the process

85
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,949
how many toys on average are in the
process

86
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:28,430
pause video and take a moment to solve
it

87
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,889
the key here is to look at the problem
and identify

88
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:35,430
the values for the individual
variables

89
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,829
if you notice we said that the
throughput rate was

90
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:42,740
30 toys per our so that becomes a
variable

91
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,930
R the length of time in the process

92
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,810
was a half hour that  our flow time so
that becomes

93
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,050
T so to calculate the inventory

94
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,319
we use Little's law of I equals R
times T

95
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,639
which equals 30 toys per hour

96
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,769
times the half an hour equals

97
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:08,409
15 toys that's all it takes to do

98
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,479
little's law  this understanding
relationship

99
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:15,159
of I equals R times T next time

100
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,500
we're gonna go and do some more
complicated problems

101
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,800
using Little's law. I'll see you then
