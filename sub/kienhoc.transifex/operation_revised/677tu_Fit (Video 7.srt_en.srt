00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,429
welcome back operations management

2
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:13,720
today we're talking about strategic fit
if you recall from our last session

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,759
we said that strategic fit is how we
look at the consistency between

4
00:00:18,759 --> 00:00:21,810
our strategic position and

5
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:26,210
our competencies of our processes by
strategic position

6
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,810
we're thinking about the business strategy
where do you want your products

7
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:32,170
positioned in the market

8
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,170
and our process competencies

9
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,760
are how we're going to be able to
achieve those particular product

10
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:42,939
attributes that give us that
particular strategic position in the

11
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:43,570
market

12
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,058
when we look at strategies

13
00:00:47,058 --> 00:00:51,839
we can look at it from multiple
perspectives one way is to look at it

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,050
as in market driven strategy

15
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:57,269
this is when we start with what is

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,340
we want to achieve in the market itself

17
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:05,379
where do we want position ourselves do
we wanna be a low-cost provider do we

18
00:01:05,378 --> 00:01:08,239
want to be highly customized provider

19
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,679
do we want to get things to our customers
very quickly what level quality

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,900
then once we have those particular

21
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,680
product attributes that then drives

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,560
the process architecture and our process
strategies

23
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,920
another way of looking at it is to say

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,978
what are we currently good at

25
00:01:30,978 --> 00:01:34,590
are we good at in terms of our process
competencies

26
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,400
are we already setup as assembly line
structure

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,290
are we already a low-cost are we

28
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:47,530
already very flexible once we understand
what our process is currently capable

29
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,269
of

30
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:52,269
then we can say where can we position
ourselves

31
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:56,319
in the market using the processes that
we already have

32
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,599
so you can see we can look at the
strategies in 2 different perspectives

33
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,408
but remember you cannot have

34
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,009
one process that fits everything you want
to achieve

35
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:12,790
getting back to the operations frontier
we know that there are always going to

36
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,118
be trade-offs

37
00:02:14,118 --> 00:02:19,620
so again we have to decide are the
processes that we currently have going

38
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,650
to drive the product offerings

39
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,469
or we going to modify our process
to match

40
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:29,400
our products so one is focusing on the
process

41
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,469
and the other one is focusing on our
product

42
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:37,219
another way of looking at

43
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:41,039
our strategy and the way we design our
processes

44
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,068
is whether we want to look at it by

45
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:47,518
individual functions within our
organization

46
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,050
or we want to have one functional area

47
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:55,480
that services many different products
that would be close to a job shop

48
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,159
structure

49
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,199
another way to look at it is with the
product focus

50
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:03,539
every product has its own series of

51
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:07,769
functions so you can look at the top
one is being much more

52
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:11,310
job shop related where you have single
functional

53
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,060
areas that work with multiple products the
other one

54
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,870
has individual functions for these
specific products

55
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:26,539
how the customer receives the product is

56
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:30,709
another way to look at it for process
design if

57
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:35,878
we make things to stock by that I mean
let's make a lot of items and put it

58
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:38,120
into inventory stored in a warehouse

59
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,700
send it to retail stores we can make a
lot of

60
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:44,878
one particular item and keep it fairly
low cost

61
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,899
that's made to stock if on the other side
we want to make to order

62
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,789
we're allowing a lot of customization but
that also means we're not going to have

63
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:57,840
a lot of inventory so if we're gonna be working on
make

64
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,590
to stock one more likely to have an
assembly line

65
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,688
a flow shop process but if we're going to
think about

66
00:04:04,688 --> 00:04:08,739
make it to order then we're going to be much
more of a job shop process

67
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:12,509
so as you can see as we decide where we
want to be.

68
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:17,348
in the market and how we want to
interact with our customers what kind

69
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:19,419
of product attribute do you want to have

70
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:25,370
that's going to drive the process design
next time we're gonna talk about process

71
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,329
metrics

72
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:30,030
what to decide the process to do what
we want to do

73
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:33,109
in terms of meeting our product attribute

74
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,189
how do we know we are actually doing it
right

75
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:41,050
how do we know wherther or not we're 
achieving our particular goals

76
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,699
that's where process metrics come in see
you next time
