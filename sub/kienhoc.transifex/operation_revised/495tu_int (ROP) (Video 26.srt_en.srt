00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:08,289
hello again and welcome back operations
management

2
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:11,689
in this session we can be continuing our
discussion of inventory

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,339
and in this one in particular it will be
about the reorder point.

4
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:21,550
Previously in with the economic order
quantity we've determined

5
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,740
how much we place in terms of

6
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:28,320
order for inventory that RQ a quantity per

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,480
inventory but we're trying to figure out

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,170
when we actually place the order this
is

9
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,850
the reorder point so when you place an
order

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,950
they usually have an amount of time it
takes from the time you place the order

11
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,780
and the time to receive

12
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,899
that's known as the lead time and
the amount of

13
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,429
inventory that you use during that lead 
time

14
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:55,649
is known as the lead time demand

15
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:58,899
frequently abbreviated as LTD

16
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:03,109
and in very simple situations th reorder point

17
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:08,620
is just equal to the Ltd which is the
amount that we use from the time we

18
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,819
placed the order to the time it's
received

19
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:15,339
we look at it graphically we notice Q is
the amount that we're actually

20
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,490
ordering now down at the bottom of the
graph

21
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:22,699
is the lead time we've placed the order
at some point t

22
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,890
and then it's going to arrive sometime
later

23
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,819
the amount of inventory that we used
during that lead time

24
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:34,978
is lead time demand and that's what equals to

25
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:41,250
reorder point very simple but what
happens if the demand varies or

26
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:41,930
the lead time

27
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,090
varies or both demand and all the lead time
varies

28
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,040
in those cases we usually want to keep
extra

29
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,830
inventory on hand and that's known as
safety stock

30
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,359
so the reorder point is no longer

31
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:00,179
just the lead time demand it's the
lead time demand

32
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,440
plus the safety stock if we look at that
graphically

33
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,890
the the chart much little bit different

34
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,759
set up a nice smooth demand it it
wiggles it varies because we're not

35
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,118
exactly sure

36
00:02:14,118 --> 00:02:19,569
how much is going to be used at any
given point we still have a lead time

37
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,109
so we have an expected lead time demand

38
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,080
how much we think we're going to use
during that period of

39
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,380
placing new order and it's being received

40
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:34,250
but notice we don't let it go all the
way down to zero

41
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,580
instead we had that yellow line there

42
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,590
and that's known as the safety stock so
when we

43
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,060
at the safety stock with the expected
lead time demand

44
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,530
now we have a different reorder point
its greater than just the expected lead

45
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,860
time demand

46
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,950
its equal to the lead time demand plus

47
00:02:55,949 --> 00:03:00,939
the safety stock so in very simple
situations the

48
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:05,870
reorder point is to the lead time demand
but if there's some sort of variation in

49
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,620
demand  the lead time 

50
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,280
will add in safety stock to the lead time on
demand to get to their

51
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,079
reorder point now the next question of
course is

52
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:20,659
how do we know how much safety stock to
keep well that's what we're gonna do in

53
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,579
the next session

54
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:22,320
I see it then
