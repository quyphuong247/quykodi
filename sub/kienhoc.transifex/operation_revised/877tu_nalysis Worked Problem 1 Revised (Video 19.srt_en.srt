00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,638
hello again and welcome back to operations
management

2
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,278
in our previous session's we've been
talking about capacity analysis

3
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:17,070
in other words we've been thinking
about what it takes to determine how

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,070
many units

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:23,698
a process can produce it generally comes
down to how much time you have available

6
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,179
for resource pool and how much time is
needed

7
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:30,689
and this session we're going to work
through a problem

8
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,399
it may be a little bit longer than some
of the other videos but please bear with

9
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:34,810
me

10
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:40,009
I involve I make things very very clear as
to how you approach a problem like this

11
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:44,339
here we have the LRDR  laundry company

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,610
this company provides a commercial
laundry service

13
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:50,850
to businesses whose employees wear
uniforms

14
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,010
approximately 10 percent of all loads are
considered heavy loads

15
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:58,219
the rest are considered normal a normal
load

16
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:01,780
takes 30 minutes in the washer and
eighty minutes in the dryer

17
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,009
a heavy load takes 45 minutes in the
washer

18
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:09,030
and 140 minutes in the dryer they have
two washers

19
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,180
and 4 dryers the washers and dryers
can run 22 hours a day seven days a week

20
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,420
the question is can they meet their weekly
demand of 500 loads

21
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:25,070
what we're going to do is we can to
parse out this particular problem

22
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:28,149
and identify all the key pieces of the

23
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:33,118
information to determine whether or not
we can meet the demand of 500 loads

24
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,228
here the grid

25
00:01:36,228 --> 00:01:41,269
that identifies the two resource pools
that we have we have the washer pool

26
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:45,200
and the dryer pool as you can see

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,579
we're going to be working with the amount
of it's needed to

28
00:01:48,578 --> 00:01:52,438
complete a load of laundry for both the
wash and the dryer

29
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:56,148
are also going to look at how much time
is available

30
00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:01,409
for each of the resources so now let's go
back to the original problem

31
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,899
and find the information that we need to
fill in this grid

32
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:09,840
in the problem they state

33
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,640
that they have two washers and 4
dryers the washers and dryers can run

34
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,219
22 hours a day seven days a week

35
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:22,030
so this is going to give us the
information on the available time

36
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,259
for the different resource pools the
washer

37
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:30,009
has 2 resource units in it cus there're
 two washers

38
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:33,039
each one runs 22 hours

39
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,539
a day now an hour is 60 minutes so

40
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,229
each one is running 1320 minutes

41
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:44,429
so there're 2 of them the total time
available per day

42
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,209
is 2640 minutes the dryer

43
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:53,390
is also running twenty-two hours a day
so each dryer runs

44
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:59,039
1,320 minutes but there are four units
in this resource pool

45
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,679
so there's a total of  5280

46
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:09,189
minutes available for dryer time
now go back and look at the problem to

47
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,000
find out how much time is needed

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,229
we're told that 10 percent of all loads 
are considered heavy

49
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:19,679
and the rest are considered normal a
normal load

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,060
takes 30 minutes in the washer and
eighty minutes in the dryer

51
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,580
whereas a heavy load takes 45 minutes
in the washer

52
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,140
and a hundred and forty minutes in the
dryer so

53
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:35,809
let's go put that in the grid as well
there's two forty-five minutes for the

54
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,229
washer for the heavy load and

55
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:42,060
140 minutes for the dryer 30 minutes for
the normal load

56
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,610
and 80-minute for the dryer for the normal
load

57
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,870
but now we have to create the average
unit load

58
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,140
this has to be a weighted average
because only ten percent

59
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:56,729
of the load are heavy and ninety
percent

60
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:01,329
are normal so I'll take 10 percent times
the heavy time

61
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,510
plus ninety percent times the normal
time

62
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:07,810
and add them together and that will give
us our weighted average

63
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,009
so on average a load

64
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:14,979
of laundry through the washer takes
31.5 minutes

65
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:18,209
and in the dryer it takes 86 minutes

66
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:21,720
to this is the time we need per load

67
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,420
and we have already calculated the
amount of time that we have available

68
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,140
so the next step is to just calculate
the number of loads per day

69
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:33,719
we have the load per day

70
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,030
equally the available time for the
washer which was two thousand four

71
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:39,559
hundred and sixty minutes

72
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,889
divided by 31.5 is 83.8

73
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:48,129
loads per day and the same thing with
the dryer the total time

74
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:51,689
5280 minutes divided by

75
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:55,170
86 minutes needed per load giving us

76
00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:02,170
61.4 loads per day now the question was
can we meet five hundred loads in a week

77
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,250
so if we know how many loads per day
we can

78
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,860
multiply it  by seven and determine the
number of loads per week

79
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,810
the washer can meet the commitment 586.7
loads can be done

80
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,750
through the washer in a week but the
dryer can't

81
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,220
the dryer can only do 429.8

82
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,290
so the overall capacity of the laundry
company

83
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:32,000
is only 429.8 loads per week

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,050
the dryer is our bottleneck it is what's
driving

85
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,710
our effective capacity for the process
so

86
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:44,779
the answer to your question can we meet
the demand to five hundred loads per

87
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:45,419
week

88
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,560
the answer is No now and the next
session

89
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,970
we'll talk about how we go about
determining how many

90
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:57,190
resources we need in order to meet their
demand

91
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:58,089
i'll see you then
