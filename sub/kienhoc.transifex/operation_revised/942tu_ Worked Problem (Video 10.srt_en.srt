00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,210
hello and welcome back to operations
management

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,838
in our last session we talked about
Little's law which is a very powerful

3
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,050
equation that shows the relationship
between inventory

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,620
throughput rate and flow time in this
session

5
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,939
we're going to take a very simple
problem and work through it

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:29,940
using Little's law here we have a simple
flow diagram

7
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,640
this is what's going on inside the
process

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,429
of a delicatessen people walk into the
deli

9
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:40,530
they wait on line they get served at the
counter

10
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,820
and then they leave so you can see first
of all

11
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,340
we have an arrow showing an input

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,469
into the process and we have people
coming

13
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:53,670
into the deli at a rate of 30 per hour

14
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,280
then they wait on line on average

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,079
there are eight people waiting that's
represented by the triangle

16
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,359
triangles represent buffers and buffers
represent units that are waiting

17
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:09,448
following that we have

18
00:01:09,448 --> 00:01:13,978
a rectangle and that's the activity of
somebody being served at the deli

19
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:14,650
counter

20
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,500
and on average that takes five minutes
so we bring it all together

21
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,188
we have on average 30 people per hour
coming into the deli

22
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:26,688
on average there are eight people
waiting on line

23
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:29,989
and then as they get up to the deli
counter

24
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:33,449
on average takes five minutes for them
to get to the deli counter

25
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,040
and then leave remember I'm using averages
here

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,340
that way we're not dealing with
individual fluctuations

27
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,780
and we also going to look at this as a
stable process

28
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,000
which means the input rate is going to
equal our output rate

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,280
30 people coming in per hour 30 people

30
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,478
per hour are meeting to the first thing
we want to double check is

31
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:58,769
what is our flow unit now

32
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:04,590
if you said people you'd be correct by a
flow unit this is what we are studying

33
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,180
as part of the process and you can see
that we're referring to people

34
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,039
in the buffer we're referring to people
as part of the throughput rate

35
00:02:13,038 --> 00:02:16,659
so

36
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:21,239
what can we do with Little's Law we're going
to be able to answer these kinds of

37
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:22,120
questions

38
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,020
how long does the average person wait on
line on average how many people are

39
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,370
being served at once

40
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,989
how many people are in the deli how long
does it take to get through the whole

41
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:34,200
line and service

42
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:37,829
we'll be able to answer these questions
with Little's law

43
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:43,050
so our first step is to take a look at
what kind of information we have if you

44
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,340
recall from a problem

45
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,709
we were given information at the waiting
line that there were

46
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,459
eight people there we're also told that
the throughput rate

47
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:56,259
is thirty people per hour at the
activity of being served at the deli

48
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:56,848
counter

49
00:02:56,848 --> 00:03:01,229
it takes five minutes on average we've
got a problem here

50
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:04,959
because the throughput rate is in units
per hour

51
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,939
but our flow time is in minute we have to make
sure that our flow time our 

52
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:11,699
throughput rate

53
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:16,060
have the same time units they don't have
the same time units

54
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,939
our equation will not work so what we're
going to do is we're going to add

55
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:20,939
another column

56
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:26,169
and in this column instead of just
having the throughput rate in units per

57
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:29,949
hour we're going to convert that over two
units per minute

58
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:35,500
so 30 per hour is the equivalent of
seeing a half a person per minute

59
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,009
so now we have all of units matching

60
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:43,609
we have people and we have time in
minutes

61
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:47,920
so now we're going to use Little's law

62
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,399
we're going to use it in two different
versions of the same equation

63
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,539
the way we first introduced it was I
equals

64
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:58,719
R times T inventory equals

65
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,009
throughput rate times flow time we can
use that

66
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:06,298
to calculate the inventory as long as we have
a throughput

67
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,709
rate and we have a flow time we can
figure out how many items are there

68
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:15,250
another way of using little's law is to
calculate the flow time

69
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,438
if you already have inventory and
the throughput rate

70
00:04:18,438 --> 00:04:21,779
so here we have T equals I divided by

71
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,978
R when we look at our table now

72
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:29,139
we can see that we have I and we have have
R

73
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:32,350
for the waiting line the buffer and we're
going to calculate

74
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,840
T so we're going to use the equation I
divided by R

75
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:41,409
for the activity of being served we had
the throughput rate

76
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,439
and we had the flow time so we're going to use
the equation in the

77
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,389
form of R times T to calculate the
inventory

78
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:54,150
so let's see how that comes out

79
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:57,189
so for the inventory being

80
00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:00,759
8 and our throughput rate being .5 we
ended up

81
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,759
realizing that flow time is 16 minutes

82
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:09,050
for the activity of being served the
inventory is two-and-a-half

83
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,620
then we can total everything up on
average there's

84
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:18,500
ten-and-a-half people in the deli and on
average it's taking 21 minutes to get

85
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,779
through the whole line

86
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:24,029
and being served so getting back to
original questions

87
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:28,349
now we have those answers how long on
average does the person wait on line

88
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,580
16 minutes how many people are being
served at once

89
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:36,439
two-and-a-half on average how many
people are in the deli

90
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:39,439
ten-and-a-half and how long does it take
to get through it

91
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:44,279
21 minutes don't be afraid when you see
half people or

92
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:47,489
quarter of people or things like that in your
answers remember

93
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:52,470
we're working with averages and averages
means you're not going to get whole

94
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,280
numbers all the time

95
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:00,750
so you can see the power of little's law and
even with this simple problem you can

96
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,439
see how this could relate to more
complicated problems

97
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:08,129
I'll be going through more complicated
problems and different ways of using the

98
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:09,879
little's law in our next session

99
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:10,430
I'll see you then
