Hello again and welcome back to Operations
Management.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,310
In this section, we are going to do the entire
problem on inventory.

00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:08,310
Hello again and welcome back to Operations
Management.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,310
In this section, we are going to do the entire
problem on inventory.

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,509
Up into this point, we have been doing inventory
in pieces

6
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:14,120
and we are going to pull it all together with
a single problem

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,160
Let’s see what we have
The M.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,470
M.
Pod Company is a retail chain that specializes

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,970
in camping equipment.
They carry a special tent designed for high

10
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,960
altitudes.
The demand is generally normally distributed

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,320
at 20 per week with a standard deviation of
3.

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,950
The store is open 52 weeks a year.
The cost of each tent is $150 and the holding

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,390
cost (including opportunity and physical holding)
is 15%.

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,440
The ordering cost is $55.
The lead time for receiving a shipment of

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,510
new tents is 6 weeks and is fairly constant.
They only want a 5% chance of a stockout

16
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,360
Now using this information, what we are going
to do

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,750
is calculate the optimal order quantity, the
safety stock, the reorder point,

18
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:11,180
the average inventory, and the average time
a unit spends in inventory

19
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,950
So we are going to take that problem
and we are going to take a look at the beginning

20
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,850
part of it
because the beginning part gives us basic

21
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,790
information to calculate the optimal order
quantity

22
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:28,240
We know that the demand is normally distributed
at 20 per week with a standard deviation of

23
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,590
3.
The store is open 52 weeks a year.

24
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,159
The cost of each tent is $150 and the holding
cost is 15%.

25
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:43,670
The ordering cost is $55
So we calculate the annual demand from 20

26
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,210
per week times 52 weeks a year.
We have 1040

27
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:54,790
Next we know the cost being $150
We have to calculate the holding cost.

28
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:03,270
That’s 15% times $150.
So the holding cost per unit per year is $22.

29
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,429
5
Our set-up or ordering cost is $55

30
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:15,049
So now with the particular variables in place,
we can use the EOQ equation: square root of

31
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:20,269
2RS over H.
We plug in the numbers and we determine that

32
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:24,769
our optimal order quantity is 71.
3 units

33
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:28,920
Now the next step is try to figure out what
the safety stock is

34
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,379
To do that, we have to piece together some
information.

35
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:37,829
We know that they only want a 5% chance of
a stock out.

36
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:42,090
We also know that the demand is normally distributed
at 20 per week

37
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:48,640
with a standard deviation of 3.
And the lead time is constant at 6 weeks.

38
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,150
Knowing that the lead time is constant we
only have to deal with the variability and

39
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,690
the demand
So we are going to calculate the lead time

40
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,109
demand
by taking the number of weeks it takes for

41
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:05,860
those tents to arrive,
which is 6, and multiplying it by 20 per week

42
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,420
that we use.
So the lead time demand is 120

43
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:15,720
Next we have to calculate the standard deviation
of the lead time demand.

44
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,150
The variability is only in the demand,
so we are going to take the square root of

45
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,569
the lead time
and multiply it by the standard deviation

46
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:27,489
of the demand.
So the square root of six is 2.

47
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:35,260
45, we multiply it by the standard deviation
of 3, and we get 7.

48
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,790
39
Our service level is the next thing we need

49
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,769
to calculate.
We know that we don’t want to have more

50
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:47,900
than 5% stock out.
So, to get the service level is 1 minus the

51
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,109
probability of stock out.
So we have 95% service level

52
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:56,319
From this, we can now calculate the safety
stock.

53
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:02,279
We need to figure out the z statistics associate
with 95% service level.

54
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:11,650
So using Excel/ we determine that it’s 1.645
So now calculating the safety stock z times

55
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:19,319
the standard deviation of the lead times demand,
give us 1.645 times 7.39

56
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:27,620
So the safety stock should be 12.09, but we
always have to round up to the next whole

57
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:34,581
unit, so it should be 13
So we have safety stock, we have lead time

58
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:42,270
demand, so now we can calculate our ROP point
We have the lead time demand of 120, a safety

59
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:47,990
stock of 13,
so when we get down to a total of 133 tents

60
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:55,460
in our inventory, that’s when we are going
to place their order

61
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:03,090
Calculating the average inventory, we take
Q over 2, which is the amount we order,

62
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,270
we divide in half, and then we add in the
safety stock

63
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,810
That’s because we never ever get down to
0 when we’re using safety stock

64
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:19,720
So now, our average inventory is ordering
amount which is 71.3 divided by 2, we add

65
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:27,740
13, so it’s 48.65
Now how long does this average spend in inventory,

66
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,099
well, this is where we use Little’s Law:
I equal R times T

67
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:37,199
We have value for the average inventory, which
we‘ve just calculated

68
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,720
We have value for the throughput, which is
the annual demand of 1040

69
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:51,720
So now we calculate the time in inventory
is I over R, which is .0478 years

70
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,310
But we have to convert that to week, so we
multiply it by 52 weeks.

71
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,009
So it’s 2.43
So we put it all together, and we are able

72
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:06,610
to answer all the questions from that basic
problem.

73
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,020
The next section is going to be talk about
what happens when we aggregate warehouses,

74
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:17,310
what happens if we bring inventory all together
instead of having them in separate places.

75
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,580
I will see you then
