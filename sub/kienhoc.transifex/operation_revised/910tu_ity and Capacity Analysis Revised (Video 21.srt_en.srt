00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,948
hello again and welcome back to operations
management

2
00:00:08,948 --> 00:00:12,318
in this session we're going to be
continuing our discussion of process

3
00:00:12,318 --> 00:00:13,259
capacity

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,268
but now we're going to be applying
profitability

5
00:00:16,268 --> 00:00:19,620
to the same kind of problems that we've
been doing with

6
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,009
process capacity we're going to be
continuing with

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,890
the example of the LRDR laundry
company

8
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:31,949
and but let's get started if you recall

9
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,429
the LRDR laundry company provides
commercial laundry service to businesses

10
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:36,959
whose

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,850
employees wear uniforms approximately 10
percent of all load are considered heavy

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,440
loads

13
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:47,119
the rest are considered normal a normal
load takes 30 minutes in the washer

14
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,899
and eighty minutes in the dryer a heavy
load takes 45 minutes in the washer

15
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,780
and 140 minutes in the dryer they have
two washers

16
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:01,558
and for dryers the washers and dryers
can run 22 hours a day seven days a week

17
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:04,680
the net profit for a heavy load

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,989
is five dollars and the net profit for

19
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:11,969
regular load is four dollars now it's
just

20
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:16,310
added some profit associated with

21
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,560
the same process capacity problem so
now

22
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,240
with that information we can determine
how much profit can be made in one week

23
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:32,819
using your current situation if you
recall

24
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:37,399
when we looked at the capacity of the
LRDR laundry company

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,280
we recognized that the dryer was the
bottleneck

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,359
that although the washer could

27
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:48,399
accomplish 586.7 loads per week

28
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,978
the dryer could only do 429 point

29
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:55,118
8 so the dryer was the bottleneck

30
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,739
and that drove the overall effective
capacity

31
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:05,109
for the entire process to be only 
429.8 loads per week

32
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:09,709
now using this information we can now
determine the profitability of the

33
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:10,319
company

34
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,680
we know the overall number of load

35
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,490
is 429.8 ten percent of them

36
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,780
are heavy loads so 10 percent of
29-point

37
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:28,110
8 is 42.9 if we multiply that by the
profit

38
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,160
per heavy load of five dollars and we

39
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:34,930
know that the profit from heavy loads in
a week

40
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:41,930
is 214 dollars and ninety cents ninety
percent of the loads are the regular normal

41
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:45,840
loads and that turns out to be 386.82

42
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,959
 loads so if we take

43
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,439
that number of load multiply it by the
four dollars per

44
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:58,280
regular load that we earn from the net
profit for a regular load

45
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,610
we end up with 1,547.28

46
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,340
dollars so the total profit in 
one week

47
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,120
the 10 percent heavy and 90 percent
regular

48
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,289
totals up to 1,762.18

49
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:17,750
dollars so that's what they
earn in one week

50
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,879
but now we have to consider

51
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,090
well which type of load is actually more
profitable for the company

52
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,530
should they be doing more heavy loads
should they be doing more normal loads

53
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,739
this is where we have to consider couple of
things

54
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:39,150
first we have to consider what the net
profit per load 

55
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,219
is I already have that information

56
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:46,609
we're told that the heavy load provides
us with a net profit of five dollars per

57
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,280
load

58
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,390
and the normal load gives us a net
profit of

59
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:55,238
four dollars but we also need to
consider

60
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:59,319
how many loads could be done using the
same

61
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:04,400
the same resources for the LRDR 
laundry company

62
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,060
how many heavy loads could be done if
that was the only thing that they did

63
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,430
or how many normal loads could be done 
if that was

64
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,859
only thing they did so let's take a look at that
let's separate it out

65
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:23,019
looking at the heavy loads themselves
and assuming that we didn't do

66
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:26,060
any normal load none whatsoever

67
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,379
we can calculate the number of loads per

68
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:32,639
week that heavy loads could bring us

69
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,350
so the washer says that resource pool

70
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,530
we could do 382.69 loads

71
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,449
but the dryer again is our bottleneck

72
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:48,029
we could only get 264 heavy load out in
a week

73
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:52,099
so the maximun loads per week if the only
thing we did

74
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:58,180
was heavy load is 264 we multiply that
by the profit for the heavy loads

75
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,990
and if the only thing we did was heavy
load

76
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,410
we could earn $1320

77
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:10,430
now let's see what would happen if we take 
a look at the regular load

78
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,459
now with a regular

79
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:17,939
load the washer says we could do 574

80
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:22,069
loads per week the dryer again is our
bottleneck

81
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:25,949
it doesn't always have to be that way but
in this case it is

82
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:31,269
dryers the bottleneck only being able to
produce 462 loads

83
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:34,519
so a maximum loads per week is 462

84
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:38,659
if we multiply that by the four dollars
per load

85
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,500
we could earned 1848

86
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,019
dollars in a week so let's compare
these two

87
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:51,629
which type of laundry load is more
profitable for the company

88
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:56,519
well if we only did heavy loads we could
earn one thousand three hundred and

89
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,569
twenty dollars

90
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:00,879
but if we only did regular loads

91
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,180
we could earn 1840 

92
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,939
dollars

93
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:10,839
so although individually heavy loads
have a higher net profit

94
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:13,909
when you think about the capacity

95
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,360
it's being constrained by the capacity
of the process

96
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,699
you can actually complete more regular
loads and

97
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:24,449
end up with the higher profit so that's
something

98
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:28,069
very important to consider when you're
looking

99
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:32,399
at trying to market your particular
organization

100
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,500
or if you trying to think about the
operations as a whole

101
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,100
just the net profit per

102
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,080
item is not enough you also have to
consider the capacity

103
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,949
that brings us to the end of

104
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,930
the capacity analysis section of
operations management

105
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,660
and we will be moving into inventory next time
I'll see you then
