00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,240
hello again and welcome back operations
management

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,919
in our last session we're talking about
process capacity

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,609
in this session we'll be talking about
effective capacity

4
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:18,839
effective capacity tells us that

5
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:24,519
for our existing process how many units
we can actually get out of that process

6
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:25,059
per

7
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:29,009
period of time so let's take a look at
this

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,840
we're trying to figure out how many
units the process can produce

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,829
so  another question we have is are we
able to meet our customer demand

10
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,460
how can we increase the number of units
if we need to

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,039
and the big question are do we have
enough resources

12
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,070
and are those resources in the right
places if you recall when we look at

13
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,840
the basics of a process we have inputs
being transformed to

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,030
output but in order to have that happen

15
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,039
we have to have resources so with

16
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,300
effective capacity we're gonna be taking
a harder look at those resources

17
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:08,590
to do that we have to get through a
little bit of terminology

18
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,010
we're gonna start with something called
a resource unit

19
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,670
a unit within a resource pool not very
clear

20
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,150
but if we think about a laundromat and

21
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,750
we think about doing laundry and there's
a big pile of washing machines

22
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,310
well that big pile of washing machines
can be considered

23
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,969
a resource pool a collection of
interchangeable

24
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:35,170
resources that perform an identical set
of activities

25
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:40,240
in this case washing clothing so an
individual washer

26
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:45,810
would be a unit within that resource
pool resource pooling says we're going

27
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,090
to be able to combine

28
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,299
separate different pools into a single
flexible pool

29
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:55,530
so our terminology says we have an
individual resource unit

30
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,950
and that unit belongs to a resource pool

31
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,000
we also need to know

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,609
for that individual unit how long it
needs

33
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:08,908
to process a flow unit so for example

34
00:02:08,908 --> 00:02:12,270
a washing machine may take 30 minutes to
process

35
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:15,318
a load of wash so that is the 

36
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:19,829
average amount of time required by the
resource unit to process

37
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,629
a flow unit so the effective capacity
of the unit which is the

38
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:29,500
inverse of the unit load is if we have 30
minutes per load of wash

39
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,568
that means we can get 2 loads done
in an hour

40
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:36,060
right so we have the time we take the
inverse

41
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,489
and we have the effective capacity now

42
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:43,939
we have a bunch of washers together that
means the effective capacity

43
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:47,199
in that of all those washers combined

44
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,848
so it's not just how long it takes one
individual to wash

45
00:02:51,848 --> 00:02:55,039
and says we can get 2 done per hour

46
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,729
if we work bunch of them it's 2 per washing
machine

47
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:02,929
per hour so that's the effective capacity of
the resource pool

48
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,790
what I'd like to do next is use a very
very simple example

49
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:12,979
just using one resource pool I'm walking
through calculating that effective

50
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:18,979
capacity let's say we have a teacher who
takes 10 minutes to grade a paper

51
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:23,009
and that teacher has available time of
three hours a day

52
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:26,199
what is the effective capacity of the
teacher

53
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:30,060
so let's say the resource pool is the
teacher

54
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,699
and in this case we have one teacher and
it takes that teacher

55
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:37,759
10 minutes to grade a paper that's our unit
load

56
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,639
and our available time is three hours
per day

57
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,829
we have a total of 180 minutes


58
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:49,409
per day to grade papers so this is our
available time

59
00:03:49,408 --> 00:03:53,128
180 minutes it takes 10 minutes per
paper

60
00:03:53,128 --> 00:03:57,188
so our effective capacity is 18 papers
per day

61
00:03:57,188 --> 00:04:02,900
that's it we only have one resource in
our resource pools so our effective

62
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,819
capacity is 18 per day

63
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:07,839
now let's see what happens if we change
the number of

64
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,400
resources when we change the number

65
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,459
resources we still have the
resource pool of teacher

66
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,649
and the unit load hasn't changed
either and the individual available time

67
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:20,629
per teacher

68
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:24,370
that also hasn't changed but now we have

69
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,850
three resources so our effective
capacity has

70
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,970
actually tripled we now have

71
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,139
3 resources instead of one so instead

72
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:41,009
18 papers per day we now have 54 papers
per day

73
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:44,680
that's all it takes when we're thinking
about effective capacity

74
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,949
for a resource we take how much time we
have available

75
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:55,340
for all the resources in the pool and we're going
to be dividing it up by the unit load

76
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:59,359
and that gives us our effective capacity

77
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,970
now that was an example with just a
single resource pool

78
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,860
but in most cases we have multiple
resource pools for particular

79
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,280
process

80
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:11,599
so what we do have to deal with is
something called the bottleneck

81
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,990
and the bottleneck tells us that it's
the slowest resource pool

82
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:21,680
up the entire process and that drives
the effective capacity of the process

83
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,879
this will be a lot clearer when we do a
larger example

84
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:28,889
and that's what we'll be doing next time
we're gonna take the

85
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:32,069
effective capacity and do a step-by-step
example

86
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:34,990
using more than one resource pool. I'll see you then.
