00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,870
hello again and welcome back operations
management

2
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,449
in the previous session we started
talking about Six Sigma

3
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:17,039
and the different tools of quality that we
can use to analyze processes

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,109
in the first of these tools we gonna be
talking about

5
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:24,608
check sheets check sheets are very very
simple

6
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:28,150
it's a structured way of collecting data
and it's particularly

7
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:31,879
easy to use a check sheet for high
frequency data

8
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:35,979
it doesn't take long to learn how to use
it and most people can use them

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,020
very easily let's see a couple of these check
sheets look like

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,620
and the one on top here we happy human
resource department that is collecting

11
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:46,589
information

12
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,690
about what kinds of questions they
receive on a daily basis

13
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:54,869
so on the left hand side there's
questions regarding health insurance

14
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:56,269
disability insurance

15
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:00,239
sick time and so forth and then they
check it by day

16
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,049
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and
Friday so

17
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,890
within a week you can immediately see
that the most frequent question is paid

18
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,939
time off with the high value of
forty-seven

19
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:15,059
and the least frequent is about payroll

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,150
errors when we look to the wine on the
bottom left we're looking at

21
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,859
defect types in which case we can't have

22
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:27,030
rusted supplies misaligned welds

23
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,478
and so forth and we're counting what is wrong

24
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,769
these are particularly defects that
we are noticing in manufacturing then

25
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:36,950
when we look at

26
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,469
another one on the right hand side on
the bottom this one is the

27
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:44,170
value of waiting the traffic for model
homes

28
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,329
what is causing people to come into a
model home

29
00:01:47,328 --> 00:01:49,679
whether it's a newspaper ads

30
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,200
a website road signage and so forth so

31
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,420
these things that are happening with the
check sheet is that we are collecting

32
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,159
information so that we can do further
analysis

33
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:08,158
for it so when we develop a check sheet
the first thing we need to know is

34
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:12,930
what data are we trying to collect are
we trying to collect information about

35
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,129
defects or problems

36
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:20,159
we're trying to collect information
about questions people have

37
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,180
so check sheet could be used in all different
areas

38
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,409
of an organization when we define the
categories

39
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:32,189
we have to be extremely specific with
regard to no overlap

40
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:35,769
what I mean by this that if you have

41
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:39,019
five different people and they're
confronted with the same

42
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:43,459
information they would put the check in
the exact same

43
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:47,420
category there wouldn't be any confusion as
to 

44
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:53,139
which category this check should be so if
we say that there's a bad well

45
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:58,078
we have to say that a bad weld would look like
a particular thing

46
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:01,329
so that everybody agrees that this is a
bad weld

47
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:05,760
we say low pressure we would have to
have a specific

48
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,229
amount of pressure that would indicate
it's being low

49
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:12,889
to everybody agrees as to what these
categories are

50
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:18,018
and  we train all the users said that
they all know how to use this check sheet

51
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:22,730
and that's it that's the simplest way of
collecting information

52
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:26,048
you develop check sheet you train your
users

53
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:30,620
and then you go ahead and use it and we
collect a lot of information this way

54
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,730
and you'll see most organizations use it
 in the next section

55
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:39,179
we're gonna be talking about scatter
diagrams going to be looking at whether

56
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:39,549
there's

57
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:43,329
two variables that actually have some
relationship to each other

58
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:43,939
I'll see you then.
