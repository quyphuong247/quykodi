00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,500
welcome back to the operations management in
today's session we're gonna be talking

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,330
about the relationship between process
strategy

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,129
and process architecture and by
architecture

4
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:19,410
I'm referring to how the process is
designed

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:26,009
from start to finish before we can
actually developing architecture we have

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,310
to go back and take a look at what kinda
competencies are needed in the process

7
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:34,518
and if you recall those process
competencies are related directly back

8
00:00:34,518 --> 00:00:35,259
to

9
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,439
the product which of course relates back
to new organization strategy

10
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:44,709
what kind of products for developing
then we take this attribute to the

11
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,850
products and figure out what kind of
process competencies are needed

12
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:53,189
so we're looking at do we have to have a
low-cost process

13
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:57,929
does it have to be done quickly do we
have to allow for flexibility

14
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:01,899
and the level of quality we're trying to
build into this process

15
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:05,099
that process architecture

16
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,530
will help us determine those process
competencies

17
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,329
we can do this process competencies
with different kinds of architectures

18
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:17,908
we gonna talk specifically about two
different architectures

19
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,609
one of them is the job shop and the
other one is the flow shop

20
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:24,849
beginning with the job shop

21
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:29,219
world looking at an architecture that
allows for flexible

22
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:34,118
resources we're using equipment that can
be used for a variety of purposes

23
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:37,709
different kinds products it's a
general-purpose

24
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:42,530
organization so that we can make
different kinds of products we can make

25
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,109
changes to

26
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:48,250
products and so forth its also known as
the functional or process

27
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,310
layout if you think back to the

28
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,250
operations frontier you'll notice that
there were trade-offs

29
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,769
if we use a job shop structure we're

30
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:02,908
trying to achieve flexible resources

31
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,380
we're gaining flexibility but at the same
time

32
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:09,478
we're going to lose cost-effectiveness

33
00:02:09,478 --> 00:02:13,219
we're going to lose on process flow time

34
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:16,580
so what characterizes a job shop

35
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,319
is high process flexibility by high
costs

36
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,419
and long flow times the other end of the
spectrum

37
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:29,729
is the flow shop this flow shop is
designed specifically for particular

38
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:31,009
type of product

39
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:34,568
and this is what many people think of
when they think of an

40
00:02:34,568 --> 00:02:37,878
assembly-line their specialized
resources

41
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:41,199
that perform specific tasks for

42
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,759
that particular product one product goes
to the assembly line

43
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,259
don't have another product doing that
that's why

44
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:54,269
also known as the product layout so
again when we're thinking about that

45
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:55,879
operations frontier

46
00:02:55,878 --> 00:02:59,280
we have specialized resources we're
giving up

47
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,669
flexibility in order to have higher cost
effectiveness

48
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:08,559
and also a much shorter process flow
time between these two

49
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,709
the job shop and the flow shop have something
called a batch

50
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:16,050
shop were ticked aspects of these
kinds of architectures

51
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,340
when we compare them across

52
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,759
the different kinds of attributes of that
process design

53
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,719
whether its products volume whether their use
of specialized equipment product variety

54
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:34,259
the machine setup frequency what kind of
labor skills are needed in the variables

55
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:35,000
cost

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,739
you can see that with a job shop we
give up

57
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:44,349
product value we can't make a lot of it
because we don't have specialized

58
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:45,060
equipment

59
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,989
but we are be able to make a lot of
different kinds of product

60
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:52,590
but because of that every time we make a
different product

61
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,920
we have to keep setting up  machines so
we have

62
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,149
a very high frequency on machine setup
and because

63
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,500
the machines are more general-purpose
the

64
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,598
employees that work on those machines
have to be very skilled

65
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,839
because they have to be up to know how
to make a variety of different products

66
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,430
and as a result result the variable cost
as high as well

67
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,450
for the flow shop we're going to get a
lot of items

68
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:24,009
out because we have specialized
equipment but that means

69
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:29,229
while making one product we cannot have a
lot of variety to it

70
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:32,449
it also means that we don't set up the
machines frequently because

71
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:36,590
all of the equipment is designed for a
particular product

72
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:41,089
and because of that we don't need very
highly skilled employees

73
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:44,439
because they only have to know how to
work that machine for that particular

74
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,370
product

75
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,949
which also means a variable cost gets
lowered

76
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,520
and between the two batch shop well we
can make

77
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:57,299
some product we use some specialized
equipment we allow for a little variety

78
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,960
and so forth

79
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,888
so you can see that our falls between them 
so depending on what kind of product we're

80
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:05,660
trying to design

81
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,750
we have the process competencies we're
trying to achieve

82
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,430
we have to match the architecture to it

83
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,889
next time when we talk we gonna be
discussing

84
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:19,650
the operational on it and that is we'll
verify

85
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:23,099
what is going on in our operations
wether it can meet

86
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,750
our strategy for the organization as a
whole

87
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,180
see you then
