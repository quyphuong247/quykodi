00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,370
hello in this session about operations
management we're going to be talking

2
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,359
about process strategy

3
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:15,710
and something known as the operations
frontier

4
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,910
beginning with process strategy

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,960
we have to first look at the corporate
strategy

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,269
the overall strategy for the
organization if you're looking at a very

7
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:28,719
large company

8
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,879
something let's say like it to ponder
Boeing you noticed they have

9
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:36,460
a very large corporation with special

10
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,660
business underneath for example with
Boeing

11
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:43,919
they make commercial aircraft they make
defense & space products they have

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,899
electronics

13
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:49,250
each of those are considered business
unit underneath that whole corporate

14
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,009
structure

15
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:55,780
those business units have particular
products and services that they make

16
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,730
and therefore they have to have
particular process competencies

17
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:05,500
to meet the product actually cutes I
love the products and services that they

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,859
produce so how do we decide

19
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:15,079
what process competencies are needed and
our last session we talked about product

20
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:18,590
attributes and how they're related to
process competencies

21
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,810
but you cannot have the best of

22
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:27,728
every single attribute at all times you
can not have the fastest to the customer

23
00:01:27,728 --> 00:01:30,129
with the highest possible quality

24
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:34,618
with the lowest-cost providing the
greatest customization

25
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:37,890
you can't be all things at all times

26
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,560
instead what you have are trade-offs
between those product attributes

27
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,868
and as a result you'll have trade-offs
between

28
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:49,978
process competencies based on what

29
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:54,170
the organization is trying to achieve in
their products or services

30
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:58,340
that's how we decide what process
competencies to pursue

31
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,228
this is explained in the operations
frontier

32
00:02:02,228 --> 00:02:05,679
it shows graphically the trade-offs between

33
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,110
2 product attributes to process
competencies

34
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,740
for example the trade-off between cost
effectiveness

35
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,049
and quality were flexibility and
cost-effectiveness

36
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:23,959
so why don't we take a look  at that 
the frontier is characterized by

37
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:27,098
an axis: an x-axis and a y-axis

38
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:30,689
within attribute on either one or
competency

39
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:33,979
on each one in this case we're going to
compare

40
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:37,000
process flexibility which is on the
y-axis

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,110
with cost effectiveness on the x-axis

42
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,519
there's a curved line that represents
the frontier

43
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,140
along that curve line you see that there
are trade-offs

44
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:52,229
if you very high in flexibility

45
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:56,159
you're going to be very low in your
cost-effectiveness

46
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,189
if you can be very high
cost-effectiveness

47
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:03,769
you are going to be low in the process
flexibility so here we are

48
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:07,050
right at the top we are the best process

49
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,680
possible that is flexible but not
cost-effective

50
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,120
down at the bottom if we on

51
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,469
that part of the curve we're at the best
process that is cost-effective

52
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:21,989
but not flexible everywhere along that

53
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:25,400
curve was showing the best possible
process

54
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,010
with those particular trade-offs if we're

55
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:32,429
inside the curve that means we're nowhere

56
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,930
that means that there are organizations
out there that are

57
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,790
better that us for that level of
cost-effectiveness

58
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:43,829
they're better and flexibility

59
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,469
well for that level flexibility they're
better cost-effectiveness

60
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:52,500
so we know that we need to work on our
processes to move closer

61
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,949
to the edge of that frontier we take a
look at specific example

62
00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:02,839
we take a look at hospitals on one side
we have cost efficiency

63
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,420
the x-axis and the other side we have
flexibility

64
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:12,048
the y-axis at the top a world-class
emergency room has to deal with

65
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:16,279
a lot of different kinds of traumas they
never know what's going to come in

66
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,098
so they have to be extremely flexible
they have to be able to deal with

67
00:04:20,098 --> 00:04:24,358
every kind emergency that arrive at that
hospital

68
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:28,198
but as a result they give up cost
efficiency

69
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,090
on the other hand if they're very very
cost-effective

70
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:35,728
we could have a world-class non-emergency
hospital

71
00:04:35,728 --> 00:04:40,629
this hospital knows in general what
kinds of patience is going to come into

72
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:41,759
this hospital

73
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,520
and so they can plan on it they don't
have to be very flexible

74
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,709
because they know the general
classifications of

75
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:52,779
the kinds of injury or
illnesses that will come to that

76
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:54,359
hospital

77
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,660
so all along that frontier are

78
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,320
best in class hospitals with varying
degrees of

79
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:06,639
flexibility and cost efficiency if
they're inside that frontier

80
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,460
then they know that they need to get
better

81
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:15,049
they have to have an improvement in
their processes to make them even

82
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,650
more cost-efficient

83
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,728
or flexible

84
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:24,288
so bring this all together the
operations frontier

85
00:05:24,288 --> 00:05:28,209
issuing the trade-off between
competencies deciding what those

86
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:29,258
competencies

87
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:34,050
are that you want to have has to go back
to the product attribute

88
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,740
which then again goes back to the
overall strategy of the organization

89
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,829
what they want to produce

90
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:46,529
and our next session we're gonna talk
about how the structure of your process

91
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:50,439
Impacts the process competencies that
you're able to achieve

92
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:50,910
well see you then
