00:00:06,078 --> 00:00:09,259
hello again and welcome back to operations
management

2
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:13,019
we're continuing with our talk on
inventory

3
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,349
in our last session we did the turtle
annual cost equation

4
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:21,019
and this one we're going to be looking
at EOQ

5
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:26,559
the economic order quantity if you
recall from last session we had that

6
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:27,739
total cost

7
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:31,409
equation and that referred to cost over
a year

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,750
EOQ is going to minimize that
cost

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,960
so we're going to take that total annual
cost

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,539
we're gonna try and find a way to make it
the smallest

11
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:44,619
amount over a year EOQ

12
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:48,878
is the starting point for inventory
analysis we use

13
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,409
certain assumptions they are not very
realistic

14
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:55,628
but they are a way to give us a starting
point

15
00:00:55,628 --> 00:00:59,729
so those assumptions include that the
demand is known

16
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:04,919
its constant which means we never have
fluctuations

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,319
we know exactly how much we are going to
be using

18
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,510
at any given time the lead time is known
and constant

19
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,299
which means from the time we place an
order to the time we get it

20
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:19,770
we know exactly how long it's going to
take.

21
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:22,929
and that never changes either and when we

22
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,159
get the inventory we get it all at once

23
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,650
we never get partial orders so there's
never any problems with it

24
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,140
so these are key assumptions with the EU
Q equation

25
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,290
admittedly they're not very realistic
but it is a starting point for analyzing

26
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,100
inventory

27
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:43,349
so when we look at the EOQ model

28
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:47,000
you notice it is a saw-tooth if you take a
look

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,489
right up here we have the order
quantity:

30
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:55,188
Q when we place an order this is the
amount that we're ordering

31
00:01:55,188 --> 00:02:00,578
and that overtime because our our demand
rate is constant

32
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:06,758
its has a slope down so looking at that
secondary you can see how there's a very

33
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,240
smooth line going from the top

34
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,149
point down to 0 which means our

35
00:02:13,149 --> 00:02:16,800
average inventory is going to be Q
over 2

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,480
we takin the highest amount which is
the amount we

37
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:25,299
order which is Q our lowest amount is 0

38
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,390
and we average 2 of them and that's
how we get

39
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:34,549
Q over 2 now when we take a look at the
total cost equation

40
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:39,140
we notice a couple of things one is the
setup cost which is the

41
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:43,589
ordering cost is a curved line starting
very high

42
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,930
and it flattens out and it gets lower and
lower

43
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,230
that's because we're spreading the cost
of

44
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:54,268
ordering depending on how many items we
are ordering at 

45
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:57,430
once if we're only going to order

46
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:02,069
five times a year it's going to cost
more

47
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:05,859
than if we order three times a year

48
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,190
or one time a year so the more times we

49
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,560
order the costs go up so if there is more

50
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,060
in the order we don't have to orders
many times

51
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,680
so that that's how that curve goes down
the second line the holding cost

52
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,510
well the more we hold on to at any given
time our cost is going to increase

53
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:30,959
that's why that one is heading upwards
we bring the two of those together

54
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,199
along with the cost to the product
itself we have a total cost

55
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,699
and that is another curve there bringing
the two together

56
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:44,209
something interesting happens if you
notice that the lowest point of that

57
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:45,689
total cost curve

58
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:49,079
is at the same point where the ordering
cost

59
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,719
is equal to the holding cost so

60
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,979
when that happens we can actually
calculate that value for Q

61
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:01,329
to find out what that quantity

62
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:06,760
is to minimize the total cost all we
have to do is set the ordering cost

63
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:10,539
equal to the holding cost and that's
what we're doing here

64
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:14,628
we take a set-up costs which is the
ordering costs

65
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:18,429
we set it equal to the annual holding
cost and

66
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,199
we just do some basic algebra to
determine

67
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,239
the quantity now we end up with a
quantity

68
00:04:25,238 --> 00:04:28,849
equalling the square root of 2 
times

69
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,120
R which is your annual demand and
your throughput rate

70
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,790
times S which is your set up cost divided
a by a holding cost

71
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:43,550
we use asterisk next Q indicate that
we got this value

72
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,168
by using the economic order quantity
calculation

73
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:51,689
so what does this really mean let's do a
quick example

74
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:55,279
and you'll see let's say

75
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:00,539
we purchase batteries from a
supplier for unit cost of ten dollars

76
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:05,509
and we make smoke detectors on average
we gonna use 54,400

77
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:10,360
batteries each year and every time we
place an order

78
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,710
we have a big ordering cost of a
thousand dollars

79
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:18,359
whether we order one battery or
whether we order a hundred batteries

80
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,189
or 2 thousand batteries it's still going to be
a thousand dollars

81
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:27,310
every time we place an order our cost of
capitalist is 10 percent per year

82
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,500
and our cost of holding is seven percent
of the unit cost per year

83
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,870
so now how many battery should be
purchased

84
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:39,459
at a time so in other words what is your
quantity when we place that order

85
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:42,529
then also what is your total annual
ordering cost

86
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:46,288
holding cost and the total cost

87
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:50,379
let's step through this your key
variables

88
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:54,538
C the cost per unit ten dollars

89
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:58,300
R the annual demand or annual throughput
rate

90
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,560
is fifty four thousand four hundred S

91
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,889
our set up cost every time we place that
order is a thousand dollars

92
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:10,019
and we need H which is the overall
holding cost

93
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:13,639
so we're gonna take our physical holding
cost

94
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,360
and our cost of capital and multiply it by a
cost per unit

95
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,259
and we get a capital H equalling one
point seven dollars

96
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:26,960
now let's plug that into the EOQ
equation

97
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,180
there it is we put everything in

98
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,550
now we have to square it of 2RS over H

99
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,009
and we come up with 8,000 we should
order

100
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:41,160
8 thousand batteries at a time

101
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,740
so what is our total set up cost

102
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,960
S times R over Q  $6800


103
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:54,870
our total holding costs

104
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,038
six thousand eight hundred dollars as
well

105
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:02,300
which should not be a surprise because
we calculated

106
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,870
the minimum cost at the point where the
holding cost was

107
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,240
equal to the setup cost so those two
numbers

108
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,949
should be the same when we're using the
economic order quantity

109
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:20,848
now lastly our total annual cost says
we're going to take our setup costs

110
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:25,089
holding costs and our unit costs

111
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:28,109
and add them all together and we end up
with

112
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,620
$557,600 

113
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,288
so that's how we use economic order
quantity

114
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,500
key things to remember our first of all

115
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,399
it's an idealized situation we know
everything

116
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,620
demand leadtime we never get partial
orders

117
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,000
and when we calculate the EOQ 
annual setup cost

118
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,579
will equal our annual holding costs

119
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:58,620
now we're gonna make some changes to
this equation in our next session 

120
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,160
I'll see you then
