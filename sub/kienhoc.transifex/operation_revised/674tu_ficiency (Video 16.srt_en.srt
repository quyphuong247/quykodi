00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,199
hello again and welcome back operations
management

2
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,298
in this session we're gonna be talking
about process efficiency

3
00:00:12,298 --> 00:00:17,380
in the last couple of sessions we've been
looking at critical path

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,089
and following the activities of a
process from start to finish

5
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:24,589
so we now know how long a process will
take

6
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:28,500
the next step is trying to make that
process better

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,528
so need to do is we need to identify

8
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:35,698
the activities on that process that
maybe we can improve

9
00:00:35,698 --> 00:00:41,770
so how do we go about doing that
starting with the same example that

10
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,410
we've been using for the past couple of
sessions

11
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:48,578
this is the cleaning of an office we
know that there are six activities

12
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:49,480
involved

13
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:54,699
and in the last session and the one
before we were looking at specific

14
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,199
activity times

15
00:00:56,198 --> 00:00:59,219
these are activity times that

16
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,349
actually takes to perform the task when
we had people at the field

17
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:08,340
doing the cleaning up in office we
monitor them and we figure out

18
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,600
how long it takes to pick up the cups
how long it takes to dust

19
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:17,089
the surfaces and so forth this is the actual
activity time

20
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,200
now in a perfect world

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,500
where all the resources are immediately
available

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,989
nothing is waiting for anything we have
a theoretical time

23
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:33,019
so an activity A in reality it takes
fifty-five seconds

24
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:37,298
but in an absolute perfect world it may
only take forty seconds

25
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:40,860
activity B perfect world

26
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:44,569
240 seconds when the real world it takes

27
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:49,459
300 seconds so you can see there is a
difference between

28
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:53,688
the theoretical time and the actual
activity time

29
00:01:53,688 --> 00:01:57,048
so again

30
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:01,729
which activity do we focus on to try and
improve the process

31
00:02:01,728 --> 00:02:07,269
What we're going to do is we're going to be taking
a look at each of these activities

32
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:11,639
and their actual time and theoretical
time

33
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:14,689
and we're going to calculate the efficiency

34
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:19,189
we do that by taking a theoretical time

35
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:23,459
and dividing it by the actual time and
converting it to a percentage

36
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,830
so if you recall we had our

37
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,160
chart here whether actual activity time
and theoretical time

38
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,098
and now we have a column for efficiency
activity

39
00:02:36,098 --> 00:02:40,589
A we take our forty seconds which is in
the ideal world

40
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,409
and divided by 55 seconds which is
reality

41
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:48,579
and we come up with an efficiency of 72.7
percent

42
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,310
we do that for each of the activities in
the process

43
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,378
as you can see some activities are fairly

44
00:02:56,378 --> 00:03:01,549
efficient such is the dusting process
it's an 80 percent efficient process

45
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,930
activity but empty the trash can

46
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,590
that's only 50 percent efficent so still

47
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,689
how do we decide which activity to
target for improvement

48
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:16,239
efficiency by itself is not enough

49
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,750
we need to take a look at the actual

50
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,878
flow diagram if you recall

51
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,079
there were three paths through this
process ABEF

52
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,510
ACEF and  ADF


53
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:33,348
I calculated the longest path

54
00:03:33,348 --> 00:03:36,568
ADF at 455 seconds

55
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:41,089
and that was the critical path so

56
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,729
if we go and we actually try and improve
activity

57
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:51,209
E because it's only 50 percent efficient
it's not going to have an impact on the

58
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:52,060
critical path

59
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:58,890
we can improve activity E but the process
will still take 450 five seconds

60
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:03,139
the next one Sanitize 61 percent
efficient

61
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:07,238
again we can improve that but it still
will not

62
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:11,700
impact the overall process club so we
need to do

63
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:15,060
is identify the activity that has

64
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,408
the lowest efficiency but is on the
critical path

65
00:04:19,408 --> 00:04:22,750
that's the one we're going to take a
look at first

66
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,769
so in this case it's activity F sanitized
doorknob

67
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:31,870
even if we improve the efficiency just a
little bit

68
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,970
and that it takes only 39 seconds to 30
eight seconds

69
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:42,550
it will have direct impact on the
overall time for the process

70
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:47,319
so now what we've done is we'd analyze
processes

71
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:52,279
wave figured out the critical path I've
also look at how to identify

72
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:57,879
the activities with any process that are
targeted for improvement

73
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:01,310
our next series  of sessions

74
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,439
will be involving capacities analysis

75
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:09,050
make sure that we have enough resources
in order to support the process

76
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:09,639
I see it then
