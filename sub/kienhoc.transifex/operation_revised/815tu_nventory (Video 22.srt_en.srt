00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,359
hello again and welcome back to operations
management

2
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:11,628
in this lecture we are going to be
talking about inventory

3
00:00:11,628 --> 00:00:15,879
we're gonna start with just a brief
introduction as to what

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,849
is inventory and the kinds of inventory:
as well as the costs associated with

5
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:21,710
inventory

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,789
beginning with the types of inventory

7
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:29,900
we know that there're different kinds of
inventory out there

8
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:34,689
the first is input inventory when you're
thinking about a process

9
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:37,738
and you're looking at the items are
going into the process

10
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:41,629
that's your input inventory if it's
sitting and waiting

11
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:45,120
at the beginning of a process that's your
input inventory

12
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,479
when it's in the process and it emits
div activities or between activities

13
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:51,898
inside the process

14
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,910
that our in process inventory most

15
00:00:55,909 --> 00:01:00,119
of commonly known as work in process or
work in progress

16
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:03,349
and the output inventory are

17
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,300
items that have been completed but have
not left the barrier

18
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:11,219
of the process you know we haven't
shipped it out of the process

19
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:16,170
to the next process so these are the
three kinds of inventory that we have

20
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,810
and when we add them together that's the total
inventory for process

21
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,390
we know from Little's Law

22
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,868
that our average inventory equals to
average throughput rate

23
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:33,540
times our average flow time we also
know that there is a certain amount of

24
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,479
inventory that is needed

25
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:40,908
for any particular process but why do we
use inventory

26
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:45,329
well processes can have

27
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:48,759
fluctuations so by having buffers

28
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:52,868
inventory is a buffer it allows

29
00:01:52,868 --> 00:01:56,239
one process to be slightly separated from
another

30
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,560
so if one process is running quickly and
there's inventory

31
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,460
it can continue running if there's
another process is running slowly

32
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,509
we can allow inventory to build-up so what
happens is that

33
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,459
we have buffer that separate each of
these processes from each other

34
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:20,459
as well as from the external environment
when we actually think about inventory

35
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,090
we think about using it for four major
reasons

36
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:29,700
one is economies of scale by using
inventory

37
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:32,729
to allow us to build up production

38
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:36,939
or increase capacity we can spread fixed
cost

39
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:41,889
over a large production quantity if you
think about when you're buying a screen

40
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:42,909
printed shirt

41
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:46,068
no matter how many other item you buy

42
00:02:46,068 --> 00:02:50,030
there is a cost to have the screen
printing done

43
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,769
to actually designed the print whether you
buy one

44
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:57,140
t-shirt 5 t-shirts a hundred t-shirts

45
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:00,299
there's one fixed cost so for

46
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,159
able to spread that fixed cost over a
hundred T-shirts

47
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,158
the individual cost per t-shirt

48
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,199
goes down that we mean by spreading fix
costs

49
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:17,539
over the large production quantity for
production capacity smoothing

50
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:21,919
we know that demand fluctuates it is
never ever

51
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,568
absolutely constant but we don't wanna
keep hiring

52
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:30,708
or laying off people we don't wanna
have to keep running second shifts

53
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:34,209
third shifts for production it's very

54
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:37,439
hmm not very efficient to do that

55
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,519
and so what we do is we use inventory

56
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:43,569
to smooth that out we allow inventory to

57
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:47,798
increase and decrease when demand
fluctuates

58
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:53,219
for example when we considered the whole
holiday season in December

59
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:58,469
there are some products don't have a lot
of demand throughout the year

60
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:02,019
but have a very large demand in November
and December

61
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:05,469
one way of handling that is to have

62
00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:09,639
a smooth production all throughout the
year

63
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:15,268
allowing inventory to build up so that
we can meet that demand in November and

64
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:15,980
December

65
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:19,199
the third way we use inventory

66
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,750
is to prevent shortages that's what's
known as stock out protection

67
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,430
we use safety stock this is extra

68
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,939
inventory to prevent us from running out

69
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:36,019
said that week can't disappoint our
customers and so we don't have to stop a

70
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:37,698
process

71
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:41,590
and the last way we look at inventory
is for price speculation

72
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:45,849
if we think that the price of a product
that we use is gonna go up

73
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:52,850
we may buy more a bit now to prevent a
cost later on

74
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,020
but all these good things about using
inventory comes with

75
00:04:57,019 --> 00:05:01,649
a cost there actual cost of holding
inventory

76
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:05,319
they are the physical holding costs once
we actually have

77
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:10,120
items in our process we have to store
it somewhere

78
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,689
we have warehouses we have to keep track
of it

79
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:17,699
sometimes we might be on climate control

80
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:21,430
all of these are physical holding costs
the cost of

81
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,840
storing the inventory another kind of
cost associated with inventory

82
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:30,250
is opportunity costs it's the cost of lost

83
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,430
investment the money that we have tied
up in

84
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,900
inventory can't be used for anything
else

85
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:41,799
you can't use this to find another
project or even to put in a bank

86
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,870
gaining interest so even though we had

87
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,860
reasons to use inventory we also have to
balance it with the cost

88
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,360
of inventory so that's an introduction
to inventory

89
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,280
in the next session we're gonna
talk about the total cost equation

90
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,068
so we can go on and try and figure out
how much of

91
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:06,289
any particular item to order at a time. I'll see you then.
