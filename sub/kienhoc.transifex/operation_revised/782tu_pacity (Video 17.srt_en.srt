00:00:06,198 --> 00:00:08,339
hello again and welcome to 

2
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:12,660
operations management in this session we're
gonna be talking about process capacity

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,179
if you recall from littles law there
were three main components of process

4
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:21,190
one was inventory one was to throughput rate

5
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,820
and the third one was flow time when we
deal with process capacity

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,149
it has a direct relationship on the
throughput rate

7
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:34,879
so what is process capacity well process
capacity tells us how many

8
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:39,210
flow units the process can produce in a
given period of time

9
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,628
so it's what it is capable of

10
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:45,799
dealing that's the key of process
capacity

11
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:48,988
well how do we figure that out well

12
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:52,599
in some cases we want to take a look at
something called takt

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,730
time it's a funny sounding word

14
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:59,038
takt time it's actually german term but it

15
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,070
is actually the inverse of the flow
rate

16
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,319
its also how long it takes for one unit
to come

17
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,308
out of the process by that I mean not
how long

18
00:01:10,308 --> 00:01:13,609
unit takes to go through the entire
process

19
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:18,680
but from the end of the process you're
looking at things coming off

20
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,420
a production line how long it takes from
one unit

21
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:28,040
to the next unit to come out of the process
it's also considered to be

22
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,000
average activity time of the longest
activity station

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,060
we'll take these step-by-step

24
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:40,820
let's start with the inverse of the flow
rate if we're given a flow rate that says we

25
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:44,109
have 10 units per hour going through a
process

26
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:47,670
then the takt time is the inverse of

27
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,820
that one hour per 10 units if we convert
that

28
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:55,228
to minutes it turns out that a flow rate of

29
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:59,188
10 per hour is a takt time of six minutes

30
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:02,639
an unit comes out of the process every 6

31
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,640
minutes now when I also said

32
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,799
that the takt time is the longest time of an
activity

33
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:13,810
think a process that has three different
activities to it

34
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,989
it requires activity A and activity A
takes 20 minutes per unit

35
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:22,230
activity B takes 30 minutes

36
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:25,659
an activity C takes 15 per unit

37
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:28,969
now the shortest time is 15

38
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:32,848
but remember activity B still has to be
done

39
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:37,299
and let's say they're all being done at
the same time which one is the longest

40
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,840
well that'a activity B and activity B

41
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,280
at thirty minutes per unit is the
longest time

42
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,959
so that would be our tatk time a good
use of takt

43
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:53,390
time is to try and figure out what the
flow rate has to be

44
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:57,679
based on our customer demand the takt

45
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,250
time to meet customer demand says how
much time do we have available to us

46
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:09,469
in our resources for the process and we have
to take a look at what the demand rate

47
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:12,759
is and that will give us the takt time

48
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:17,799
let's take a look at a short example for
example

49
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,950
we have a bicycle manufacture that is

50
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:24,219
100 units per week the demand

51
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:28,919
is 100 bicycles per week the bicycle
manufacture

52
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,250
works one shift a day eight hours in a
shift

53
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,739
five days per week so we can figure out

54
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:39,789
how much time is available in the
process

55
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:43,189
as well as the demand that's already
given

56
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,549
100 per week so let's figure out the
takt

57
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:50,310
time recalculate the available time

58
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,420
we have one shift a day times eight
hours per shift

59
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:58,979
times five days per week which equals 40
hours per week

60
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:02,768
now notice that I've put all of the units
down

61
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:06,658
the reason I do that is to make sure
that I am putting

62
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:10,810
the numbers in the correct places we
have one shift

63
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,870
in the numerator and shift in the
denominator

64
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,349
we have days in the numerator days
denominator

65
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:20,980
and that says our available time is
forty hours

66
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,310
in a week our demand is a hundred

67
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:30,870
in a week so in those forty hours in a
week we have to get a hundred units done

68
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,769
to a takt time is forty divided by 100

69
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:39,529
which is .4 hours so a bicycle must come
of that

70
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:44,168
manufacturing facility that processes
every .4 hours

71
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:47,579
which is 24 minutes so a takt time

72
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,990
is 24 minutes and our throughput rate

73
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,879
is the inverse of that takt time that
says

74
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,659
we have to get two-and-a-half bicycle
through the process

75
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,740
every hour so by you saying

76
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,259
the customer demand and our available
time

77
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:09,340
we have an idea of what our throughput
rate

78
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:14,279
has to be in order to meet our demand rate

79
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:17,739
so this what we talk about with process
capacity

80
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,269
the next time we're going to be looking
at is effective capacity

81
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:24,629
sometimes the process doesn't meet the
demand

82
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:29,329
and we need to figure out how that's
happening what's causing it

83
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,500
and that what we're starting to do with the
next session I'll see it then
