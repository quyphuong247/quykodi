00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,840
Hello again and welcome back to Operations

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,450
Management
We are continuing with the topic of inventory

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:12,080
In our last section, we gave an introduction
to inventory, why we use it,

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,170
and in this one, we are going to talk about
Total cost equation.

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:23,220
This total cost equation is very important
because it helps us to determine how much

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,609
of an item to order at any given time
Let’s get started

7
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:34,000
There are 3 main components to this Annual
inventory total cost

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,800
The first piece is how much does this cost
us to actually order the inventory

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,210
Every time we place an order, there is a cost
to associate with it

10
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,320
The second aspect of this equation is how
much does it cost

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,310
to physically hold on this inventory,
and this is a physical and an opportunity

12
00:00:55,310 --> 00:01:02,079
cost to hold on that inventory
And the third part of the equation is how

13
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,170
much the inventory itself costs
So those are the 3 pieces

14
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:12,490
So I am going to develop an equation that
capture all of these three components

15
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:17,770
So in order to do that we have to take a look
at certain number of variables

16
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:23,259
The capital letter Q: that represents quantity.

17
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:26,350
So when we place an order,
we‘re actually going to order a certain

18
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,480
number of units and that’s what Q is.

19
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,709
It is the number of units ordered at a given
time.

20
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:39,389
R is annual throughput rate
In other word how much we are going to use

21
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:43,179
in a year
Sometimes it’s known as demand but remember

22
00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:49,419
this is a total annual cost equation
So everything we are dealing with here is

23
00:01:49,419 --> 00:01:54,739
for a year
C is how much a unit cost

24
00:01:54,739 --> 00:02:00,399
Just how much you pay for it
S is the set-up cost

25
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:08,319
Every time you place an order this is a special
cost associates with placing an order

26
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,980
Now let’s look at the bottom one here
That’s the capital letter H

27
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,310
This is Annual holding cost of an individual
unit

28
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:23,219
As we can recall, inventory has a physical
holding as well as an opportunity cost

29
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:30,290
So you can see that capital H is the combination
of both physical holding cost which is lowercase

30
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:35,069
h,
plus the opportunity cost, which is lowercase,

31
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:40,019
multiplied by the unit cost
So that’s what we’re going to use,

32
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:45,239
we’ll use capital H but it actually comprises
both physical and opportunity cost

33
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,810
So with this variable let’s move on to the
first piece of the equation

34
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:56,959
This is the cost of placing an order
So the annual set-up costs are every time

35
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:05,269
we place an order we are incurring a cost
So if we order 5 times, we‘ll take a set-up

36
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:10,400
cost and multiply it by 5
If we order 10 times we’re taking a set-up

37
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,390
cost and multiply it by 10
But to determine the number of times you are

38
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,090
placing an order,
we take a total throughput rate,

39
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,719
which is R and divided by the amount of ordering
at a time

40
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:28,239
So R over Q will tell us how many times you
are placing an order

41
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,240
and we’re multiplying it by S, the set-up
cost

42
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:39,930
They give you the annual set-up cost
Next is your annual holding cost

43
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:47,709
So what we need is average inventory, which
is typically identified as Q over 2

44
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:53,529
Because this is the amount of ordering and
when we get down to 0, we order again

45
00:03:53,529 --> 00:04:00,810
So average inventory is shown as Q over 2,
we multiple that by holding cost

46
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:09,459
So that’s annual holding cost
Next is the annual cost of actually acquiring

47
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:14,510
the product
So that’s the cost for item times the total

48
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,110
number of items
we are gonna use in a year, which is R

49
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:22,949
That’s C times R
So now we’ve defined the 3 aspects of the

50
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:27,810
annual total cost equation
and when we bring them together it looks like

51
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:34,020
this:
A total annual cost is equal to annual set-up

52
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:40,400
costs (S times R over Q)
plus annual holding costs (H times Q over

53
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,750
2) and annual cost of units purchased (C times
R)

54
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:51,810
That’s total annual cost equation
Now we are gonna take the equation in the

55
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,430
next video and talk about the economic order
quantity,

56
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:01,680
which is trying to figure out what is the
right value for Q,

57
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,280
how much order at a time in order minimize
that total cost

58
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:07,900
I will see you then
