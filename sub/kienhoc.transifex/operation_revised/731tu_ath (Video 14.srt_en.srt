00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:08,530
hello again and welcomed operations
management

2
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:11,730
in this session we're gonna be talking
about critical path

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,769
critical path allows us to determine

4
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:19,509
how long a process actually takes so what
we're going to be doing

5
00:00:19,509 --> 00:00:23,769
is following a process flow diagram from
beginning to end

6
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:27,118
but we're also gonna be taking a look at
the time it takes

7
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:32,210
to complete each activity for this we're
going to use an example of cleaning an

8
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:32,939
office

9
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:36,210
if you notice here we have six different
activities

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,370
starting with picking up things all the
way through dusting sanitizing

11
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:46,238
vacuuming and emptying the trash can and
finally cleaning that doorknob when we leave

12
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:47,218
the office

13
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,239
just like before when we did

14
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,169
doing diagram processes

15
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,329
we have precedence relationships and

16
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:03,120
this time were also acting adding times
to complete individual activities

17
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,430
so picking up the cups and so forth
takes fifty-five seconds

18
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,569
dusting the surfaces takes 300 seconds

19
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:14,919
and so on as you can see all those times
for the different activities

20
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,560
so now when we build process flow
diagram

21
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,890
not only concerned with precedents to
make sure that we put the activities in

22
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,340
order but we're also interested in how
long every activity takes

23
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,700
so here we have it starting with picking
up the cups and papers in fifty-five

24
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,600
seconds

25
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:40,438
activity a we branch of into three
different activities

26
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:45,239
B, C and D can be done at the same time

27
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,489
B - testing services takes 300 seconds

28
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:53,688
sanitizing things activity C in
ninety seconds

29
00:01:53,688 --> 00:01:57,839
and vacuuming activity D is three hundred
and sixty seconds

30
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,060
once we finished dusting and sanitizing

31
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,618
we can empty the trash can E at 40s

32
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:08,938
and finally once we finished vacuuming
and emptying the trash can

33
00:02:08,938 --> 00:02:13,310
we sanitize a doorknob and leave at
forty seconds

34
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,759
so how long is actually taking us 

35
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:23,209
to complete this entire process what we need
to do is take a look at all the different

36
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:23,729
ways

37
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:27,889
we can get through this process flow
diagram notice from

38
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:31,469
A we branch off into three different
areas going from

39
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:34,750
A to B, E to F

40
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,769
that's one way through the process

41
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:41,140
and if we take a look at that path

42
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:44,539
and we add up all the times on the activities
of that path

43
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:49,989
ABE and F that path goes and takes

44
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:54,650
435 seconds but there's another path
through

45
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,310
that ACEFand if we add up the times
along

46
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,340
ACEF we end up with 225 sec

47
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,469
and lastly we have a path that's just

48
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:14,199
ADF  it looks like the shortest path
because it's only three activities on it

49
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:18,209
but in actuality the length of time is
the longest

50
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:24,019
455 seconds so how long does it take to
get through the whole process

51
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:27,629
its 455 seconds

52
00:03:27,628 --> 00:03:31,518
that is our critical path it's the
longest

53
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,069
path time of a process

54
00:03:35,068 --> 00:03:40,018
so what it means is that by the time we
finish

55
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,060
ADF we've also completed

56
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,170
dusting the survices sanitizing and emptying
the trash can

57
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:51,699
but what happened if activity times
change

58
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:55,219
here activity B

59
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:58,979
has been increased we went from 300
seconds to three hundred and thirty

60
00:03:58,979 --> 00:03:59,780
seconds

61
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:05,900
and vacuuming the carpet went down by 20
seconds from 360 to 340

62
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,010
let's see what kind of impact that has

63
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:15,929
on our process flow diagram and our
critical path so here we have the same

64
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:16,819
diagram

65
00:04:16,818 --> 00:04:21,659
but with the change times for B and D so
let's take a look

66
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,479
ABEF well that's now 465 seconds

67
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,649
ACEF that didn't change at all

68
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:34,799
cus nothing none of the activities
on that path changed

69
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,050
at 225 seconds but lastly

70
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,430
ADF that changed and it's now

71
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,800
435 seconds

72
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,120
so because the times changed on
activities

73
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,490
the critical path changed as well

74
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,360
the critical path moved from ADF

75
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,199
to ABEF and the process flow

76
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,340
time changed it went from 455 seconds

77
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:07,969
to now 465 seconds

78
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:12,180
so as you can see when you're dealing
with processes

79
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,129
and the activity times if those times
change

80
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:19,949
you have to take a good hard look at
your process flow

81
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:24,080
to see whether you're critical path has
changed as well

82
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,978
and our next session we're gonna be talking
about slack time

83
00:05:27,978 --> 00:05:32,939
slack time says certain activities don't
always have to be started right at the

84
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:33,839
beginning

85
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,500
sometimes they can wait a little bit and
how much time you can afford to wait

86
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,579
well thats slack and that's what we're
going to do next

87
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:42,069
see you then
