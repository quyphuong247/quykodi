00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,839
hello again and welcome back to operations
management

2
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:12,769
in this session we're gonna be talking about
inventory aggregation

3
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:17,558
by aggregation on saying that we are
actually merging

4
00:00:17,558 --> 00:00:20,780
warehouses or combining inventory stores

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,379
when we think about merging inventory

6
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:27,750
there's two different ways to consider
it one is

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,448
physical centralization that's we're
actually taking

8
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:34,750
different warehouses different
storerooms and combining

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:40,570
all of the items into one facility
another way to consider it is virtually

10
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,409
instead of putting them all in one place
for sharing a single

11
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:48,609
inventory data system said that items
can be shipped from

12
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:53,390
one facility or another facility but all
the inventory is kept

13
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:59,600
as a single unit when we do this there
are advantages and disadvantages

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,680
the significant advantages of this are
that we get better accuracy and are

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,789
forecasting

16
00:01:05,789 --> 00:01:09,760
because we're combining lots of different
places together we lose some of that

17
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,820
variability

18
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:14,389
and so we have a much better accuracy
for forecasting

19
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:19,680
the other advantage is that we can get
better customer service

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,240
in terms of our service level

21
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:28,879
with the same level of inventory as if
 we had a decentralized system

22
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,119
disadvantages are if we are locating in
one place

23
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:37,079
we can increase the response time to the
customer and we can possibly increase

24
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,179
shipment costs

25
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,380
when we bring together

26
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:44,959
all the products that are similar and
we're pulling it together

27
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:49,549
we're going to have a combined safety
stock now this equation should look

28
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:50,829
somewhat familiar to you

29
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:54,439
because you're creating a safety stock
by using these statistic

30
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:59,170
associated with service level and a
standard deviation of the lead time demand

31
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:04,250
what's different about it is that we're
using a standard deviation of the lead time

32
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,400
demand for one location

33
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,160
and then multiplying it by the square
root other number

34
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,280
of locations that we're combining so let's 
see how this works

35
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,539
a major online retailer has seven
warehouses

36
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:21,989
and each warehouse they maintain
inventory for double-A batteries

37
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,409
the average lead time demand for each
warehous is 200

38
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:31,120
with a standard deviation of 30 we're
trying to have a 95 percent service

39
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,409
level we're going to look at this two
ways

40
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:38,299
one is we're going to look at an
individual warehouse

41
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,830
and figure out the safety stock and the
reorder point and then we're also going to

42
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,900
take a look at what happens when we
combine

43
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,000
all seven warehouses together calculate the
safety stock

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,909
and that reorder point beginning with

45
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:57,239
one warehouse this looks familiar we
have a standard deviation of lead time

46
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:57,769
demand

47
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:02,269
of 30 we caculate these statistic
associated with the ninety-five percent

48
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:03,510
service level

49
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:08,799
so when we bring that together we have
a Z statistic of 1.645

50
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,709
we multiply it by the standard deviation
of lead time demand of

51
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:16,370
30 and we're going to get a safety stock
at fifty units

52
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,939
member we round up

53
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:22,378
then let's caculate the reorder point
for that warehouse

54
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:25,429
the lead time demand was 200

55
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,939
we add in our 50 units for safety and so
when we get down to 250 units in

56
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:31,889
inventory

57
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:35,889
that's when we're going to place our
order pretty simple

58
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:39,068
now what happens if we have seven
warehouses

59
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:43,030
and we combine them together now we're
going to use

60
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,269
that formula for combined

61
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:49,599
safety stock reuse the same Z statistic

62
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,579
1.645 the same standard deviation
of lead time demand of

63
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,480
30 but now we're combining 7 warehouses
together

64
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,629
so we're going to multiply it by the square
root of seven

65
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:06,560
so now our total safety for all seven
warehouses

66
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:13,560
all combined is 131 units so now
remember we have one single warehouse

67
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:16,870
that is taking the place of seven
warehouses

68
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,489
so now the reorder point is seven

69
00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:23,560
times to 200 for the lead time demand

70
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,629
200 was one warehouse we're now looking
at seven of them

71
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:31,579
we add in our safety stock of 131

72
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:37,120
so the reorder point for the
combined warehouse is 1,531 units

73
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,129
now let's see where the savings come in

74
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:45,538
if we have one combined warehouse

75
00:04:45,538 --> 00:04:50,279
we have 131 units in safety stock if we
have seven

76
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:54,918
individual warehouses each warehouse has
a safety stock of

77
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:57,939
50 but now there's seven of them

78
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:01,319
so we have 350 units of safety

79
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:07,060
that's a big difference that actually
 a difference  of 219 units

80
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:12,910
and that means you're not holding on to
219 units and the cost of

81
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,150
those 219 units can be spent elsewhere

82
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:20,509
so that's the major advantage of combining
the inventory

83
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:24,579
that concludes the whole session on
inventory

84
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:28,069
and in our next grouping we will be moving
into Six Sigma

85
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:28,668
I'll see you then
