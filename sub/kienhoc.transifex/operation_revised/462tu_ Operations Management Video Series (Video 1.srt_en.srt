hello and welcome to operations
management

2
00:00:09,048 --> 00:00:12,710
i'm professor Lisa Bussom and in this
series of videos we are going to talk

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:18,138
about what operations management is why
we study it and how we can actually

4
00:00:18,138 --> 00:00:24,259
delve into understanding operations for
different organizations people may be

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,109
wondering why we study operations

6
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:32,240
well it's how organizations get things
done whenever you walk into a store and

7
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,858
you see a certain number of people on
staff that's actually part of operations

8
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:41,149
management trying to determine how many
people you need to start an organization

9
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:47,030
in addition what kind of inventory they
hold that's also part of operations

10
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,950
management how much how quickly we have
to order things that's part of

11
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:56,480
operations if you've gone to a theme
park and you've looked at how they

12
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,729
structure the lines for rides

13
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:02,929
that's also an area of operations
management called queuing so there's so

14
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:06,409
many different things associated with
operations

15
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:10,908
it really is how organizations get
things done and we're not just talking

16
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:15,920
about for-profit organizations
corporations not-for-profit

17
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,640
organizations places such as museums
educational institutions they also deal

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:30,769
with operations management for profit
they are obligated to make a profit for

19
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:36,618
their stakeholders and the best way to
do that is to have a lean operations

20
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:40,459
manufacturing that's what most people
think about when you think about

21
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:44,688
operations management because they're
thinking about raw materials being

22
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:48,828
converted into products and then being
delivered to a customer service

23
00:01:48,828 --> 00:01:53,209
organizations if you go to get your
haircut that's also going to include

24
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:58,669
operations management from the moment
you walk in to the hair salon to the

25
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,909
time you've gotten your haircut and
you've paid for it

26
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:05,840
there are a variety of aspects of that
are all governed by operations

27
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,379
management in fact people have studied
operations management with all different

28
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:16,740
kinds of organizations and they've
recognized that nearly 80-percent of

29
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:22,320
the organization has operations
management that's a huge portion so you

30
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,829
can see that even if you have a solid
accounting firm Department marketing

31
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,780
department human resources department of
technology research and development

32
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:39,719
unless you can get your product or your
service out to your customer in an

33
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,250
efficient manner

34
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,389
you're not going to succeed and that's
why operations management is so

35
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:51,149
important effective and efficient
operations can make or break an

36
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,560
organization

37
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,360
all you have to do is think about the
success of organizations such as

38
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,360
amazon.com and also think about all the
problems that the US Postal Service's is

39
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,010
having a lot of it has to do with
operations management and that's what

40
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:11,399
we're going to be studying we're going
to be taking a look at operations

41
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,140
management from a process perspective
and in the next session we're going to

42
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:17,939
talk about process basics
