00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,160
welcome back to operations management
in our last session

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,160
we talked about what a process is in
general we talked about

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,259
how inputs enter into the process they
can transform somehow through the use

4
00:00:18,259 --> 00:00:20,949
of resources information and management

5
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:24,429
and they creat outputs from those inputs

6
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:28,239
but we never really talked about what
makes a good process

7
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:33,079
so what does make a good process in
general

8
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:36,149
a good process is one that produces a

9
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:42,070
good product or service every customer
out there

10
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,920
wants their product to meet or exceed
their expectations

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,440
and that's what makes a good product

12
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,679
the always think about the costomer when we're
thinking about operations

13
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,628
whether their customers a client a 
person on the street a person in a

14
00:00:58,628 --> 00:01:00,259
retail store or

15
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:04,819
somebody in another organization that
person is a customer

16
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:08,049
and when you provide them with a product
or service

17
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:13,599
they are expecting something from you
and to make a good product or service you

18
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,399
have to meet

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,478
or exceeded their expectations so

20
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,329
how do we know whether we're making a
good product well the customer looks at

21
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:27,519
a product from a variety of different
perspectives these are what we call our

22
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,009
product attributes

23
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,569
first of all how much is it going to cost
them

24
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:37,408
that's their price the price to the
consumer another thing they are

25
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:38,329
concerned about

26
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:43,559
is when can I get it that's what we call
the product delivery response time

27
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,189
in addition they want to know can I make
changes to this

28
00:01:48,188 --> 00:01:52,169
can I have a variety can I customize in
some way

29
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,710
this is product variety and lastly

30
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:59,149
does this product or service do what I
want to do

31
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:04,489
that's what we call product quality
altogether these are product attributes

32
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:05,699
and that is what

33
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,079
a customers looking for so

34
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:15,209
in order to make a good process we have
to be able to make

35
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:19,530
those particular product attributes to
do that we call these

36
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,939
process competencies if the customers
worried about how much it's going to

37
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:25,870
cost them

38
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:31,310
the price of the product or service we are
concerned with how much it costs us

39
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,170
to make that product or service that's
the process cost

40
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:39,839
if the customers concerned about how
quickly they will receive it

41
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,580
we are concerned on the inside how
quickly we can make

42
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,660
the product or process a product or
service

43
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:50,709
flow through the process that's called the
flow time

44
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:53,989
if they wanna make changes to the
product

45
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:57,500
customize it then our process has to be
flexible

46
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,680
has to be able to adjust to the

47
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,489
requirements up the customer and lastly

48
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:08,300
the product pass to meet or exceed
customers expectations

49
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,590
which is quality which means our process
has to produce

50
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,989
that product that's intended without

51
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:19,519
defects so when we bring this all
together

52
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,860
we're saying that what the customer sees

53
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,129
the external attribute of the product

54
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:29,658
have to relate directly to process
competency

55
00:03:29,658 --> 00:03:33,429
how the process works so good process

56
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,230
will create the required product
attributes

57
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:42,628
the price which is what customer sees
relates directly to how much it costs to

58
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:43,189
make

59
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:48,579
how quickly the customer receives it is
related to how quickly we can get it

60
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,110
through

61
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:54,190
our process the flow time on if the customer
wants a lot of variety

62
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:58,658
a lot of customization then our process
has to be flexible to be up to make

63
00:03:58,658 --> 00:04:00,359
those different kinds of changes

64
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:06,049
and in general we always have to meet or
exceed that customer expectation

65
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:09,489
which means our process has to be a
quality process

66
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:13,140
providing no defects so that an essence

67
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:16,370
a good process makes a good product

68
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:21,060
next time when we get together we'll talk
about their trade-offs between this

69
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,410
product attributes

70
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,609
and that's going to be this to the
operations frontier

71
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:26,629
see you then
