hellow again and welcome back operations
management

2
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,000
in this session we'll be talking about
statistical process control

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,009
one of the seven tools of quality
statistical process control

4
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:21,278
also known as SPC is a way that we can
monitor

5
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:25,009
a process we have particular standards
in place

6
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,830
and then as the process is running we're
going to take measurements

7
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:32,439
compare them against those standards and
if necessary

8
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,939
we'll make corrective action and all this
is happening

9
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:41,409
while the product or service is being
produced this is part of what's known as

10
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:41,769
the

11
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,100
feedback control principle we have a
process

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,340
we evaluate the performance collect
information

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,160
and then make a decision as to whether
we need to change the process

14
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:57,000
so it's a feedback loop we know that
inside the process this's going to be

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,640
variations

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,039
you could either be normal
variation or

17
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,609
abnormal variation and what we need
to do is figure out

18
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:10,689
the differences between the two natural
or normal variation

19
00:01:10,688 --> 00:01:14,889
is to be expected every time a process is
happening

20
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:19,379
and every time we produce a product this
can be some slight difference between

21
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,469
one product to next product

22
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:24,509
if you think about when you sign your
name

23
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,549
every time sign your name your signature
looks

24
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:30,618
a little bit different and that's to be
expected

25
00:01:30,618 --> 00:01:34,599
that is natural variation what

26
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:38,478
isn't to be expected is what's known as
assignable variation

27
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,469
let's say you're signing your name and
somebody bang your elbow

28
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:46,019
and suddenly your signature looks a
little bit different or

29
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:50,459
in some cases significantly different
this is a variation

30
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:53,599
that can be traced to a particular cause

31
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,839
that's why it's called assignable you
can assign

32
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,140
cause to it

33
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,540
in statistical process control what
we're trying to do

34
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,690
is determined whether the variation is
natural

35
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:11,620
or due to some sort of cause that we then
have to go and correct

36
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:17,360
we use control charts which are
graphical presentation updated over time

37
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,890
we have predetermined control limits so
if variation exceed

38
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:27,369
 that control limit there's a problem
if variation goes below

39
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:32,490
a lower level limit there's a problem but
it's very easy to see

40
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,909
on a graph this is all based on

41
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:41,500
the central limit theorem if you recall
from your basis statistics

42
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,819
you realize that when you have a
population

43
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:48,500
and we take samples from their
population we take the means of those

44
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,340
samples

45
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,740
that tends towards a sampling
distribution of the mean

46
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,000
which is looking somewhat like a normal
distribution

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,729
and so we use that when we setup our
control limits

48
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:05,679
here we have the normal distribution

49
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,750
it a nice belt curve and if we're trying to
capture as much

50
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,349
the natural variation as possible and
most cases

51
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:17,659
we define those control limits to be three
standard deviations

52
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:21,949
above the mean and three standard
deviations below the mean

53
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:25,939
that means that we're capturing
ninety-nine point

54
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:30,889
74 percent of all that natural variation
that goes on in a process

55
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:34,219
so if something falls outside of those
limits

56
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:37,459
we're pretty sure that it's due to an
assignable cause

57
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:40,909
so let's take a look at a control chart

58
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:44,209
here we've captured means of samples

59
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:48,860
overtime there's a lot of variation
there but right now we can't tell

60
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,400
whether that variation is natural

61
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,170
or that variation is due to
particular causes

62
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:58,739
to now once we've added the normal
distribution there

63
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,090
we can see where that normal
distribution spreads

64
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,189
and if we take three standard deviations
above

65
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:10,870
and below the mean we now have operand
lower control limits

66
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,560
and we can see that most that variation
actually falls

67
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,019
inside the control limits so that would be
natural variation

68
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:25,290
but we also have three-point that fall
outside of these control limits

69
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,810
this is what we would look for in terms
of assignable

70
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,899
variation because it is now

71
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:35,109
beyond three standard deviations away
from the mean

72
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,250
it is most likely due to an external
costs

73
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,730
so that's generally what we do with
control charts

74
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,520
in the next session we're gonna talk a
little bit about inspection

75
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,060
and how we actually develop those
control charts I'll see you then
