00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,519
hello again welcome back to operations
management

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,620
in this session we're going to be
continuing with the concept

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,070
critical path and talk about slack time

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,880
and how we calculate slack time using
the critical path method

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,420
so to begin with let's talk about what
slack time

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,289
is when we go through a process

7
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:30,010
flow and there's a variety of different
activities

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,829
and a lot of those activities are on
different paths through the flow

9
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:37,500
some others activities don't have to be
started

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,539
right on time we know that the critical
path

11
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:45,469
is the longest path through the
entire process

12
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:49,179
but some path are shorter in time so that
means

13
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:52,609
there's room for delay and

14
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:57,109
that's what we're looking at we're trying
to figure out how much time there is

15
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:00,109
between when an activity

16
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:03,390
can start which is the earliest time
you can start

17
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,569
and when an activity has to start

18
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:10,510
and that's the latest time it has to start
so slack

19
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,710
can be said to be the difference between
the latest

20
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:16,949
start time LST and the

21
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,060
early start time EST so that tells us

22
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,060
how long an activity can be delayed

23
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,909
before it has to be done to in order

24
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:32,340
to figure out slack we use what's known
as the critical path method

25
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,640
will we take a forward pass through the
flow 

26
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,290
diagram to determine when all the
activities

27
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,350
can start the early start time

28
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:47,519
and as a result also when the earliest
they will finish that's the early finish

29
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,069
time

30
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:51,298
then we take a backward pass

31
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,520
between the flow diagram to figure out
when the latest

32
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,920
each activity can start and when the
latest

33
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,219
each activity will finish that's the LST

34
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:05,539
latest start time and LFT

35
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,100
the latest finish time then we compare
the two

36
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:12,478
if there's a difference between the
early start time

37
00:02:12,478 --> 00:02:17,789
and the late start time we know there's
slack so we're actually going to use the

38
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:20,000
same example from the critical path

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,280
problems before we were cleaning an
office

40
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,110
and if you recall there were six
activities there each with different

41
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,900
times

42
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,870
and when we put it together we had a process
flow diagram that looked like this

43
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,810
there were three potential paths through the
process

44
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,890
ABEF ACEF and ADF

45
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:46,929
and each path had a different amount of
time so what we need to do is figure out

46
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,340
how much delay time we have for
different activities

47
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,340
in this process so we're going to take a
forward pass

48
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,080
through the flow diagram starting with
activity

49
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,090
a it starts right at time 0

50
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,110
it's the first activity in the entire
process

51
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,700
so at time 0 that's when activity can
start

52
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:12,179
and then we add the 55 seconds

53
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,060
that the activity last so we know
that it can finish at

54
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,128
time 55 we're starting at zero

55
00:03:19,128 --> 00:03:23,098
we're adding 55 seconds for the activity and
we're finishing

56
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:26,840
at time 55 now activity

57
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,039
B has to wait until activity A

58
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:34,199
is completed which means activity B
cannot start

59
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:38,229
until activity A finishes so the earliest
you can start

60
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:43,969
is time 55 we add to 300 seconds that
activity lasts

61
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:48,139
and so activity B finish at 3:55

62
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:53,369
we did the same thing with activities
C it can start time 55

63
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,688
and finishes up at 145 and activity D

64
00:03:57,688 --> 00:04:02,719
starting at fifty-five and finishing
three hundred and sixty seconds later

65
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,449
at 415 so now we take a look at
activity

66
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:10,530
E remember activity E

67
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,750
cannot start until both B and

68
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,048
C are finished so although

69
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,509
activity C can finish at 145

70
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:23,529
activity E can't start then

71
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:27,059
it has to wait until B is done so the

72
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,790
early start time for E is 355

73
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,150
then we add the forty seconds for that
activity

74
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:38,029
to make it 395

75
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:42,289
so here we have activity E finishing at
395

76
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:46,479
and activity D finishing at 415

77
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,779
both of them have to be done before
activity F start

78
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:54,399
so activity D finishes later than E

79
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,429
so that's why the early start time for
F

80
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,829
is at 450 then we add the 40s of

81
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:05,159
the activity so we know that it finishes
at 455

82
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,210
so that was our forward pass through
the process flow diagram

83
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:13,288
and we figure out when everything starts

84
00:05:13,288 --> 00:05:19,019
so now let's do a backward pass

85
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:25,879
activity F since it's the last activity
we know that finishes at 455

86
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:29,409
and so the earliest that can start
is 415

87
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,789
and the latest you can start is 415 as
well

88
00:05:32,788 --> 00:05:36,180
so that activity has a slack of  0

89
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,910
now let's go back to activity E

90
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,139
activity E must be finished by 415

91
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:48,418
so that's the latest finish time 450

92
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:52,469
which means when we subtract out the
40s of the activity

93
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,210
the latest it can start is 375

94
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:59,668
so there's a difference between the
early start time and

95
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:03,038
the late start time of 20 seconds

96
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:07,318
that's the slack for activity E

97
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,400
let's do another one let's take a look
at activity D

98
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,649
activity D must be finished by 4:5

99
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:18,899
because that's the latest activity
F start

100
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:23,068
so if it must be finished by 415 the
LFT

101
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:26,910
we subtract out the three hundred and
sixty seconds of

102
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,810
the time for D we find out that
our latest start is

103
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,459
55 there's no difference between the
late start

104
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:38,288
and the early start so we have a slack of
0

105
00:06:38,288 --> 00:06:41,639
let's do another one here's activity

106
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,030
B activity B says if has to be done by

107
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:49,349
375 because that's the latest activity

108
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:53,479
can start noticed the latest start
time

109
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:57,139
of the activity that follows it

110
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:00,840
is the latest finished time for that
activity

111
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,269
so again the latest finish time 375

112
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:08,478
we subtract out 300 for the activity
time

113
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,240
to have a late start time of 75 we have
the slack of

114
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,490
20 we do the same thing for activities

115
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,699
C and then when we get back to activity

116
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:23,960
A take a good hard look at that

117
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:28,500
activity A must be finished by what time

118
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,610
it has to be finished by the earliest

119
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,848
time of all the activities following it

120
00:07:35,848 --> 00:07:40,959
so activity B well that have to start by
75

121
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,689
activities C well that doesn't have to
start until 295

122
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:49,610
an activity d has to start by 55

123
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:54,650
so the latest activity A can finish it's 55

124
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:58,388
so the latest you can start is 0

125
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:03,030
so there's no slack for activity a
it's very important to realize that when

126
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:06,429
you look at this process flow diagram

127
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,759
all of the activities on the critical
path

128
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,500
will always have a slack of 0

129
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,459
it may take a few times for you to
understand this I suggest you go over

130
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:20,628
this example couple of times

131
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:25,569
just make sure you understand the
forward pass and the backward pass

132
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:28,990
and the next session we can be talking
about process efficiency

133
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,519
I'll see you then
