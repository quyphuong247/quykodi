00:00:05,198 --> 00:00:09,349
welcome back operations management and 
our first lecture we talked about but

2
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:10,129
operations

3
00:00:10,129 --> 00:00:13,589
was and I also said that you can be
looking operations from

4
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:17,820
a process perspective so today we're
going to talk about

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,810
what process basics are you know what
you need to know about process

6
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:25,948
in general a process

7
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,830
is a transformation it takes inputs and
converts them into outputs

8
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:34,310
so you look at this diagram here we have
inputs

9
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,629
entering into the process and outputs 
coming out

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:42,879
that's all our processes so what do I mean by

11
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,628
imputs inputs are things that flow into
the process

12
00:00:46,628 --> 00:00:50,079
for example they could be orders they
could be

13
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,230
travelers they could be people they can be raw
materials

14
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:59,198
they could be dollars invoiced the
things that enter into a process

15
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:02,229
that then get changed in some way

16
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,319
so things go into a process

17
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:10,338
in order to be changed when we study
those particular items going into a

18
00:01:10,338 --> 00:01:11,219
process

19
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:14,530
carefully we'll look at them and we call
them a low

20
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,719
unit this is what we're tracking as they
go through the process

21
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,859
coming after the process we have

22
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:28,359
outputs so if we had water's coming into
the process who would have completed

23
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:29,599
orders coming out

24
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:33,030
if we have travelers coming into our
process

25
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,769
maybe coming out of the process is
travelers that have a complete the security

26
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:37,530
scan

27
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,210
units going in finished products coming
out

28
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:44,500
dollars that our part of

29
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,938
an invoice now we have dollars that are
being paid

30
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:51,089
so as you can see we took an input part

31
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,159
and transformed it somehow to become an
output

32
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,630
but what goes on inside that process

33
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:01,140
we actually have to make that
transformation happen

34
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,549
and in that transformation we have to
apply

35
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:07,979
things such as energy labor equipment

36
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:11,780
these are used to make that
transformation happen

37
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,219
these are tangible resources and so we're
taking an

38
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:19,250
input applying resources to them

39
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:25,560
to create the output when we look inside
the process as well

40
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,068
it's not just one block whatl we have

41
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:32,488
are a whole series interconnected
activities

42
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:37,378
if you look at inside our box here for
the process you notice on this little

43
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:39,389
rectangles does your activities

44
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:42,639
triangles are called buffers places
great things

45
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,089
wait so if you think about a large
organization you know that

46
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,840
as things passed through an organization
activities happen

47
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,269
sometimes things have to wait but when
we combine it all together

48
00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:59,789
into a good network that's what's going
on

49
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:05,719
inside process so the input entering into
the process for applying those resources

50
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,500
to traveling to all these activities and
buffers

51
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,419
and then we have outputs but that's not
enough

52
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:16,679
how do we know how many other things to
me

53
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,730
when we need them and so forth that's

54
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:24,109
information this is also part of the
whole process

55
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:29,080
we need information tell us what we
need to know in order to perform the

56
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,909
process

57
00:03:29,908 --> 00:03:33,039
and we also need management

58
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:38,310
policies procedures such as hiring
practices

59
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,920
or shift work things like that

60
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,458
that's part of the management of the process so when
we pull it all together

61
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,939
what we have is the inputs flowing into

62
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:53,509
a process which is a network of
activities and buffers

63
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:58,188
we are applying resources tangible
items such as

64
00:03:58,188 --> 00:04:02,878
labor capital equipment to convert them
into output

65
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,639
we use information that tells us how
much

66
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,949
when how to make things and we have
overall management structure to

67
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:14,000
keep everything organized and that

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,110
all that goes on in a process in our
next class

69
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,540
we'll talk about what makes a good
process see it
