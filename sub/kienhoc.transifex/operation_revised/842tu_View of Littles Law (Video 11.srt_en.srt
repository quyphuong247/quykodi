00:00:06,198 --> 00:00:09,068
hello again and welcome back to operations
management

2
00:00:09,068 --> 00:00:13,120
in the past couple of sessions we've
been looking at the powerful

3
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,799
equation known as Little's law Little's
law

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,500
shows the relationship between inventory
flow time and throughput rate

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,829
and in our last session we actually look
at

6
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:29,528
units going through a process flow
diagram in this one

7
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:33,489
we're going to take a look at using
little's law with financials

8
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:37,598
items we can get often income statement
or balance sheet

9
00:00:37,598 --> 00:00:43,109
because a lot of times we don't have the
luxury of having an entire process flow

10
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,670
diagram that we can keep track of

11
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,329
but what we do have is financials

12
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:53,128
we can see how efficient an organization is

13
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:56,619
just by looking at the financial
statement and applying little's law

14
00:00:56,619 --> 00:01:00,238
as always with little's law

15
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,159
we're concerned with the stable process
so that the average

16
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,828
inflow  going into the process
equals the average outflow coming out of

17
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:09,799
the process

18
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,260
this way we don't have to deal with
individual

19
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,260
fluctuations a day-to-day fluctuations

20
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,030
we're only gonna be looking at averages
Little's law

21
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,868
concerns itself with three particular
operational measures

22
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:29,040
flow time how long it takes to get
through the process

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,600
inventory how much is going on

24
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:36,890
in the process and the throughput rate
what's going on

25
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:42,290
through the process in a given time when
we're looking at financials

26
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,670
we're looking at money more specifically
dollars

27
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,100
or other kinds of currency in terms of

28
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:53,589
how long does it take for a dollar to
get through the entire process

29
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,859
how many dollars are sitting in
inventory

30
00:01:56,859 --> 00:02:01,368
and how many dollars go through the
entire process

31
00:02:01,368 --> 00:02:05,700
in a day a year a month and most usually

32
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,180
we're looking at it in terms of the year
so let's take a simple example

33
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,610
here's a company called LRDR and here
are their year

34
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,410
end's  financials we have a value for net
sales

35
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:22,829
a cost of goods sold net income 
inventories

36
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,099
so we need to identify

37
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:30,068
the correct financials from this
statement here

38
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:34,708
to apply them to Little's law so we need
to understand

39
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:37,890
which value here is going to be our
throughput rate

40
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:40,949
which value here is going to
represent their

41
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:44,889
inventories let's take a look at it on a
diagram

42
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:49,079
inventories is pretty easy

43
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,110
straight off the statement there we saw
that the inventory was nine thousand six

44
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,800
hundred forty six dollars

45
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,310
and there it is right in the diagram but
the flow rate

46
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,590
might be a little bit more difficult to
understand flow rate

47
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,750
is dollars that we put into 

48
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,590
the process okay so we're concerned with
our cost

49
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,060
of goods sold sometimes cost of sales

50
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,598
is what it's called but this is the dollars
that we are putting

51
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,128
into the process to create the item that
goes out to the customer

52
00:03:24,128 --> 00:03:27,169
that's why we use cost of goods sold

53
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:32,030
it's the dollar's entering into the
process so now we have a value for the

54
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,449
flow rate because we know how much
money was spent in costs of goods sold

55
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,719
a year and we have a value for the
inventory

56
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,280
which currently sitting in the process
so using

57
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,860
the version of Little's law that says

58
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,560
flow time equals to inventory divided
by our throughput

59
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,299
rate we can calculate how long it takes
for single dollar

60
00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:01,080
to go from the beginning of the process
all the way through to the end

61
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,489
so let's go take a look at that our throughput
rate

62
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,200
was $79,183 per year

63
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:13,699
again that was our cost of goods sold
the dollars they got entered into the

64
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:14,589
process

65
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,289
at the end of the year we had nine
thousand six hundred and forty six

66
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:19,879
dollars

67
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:23,238
in inventory so now to calculate

68
00:04:23,238 --> 00:04:28,349
the flow time we just take our inventory and
divide it by the throughput rate

69
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,669
and it gives us .122 years

70
00:04:32,668 --> 00:04:36,829
remember our throughput rate was in dollars per
year so our flow time

71
00:04:36,829 --> 00:04:41,750
is in years as well because our unit
time has to match

72
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,978
but a lot of people have difficulty
understanding what .122

73
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:46,409
years is

74
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,639
so we just multiply it by 52 weeks in a
year

75
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,079
and that's how we get 6.33 weeks

76
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:57,800
so what this tells us it takes 6.33
weeks

77
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,870
for single dollar to enter the process

78
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,910
for to come out to be able to be built to

79
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,340
the customer

80
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:12,239
so what does that mean for us well it
could be one of our metrics

81
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,590
how do we evaluate how efficient
organization is

82
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:20,279
if there are other companies in our same
industry that have

83
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,508
a flow time of only 4 weeks we are not
nearly as efficient

84
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:27,669
in getting our process is done as they
are

85
00:05:27,668 --> 00:05:31,769
if however there are other organizations
that are taking ten weeks

86
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:36,288
then we are doing better than they are so
that's one of the things that we can use

87
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:37,719
financials for

88
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,229
we're trying to figure out how long it
takes for items to get through our entire

89
00:05:42,228 --> 00:05:43,609
process

90
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,020
we're going to continue with Little's Law
in the next session I'll see you then
