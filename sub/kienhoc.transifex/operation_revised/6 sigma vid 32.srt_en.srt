00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:03,339
Hello again and welcome back to Operations
Management

2
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:07,970
In this section, we are going to talk about
Quality and Six Sigma

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:13,150
Up to this point, we’ve been looking at
processes and we’ve been evaluating them,

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,440
flow time, we’ve been looking at matrix,
we’ve been looking at inventory, we’ve

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,340
been looking at capacity
But now it’s time to think about quality

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,760
and how can we go about improving all these
processes

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,880
So the first question is what is quality?

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,760
If you look at the definition from the American
Society for Quality, it says that it’s totality

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,199
of features and characteristics of a product
or service that bears on its ability to satisfy

10
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:47,629
stated or implied needs
If you can dense that down, it really is the

11
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:52,660
ability of a product or service to meet or
exceed customer expectations

12
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,010
That’s what quality is.

13
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:00,979
It is in the eyes of customers
So, why do we consider quality?

14
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:04,989
Well, quality is associated definitely with
the company’s reputation

15
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:09,420
The better the quality is, the product is,
the more likely people will purchase their

16
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,270
product
If it is low quality product, people will

17
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,380
stay away from it
If somebody is harm, or injured or worst with

18
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,090
their products, then you’re subject to liability.

19
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:27,070
And of course, if we are going to deal with
global customers,

20
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:31,460
then you will have to have very consistent
products that can be used across multiple

21
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:35,799
countries
So what we want to do in terms of quality

22
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:42,680
is we want to manage the process flows
by reducing variation in the process and in

23
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,189
the product itself,
it improves cost effectiveness

24
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:52,749
If you recall, the more variations we have
in terms of lead time and demand,

25
00:01:52,749 --> 00:01:58,649
we have to keep safety stock,
Once there is a variation in a process flow,

26
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:05,070
we have increases in lines,
increases in inventory that causes also a

27
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,399
problem
So, if we can reduce variations in process

28
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:15,879
we will improve the cost effectiveness
There are costs associated with quality

29
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:20,180
And we look at them from 4 different prospectives
The first being the prevention cost.

30
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,700
That’s a cost associated with stopping a
problem from happening.

31
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:30,620
That’s typically designing a cost, designing
a process to prevent a problem

32
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,120
The second one is considered appraisal costs.

33
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,860
This is where you think about quality and
inspector

34
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,849
and all the tools associated with checking
for problems

35
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:47,930
That is where appraisal costs come in
And internal failure is one we find or identify

36
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:53,680
a problem throughout process
but we still catch it before it goes to the

37
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,120
customer
So this could mean we work or the cost of

38
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,890
making a product they cannot be solved,
that’s internal failure

39
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:09,890
External costs are associated with when the
customers find the problem.

40
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:16,079
And it is the worst because you are dealing
with the cost of fixing the situation

41
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:22,640
as well as possibly losing good will with
the customer who find a problem in a product

42
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,530
So how do we improve quality?

43
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,360
Well there’s an overall quality improvement
process,

44
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,360
and that’s where we measure everything,
we call everything has to have a metrical

45
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,280
associated with it to make sure it’s up
to standard,

46
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,920
we analyze it, we control all processes and
once we control,

47
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,760
we try to improve them and possibly redesign.

48
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,329
That’s the overall quality improvement process.

49
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:53,160
So how do we go about doing this?

50
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,750
This is where we start talking about six sigma.

51
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:04,959
The key to six sigma is something called DMAIC,
and that stands for Define, Measure, Analyze,

52
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,819
Improve, and Control
If we are going to makes any changes to process

53
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:17,080
we need to define the problem
Measure things so we can climb to the top

54
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,480
variables,
analyze them and then make a change with their

55
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:28,880
improvement and control it and monitor it
to make sure that the process is now staying

56
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,450
in the improve mode.

57
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:36,780
So that’s the key to six sigma but how do
we actually go about doing that.

58
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,310
This is where we talk about seven tools of
quality

59
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,470
Most of them are very simple to you but very
effective

60
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:50,970
They are check sheets, pareto charts, histograms,
scatter diagrams,

61
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:56,860
ishikawa otherwise known as fishbone’s cause
and effect diagrams, flow charts, statistical

62
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,510
process control
In the next few sections, we are going to

63
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,230
take a look at each one of those particular
tools

64
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:11,020
and see what we can learn from them and how
we can use them to improve processes.

65
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,260
I will see you then
