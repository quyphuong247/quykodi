00:00:05,859 --> 00:00:08,529
hello again and welcome back operations
management

2
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:12,609
and we're still continuing with
inventory this time we're talking about

3
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:14,320
how we can calculate

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,018
an appropriate service level for an
organization in previous sessions we

5
00:00:20,018 --> 00:00:22,850
talked about the service levels is being
the probability

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:27,580
that we won't run out so it's
actually one minus the probability that

7
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:28,629
we will run

8
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:31,969
out but what should that service level 
be

9
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:34,989
all we do know that a

10
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:40,780
service level that'll should be a balance
between having enough safety inventory

11
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,520
and too much

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,190
because we do know that excess inventory
incurs extra holding and capital costs

13
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:51,479
but not enough inventory and

14
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:54,750
we can stop production due to materials
shortages

15
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,859
customers can't have order filled and so
forth

16
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:01,589
so we need to do is find an appropriate
balance between the two

17
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,640
so what should be that correct service
level

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,340
we do a marginal analysis we're going to
compare the expected costs and benefits

19
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,909
approaching saying each incremental unit

20
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,990
of inventory so every additional unit
in inventory

21
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:24,769
we're going to see the costs and
benefits of that to do that we need to

22
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:25,649
understand

23
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,759
the marginal benefit abbreviated NB

24
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,909
says the price this is what we can sell
the unit for

25
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,460
versus how much it cost us so the price

26
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:39,519
minus the cost is a marginal benefit

27
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:45,449
the marginal cost is how much it cost us
to acquire the item in the first place

28
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,100
but we subtract out the salvage value

29
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:53,009
at the end of the season this is what we
can get for this unit

30
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,540
it's not the original price but it's
something left over

31
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,350
so we're going to calculate our service level

32
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:03,649
we're taking a marginal benefit and
dividing it by

33
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:07,689
the combinational of marginal benefit
and marginal cost

34
00:02:07,688 --> 00:02:10,860
and that will give us the probability
that our demand

35
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,349
 during the time we place the order to
the time we

36
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:17,400
receive it is less than or equal to
re-order

37
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,670
point just like we've always said
about service level so if we take a look

38
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:23,729
at an example

39
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:28,409
we have Sydney with a seasonal business
of buying and selling imported figurines

40
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:32,719
Sydney by figurines at a cost
twenty-five dollars each

41
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,990
and then the figurine can be sold at a
price

42
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,120
a fifty dollars at the end of the season

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,810
Sydney has to get rid  the unsold
stock by selling it to a wholesaler

44
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,199
for fifteen dollars each we're going to
use this information

45
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:54,000
to figure out the appropriate service
level so we're told that we could sell

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,659
figurine for fifty dollars

47
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:59,270
there's the price it costs us twenty
five dollars

48
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:04,320
to acquire it and at the end of the season
the best we can get for each figurine is

49
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,400
fifteen dollars

50
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,900
that's our salvage value so our marginal
benefit is our price minus the cost

51
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,860
which is twenty five dollars and our
marginal cost

52
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,640
is our cost less the salvage value which
turned out to be ten dollars

53
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:25,109
so our service level is just 25 divided
by the 25 plus 10 so it's

54
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:30,299
25 divided by 35 it's point 7143

55
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:33,640
so we're not looking at a 90 percent
service level

56
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:38,099
we're actually looking at about a
71.43% service level 

57
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:41,939
so it's a little bit different every
organization will have to figure out

58
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:44,269
what the appropriate s?vice level is
for them

59
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:48,349
and our next session we're going to
start with

60
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:51,379
a fall blown problem on

61
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:55,469
inventory analysis gonna take it
straight through from economic order

62
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:56,229
quantity

63
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:59,409
all the way to the reorder point in
safety stock

64
00:03:59,409 --> 00:03:59,989
