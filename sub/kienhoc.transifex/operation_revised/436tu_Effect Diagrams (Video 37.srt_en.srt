00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,570
hello again welcome back to operations
management

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,839
we're continuing our series on 7 tools of
quality

3
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:14,980
and in this session we talk about
cause and effect

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,070
diagrams cause-and-effect diagrams are
also known as

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,109
fishbone diagrams and they're also known
as Ishikawa diagrams

6
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:29,859
named after their inventor Ishikawa what
cause and effect diagram does

7
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:34,448
is it provide to a graphical technique
to help discover causes

8
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:38,219
of problems typically their number
spines

9
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:44,429
on a graph and this graph spines include
things like measurements materials

10
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:48,238
personnel environment methods machines

11
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,250
sometimes there's four spine sometimes
there six spines

12
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,409
sometimes the spines are a little bit
different depending

13
00:00:55,409 --> 00:01:00,619
on what kinda area you working in but
really what they are providing

14
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:05,299
a way to you get you thinking about
causes

15
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:10,609
of a particular situation so we use the
cause-effect diagram

16
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:14,228
if we need a structured way to look at a
problem

17
00:01:14,228 --> 00:01:18,840
what kind of causes are out there
that could create this particular

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,990
problem

19
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:23,670
so let's take a look at a sample here we
have

20
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,900
diagram that's looking at 4 percent of
double chocolate chip cookies are burnt

21
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,340
so we're going to take a look at a
variety of different

22
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,630
reasons why this could happen as I said
before sometimes there're 4 spine

23
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:40,449
sometimes there're 6 spines

24
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,868
and this one we have a 4 spine diagram

25
00:01:43,868 --> 00:01:47,750
one covering machinery methods equipment

26
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,759
and people and if you look carefully at
it we are identifying

27
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:57,209
issues with regard to machinery here we
have unreliable oven 

28
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:01,118
we could possibly have broken timers for
mathods

29
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:05,649
maybe we don't have a set cooking time
maybe the procedure manuals are out-of-date

30
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:10,269
for people too many temporary staff

31
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:13,879
maybe not enough training and if
there's equipment

32
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:17,280
maybe some things are inconsistent so
what we're doing

33
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,310
is we're using the spines the titles

34
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,039
of those spines to give us a basis for

35
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:27,629
analyzing why a particular situation is
occurring

36
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:33,030
and then we write on those spines what
those causes could be

37
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,009
so it's a great way to think about a
situation

38
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:40,649
and think about why this thing is
actually happening

39
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,219
so when we use a cause-and-effect diagram

40
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:47,629
first thing we have to do is try to
specify the

41
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:51,759
effect that we're analyzing what's the
problem what's the situation

42
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,229
then by using the categories of the
spines for guidance

43
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:59,310
we consider why the effect is occurring

44
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,150
and then once completed we're able to
look for the likely causes

45
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,539
that's all there is to a
cause-and-effect diagram

46
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:12,639
and it's one of the best of the seven
tools of quality for

47
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:18,079
analyzing why something is actually
happening I'll see again next time

48
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,840
with another tool
