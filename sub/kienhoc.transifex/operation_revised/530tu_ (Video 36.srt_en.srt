00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,870
hello again and welcome back operations
management

2
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,039
are continuing with the grouping of
videos

3
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:16,429
on 7 tools of quality and today we're gonna be
talking about histograms

4
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:21,039
basically a histogram is just a
graphical representation

5
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,050
of the variation or distribution of data

6
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,839
so what we're doing is we're taking data
putting in two categories

7
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,278
and now we're making a chart so when we
use histograms

8
00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:35,679
we try to decide can we see the shape

9
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:38,780
of a data's distribution? Is it normally
distributed

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,500
Is there any kind of bias

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,500
or skewness to it do we need to compare
the output across processes 

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,738
for example do we need to take a look at
one production line versus another and

13
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:56,000
take a look at the output to see whether
they're roughly the same

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,159
another thing about histograms all that
data

15
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,718
on them must be numerical we can't use
anything like colors

16
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,649
or people are things like that what we
want to do is take a look at numerical

17
00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:09,250
data

18
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,400
We want to see what the categorized

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,049
for the shape of that data so here's a sample
histogram

20
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:20,330
for call center and as you can see me

21
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:23,750
across the bottom line categories of the
numbers of minutes

22
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,769
on hold 0 to 1, 1 to 2,  2 to 3 and
so forth

23
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:31,859
and then on the y-axis

24
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:35,060
we are showing the number of customers
willing to wait

25
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,790
for those particular minutes and now you
can see me that this is roughly a

26
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,390
normally distributed

27
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,200
distribution of data because it's
roughly bell-shaped

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,228
where the peak in the center and as you
can see

29
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:53,640
all these partial right next to each
other we've categorized the data

30
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,430
so that we're checking between one and
two minutes to in three minutes 3&4

31
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,520
and we're just checking to see if the frequency

32
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,728
for each of these categories so in other
words it's also like

33
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:11,590
graphically representing a frequency
distribution

34
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,140
so when we look at a histogram we
noticed that the shape of the data 

35
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:15,779
provide

36
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,890
insight into the process producing the
data a bell curve is going to show a

37
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:22,449
normal distribution

38
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:27,310
if we have a tail to the right or left
that indicates some kind of skewness to

39
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,390
data if we end up with a rectangular
shape

40
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:33,419
it indicates there's uniform distribution

41
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:37,059
so by looking at that distribution the
data we have

42
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,420
a sense for what kind of process we have

43
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:45,329
when we built a histogram we can do it
in Excel

44
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,340
we enter data by category so if we're
looking at the diameter a whole

45
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,069
we have all these categories less than
10 centimeters

46
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:57,840
between 10-11 11-12 and so forth

47
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,650
and we're calculating the frequency for
each of these particular categories

48
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,039
notice none of these categories will
overlap

49
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:09,039
so that they are distinct one from
another

50
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,379
from this we then plotted in

51
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:16,789
using the chart tools and we select the
column chart

52
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:20,289
and then we edited to reduce the gap
between the columns

53
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:25,259
and also to provide titles so create a
histogram is fairly simple

54
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:29,319
we're actually taking a frequency
distribution of data

55
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:33,459
or graphing it to see the shape of it

56
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:36,739
next time we'll be talking about another
tool. I'll see you then
