00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,890
hello again and welcome back to
operations management we're talking

2
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,320
about capacity analysis and I have
another problem for you this is

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,259
supplementary problem number two and
this is can be divided into three parts

4
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:22,990
because it's gonna be fairly
comprehensive so we'll get started

5
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:29,459
we're gonna be talking about the amazing
shed company this company produces three

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,420
different kinds of sheds basic superior
premium each of the sheds uses the

7
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,800
same resources fabrication teams
assembly teams painted teams and

8
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:45,069
inspection teams the company has
received orders for twenty basic 10

9
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:50,200
superior and 10 premium sheds to be
completed in one week we're going to

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,359
assume five days in the week

11
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:57,609
the question is can they meet their
order requirement and why and what is

12
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:03,019
the minimum number of teams needed for
each resource so the information about

13
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:09,469
the shed and the shed company and their
different resource pools is on the slide 

14
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:13,560
here you can see we have four different
resource pools fabrication assembly

15
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:20,379
paint and inspection and there are three
different sheds that are being done so

16
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:27,719
there are different unit loads for each
type of shed the basic shed has two

17
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:33,978
hours for fabrication 3 for assembly 1 for paint
1.5 for inspection superior

18
00:01:33,978 --> 00:01:39,759
2.5; 3.5;  1.25; 1.5 respectively

19
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,739
the premium shed 2.5; 3.8;  2
and 1.5 respectively

20
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:51,339
you can see that each different kind of
shed has a different unit load in the

21
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,159
fabrication area there are four teams
available

22
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,719
3 for assembly 2 for paint and 2 for inspection
and when we look at the number of hours

23
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,019
available per team per day you can see
there seven hours available in

24
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:07,869
fabrication 7 and 

25
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:15,490
a half assembly 7 for paint and 6 for
inspection so the first thing we need to

26
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:20,390
do is we need to figure out what the
average unit load is we have three

27
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:25,319
different kinds of sheds and each one
has a different unit load so we need to

28
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,560
find out what that average unit load
is to do that we have to take a

29
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,319
weighted average we know that we're
doing twenty basic 10 superior and 10

30
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:42,689
premium sheds in a week that gives us
a total of forty sheds so our product

31
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:53,810
mix is actually 50% basic 25% superior
and 25% premium using this product mix

32
00:02:53,810 --> 00:03:01,009
we can then calculate the average unit
load for each of the different resource

33
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:07,479
pools so when we get to fabrication our
weighted average unit load is two and a

34
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,869
quarter hours assembly three and a third paint

35
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:17,239
1.31 inspection 1.5 and if you look at
the bottom half of the slide you can see

36
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:22,810
how that is calculated so now that we
know how much time we need per shed the

37
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:28,849
next thing we need to do is figure out
how much time we have available so to

38
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:33,430
calculate the available times per day we
take the number of teams for each

39
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,830
resource times number of hours available
per team per day and that's how we get

40
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:44,500
our available time per day so we have
four teams available on fabrication each

41
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,469
team work seven hours and that gives us
28 hours we did the same calculations

42
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:57,849
for assembly paint inspection so you can
see those hours on the bottom left of the slide

43
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:04,549
next we then have to calculate the
capacity per day capacity how much time

44
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:09,719
do we have how much time do we need we
have twenty eight hours available and we

45
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:17,250
need two and a quarter hours per shed so
that gives us 12.44 sheds in fabrication

46
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,419
we have twenty two and a half

47
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:25,459
hours in the assembly and we need three
and a third so that gives us 6.77 and

48
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:28,819
for paint we have 14 hours available

49
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:36,209
divide that by 1.31 that's 10.67 and for
inspection we have 12 hours available divided

50
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:43,899
by one and a half and that's 8 so it gives us our
capacity per day and we have five days

51
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:49,579
in a week so we multiply our capacity
per day by five and that tells us how

52
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:56,079
much we can get done in the week and as
you can see our bottleneck is assembly

53
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:07,829
we can only do 33.8 sheds in a week when we
required to do 40 so our bottleneck is

54
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:10,009
assembly right there

55
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:17,879
33.8 sheds so when we look at this we
said can they meet their order

56
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:20,009
requirement and why

57
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:23,779
well no they cannot because the
maximum number of sheds that they can

58
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:30,199
produce is 33.8 so now we know that they
can't meet the requirement the next

59
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:36,978
question is how many teams for each
resource should we have so let's take a

60
00:05:36,978 --> 00:05:42,819
look at that now when we do the number
of resources needed we look at things

61
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:44,209
a little bit differently

62
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:50,159
instead of how much time do we have and
how much time do we need we try and

63
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:57,979
figure out with how much time overall
do we need for those forty sheds then we

64
00:05:57,978 --> 00:06:02,849
work backwards to get the number of
resources needed so when I look at the

65
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:09,039
time needed per week we know we need 
2.25 hours per shed in

66
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:17,529
fabrication and we need to produce forty
sheds so 40 times 2.25 is 90 hours

67
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:25,029
we did the same type of calculation for each
of the other teams the assembly we need

68
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:27,168
3.33 hours per shed

69
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:29,128
we multiply that by 40 that's

70
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:35,330
133.2 for pain we end up with
52.4 hours and

71
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:43,519
inspection 60 now we break that down to
time needed per day so we know how many

72
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,819
hours per week we're going to divide
that by five days in the week so now

73
00:06:48,819 --> 00:07:00,309
that tells us how many hours are needed
per day so 90 divided by 5 is 18  133.2 divided by
5 is 26

74
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:08,088
points 64 52.4 divided by five is
10.48 and 60 divided by 5 is

75
00:07:08,088 --> 00:07:15,069
12 so this is how much time we need per
day we also know how many hours are

76
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:22,209
available per team per day that was
given originally if we divide those 2 the

77
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:28,168
time needed per day by the number of
hours of available per team per day we

78
00:07:28,168 --> 00:07:37,109
end up with the number of teams we need
so 18 divided by seven is 2.57 26.64 

79
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:50,229
divided by 7.5 is 3.55 10.48
divided by 7 is 1.5 and 12 divided by 6 is 2 so

80
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:56,438
when we look at it overall we currently
have four fabrication teams and we only

81
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:04,749
need  2.57 assembly which was our
bottleneck we only have three teams but

82
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:12,550
we actually need 3.55 paint we currently
have 2 we need one and a half

83
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:18,759
inspection we currently have 2 and we
need 2 so we have excess capacity in

84
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:24,459
fabrication and not enough capacity in
assembly so when we're thinking about

85
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:29,329
making changes to the resources
available for the amazing shed company

86
00:08:29,329 --> 00:08:34,439
we will be thinking about reducing the
number of teams in fabrication and

87
00:08:34,439 --> 00:08:37,639
increasing the number of teams in assembly

88
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:43,799
so when we think about capacity analysis this
really helps us understand that if we

89
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,379
place the right resources in the right
locations

90
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:52,210
it really improved the throughput I'll see you for
part two
