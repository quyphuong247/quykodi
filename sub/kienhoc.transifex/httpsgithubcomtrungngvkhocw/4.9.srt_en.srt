Now there&#39;s been a lot of airtime, I suppose, around the idea of the 10,000 hours of expertise.

1
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:14,480
Is there anything to that figure, the 10,000?

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,480
I have no idea, really, about the 10,000 hours—that is, I&#39;m a customer of this. I mean, Ericsson,

3
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:30,180
who has promoted this figure, is a highly reputable researcher, but it&#39;s a crude approximation,

4
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:37,579
I&#39;m sure. I mean, there&#39;s nothing magical about 10,000, and I&#39;m sure that it doesn&#39;t

5
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:43,170
take the same amount of time to different people, and expertise is not wholly defined

6
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:50,170
and so on, but it gives you an idea that this is a lot of hours, that to become an expert

7
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:59,719
where you see that qualitative change in the way things are done, where basically performance

8
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,640
switches from what I call system two to system one, that takes a long time. How many hours,

9
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,600
I&#39;m not committing myself, and I don&#39;t know.

10
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Yes. One of the goals of the course is to cue people to the difference between people

11
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,880
who are actual experts and people who simply just claim to be experts. Is there anything

12
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,590
that people should watch out for, any red flags to tell the difference between people

13
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,810
who actually know or can actually do what they claim for themselves?

14
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:37,810
Yes, I mean, I think—Gary Klein and I wrote a paper in which we actually suggested and

15
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:44,810
then said— it&#39;s embarrassingly simple—but when somebody acts like a self-confident expert

16
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:53,670
on a range of problems, then there&#39;s one question to be asked: did that person have a decent

17
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:02,030
opportunity to learn how to perform the task? That requires getting feedback on the quality

18
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:09,030
of performance and getting rapid and unequivocal feedback. In the absence of rapid and unequivocal

19
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:14,840
feedback, expertise is just the self-confidence that comes with a lot of experience, and that

20
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,200
is uncorrelated with accuracy. This is something we&#39;ve known for 50 years or more.

21
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:26,260
So if somebody wanted to become an expert at a new task, what&#39;s the fastest and most

22
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:33,500
efficient way to turn, as you said, that system two, that effortful sort of processing, into system one?

23
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:40,510
Well, there are really two ways of doing this, and you have to use both. You have to use

24
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:48,530
system two. For somebody to become an expert driver, you have to tell them how to drive.

25
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:56,500
I would say for somebody to become an expert diagnostician on the basis of X-rays, you

26
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:02,230
have to teach them what the things look like so that they&#39;ll be able to recognize them.

27
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:07,740
But then you&#39;ll need also a lot of practice with high-quality feedback. Merely telling

28
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:13,790
people how to do something is not going to turn them into experts, and repeatedly telling

29
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:18,680
them the same thing is not going to help. It&#39;s a lot of practice with feedback that

30
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:25,680
creates real expertise, but you can abbreviate the time that it takes to reach expertise

31
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:35,150
by having high-quality instruction about what cues you should be paying attention to.

32
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:41,520
Yes, so actually knowing what it is that discriminates the two categories, if it&#39;s an abnormal scan

33
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,700
versus a normal scan and so on?

34
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:50,700
Gary Klein has a beautiful example. He talks of a nurse in the cardiac ward who comes home

35
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:59,569
and talks to her father-in-law, as I recall, and says, &quot;We have to go to the hospital,&quot;

36
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:05,470
because he doesn&#39;t look good to her. It turns out that, yes, he had to go to the hospital.

37
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,290
He&#39;s in deep trouble. He needs—twelve hours later or something, he is on the operating table.

38
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:15,099
What she had done...

39
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:22,099
Gary Klein did what he and others—but I think he is the main guru of this type of

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
enterprise—he found out what the cues were, although she was not aware of the cues that

41
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:38,260
she was using. He found out that when arteries are obstructed, getting obstructed, which

42
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,949
will lead to a heart attack, there is a pattern. The pattern of distribution of the blood in

43
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:50,120
the face changes. Now she had recognized, she had learned that pattern, but she didn&#39;t

44
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,050
know what it was. Now when you&#39;re training nurses, you can show them the pattern.

45
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,860
That&#39;s clever. The goal of the course, the title of the course is &quot;The Science of Everyday

46
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:08,100
Thinking,&quot; and what we&#39;re trying to do is to provide people with the ability to think

47
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:14,350
more clearly, argue better, reason better, I suppose learn to use system two, to be more

48
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:20,280
analytic, to unpack, read more carefully and so on. Do you have any advice for somebody

49
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:27,280
in the course who&#39;s trying to improve their everyday thinking?

50
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:34,380
Well, you know, my advice would be quite conservative. I mean, it would be: pick a few areas and

51
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:44,380
pick a few things where you want to change what you&#39;re doing, and focus on those. I mean,

52
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:49,430
do not expect that you can generally increase the quality of your thinking because I think

53
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:56,430
you really cannot, but if there are repetitive mistakes that you are prone to make, if you

54
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:04,750
learn the cues, the situations in which you make that mistake, then maybe you can learn

55
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,930
to eliminate them. I&#39;m not...

56
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:15,729
The history of success in enterprises like yours is that they&#39;re not always successful.

57
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:22,729
I mean, people feel great when they hear of all these ways of doing things and of controlling

58
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:29,680
themselves, but then when they are making a mistake they are so busy making it that

59
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,280
they have no time to correct it.

60
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:41,280
One of the reasons, I think, for my skepticism about this is that I don&#39;t think my thinking

61
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:48,330
is very much better than it was 40 years ago or 45 years ago when I started doing this

62
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:55,330
work. This suggests some humility. So pick your shots, pick a few areas, and then in

63
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:07,100
those situations that you recognize as situations where you&#39;re prone to make a mistake, slow yourself down.

64
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:13,900
One piece of advice, by the way, is that recognize situations where you can&#39;t do it alone, where

65
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:20,000
you need a friend, where you need advice because if you do it alone you are going to make a mistake.

66
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,500
My name is Danny. I think about thinking.
