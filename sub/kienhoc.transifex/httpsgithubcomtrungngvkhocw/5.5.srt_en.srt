Now despite decades of research into this stuff, most high school and university classes

1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:14,789
are done in a kind of traditional format. They call it the sage on stage, where a professor

2
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:21,140
stands in front of a room and their job is to profess, to fill these empty vessels, these

3
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,080
students, with knowledge. What&#39;s actually happening in a lot of these classrooms is

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,339
students spend their time taking notes, and they&#39;re feverishly trying to record what the

5
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:35,560
professor is saying, kind of like a court stenographer. That doesn&#39;t give much of an

6
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:43,800
opportunity for students to really engage with the material, to process it deeply. Instead they&#39;re just note-takers.

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,230
That&#39;s their main role, I think, as students. I have a lot of experience with my students

8
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:57,230
in each of my classes that I teach. I talk to them, each of them, about how they record

9
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,120
their lectures, how they take notes, how they study for these sorts of things, and the vast

10
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,750
majority of people, when they sit in a class, when they sit in a university lecture, it&#39;s

11
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,310
as you said: they just write down absolutely everything you say, and that&#39;s their method

12
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:18,130
of studying. It&#39;s very common. In fact, I suspect that a lot of the students in this

13
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:22,280
course are probably writing down every word that we&#39;re saying right now, and that&#39;s not

14
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:29,280
the most effective way of learning. We know this. But it&#39;s extremely common. So is highlighting

15
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,340
the information when they&#39;re reading a textbook.

16
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,329
Obviously, the title of the segment is &quot;Learn by Doing,&quot; and what we&#39;re really trying to

17
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:45,329
emphasize here is the importance of active learning. It sounds trite. The active component,

18
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,229
the struggle that people have with generating the content—and that is extremely important.

19
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:57,020
It&#39;s not enough to just sit back and let the information kind of wash over you. It&#39;s a

20
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:04,020
matter of actually producing the content so that that struggle, I think, really solidifies

21
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:10,060
in memory, really cements it, so you&#39;ll remember it far longer than you will if you actually

22
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,220
just re-read the information.

23
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,239
Yes. I think anything—what we mean by that active learning is anything you can do to

24
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:23,239
engage with the content more deeply. This can be anything from quizzing yourself, using

25
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:28,640
flashcards, getting your friends to quiz you, just chatting about the content with your

26
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,980
friends and family over dinner, trying to relate the concepts that you&#39;re learning now

27
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:40,069
to other concepts that you know really well. Just relating the material to your everyday

28
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:43,510
experience will really help with encoding that information.

29
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:50,470
This is something both John and Bob said, that memory, in our learning, kind of works

30
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:56,019
like a scaffolding. The more that you know, the more that you&#39;re—the more you know,

31
00:02:56,019 --> 00:03:02,200
the more you&#39;re capable of knowing. As we&#39;ve heard, memory does not work like a video camera

32
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,900
with some kind of limited capacity. It&#39;s kind of better than that. You can build on this

33
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:13,829
material if you work on it actively so that&#39;ll help with encoding and it&#39;ll help with retrieving

34
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:18,640
those memories when you need it in the immediate future or months down the track.

35
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,040
That&#39;s exactly right, but I think what we need to do is make that idea of retrieval

36
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,719
a little bit more concrete, so what does that actually look like when people are retrieving

37
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:34,409
the information? I think the best way is something that most people are already familiar with—not

38
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:41,409
as flashcards—so obviously something as simple as learning another language.

39
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:48,469
If you see the word, say, bonsoir, in French, if you actually have to generate the English

40
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:57,040
equivalent of that word from memory, that struggle, that &quot;Bonsoir—what is that? It&#39;s...,&quot;

41
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:03,969
that process right there that you&#39;re actually engaging in to generate &quot;good evening&quot; in

42
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:10,340
English, that&#39;s the process that we&#39;re after. But if you just see the words &quot;bonsoir = good

43
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:15,560
evening&quot; in a guidebook or in your textbook, you can read that a dozen times, and it&#39;s

44
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:22,270
not going to get you any closer to remembering that information nearly as much as actually

45
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:29,270
generating that—so having flashcards, writing on one side of the card &quot;bonsoir,&quot; generating

46
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,330
the English equivalent, writing it out, and then looking on the other side whether you&#39;re

47
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:41,419
correct or incorrect; going with another French phrase and so on, having English on one side

48
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:43,370
and French on the other and going back and forth.

49
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:50,370
But it&#39;s not just simple association, learning like that. It can also be very complex. We

50
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,400
can have a word like—or a concept like the availability heuristic. So on one side of

51
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:04,979
the card, you have: &quot;What is the availability heuristic,&quot; and you generate the response.

52
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:10,190
Students in this class might actually try it. So you have on one side: &quot;Availability

53
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:17,190
heuristic,&quot; go! What is it? Generate the description of the availability heuristic. Then once they&#39;ve

54
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,639
tried and they see where they&#39;re not quite clear as to exactly what their understanding

55
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:29,000
of that is, then they can flip it over and then they can see exactly what that definition is.

56
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,280
You can do that, the same, for the confirmation bias. You can do it for representativeness

57
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,410
heuristic. For each of the topics and the content in this course, put it into a flash

58
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:43,500
card, use retrieval learning, and see whether you can actually explain it or not, whether

59
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,650
you can actually talk to your mother or your sister or something and explain that concept

60
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:55,650
to them. It&#39;s only when you see, only when you struggle with that material, in producing

61
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:01,520
it, that real learning happens, and that is going to cement it in memory and you&#39;re going

62
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,680
to remember it for much, much longer.

63
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,069
I think now it&#39;s really important to realize that this process, this struggle of retrieving

64
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:15,539
something from memory and making mistakes is by far the best way to learn. I mean, a

65
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:21,069
good sort of heuristic or rule of thumb that you can use is that if it feels easy, you&#39;re

66
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:22,550
probably doing it wrong.

67
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:28,250
I think that&#39;s right. Another really good example of this is when you&#39;re preparing a

68
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:33,860
talk or a presentation of some sort. Now the first sort of knee-jerk response when you&#39;re

69
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:40,520
preparing a talk is to memorize it, to write out the entire thing and read it, and then

70
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,680
reread it, in preparing for this for this big event. That&#39;s what most people do.

71
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,020
How else are you going to get through it?

72
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:52,210
That&#39;s right. But in fact that&#39;s probably the worst thing you can do. The best advice

73
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:58,199
that I can give when preparing to give these sorts of things is to give it. Just present

74
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:03,220
it. Find—present it to your dog or your cat or your friend or your mother or something,

75
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:10,080
anyone who&#39;s willing to listen. Just have a go. Don&#39;t worry about getting the lines

76
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,259
right or getting—it&#39;s going to be bad. The first one, two, three times that you do, it&#39;s

77
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:18,419
going to be horrible. You&#39;ll forget what it was that you were talking about. It&#39;s going

78
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:24,639
to be terrible, but that&#39;s the process. If you&#39;re actually trying to generate the thing,

79
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,190
if you&#39;re trying to struggle to remember the themes of your presentation, what it is that

80
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:35,500
you&#39;re going to be talking about, that process, that struggle is going to cement it in memory,

81
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,879
but it&#39;s going to make it a lot more flexible. When you&#39;re actually giving the talk, you

82
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:43,970
won&#39;t be stuck to your lines. You&#39;re not going to—if you lose your place, you won&#39;t be

83
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:48,990
out on a limb. You&#39;re going to be completely able to adapt and go on to something else,

84
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,930
and it&#39;s going to seem a lot more natural, a lot more pleasing to the audience to watch

85
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,970
that sort of presentation than one where people just memorized the entire thing.

86
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:05,050
So I think you&#39;re right. This idea of struggling is something that&#39;s not comfortable. It&#39;s

87
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:12,050
probably the worst thing that we can possibly imagine, but it&#39;s also—Bob Bjork calls this

88
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:18,030
&quot;desirable difficulties,&quot; and this is just one example. This is the difficult part: that

89
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:25,030
struggle, that feeling of uncomfortableness that comes with trying to generate, trying

90
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:34,729
to retrieve that information. The desirable part is all of the benefits that that kind

91
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,680
of provides six months down the road or when you&#39;re giving your presentation. This desirable

92
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:46,500
part is really the reason we&#39;re doing this entire episode—is for people to kind of

93
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,000
reap the benefits of that. So here&#39;s what Bob Bjork had to say when I asked him about desirable difficulties.
