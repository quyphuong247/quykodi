So far in Think101, we&#39;ve been trying to give people a better way of seeing the way that

1
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:15,809
their mind actually works. We&#39;ve been dealing with cognitive processes, heuristics, and

2
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:24,300
biases that people use to help them navigate the complexity that they see and interact with in the world.

3
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,009
Over the last few episodes, we&#39;ve been applying all of that to different claims. A couple

4
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:36,699
of episodes ago, we talked about extraordinary claims like psychics and ESP and horoscopes.

5
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:41,649
This week, we&#39;re going to be dealing with applied claims. This is following on from

6
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:48,339
the health claims, which we did last week, homeopathy and cancer clusters. This week,

7
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:54,890
with applied claims, we&#39;re dealing with topics that influence the lives and livelihoods of

8
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:00,600
people, where people&#39;s lives are literally at stake. The same sorts of processes are operating here as well.

9
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:05,900
That&#39;s right. The first time one we&#39;re going to deal with today is a technique called Facilitated Communication.

10
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,320
This is for people who are autistic or who have severe brain damage or

11
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:17,120
mental retardation. Now these people are nonverbal. They can&#39;t communicate verbally with the world.

12
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,440
The idea here is, &quot;Okay. Well, let&#39;s help them to communicate by tapping letters out

13
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,540
on a keyboard or touching pictures, then they&#39;ll be able to communicate,&quot; but autistic individuals,

14
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,850
for example, get stuck when they&#39;re typing. They can initiate the movement, but then they

15
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:39,020
perseverate. They persist, and they keep typing. With the help of a facilitator—that is,

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:46,020
a person helping them by guiding their hand—they can help initiate the action of an autistic

17
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:53,550
child, and then help pull them back so they don&#39;t get caught in that loop, and then help

18
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:58,820
them push forward again. They&#39;re just guiding the autistic child to where they want to go.

19
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:04,890
Now, all of a sudden, with the help of a facilitator, these autistic individuals can communicate

20
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,670
in ways they couldn&#39;t before, in full sentences. It&#39;s quite impressive.

21
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:15,430
It is impressive. It almost seems incredible. Previously, you&#39;d have these children—imagine

22
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:22,430
being a parent of an autistic child. They&#39;re nonverbal, in a sense. I mean, they&#39;re trapped,

23
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,299
in a sense, but finding out with the aid of a facilitator that they have this rich inner

24
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:35,310
life, that they can in fact communicate, that they want to communicate, all of a sudden,

25
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:44,300
they&#39;re telling you about how their day was. Now they can go to school. They can write letters. They can write poetry.

26
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:45,819
Doing complex mathematics.

27
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:52,819
That&#39;s right. A lot of the reports, the communications that come from these kids are extremely elaborate.

28
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,510
They&#39;re telling you about the fact that they&#39;ve been trapped for years, and it&#39;s incredible.

29
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:06,299
It&#39;s almost too good to be true. In fact, I talked to Scott Allen about exactly this

30
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:08,149
topic, and here&#39;s what he had to say.
