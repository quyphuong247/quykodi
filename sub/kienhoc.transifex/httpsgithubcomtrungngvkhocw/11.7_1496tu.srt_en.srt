In this episode, we&#39;ve been arguing for the power of the situation. We saw that channel

1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,680
factors are a really good way to bridge intention and action, just that the situation is a really

2
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:20,150
powerful predictor of human behavior. But it doesn&#39;t stop there. It&#39;s not like, &quot;Science

3
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:25,360
teaches us that you have to look at the situation in order to predict human behavior.&quot; 

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,500
That&#39;s the cool thing about science. You can take what we&#39;ve learned in the lab, what we know

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,500
in these highly controlled situations, and flip it around. We can use what we know about

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,730
the situation in predicting behavior to manipulating the situation to shape human behavior.

7
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:45,420
That&#39;s exactly right. We talked about this idea of channel factors. As you said, what

8
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,130
are the elements of the situation, the circumstance, the context? What are the trigger points that

9
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:57,690
are necessary in order to elicit the behavior that we&#39;re looking for? One of the most important

10
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,190
elements, I think, that we can do here is to clear those channels, in a sense. How do

11
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:08,100
you get out of the way? How do you—in order to bridge intention and action, what can you

12
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:16,600
do to make that as easy as possible for the person that you&#39;re trying to change the mind of?

13
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:23,649
Yep. This is a simple example, but I write a lot of e-mails in my work, and it&#39;s difficult,

14
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:30,439
yes, to put yourself in the situation of the person that&#39;s receiving it. How do I clear

15
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,749
all the nonsense out of their way? The nonsense would be the things that I&#39;m interested in.

16
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:38,709
Don&#39;t put the things that you&#39;re interested in, put the things that they&#39;re interested

17
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:45,079
in. Start with some context. Tell them how the situation will benefit them, and then

18
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:52,079
finish, with one sentence, a very clear ask from them, &quot;What is the next physical action

19
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,779
that I would like you to take in order to move this forward?&quot; And, don&#39;t send it five

20
00:01:58,779 --> 00:02:04,459
minutes before they&#39;re going to clock off. Don&#39;t send it when their workload is at their highest. 

21
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:11,800
Send it at a time that is conducive for them to do the next thing that you want them to do.

22
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,950
That&#39;s exactly it. You touched on a couple of things. One is making it as easy as possible

23
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:22,090
for them to do what you want them to do; the other is empathy. We know, Matt, this is—

24
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,790
right from the beginning, we&#39;ve been talking about how difficult it is to put yourself in the

25
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,580
shoes of others; to see things from their perspective. But the extent to which you can

26
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:37,580
do that, to be able to take the—okay, I&#39;m a CEO of this particular company. I have this

27
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,310
going on and this going on. Now what can I possibly do to see the world through their

28
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:49,300
eyes: to make my goals their goals; to say that these are the things they&#39;re after; these

29
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,750
are the things that I&#39;m after. Now how do I make those align as closely as possible?

30
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,730
The extent to which you can do that is the extent to which you&#39;re going to be successful.

31
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,970
Now one of the areas that you can use this really well, I think, is in—which Lee Ross

32
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:07,000
mentioned—is in donations: donating your organs, donating blood, donating to particular

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,820
charities for various things. Another is in filling out petitions. If you want someone

34
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:19,300
to get on board with something, to do it, to jump on the bandwagon along with everyone

35
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,870
else, how do you do that? What are the things that you can do for them? Again, putting yourself

36
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,680
in the shoes of the person who&#39;s filling this out.

37
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:33,680
There was a really nice one I saw the other day. It filled in everything for you. Everything

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,950
was all written. All you had to do was enter your name, your postal code, and click send.

39
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:47,950
Now just by making it that easy for the person, the numbers just climb as a result, instead

40
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:52,470
of they had to fill up a 30-page form and actually do something on their own, and you&#39;re

41
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:59,470
relying on the citizenship of the person and their goodwill, these very personality factors.

42
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,640
Then they&#39;re not going to do it. If you make the situation easy, then they will.

43
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,959
Yes. Filling out the forms is a good one. You can design entire systems like this. 

44
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:16,000
There&#39;s a light flickering in a hallway near my office, and in order to get that fixed I have to find

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,999
a computer to go online to find the website that I need to log a maintenance request or

46
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:25,810
something like that. But I visited a hospital recently, and you can imagine how busy people

47
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:32,810
are, doctors running around trying to help people. If they see a light flickering in

48
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,300
the hallway, all they have to do is go to a whiteboard in the middle of the space, take

49
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,999
out the pen and then write, &quot;Light flickering in hallway five.&quot; Then somebody else takes

50
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:47,460
that and puts that into the system, in this thing. In the hospital, that light gets fixed.

51
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,310
In my office, it&#39;s been like that for months; it&#39;s not going to happen. I&#39;m never going

52
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,789
to do it because the distance between my intention—what I want to do is fix that light—and the things

53
00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:00,770
I have to do in order to get somebody in the room to fix it, is massive.

54
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:06,689
That&#39;s right. This is extremely important when it comes to really critical types of

55
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:12,710
domains, like health or military or police—safety-critical domains. If you&#39;re working in a nuclear

56
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:17,930
power plant and you have to fill out a 30-page report to say that something is dangerous,

57
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:24,139
yea, that&#39;s not good, is it? I mean, I&#39;ve looked a fair bit into this what&#39;s called

58
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:29,789
close call or near-miss databases and what makes them successful or not. The thing that

59
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:36,490
seems to make them successful is the ease with which you make it for the user.

60
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:41,439
In a hospital case, again, if you have to fill out a five-page report on the nature

61
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,979
of the incident and everything else, people just aren&#39;t going to do it. That matters if

62
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:50,559
you&#39;re going to leave scissors in a patient or a sponge nearby that&#39;s from the previous

63
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:57,559
operation. Yes, that&#39;s not great, but if you can take out your phone and text, &quot;Sponge

64
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,900
almost left,&quot; boom, send, gone, and it&#39;s taken care of at that point, people are going to use it. 

65
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,409
The easier you make it for them, the more likely it is.

66
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:12,439
We heard about a bunch of these cases from Nisbett and Ross in the previous episode [correction: segment].

67
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:15,990
When it came to organ donation, opting out, people stick with the default

68
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,610
options. If they don&#39;t have to do anything, they won&#39;t do anything and they tend to stick

69
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:26,089
with that. Drawing a map from point A to point B, making it clear if you&#39;re holding a party

70
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:29,839
and you want people to come, the easier you make it for people to get there, the better it is.

71
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,529
Tell them what bus to get on; what will they need to do; what will it cost; what should

72
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:38,669
they bring; all of these things. If they&#39;re lined up, then people will turn up and enjoy themselves.

73
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:46,059
That&#39;s right. This is one of the hottest or most lucrative areas, I think, in cognitive

74
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,229
psychology, cognitive science, social psychology, I suppose, behavioral economics, They&#39;re all

75
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:56,270
melding together these days, but there are a bunch of teams.

76
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:03,270
Ross and Nisbett mentioned this group of academics who were helping the Obama campaign. Yep,

77
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,129
that&#39;s very successful. There&#39;s another in the UK called the Behavioural Insights Team.

78
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:17,849
There&#39;s a group out of Chicago, I think, called—based by Richard Thaler on—the Nudge group, which

79
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:24,849
you hear a fair bit about. All these are working on the same idea of making it as easy as possible

80
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:31,319
for you to do one thing, to bridge intention and action, to make these channel factors

81
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:40,000
as easy as possible, to isolate the bits of the context that are going to make the 

82
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,719
behaviors happen that you&#39;re looking for.

83
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:47,460
Yep, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;re there yet. I mean, we promised people in opening this course

84
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:52,110
that we&#39;d give them the tools to change the world, and we have. We&#39;re up to episode 11.

85
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,300
We started off with a more realistic expectation about how the mind actually works.

86
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:02,419
We shattered some illusions, and we&#39;ve gone through a bunch of cognitive mechanisms for the bases

87
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:07,249
of our beliefs. Now we&#39;ve gone from predicting behavior to shaping behavior.

88
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:13,080
But if we want people to go out there, to poke the world, to leave their mark, we need

89
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,649
to make it more concrete. We need to show them these channel factors in action, and

90
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:23,500
how they can go out and make it work. That&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do next episode in &#39;Change the World&#39;.
