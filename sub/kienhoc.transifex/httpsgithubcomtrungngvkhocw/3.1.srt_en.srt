On the last episode, we talked about how seeing, hearing, and remembering are all influenced

1
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,900
by the sum of our experiences, and we provided a bunch of examples of each.

2
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,500
We talked about two main topics, really. One is called the fundamental cognitive error,

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:27,130
and that is the fact that we don&#39;t really have any insight into the fact that we&#39;re

4
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:32,960
making any sort of interpretation. The second is this idea of naïve realism—that is,

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,930
that the world is exactly as it seems. It&#39;s this naïve view of the fact that human perception

6
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,950
works kind of like a videotape, and human memory works like a videotape as well, that

7
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,879
what you see is recorded and then you can retrieve it from memory with perfect accuracy.

8
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:56,879
We&#39;re going to see this week that people don&#39;t have any real privileged access to

9
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:04,979
their own memory, their own perception, and the determinants of our own behavior.

10
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:11,740
Yes, there are some classic examples of this. One of my favorites is by Richard Nisbett

11
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,520
and Tim Wilson. Now they set up a table at market on a busy Saturday morning with four

12
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,440
pairs of stockings that labeled A, B, C and D, and this sign that said &quot;Consumer Evaluation

13
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,080
Survey: Which is the best quality?&quot; Now they encouraged people to feel the stockings,

14
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,330
and then they asked them to choose which pair they thought was the best quality. Now what

15
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:36,319
people didn&#39;t realize was that the four pairs of stockings were identical, so they

16
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,800
shouldn&#39;t have been any more likely to pick one over the other.

17
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:45,110
That means, if they had four pair of stockings, then they should be 25—if they were selecting

18
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,920
at random, then they should select A 25 percent of the time, B 25 percent of the time, and

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,360
so on for each of the four pairs.

20
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,840
That&#39;s what you might think, but what actually happened was people picked pair A 12 percent

21
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,929
of the time, pair B 17 percent of the time, pair C 31 percent of the time, and pair D

22
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:09,550
40 percent of the time. They had a massive bias. They were far more likely to pick pairs

23
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,900
of stockings that were on the right side, compared to the left side.

24
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,660
Now Nisbett and Wilson did a follow-up experiment, where, again, they asked people to choose

25
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,610
from these four pairs of identical stockings, and, again, people were more likely to choose

26
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,000
those that were on the right, compared to the left. But now they asked people, &quot;Why

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,100
did you choose D? Why did you choose the one on the right?&quot; People said, &quot;Well, I really

28
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:37,110
liked the color of that one, the knit, the sheen, the elasticity.&quot; Then they said,

29
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,700
&quot;Well, do you think the order of those could&#39;ve influenced your judgment in any way? Do you

30
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:46,680
think it was just because this one was on the right, compared to the left?&quot; People&#39;s

31
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,550
reactions to this were classic. I&#39;ll let Nisbett tell the story.

32
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,240
So you ask people to do this, and then you say, &quot;Why did you like this the best,&quot;

33
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,110
and they give you, &quot;Well, the color is better. The feel...&quot; They&#39;re all identical, by

34
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:05,090
the way, except that they looked slightly different. You say, &quot;Okay. Well, that&#39;s

35
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:10,220
very interesting. Thank you very much. Just one question: do you think that the order

36
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:15,030
in which you looked at those things had an effect on you?&quot; People—they&#39;re a little

37
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,500
frightened. I mean, either, &quot;I didn&#39;t understand the question,&quot; or, &quot;I&#39;m dealing with a madman.&quot;

38
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:26,090
Now I think this makes clear that people had very little insight into the basis of their

39
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,620
judgments and why they picked this particular stocking over another. I mean, they actually

40
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,700
reported that they were making judgments on the basis of quality, rather than anything else.

41
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:42,700
That&#39;s right. Richard Nisbett is a huge proponent of this idea of the power of unconscious

42
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:49,590
processing, that we have no real insight into the determinants of our own behavior.

43
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,739
Yes. Let&#39;s see what he had to say.
