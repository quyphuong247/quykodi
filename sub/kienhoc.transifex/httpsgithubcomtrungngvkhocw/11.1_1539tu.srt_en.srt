In today&#39;s episode, we&#39;re going to be introducing an idea that we&#39;ve, essentially, been building

1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,620
up to over the last 10 episodes. Now we promised people, since the beginning, that we&#39;d give

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,840
them the tools to be able to change the world. This very idea, the one that we&#39;re going to

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,460
be talking and focusing on today, we couldn&#39;t have just introduced on day one. We had to

4
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:31,460
lay the groundwork first. Certainly I think it&#39;s the most powerful idea that we can introduce,

5
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:34,489
but we need to do a little bit of myth-busting first of all.

6
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:38,549
Sure. We&#39;ll start off with some situations where we need to make predictions. So, if

7
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:42,970
you—again, in a job interview, you need to predict whether this person will perform

8
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:49,299
well in their job; you want to know whether you should go on a date with somebody;

9
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:54,580
you&#39;re trying to predict whether people will buy a product that you&#39;re developing, whether

10
00:00:54,580 --> 00:01:00,299
to trust somebody with a secret or not; and more important things like deciding whether,

11
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:03,960
or predicting whether a criminal is likely to reoffend or not.

12
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,650
Now when you ask people, &quot;What information do you want that will make you help that decision?

13
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:14,850
What do you think will give you the power to make an accurate prediction?&quot; most people

14
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:24,700
ask for personality or character information like, &quot;Is she trustworthy? What was her upbringing,&quot; things like that.

15
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,670
Janice is talkative or generous, and Tom&#39;s laid-back.

16
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:34,250
Yes, all these personality character things. Now in fact we started off this episode by

17
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,920
giving people a scenario: &quot;A person is walking between two buildings and then encountered

18
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,659
a shabbily dressed man slumped in a doorway with his head down, eyes closed, coughing

19
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:49,280
and groaning. Please list one piece of information that you would like to have in order to predict

20
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,760
whether the person would stop to help the man.&quot;

21
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,659
Now, we&#39;ll tell you the responses that our online students give to this question, but

22
00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:01,840
we&#39;ve already asked our on-campus students. And, again, they tend to list character traits;

23
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,840
they ask for information about the person. They want to know whether the person is male

24
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:13,400
or female. They want to know about their occupation, the history of their upbringing, whether the person is religious or not.

25
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,450
That&#39;s right. Now this example might sound familiar to people. In fact, it&#39;s a parable

26
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:24,530
straight out of the Bible, told by Jesus. The idea is you have a man who&#39;s lying in

27
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:30,920
distress on the side of the road. He was beaten by a bunch of robbers. People are passing

28
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:37,920
on the road and see the man who is in distress. It starts with a priest who just keeps walking

29
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:44,420
right past the man. Then a temple assistant comes and walks right past the man. Finally,

30
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:50,380
a Samaritan comes, sees the man, and lends assistance. He puts him on a horse, takes

31
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,130
him to an inn, and takes care of him.

32
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:54,709
Hence the Good Samaritan.

33
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:59,090
Hence the Good Samaritan—that&#39;s right. You would think that it would have been the priest.

34
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,110
Most people would think that it would have been the priest that would have helped—he&#39;s

35
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,060
a very religious person and so on—but that&#39;s not what happened.

36
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:12,170
In fact, a couple of researchers at Princeton tried to put this into practice in modern

37
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:18,489
days and see whether the Good Samaritan experiment would actually hold up now. They designed

38
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:25,489
an experiment where they had a bunch of Princeton theological students in the seminary who came,

39
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,129
and they filled out a bunch of questionnaires in an office before actually conducting the

40
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:35,200
real experiment where they were going to see whether the Good Samaritan would actually hold.

41
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:42,200
Yep. The experimenters were Darley and Batson. After the participants completed their questionnaire,

42
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,370
they were moving to the other room in order to give their presentation on the Good Samaritan.

43
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:54,370
Now, halfway through in a hallway, they noticed a man who was, again, crouched over. His eyes

44
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:00,849
were closed. He was coughing and spluttering. The question is, would they stop to help them man?

45
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:08,300
Now it turned out that how religious a person was didn&#39;t matter at all, didn&#39;t predict whether

46
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,860
they would help or not. The thing that predicted whether the students would help or not was

47
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,280
whether they were in a hurry or not.

48
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,689
So what the researchers did, just before they left the room, the experimenter said, &quot;You

49
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:25,949
better hurry up. You are already late. You need to give that presentation.&quot; And another

50
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:30,089
group of students they said, &quot;You&#39;ve got all the time in the world. Don&#39;t worry. Take your

51
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:37,089
time.&quot; The participants that were in a hurry: only 10 percent of them stopped to help the

52
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:44,069
man. The participants who weren&#39;t in a hurry, who had all the time in the world: 66 percent

53
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:46,779
of those stopped to help the man.

54
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:48,219
Sixty-three percent, I think it was.

55
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:49,159
Sixty-three percent. Yes.

56
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:54,689
That&#39;s right. You&#39;re exactly right. This is a massive effect, right? Fifty-three percent

57
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:59,300
difference between these two. It&#39;s really good. I mean, this is a whopping effect, and

58
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,249
it doesn&#39;t get much bigger than that. The motivating factor, the thing that actually

59
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:08,809
determined whether they were going to help or not, was whether they were in a hurry.

60
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:14,300
We gave another example at the beginning of this episode as well. We asked people to rate honesty. 

61
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:22,000
This was an experiment by Hartshorne and May. This was way back; I think it was actually 1928.

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,020
In this experiment, what we asked people to do at the beginning of the episode was rate—

63
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,629
their job was to imagine themselves looking at a group of primary and secondary students. 

64
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:42,629
They were trying to measure the honesty of these students across a bunch of different scenarios.

65
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,819
In athletic performance— so how many laps the kids ran around the track then they had

66
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:53,150
to report, but they actually knew how many laps they ran around the track—and whether

67
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,729
or not they&#39;d peek at the answers or cheat at a puzzle, at solving a puzzle.

68
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:02,770
Now we asked people whether these two things are related: reporting athletic performance

69
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:09,180
and whether they solved the puzzle. Again, we&#39;ll tally up these results. The results,

70
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,009
in our own campus students and in the actual experiment, was that most people thought,

71
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:19,080
&quot;Yes, they were indeed related. Definitely related.&quot; In fact, on a scale of about 1 to

72
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:24,309
100, they said the relationship between those 2 measures would be about 60. I suspect our

73
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:29,990
students will be the same, but that didn&#39;t pan out.

74
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:35,559
Hartshorne and May did the original experiment and they showed, no, it wasn&#39;t even close.

75
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:41,259
In fact, the actual relationship between whether they would cheat in one circumstance or another

76
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:48,259
was about 0.15. That is 15 on that rating from 0 to 100. So it was very little relationship

77
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:51,479
whatsoever between these two measures of cheating.

78
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:58,479
They can you make that more concrete for me. So, if a person cheated on their—if a participant

79
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:05,529
cheated by saying that they ran more laps around the oval than they actually did versus

80
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:12,529
whether they cheated by peeking at the answer to a puzzle, that link was not strong.

81
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:18,849
Exactly. People think that once a cheater, always a cheater. This measure of honesty—

82
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:25,569
this stable trait, this essence of honesty—is exuding from the person, and there was nothing

83
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:31,330
there essentially. What did seem to predict whether they&#39;d cheat or not was whether they&#39;d

84
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:37,199
cheat in that particular situation across multiple instances as opposed to across situations.

85
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,339
Now this is really important.

86
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:46,339
Now we talked with Lee Ross. He was an author of an experiment. Jennings, Amabile and Ross—

87
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:53,479
he was the last author on this paper. They actually looked at all sorts of measures of these correlations,

88
00:07:54,949 --> 00:08:01,879
these relationships. If you have a correlation of 0.15 or even less than about 0.30—which

89
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:08,879
seems to be the cap, the maximum relationship between these personality traits—you can&#39;t

90
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:15,740
detect a relationship of about 0.5 if you see it in the real world, if it&#39;s smacking

91
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:21,639
you right in the face. If you see a correlation of about 0.15, a relationship of these personality

92
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:27,809
characteristics, it just looks like noise. It looks like nothing that&#39;s going on whatsoever.

93
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:35,800
Sometimes the person&#39;s going to cheat in one circumstance and not in another, and you just can&#39;t tell.

94
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,900
This is, I think, really important. This is the lesson, essentially, of the first part

95
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:46,450
of today&#39;s episode: that personality characteristics—character traits, morals—the things that we normally

96
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:53,450
think of as exuding from the person—how nice or honest or generous or extroverted

97
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:59,220
or introverted a person is. We think that they&#39;re going to be predictive—and this

98
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,850
is the sort of information we want to know, as you said—but they don&#39;t seem to be predictive

99
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:09,530
at all. Now this is really counter-intuitive. Instead, what does seem to be predictive are

100
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:14,430
things like the situation, exactly as you said, whether the person is in a hurry or not.

101
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,260
We&#39;re going to talk a lot more about different examples of how the person and the situation

102
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:27,260
can be contrasted, but we talked with Lee Ross and Richard Nisbett about this distinction

103
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,590
between the person and the situation, and here&#39;s what they had to say.
