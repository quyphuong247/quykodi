People tend to believe some pretty weird things, from NASA faking the moon landing to pharmaceutical

1
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:18,410
companies conspiring with government departments to keep people sick, and climate change obviously.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,880
Why does that happen? Why do people believe strange things like that?

3
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,649
Well, again, what happens is that people tend to focus selectively on what they consider

4
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:36,649
to be &quot;the evidence&quot;. They may focus on one data point in the case of climate change,

5
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,960
one thermometer somewhere that has been showing cooling for the last ten years, let&#39;s say.

6
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,469
That&#39;s certainly true, but it is only one of about a billion different measurements

7
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,809
that tell us that the climate is changing. Yet by focusing on just this one convenient

8
00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:01,660
piece of evidence that is protecting people&#39;s worldview, they can be absolutely convinced

9
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,050
that they&#39;re right: &quot;Look here, there is this one thermometer. It&#39;s cooling,&quot; and they&#39;re

10
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:11,720
ignoring absolutely everything else. It is extremely difficult to get people to go beyond

11
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,970
that one piece of evidence because doing so would imply that they have to perhaps change

12
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,290
their opinion, and that&#39;s a very difficult thing for people to do.

13
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,850
One of the major drivers in the maintenance of people&#39;s beliefs and the formation of their

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:35,100
beliefs is the role of the media. The media clearly plays a large role. You encountered that yourself?

15
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,710
Absolutely. Absolutely, yes.

16
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,870
Can you tell us a little bit about that?

17
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:45,870
Well, that&#39;s a very mixed bag and not always a nice story because there&#39;s an abundance

18
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:55,030
of evidence to suggest that certain segments of the media have done a very poor job informing

19
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:02,030
the public about a number of different issues, from the mythical weapons of mass destruction

20
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:10,740
in Iraq to climate change. The media are culpable to some extent, in providing an information

21
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:19,320
landscape that isn&#39;t always reliable, to put it mildly.

22
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:25,220
That is a serious problem, especially now that we have the ability for people to choose

23
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:31,850
their own media, in a sense, by focusing on certain sources on the Internet. Information

24
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:38,480
has become far more fragmented. People have become more immersed in their own bubble of

25
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,900
information they like, and that is what they are consuming to the exclusion of everything else.

26
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,260
There&#39;s a lot of research done on that, that people have become more encapsulated, more

27
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:56,260
polarized in general, for that reason because people follow their own instincts and they

28
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:01,860
want to hear things that they like, and so they&#39;re drifting further apart, depending

29
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,910
on their initial preferences. That&#39;s a serious problem.

30
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:12,450
So climate-change deniers probably don&#39;t read &quot;Green Left Weekly&quot; or...

31
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,650
Or the scientific literature. You don&#39;t even have to read &quot;Green Left Weekly.&quot; Yes, very

32
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:23,170
few people do, but they wouldn&#39;t read the scientific literature and the scientific literature

33
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:28,720
isn&#39;t being reported accurately by certain media organsisations. Unfortunately, we do

34
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,200
have a lot of evidence about that, that there&#39;s just a complete disjoint between the scientific

35
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:42,400
literature and the media coverage. Yes, and that is a serious problem. It&#39;s a serious political problem.

36
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,410
People seem to have a—I think we&#39;ve called it an anti-establishment bias, in that sense

37
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:56,410
that the government, the scientists—people are trying to conspire or are trying to further

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,400
their own interests at the expense of the general public. You encountered that before, I assume.

39
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,400
That&#39;s a common element of conspiracy theories—is that the official version is always wrong,

40
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:20,359
whether the official version is something that a government is putting out, or a scientific

41
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:26,499
body, or in the case of vaccinations, the pharmaceutical industry.

42
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:32,620
Conspiracy theories always involve a rejection of an official account. They always presume

43
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:39,620
nefarious intent behind the official position. The government or the pharmaceutical industry

44
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:48,900
or scientists—they&#39;re out to screw you, basically. That is always the case. It&#39;s just

45
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:56,550
one way for people to reject a fact—is by making up a conspiracy surrounding it because

46
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,699
that&#39;s one way out. If you cannot believe or do not want to believe that tobacco is

47
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:09,539
bad for you because you&#39;re a chain smoker, well, then what are going to do? How are you

48
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:13,569
going to justify that? Well, one answer is to say that all the medical scientists are

49
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:20,289
conspiring because they want to deny you this fun, so they&#39;re making up all the stuff. That

50
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:27,289
is the purpose of conspiracy theories. That is why people believe in conspiracies.

51
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:33,600
Getting back to your previous point, citing their grandfather who has smoked every day of his life and lived to 100.

52
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:37,990
Precisely. They&#39;re cherry-picking one piece of supporting evidence while they&#39;re ignoring

53
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:44,069
absolutely everything else. That&#39;s also a characteristic of conspiratorial thinking.

54
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:49,090
My name is Stephan. I think about misinformation.
