Can you tell us about the fundamental attribution error?

1
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,369
Well, actually, I&#39;ll tell you about the history of the fundamental attribution error.

2
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:18,680
Well, the term ‘the fundamental attribution error’ has a strange and interesting history,

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,200
and it has led to some confusion.

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,720
I was doing work a very long time ago.

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,330
It came when Dick Nisbett, whom I know you&#39;ve interviewed, had done a very important series

6
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,809
of studies and written a paper with Ned Jones on actor-observer differences.

7
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:42,809
The hypothesis that I was pushing was that people are situationists for themselves to

8
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,289
much greater extent than they are of others, &quot;I know what situations I&#39;m responding to,

9
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:54,569
so I explain my own behavior in terms of situations. I explain other people&#39;s behavior in terms

10
00:00:54,569 --> 00:00:56,499
of their dispositions.&quot;

11
00:00:56,499 --> 00:01:01,569
When he had shown it to me, I said, &quot;Well, that&#39;s really interesting, Dick, but the fundamental

12
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:08,040
thing is that people overestimate the degree of cross-situational consistency, and they

13
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,350
make trait attributions in general when they shouldn&#39;t.&quot;

14
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,800
With absolutely no hesitation, Ross says, &quot;Yes, Dick, that&#39;s right, but you&#39;re missing

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,680
the main point which is that everybody for everything is too much of a disposionist and

16
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,640
too little focused on situation.&quot;

17
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,990
Then in a later paper when I was discussing various kinds of errors and biases in distinguishing

18
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,550
my work from what I thought was the central message of social psychology, I had said,

19
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:43,070
&quot;Well, the fundamental error is the tendency to underestimate the impact of the situation.&quot;

20
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:49,610
What I meant by that was not that it was fundamental in the sense that it was irreducible. No,

21
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:55,340
what I meant is it was an error in the most fundamental task that we attempt in life,

22
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,960
which is to say: what does that situation tell me about the actor; what does that situation

23
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,960
tell me about the observer? The term fundamental attribution error referred to the fact that

24
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:12,920
people characteristically make an error in that fundamental task.

25
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,370
Then, well, later he comes with a name for that: it&#39;s the fundamental attribution error.

26
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:24,380
That&#39;s now become a staple of psychology. Now you read an editorial, and someone would

27
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,640
say, &quot;That guy made the fundamental attribution error.&quot;

28
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,230
There are two concepts that people understand about that. A columnist—you can count on

29
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,100
columnists to know of that in social psychology. One is fundamental attribution error and the

30
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,709
other is cognitive dissonance.

31
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:42,959
How can we reduce the effect of the fundamental attribution error?

32
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,900
Well, I think there&#39;s a limit to how much you can do. I know that, all day long, I&#39;m

33
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,650
making the error. I mean, I know that in the abstract. I think there is a limit. On the

34
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,810
other hand, knowing that we&#39;re subject to it—I mean, if I hear myself say, &quot;You know,

35
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,920
he&#39;s a very hostile guy,&quot; I say, &quot;Well, wait a minute. What exactly is the evidence for

36
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,680
that?&quot; &quot;Well, he shouted at his kid at the picnic.&quot; I mean, how good is that evidence

37
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,660
really?

38
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,780
If you have the concept clearly in mind, which you can do by giving people many, many examples—I

39
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:23,780
think it takes many examples, many illustrations from everyday life of the way that we can

40
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:29,700
make those mistakes—eventually, it does pack down to a principle that we can sometimes

41
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:36,700
recognize. We can sometimes see the error in ourselves. You can also point to the consistency

42
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:47,180
with which situations affect people.

43
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,260
One thing that strikes me often is that, I say, &quot;You should see such and such a movie.

44
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,340
People are saying it’s great.&quot; People&#39;s initial reaction to that is, “Oh well, I

45
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:04,340
may.&quot; Well, listen. If it&#39;s getting a 92 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, you&#39;re going to like it,

46
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,349
and that&#39;s an end to it. But every now and then, you&#39;re not, actually. But you probably

47
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:15,739
are. If it&#39;s getting a 34 in Rotten Tomatoes, unless you happen to have a real thing for

48
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:22,030
the actress in that thing, then you&#39;re not going to like it.

49
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:29,030
I think people find it hard to accept that generalization, actually. Since I say that

50
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,180
so often, I&#39;ve come to believe it, and really I don&#39;t go to many movies that haven&#39;t been

51
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:39,290
strongly recommended. I get a lot better hit rate than when I say, &quot;That&#39;s the kind of

52
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:45,350
movie I like.&quot; No, no, no. Specifically, how much do people like that?

53
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:52,350
There are some stimuli that are just very powerful, and we make a mistake in assuming

54
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,190
that we&#39;re not going to be one of those people. We way overestimate our own individuality

55
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,880
and our own idiosyncrasy.

56
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,530
But that isn&#39;t the fundamental failing that human beings have. The fundamental failing

57
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:13,180
that really is much more basic is the tendency to assume that the way we see the world is

58
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,940
the way the world really is. That other reasonable people should see it the same way, and if

59
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:24,340
they don&#39;t see it the same way, it&#39;s because there&#39;s something wrong with them—some bias

60
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:31,340
that&#39;s affecting them. It can be the propaganda to which they&#39;ve been exposed. It can be some

61
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:37,870
failing in their intelligence. It can be something about their education. We readily think that

62
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,510
when people disagree with us, it&#39;s because there&#39;s something wrong with them, not something

63
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:47,639
wrong with us, or at least not something that&#39;s affecting both of us that&#39;s making us simply

64
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,800
disagree.
