If we went back to 1970, the day after your out-of-body experience...

1
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,980
Nice time machine you&#39;re going to give me.

2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,240
That&#39;s right, that&#39;s right. And we tried and we approached you and tried to convince you

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,380
that this out-of-body experience could be explained using natural means. What would

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:28,500
it have taken to convince you? Could it have happened? Would you have changed your mind very easily?

5
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:35,509
How interesting. I think you should work on this time machine, and we&#39;ll find out.

6
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:43,590
That&#39;s really interesting. I&#39;m trying—44 years I&#39;ve dreamt of it. I think there would

7
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,969
have been two things going on in my mind at once. I think there even were during the experience

8
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:57,399
those things going on, on the one hand would have been: &quot;But I know. You don&#39;t understand.

9
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:03,100
You don&#39;t understand how real it was. How could you possibly—this is so important

10
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:10,100
to me, and it means so much to me,&quot; and simultaneously would have been going on: &quot;But there has to

11
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,000
be an explanation. What&#39;s going on?&quot;

12
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,950
I&#39;ve always been a scientist in the broader sense since I was a kid. How does that work?

13
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:23,600
What&#39;s this doing? How&#39;s this fire...? How about... And that would have been going on as well.

14
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,170
I think if you&#39;d approached me as perhaps one of the worst members of the skeptical

15
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,030
community, would be like, &quot;That&#39;s rubbish,&quot; then I would have been absolutely against

16
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,460
it. But if you&#39;d come along and said, &quot;Well, could it be there&#39;s something in the brain?

17
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:44,049
Could it be...&quot; I&#39;d have been thinking, &quot;Could be.&quot; I might have been frightened because—the

18
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:49,800
day after, I was so confused. I think you&#39;d have to come a week later when I&#39;ve sort of calmed down a bit.

19
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,219
In a way, when people have these very dramatic experiences, and I&#39;ve met lots and lots of

20
00:01:54,219 --> 00:02:01,219
people who have, you feel threatened if somebody tells you it&#39;s not what you thought. If you&#39;re

21
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:06,670
a sort of rigid, close-minded kind of thinker, and when you&#39;ve had this extraordinary

22
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:12,169
experience, you snap on to your own explanation, then it&#39;s very, very, very hard. You feel

23
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:17,900
frightened when people say, &quot;Yes, but it&#39;s happening in the medulla or the prefrontal cort...&quot; or whatever.&quot;

24
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,769
But if you&#39;re a more open-minded, if you&#39;re good at thinking, if you&#39;re good at asking

25
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:27,320
questions, if you&#39;re good at exploring possibilities, then I think it&#39;s much easier. If the person

26
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,669
confronting you is also like that, &quot;Let&#39;s explore this together. How did it really feel,

27
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:37,019
and then what happened,&quot; and take an interest, then I think I would have responded quite

28
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:41,010
well to you and been, &quot;Hey, you might be my savior. Let&#39;s go and find out.&quot;

29
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:48,010
But I didn&#39;t have a savior. I had to go and find out myself. In an age where the science

30
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:52,949
was—there wasn&#39;t any neuroscience. We had very little idea what was happening in the

31
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:59,169
brain. The paranormal stuff out there and the new age and the Age of Aquarius and all

32
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:04,290
that stuff, the end of the &#39;60s was like a world apart, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s taken me

33
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:11,290
a lifetime, I would say, to bring together extraordinary experiences and neuroscience.

34
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,220
A lot of people who are going to be watching these videos and taking this course would

35
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:22,919
have had something similar, some vivid experience that they can&#39;t really explain. We&#39;ve done

36
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:29,919
these questionnaires in this course and in others where students have heard a story from

37
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:38,040
parents about ghosts or they&#39;ve experienced something themselves. Given what you know

38
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,250
now about opinion change and changing your own opinion, what would be the best way to

39
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:51,250
approach somebody and change their mind or at least get them to consider the alternatives

40
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:54,630
that it might not be what they think?

41
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,190
I&#39;m glad you made that switch. I don&#39;t go at anyone who&#39;s had an extraordinary experience,

42
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,660
&quot;I want to change their mind,&quot; unless they are just so rigid, I&#39;d despair and I don&#39;t

43
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:10,660
want to have anything to do with it. But for most of the people I&#39;ve met, so many have

44
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,739
had an experience they can&#39;t understand, and they don&#39;t know what to do with it.

45
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:21,100
The first thing to do is to listen and probe. Some people will be very rigid, particularly,

46
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,760
I think, of near death experiences where it has so much of religious connotations. In

47
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:31,360
our culture, this tends most often, not always, but to be Christians who are convinced that

48
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:38,360
they have seen Jesus or pearly gates, the Judgment Day; they&#39;ve been to heaven, or they&#39;ve

49
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,890
seen heaven, or they&#39;ve seen hell. They&#39;ve got all this baggage.

50
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:49,700
What I first do is, &quot;Okay, then what happened? Then what happened? Could you see anything else?&quot;

51
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,910
Get them to loosen up because if what they&#39;ve done is had this extraordinary experience,

52
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,690
typically in a near-death experience, if it&#39;s a long one, they will typically start with

53
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:04,150
a tunnel, like I did, and go into the light. They&#39;ll have an out-of-the-body experience,

54
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,160
and they&#39;ll watch what&#39;s physically happening or seem to. Then they&#39;ll go on to other worlds.

55
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,340
After that, it becomes dependent on your culture and your upbringing. So if they are a religious

56
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:20,890
person, Muslim or Hindu or whatever it might be, or a Christian, they kind of know where

57
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:24,550
they are and they&#39;ve set their own experience in that box.

58
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:30,490
So part of my job is to actually get them to remember other things. What did these pearly

59
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,130
gates look? Were they really gates? What else could you see around? Very often they&#39;ll come

60
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,220
up with all sorts of other stuff which they hadn&#39;t really thought about, which will help

61
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:44,720
them. The point is I&#39;m grounding it in what really happened because I want to know, because

62
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,720
I&#39;m always thinking what&#39;s going on in their brain? Where is this relating to what&#39;s happening

63
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,690
in the temporal lobe? What&#39;s happening in their visual cortex where we know the tunnels

64
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:58,130
are generated? What kind of tunnel was it? What emotional state were they in when it

65
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:03,600
started? Because very often, these experiences have a most wonderful profound sense of,

66
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,690
&quot;It&#39;s all alright,&quot; which is probably endorphin-based but it&#39;s—saying that doesn&#39;t put it down.

67
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,250
It&#39;s got to have a physical basis somehow, but that can be quite an important thing also

68
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:20,490
for people to know it possible as a human being on this earth without gods spirits

69
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:26,639
and everything else to know that it&#39;s alright and you&#39;re alright. It&#39;s okay.

70
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:33,130
I sort of like to help people just to talk about their experiences. Sometimes that will

71
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,740
lead them to their own interest and their own inquiry, and they&#39;ll go off and read stuff

72
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,790
and they&#39;ll talk stuff, and I let them do that. Other times they&#39;ll just reject it and

73
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:49,560
go, &quot;Yes, well, I know and I saw Jesus.&quot; Okay. I might want to—but you know that&#39;s not

74
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,470
going to work, there&#39;s no point. I&#39;d rather people use their experience as basis to go

75
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,840
on and try to understand themselves and the world, than I would try to change their mind

76
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,280
to the truth. We don&#39;t know the truth. We know little bits. We know a lot. We know as

77
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,910
much as we can know—that nothing leaves the body in these experiences, and that there

78
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:13,460
is no spirit and no soul and so on—but so much more to find out.

79
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,919
I can&#39;t do it myself, so these people who&#39;ve had experiences—actually they&#39;re important

80
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,870
and they&#39;re the ones who can explore more and find out more.

81
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:26,880
Yes. One of the real knee-jerk responses with opinion change is just to remain passive and

82
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,650
unconvinced. Yes, I know what you&#39;re telling me, but that&#39;s fine. I&#39;m going to continue

83
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,500
my merry way and not do much about it.

84
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:41,389
Yes, we&#39;re trying to provide students with the tools specifically to look at the data

85
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:47,680
and to try not to remain passive and unconvinced, figure out what it would&#39;ve looked like in

86
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,830
other sorts of scenarios where it didn&#39;t happen just the way that it did in yours.

87
00:07:53,830 --> 00:08:00,400
I think it&#39;s absolutely foundational to being a good thinker. That reminds me of two things.

88
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,919
One&#39;s a bit depressing. It&#39;s when I used to do interviewing for admissions to the university

89
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:09,510
in psychology degree. I would set some kind of challenging scenario as purely hypothetical:

90
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:16,510
&quot;What if it turned out that black people can&#39;t do this,&quot; or some challenging thing. I&#39;m not

91
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:22,510
saying it&#39;s true. I&#39;m just saying, suppose it did, what are the possible explanations?

92
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:28,090
Now the good student, the one I&#39;m going to admit, says, &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s true but,

93
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,510
if it were, it could be because of their upbringing. It could be because of whatever. It could

94
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:38,289
be, it could be, it could be. How would I find out? Blah, blah, blah.&quot; The student I&#39;m

95
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:42,260
going to say no, is going to go, &quot;But that&#39;s not true! But that&#39;s wrong! How could you

96
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:47,200
say that?&quot; That&#39;s sort of the rigidity.

97
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,570
But it also makes me think more about the kind of paranormal things that we&#39;re thinking

98
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:59,370
about and the strange experiences that people have. The student I want, the student I will

99
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:05,540
enjoy, would go, &quot;Well, I think that this happened but, hang on a minute, okay, it&#39;s

100
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,570
emotionally difficult. It&#39;s challenging to me. I don&#39;t like it. But let me imagine a

101
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:15,610
purely mechanistic explanation. Let me imagine an explanation in terms of a religion that

102
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:19,910
I don&#39;t know much about or isn&#39;t mine. Let me imagine...&quot; And they would actually be

103
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:25,130
willing despite the, &quot;It hurts. I don&#39;t like this,&quot; to do that.

104
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:32,130
Now I&#39;ve had a lot of experience in my life of that anguish. I mean, the world&#39;s a simple

105
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:38,630
place if you know how it works. You know, I&#39;m in here. I&#39;m me. This is who I am. This

106
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,950
is what I do. That&#39;s how the world—you know. It&#39;s a simple place. It&#39;s horrible that it

107
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,170
doesn&#39;t work as a life strategy, but you feel you&#39;re going to be safe that way.

108
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:53,520
You could imagine me having started out with all these beliefs. I honestly believed that

109
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,890
out there is this great psychic field and that I was going to be the great heroine of

110
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:02,910
science who is going to change the world forever because I&#39;d prove once and for all there are

111
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:09,910
paranormal phenomena. Duh. There aren&#39;t any. This was not a comfortable time for me. It

112
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,050
was horrible. I&#39;m wrong.

113
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,800
Now also imagine me, I mean, not only with my crystal ball and my tarot cards, but—I

114
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,930
suppose I&#39;ve got colored hair still; there&#39;s a bit of that left—but, you know, the late

115
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:28,930
&#39;60s, early &#39;70s, wafty clothes and headbands and &quot;Wow. Peace, man,&quot; all that. I looked—everything

116
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:36,540
about my life was like that, and I had to give up—well, let go of—let go of all

117
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:45,100
of that in order to move forward, to ask questions, to learn. I look back now and, &quot;Good,&quot; because I found out so much.

118
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:51,450
Also, all that led me to exploring a whole lot of different things, and the only one

119
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:58,149
that stuck was meditation. I&#39;ve been training in Zen for 30 years, and that is also training

120
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:05,149
in flexibility, letting go, openness to experience, openness to different explanations. That training

121
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:12,529
goes along very, very well with a scientific mind that asks questions and doesn&#39;t take

122
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:17,140
the first theory I come up with as the truth and that&#39;s it.

123
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:23,390
The goal of the course is to improve people&#39;s everyday thinking. Do you have any recommendations

124
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:28,149
for how people in the course might improve their everyday thinking?

125
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:35,149
Yes. Start with your intuitions. Watch yourself. Feel those intuitions coming up, and question

126
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:43,880
them, because some of your intuitions will be fine: &quot;Yes, I think if I lean on here it&#39;ll

127
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,560
be fine,&quot; but some of your other intuitions: &quot;I&#39;m in here looking out through my eyes.

128
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,160
I know what that is. That person&#39;s nice,&quot; a lot of your intuitions won&#39;t be. So question

129
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,600
your intuitions and be willing to give them up if there&#39;s a good reason to do so.

130
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,339
That&#39;s hard but, yes, throw out some of those intuitions.

131
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:06,910
My name is Sue. I think about consciousness.
