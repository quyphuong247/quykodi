Now many of the claims made at the MindBodySpirit Festival included multiple endpoints, variable

1
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:18,200
windows of time, post hoc ergo propter hoc, and some even made appeals to science and to credentials.

2
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,440
Dr. Anna Rolfes, MD, PhD...

3
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,440
It&#39;s done through the radionic apparatus, which was designed by a western master of

4
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:34,760
yoga, Dr. King. We can quantify, and we do quantify. It&#39;s very exact. It&#39;s a science.

5
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:41,760
Prayer is a science, and we use prayer to manipulate the pranic energy so that we can

6
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:48,010
raise the karma of individuals and raise the karma of mankind.

7
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:53,710
But people should be really careful when it comes to appeals to authority. Yes, if somebody

8
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:59,319
is an MD or if they have a PhD or if they&#39;re a top professor, that could give you an indication

9
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:03,620
of their expertise. It could be a useful heuristic for how much they know about a particular

10
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,430
area, but it doesn&#39;t mean that the claim that they&#39;re making is necessarily true.

11
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,030
In fact, in this course, we&#39;ve tried to be really careful about not introducing our guests

12
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:19,320
as distinguished professor so and so, even though many of them are. We wanted people

13
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:26,320
to evaluate their claims and what they said based on what they said, not on who they are.

14
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,350
Same goes for us.

15
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,940
Yes, exactly. We want people to evaluate our claims based on their merits rather than our

16
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:40,240
titles. The same goes for bafflegab. Now, you were interviewing somebody at the MindBodySpirit

17
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:47,300
Festival, a kinesiologist, and I was sitting behind the camera and I had no idea what he was saying.

18
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:54,390
The way the western medical system is set up is looking at what happens when that&#39;s

19
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:02,280
already happened, rather than looking at going back and winding the clock back to when it

20
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,930
started that depletion process because the nonlinear effect is when you actually start

21
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:12,930
dealing with origins of the trauma that created the debt—that energy debt—it starts to

22
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,470
actually prove the situation in the present time, which kind of makes no sense because

23
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,710
you&#39;ve already depleted the system. It actually somehow miraculously collapses the time and

24
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:29,710
space of the causal point, and it starts to reconstruct itself, which is quite nonlinear.

25
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,600
I had a really difficult time tracking exactly what he was saying as well. I really couldn&#39;t

26
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,860
get what he meant by nonlinearity. I think the vast majority of what he was saying was

27
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:48,280
just, as you said, bafflegab. That&#39;s something that we really need to be careful with right

28
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:55,130
across all of these different areas. When somebody starts using jargon-filled explanations

29
00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:01,440
of things, citing quantum physics and things, just be careful, back up, or even ask them

30
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:08,900
to explain to the level that you can actually understand and track what it is that they&#39;re saying.

31
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:15,140
I think another really nice example of a cognitive mechanism that&#39;s operating in people&#39;s belief

32
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,750
in the paranormal is what&#39;s called a one-sided event. Now this is a really nice example.

33
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:27,690
It&#39;s also the name of this segment: &quot;The phone always rings when I&#39;m in the shower.&quot; You

34
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:33,810
can imagine lathering up in the shower, and you can hear the distant ringtone of your

35
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:39,380
phone in the other room. You could just imagine getting out, drying off, and just picking

36
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:45,080
the phone up just at the wrong time when they just hang up. That&#39;s definitely an event.

37
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,640
That&#39;s going to stand out in memory.

38
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,500
What&#39;s not going to stand out in memory is you being in the shower, lathering up and

39
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,230
thinking to yourself, &quot;Hey, the phone isn&#39;t ringing.&quot;

40
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,440
Or how many times the phone rings, and you&#39;re not in the shower.

41
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,670
Exactly. These are non-occurrences, and they just don&#39;t factor in to any sort of equation

42
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:10,780
when you&#39;re evaluating how often the phone rings when you&#39;re in the shower. They just

43
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,680
would not occur to you ever.

44
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:21,600
You&#39;re talking about these salient events. I spoke to Tom Gilovich who had a really good example of salient coincidences.

45
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:28,690
Looking at psychics in particular, what makes them seem so successful then in their predictions?

46
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:36,960
Well, any time a prediction is confirmed, it&#39;s just—it takes over your attention.

47
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:45,190
It&#39;s a very dramatic thing. What you see is that local event: someone said this was going

48
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,680
to happen, and now it happened. What you need to do is step back and say, &quot;Alright. This

49
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,440
one little data point here—where does that fit in in a broader pattern of evidence?&quot;

50
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,190
It&#39;s only if that&#39;s repeated a bunch of times that we really can trust it.

51
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:06,720
Carl Sagan, in one of his books, starts out with an anecdote where he had a dream that

52
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,080
his father had died and woke up. I may be exaggerating here but at least, as I remember,

53
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,770
he woke up in a sweat, that, &quot;Oh my god, my dad died. I got to check in on him.&quot; He checks

54
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:22,770
in on him, and his dad was fine. He said to himself, &quot;Look, if it just so happened that

55
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:29,530
I had that dream and my dad had died,&quot; there&#39;s no way that anyone could have disabused him

56
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:35,260
of the idea that he didn&#39;t have a prophetic dream. But, in fact, we populate our dreams

57
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:41,060
with familiar people. Familiar people die. If you look at all the people in the world

58
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,900
and how often we dream, there&#39;s going to be a bunch of times when that happens just by

59
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,830
pure chance. But good luck trying to convince the individuals who&#39;ve had those dreams or

60
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:57,830
the people close to them that that was just one of this broad fabric of pattern of noise.

61
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,759
You&#39;re just not going to convince them of that.

62
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:06,620
Now, as Tom just said, these sorts of coincidences happen all the time. When you&#39;re dealing with

63
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:13,620
a large population, it happens a lot. With a planet of several billion people, one in

64
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:20,030
a million events happen one in a million times, which is a lot in a big population like that.

65
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:25,300
But even if you look at the small scale, if you take—if you&#39;re at a party, say, with,

66
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:32,300
say, 23 people at a party. What are the chances that two of those 23 people are going to share

67
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:39,430
the same birthday? It&#39;s a lot more likely than you would think. In a group of 23, the

68
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:45,350
fact that two people are going to share the same birthday is 50/50, a 50 percent chance

69
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:49,180
that two people are going to share the same birthday in a group of 23. That&#39;s a lot more

70
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,840
likely than most people would think. In fact, we often use this as a classroom demonstration.

71
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,460
It doesn&#39;t take that large of a class to really make that point. If you increase it, if you

72
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:05,789
go from 23 to 30, you have 30 people in a room, the chance of two people sharing a birthday

73
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:10,289
is 71 percent, which is pretty good.

74
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:15,199
But what most people do in this sort of problem is what happens when you&#39;re dealing with paranormal

75
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,570
phenomena as well. They seem to relate it to their own experience. When you ask, &quot;What&#39;s

76
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:26,199
the likelihood of two people sharing the same birthday,&quot; they think, &quot;What&#39;s the likelihood

77
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:32,050
of two people sharing my birthday?&quot; What are the chances that it&#39;s going to be on the 17th

78
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:37,300
of January? And they&#39;re looking at it through that lens, instead of through all of the lenses

79
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:44,300
of the people at that party. The chance of somebody in the room sharing your birthday,

80
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:50,669
it would take 253 people to share the same birthday as you, which is a very different

81
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:57,669
problem than anybody sharing the same birthday. It really nicely highlights how we misinterpret

82
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,979
this idea of coincidence.

83
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:06,240
Yes. We&#39;ve dealt with several of the cognitive mechanisms that are operating in things like

84
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,080
paranormal belief but also just evaluating claims and predictions in general.

85
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,880
Now I hope people spend a bit of time on working through those general mechanisms because I

86
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:23,880
think they&#39;re really helpful. It&#39;s so easy to discount those people who believe. We spent

87
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:29,690
all day with them. These people at the MindBodySpirit Festival were lovely. We told them what we

88
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:35,180
were doing. We&#39;re teaching a course on everyday thinking and we study intuition. They wanted

89
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:41,409
to share their lives and their experiences with us. There is no way that these people

90
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:47,970
were deliberately trying to deceive people just to make money. They were genuine.

91
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:52,870
So what&#39;s happening? Okay, let&#39;s give them the benefit of the doubt.

92
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:59,170
If these mechanisms aren&#39;t occurring to you or I, as we walk around, why would we think

93
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:05,830
that they occur to believers? Let&#39;s give them a chance and try and work through why it is

94
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:11,900
these people believe strange things. Don&#39;t just discount them as being silly or believing everything that they see.

95
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,380
That&#39;s right. Now we&#39;ve talked about a bunch of mechanisms, from multiple endpoints, variable

96
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:21,580
windows in time, one-sided questions. These don&#39;t exactly roll off the tongue, do they?

97
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:27,550
People—they probably didn&#39;t occur to most people who are watching this video, just like

98
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:35,100
they wouldn&#39;t occur to most people who are practicing the psychic arts or paranormal beliefs.

99
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:41,260
So why would we hold them to the same standard, in a sense? Why would we think that they&#39;re

100
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:46,940
guilty of these things necessarily? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that easy. I don&#39;t think we can

101
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:53,940
just attribute it to malice or thinking that they&#39;re out to deceive us in some sense.

102
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:59,350
They may be. There may be, and there are some people out there who even know these things

103
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:04,020
and try to frame them in such a way as to manipulate people, but I don&#39;t think that

104
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:09,720
that&#39;s going to explain most people&#39;s behavior. But if that&#39;s the case, if most people who

105
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,540
are taking this course and even people who are practicing these things have these opinions

106
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,930
about the way that the world works, it&#39;s not going to be easy to change their minds, to

107
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:30,900
show them about all of these cognitive operations that are happening that lead them to believe in supernatural explanations.

108
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:37,930
Now I talked to Susan Blackmore about exactly this. Now you remember, she had a very salient,

109
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:44,720
vivid experience, out-of-body experience. I asked her what it would take to change her

110
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,720
mind about the nature of that experience and what it would take to change her opinion about

111
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:56,940
the source of out-of-body experiences. She had quite an interesting answer.
