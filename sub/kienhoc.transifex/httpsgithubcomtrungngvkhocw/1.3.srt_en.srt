It’s quite apparent. Yes, it sounds like that, sort of, but it’s like visual illusions.

1
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,850
You’re also aware at the same time that it isn’t really like that.

00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:21,760
People have reported seeing a face on Mars, or Elvis in the form of a tree, or even seeing

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,210
the Virgin Mary in a toasted cheese sandwich. This sort of expectancy effect is really common

4
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,949
throughout cognition, and psychology, more generally.

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:38,949
There are certainly a lot of famous politicians who have had distorted memories. Memory evidence

Imagine that you’re sitting in front of an auditorium and you’re asked to perform

8
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,809
for a roomful of people by tapping out a tune for everyone to hear. How many of the 100

9
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:56,610
listeners would be able to name the tune that you’re tapping?
