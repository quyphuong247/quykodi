In the last episode, we talked about learning how to learn, and so we provided people with

1
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,139
a few tools that they could use to try to learn information and remember that information

2
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:19,750
for a longer period of time—things like retrieval practice, interleaving, desirable

3
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:25,810
difficulties, more generally. Hopefully, people will be able to use those skills to be able

4
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:31,860
to help them improve their learning across the board when it comes to learning a new

5
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:37,909
language, a new skill like the guitar, or a sport, or even formal training like calculus

6
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:40,879
or computer programming or everyday thinking.

7
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:47,479
We&#39;re going to continue on that theme today in providing people with skills that they

8
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:53,579
can use in their everyday lives. We&#39;re going to be borrowing something from science, specifically

9
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,519
some of the tools that scientists use in the lab that we can use every day.

10
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:04,129
Yes, I agree. In fact, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything particularly special about what scientists

11
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:09,540
do in the lab. Yes, they&#39;re performing experiments; they&#39;re doing data analysis; they&#39;re using

12
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:16,540
statistics, but these are just formal ways of finding things out, of detecting strangeness,

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,310
of picking up whether something fishy is going on. Now what we do in our everyday lives,

14
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,290
we may not realize it, but we&#39;re actually using some of the tools of science as well,

15
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:36,200
but we use these informally; we use these intuitively. This idea came up in my conversation actually with Tom Gilovich.

16
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,330
Can you tell me about the intuitive scientist?

17
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:46,330
Sure. That&#39;s a metaphor that people have used to draw a parallel between what scientists

18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,670
do, which is try to understand the world—and there are some formal tools for doing that—and

19
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,680
what scientists try to do professionally and of course we all try to do in our everyday

20
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:01,240
lives: to figure out the world around us. There a lot of similarities between what we

21
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,960
do as people in our everyday lives and what scientists do. In fact, science developed

22
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:14,960
out of the kinds of mental habits that we had. We, over time, recognized what the problems

23
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:22,480
are and what are the things that allow the most powerful conclusion. So it would be odd

24
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,480
if regular thinking was just radically different than scientific thinking. It&#39;s different but

25
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,450
there are some parallels between them.

26
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:37,670
We&#39;re trying, just like the scientist does, to identify: what are the phenomena out there?

27
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:44,300
Okay, there are the phenomena. Why are they that way? We ask why all the time. You know,

28
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,990
there used to be this beer commercial in the United States of, &quot;Why ask why?&quot; It&#39;s a brilliant

29
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:56,600
little tagline because by raising it, it&#39;s illustrated: we just do that all the time.

30
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,849
Something happens, and we just want to know why. That&#39;s what scientists do, and that&#39;s

31
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:03,569
what we do in our daily lives.

32
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:10,030
This idea of applying the formal tools of science to our everyday lives came up in my

33
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,920
conversation with Michael Brenner and Pia Sörensen, who are teaching another edX course

34
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,580
called Science and Cooking. Here&#39;s what they have to say.
