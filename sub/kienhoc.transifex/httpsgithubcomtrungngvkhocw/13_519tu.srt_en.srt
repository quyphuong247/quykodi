Right from the beginning of Think101, we&#39;ve given you example after example of how difficult

1
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:20,380
it is for you, for us, to make sense of the world. We&#39;re inundated with information, misinformation,

2
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,700
and there are many different ways that it can be interpreted. We see patterns where none exist.

3
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:30,300
We see relationships where there are none. We see, hear and remember things that never happened.

4
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,580
In order to make sense of the world, we have to rely on simplified models or heuristics

5
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:41,010
we&#39;ve talked about before. This is the area of system one, which is also very lazy, and

6
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,930
so relying on system one, we also do so at our own peril. There are a lot of mistakes

7
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,440
and fallacies that we can make as a result.

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,400
We&#39;ve talked about the availability heuristic. We&#39;re completely at the whim of the media

9
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,890
when it comes to shaping how common or how risky we think things are. We tend to pigeonhole

10
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,670
people, depending on how similar they are to our stereotypes. We&#39;re sensitive to anchors.

11
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:10,110
We tend not to unpack or read things as carefully as we should.

12
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,300
We&#39;re trying to provide you with the tools in this course to be able to improve your everyday thinking.

13
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,580
We&#39;ve given you the tools to think better, tips for avoiding fallacies, techniques for

14
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,500
learning and retaining information. We&#39;ve identified the factors that are important,

15
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:30,300
useful and predictive. We&#39;ve told you where to find evidence to distinguish fact from fiction.

16
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,950
Now you&#39;re one of the very few people in the planet with this knowledge. You now have a

17
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:42,100
better understanding of how the mind works than most judges, lawyers, politicians and even most scientists.

18
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:47,000
Now we&#39;ve given you the tools to think better. We want you to use those tools to do better.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,900
We want you to think about what you can do to make the world smarter, more rational, less superstitious.

20
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:58,900
Look around you and see what&#39;s broken and exactly what you can do to fix it.

21
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,940
How can you increase rationality in the world? What can you do in your life, in your job,

22
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,860
to convince people to slow down, to consider the evidence?

23
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,920
The next time you see a claim that strikes you as dodgy or strange, or the next time

24
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:20,100
you or a friend are complaining about something, ask yourself, respond with, &quot;Okay, what are we going to do about it?&quot;

25
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:24,409
Does your company use personality tests or interviews? What are you going to do about it?

26
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:30,629
How do you convince your child to read? How do you convince a classroom full of children to read? 

27
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:34,590
How do you increase the literacy rates of your entire country?

28
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,129
If there&#39;s a change that you want to see, what are you going to do to make it happen?

29
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:42,819
Throughout the course, we&#39;ve given you the tools to be able to change the world.

30
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:45,709
Now it&#39;s up to you to use them.

31
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:52,400
We want you to tell us, to show us, to share with the thousands of people who are taking this course what you&#39;re going to do to change the world.
