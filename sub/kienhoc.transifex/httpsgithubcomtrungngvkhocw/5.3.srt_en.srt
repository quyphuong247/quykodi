Now we talked to our students a lot about this, and certainly based on my own experiences,

1
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:14,030
I completely agree with John. Many of us spend the night before an exam just trying to cram

2
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,190
weeks and weeks of material into our heads. The same goes with a big presentation that

3
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:23,570
you have to give in front of people. What strikes me, though, is how we can get it so

4
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,960
wrong. I mean, we&#39;ve had years and years of schooling. We&#39;ve had lots of time to

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,019
figure out exactly what the best strategies are to get information into our head, but

6
00:00:34,019 --> 00:00:38,429
we use these inefficient strategies. I mean, how is it that we can get it so wrong?

7
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:41,969
That&#39;s a really interesting problem, and it&#39;s one that people are actually working

8
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:48,399
on. It&#39;s not done and dusted. John Dunlosky, who we talked to, has done a fair bit of work.

9
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,699
Bob Bjork, who we&#39;re going to hear from next, is also working in that field, and Nate

10
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:57,999
Kornell, They&#39;re trying to figure out exactly that: how do people get it so wrong? How is

11
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:03,159
it that you can have a lifetime of experiences and learning; you&#39;ve tried a lot of things

12
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:08,650
that work and a lot of things that don&#39;t, yet we continually make these sorts of mistakes

13
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,100
like cramming. Cramming is not effective for actually having things stick in your memory,

14
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:19,700
so why do we continue to use it? I think from reading their work, there are at least a couple of reasons.

15
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:26,660
One reason is that it is effective in the short-term. So if you have a big exam and

16
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:31,440
you study as hard as you possibly can, it&#39;s probably enough to get you by. It&#39;s enough

17
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,140
to get you over the line. You&#39;ll pass that exam, and you&#39;ll see, you&#39;ll directly

18
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:42,050
associate those efforts for studying the exam and that passing mark. Those two will go hand

19
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:47,980
in hand, and you&#39;ll see that connection. What you won&#39;t see is the lack of effect

20
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,520
six months later. So if you&#39;re taking an advanced course in that topic that you&#39;ve

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:58,170
been cramming for, in six months&#39; time, you&#39;re not going to see the fact that you

22
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,390
don&#39;t know anything that you&#39;ve studied for six months previously. That lack of association,

23
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,360
I think, is important.

24
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,030
The second reason that people continually think that cramming is important, I think,

25
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:17,030
is something called fluency. Now we touched on this with respect to the availability heuristic.

26
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:24,530
People mistake the size of the category with the ease with which it goes down. The same

27
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:29,610
thing&#39;s kind of happening here. People are mistaking the fluency, the ease with which

28
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,380
the information that they&#39;re studying is going down, with learning. They&#39;re not the

29
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,090
same thing, and so when you&#39;re cramming, you&#39;re massing all of this information together;

30
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,780
you&#39;re repeating each of these things, then you reread it, and you—all of this massed

31
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,890
information feels like it&#39;s going down and feels genuinely like you understand that material,

32
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,510
and you&#39;re mistaking that ease of processing with learning.

33
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:59,250
Yes, and it&#39;s exactly the same for re-reading. Before, when you&#39;re studying for an exam

34
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,540
or before a presentation, you read through the material you&#39;re supposed to remember.

35
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,040
Then, &quot;I&#39;ve got to do something else,&quot; so I&#39;ll read through it again. Every time

36
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,580
you read through it, it just feels better and better. It feels like you&#39;re learning,

37
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:19,580
but obviously that&#39;s a mistake. It feels good, and it seems to be one of those things

38
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:27,600
again that our predictions about how things are actually working are completely disjointed with reality.

39
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:32,260
That&#39;s exactly right, and I think that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to work on, particularly

40
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,630
on this episode. It&#39;s a little bit more myth-busting, because this one is hard. This

41
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:42,349
one isn&#39;t easy because what we think works for learning is almost—it&#39;s not even that

42
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:47,220
there&#39;s no relationship between what we think and reality, but in fact it&#39;s a negative

43
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:52,760
relationship. What we think works is the exact opposite of what actually works.

44
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,220
So we talked to Bob Bjork about this, and he&#39;s been working in this field longer than

45
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,980
anyone I know, and he had some pretty good advice about what works and what doesn&#39;t.
