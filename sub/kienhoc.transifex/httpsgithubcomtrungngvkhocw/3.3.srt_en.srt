Richard Nisbett is a really strong proponent of this idea of unconscious processing: the

1
00:00:10,129 --> 00:00:15,690
fact that we really have no insight into why we do the things that we do. In fact, there&#39;s

2
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,520
a lot of evidence for this coming at different angles.

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:27,520
A fellow named David Dunning provided a meta-analysis, a kind of analysis of analyses, of all of

4
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:33,550
these sorts of experiments. There&#39;s one really good demonstration that we&#39;re all

5
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,180
guilty of, I think, and that&#39;s something called the planning fallacy. It&#39;s an old

6
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:43,650
idea actually developed Daniel Kahneman back in the &#39;70s, but it&#39;s as you would expect:

7
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:49,869
when there&#39;s any sort of complex thing that we have to do in the future, we&#39;re really

8
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:55,750
bad at planning for it. You can imagine this happens all the time with large projects.

9
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:01,549
I think the mother of all planning disasters was right here in Australia at the Sydney

10
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:06,010
Opera House. When it was being built, it was originally estimated to be about 7 million

11
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:11,460
dollars and it was supposed to be completed in 1963, but it blew out. I think it wasn&#39;t

12
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,830
completed until a decade later for 102 million dollars.

13
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:22,830
I mean, that&#39;s the large scale, but despite our best intentions to do something, to plan

14
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,420
for this thing, an assignment, whether it be anything, we&#39;re just horrible. It&#39;s

15
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:35,630
like we only see the best situation that&#39;s going to get us from point A to point B.

16
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:40,550
I&#39;m totally guilty of the planning fallacy. I go away on holiday and I bring four books.

17
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,380
I&#39;m like, &quot;Yes, I&#39;m going to read on the plane, and I&#39;m going to read on the

18
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,810
beach. It&#39;s going to be awesome,&quot; and of course by the time the end of the holiday

19
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,780
rolls by, I&#39;ve read maybe a couple of chapters.

20
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:56,400
That&#39;s right. David Dunning, not just the planning fallacy, he provides a bunch of different examples.

21
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,920
Another one that&#39;s kind of on that line of seeing yourself in the best frame, &quot;I&#39;m

22
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,370
going to be this diligent scholar,&quot; and so on, is something called the above average

23
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:12,370
effect. We like to see ourselves as being above average in every respect. We&#39;re more

24
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:19,450
talented. We&#39;re better drivers. We are more attractive. We&#39;re more moral. We&#39;re more

25
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:26,450
sympathetic. There&#39;s a whole bunch of different experiments to demonstrate that we judge ourselves

26
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,650
to be far better than average.

27
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,850
In my conversation, brief conversation, with Geoff Norman, who we&#39;re going to meet again

28
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:39,260
on episode five, he describes this idea of how bad we are at self-assessment.

29
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:44,490
If I think of all the people who are watching this video, I&#39;m going to ask them all a

30
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:50,670
simple question: are you in the bottom half of driving skills? Now half you should say

31
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:56,480
yes, but having seen this performed, having done this in live time, probably one out of

32
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,900
a hundred will say yes, and yet half of you, by definition, are in the bottom half of driving skills.

33
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,480
The evidence is absolutely crushing that people cannot assess where they&#39;re at. They basically

34
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,489
start with a premise of they&#39;re at about 70 percent and then go up and down from there.

35
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:18,050
I&#39;d like to think that we&#39;re a little better than Geoff Norman lets on in terms

36
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:23,090
of predicting how good of a driver we are or something. Now, obviously, we&#39;re teaching

37
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:29,090
this stuff, so you&#39;d like to think that we&#39;re immune to this planning fallacy and

38
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,620
above average effects and so on, but that&#39;s not actually the case.

39
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,300
There was another experiment doneâ€”well, more of a survey, I supposeâ€”by Patricia

40
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:43,300
Cross, and she looked at university professors and asked them to judge how good they were

41
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,640
compared to their colleagues, and 94 percent of these university professors judged themselves

42
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:58,390
to be better than average at teaching. Obviously, average is 50 percent, and we&#39;re way off

43
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,569
on that scale. I&#39;d like to think that we&#39;re kind of immune to these sorts of effects and

44
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:06,680
biases, but maybe I&#39;m just being a little bit too idealistic.
