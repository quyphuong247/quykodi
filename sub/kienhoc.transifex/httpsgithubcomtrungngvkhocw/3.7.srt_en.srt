Alright guys, we&#39;ll get cracking.

1
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:18,660
Welcome to week 3. We&#39;re going to be giving you a few questions about something called intuitive

2
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,740
physics; we&#39;ll ask you to do first when we hand them out is just to work on them yourselves,

3
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,680
then we&#39;re going to discuss them as small groups, don&#39;t change your answers.

4
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,160
I know it might be tempting if you kind of see someone else with a completely different answer than

5
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,280
you but don&#39;t worry about it, just leave it as it is, and then we&#39;ll discuss them, that&#39;s

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,980
the interesting bit, if you guys have different answers. So it&#39;s flat on the table, it&#39;s like

7
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,890
this on the table and the ball goes flying through, then it exits. Which way does it

8
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:52,880
exit? A lot of people think that the ball goes through the coil and then exits and continues

9
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,070
on in that trajectory. How many people went with this one? When it continued on in that

10
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:03,489
direction. Two. I know I&#39;ve seen more than that, come on, I saw a good five or six of

11
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:10,400
those. And the correct answer: directly up. Yea, uh-uh. Sure

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,800
So that&#39;s kind of the point of this exercise, so we have, nobody is trained to be a fighter pilots, or astronauts, or coil

13
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,729
handlers, or something, in the first case. You don&#39;t have a lot of experience with these

14
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:32,200
types of problems. Even though they are fairly counterintuitive a lot of people don&#39;t see

15
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,979
these solutions. The punchline here is that there is nothing that&#39;s going to happen if

16
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,259
you&#39;re wrong in these particular cases. Your understanding of how these sort of things

17
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:47,959
work is good enough to get you by. You&#39;re all living, right? You&#39;ve functioned pretty well this far.

18
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:54,489
It&#39;s pretty important that you understand that these

19
00:01:54,489 --> 00:02:00,899
heuristics, these shortcuts, these rules of thumb, that we&#39;re going to be talking about in this courseâ€”

20
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:07,899
your failings, in a sense, your irrationalities, aren&#39;t really failings in any sense they&#39;re

21
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:14,959
almost sufficient to get you by in the world; they&#39;re good enough. People who grew up in

22
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:22,530
east Asia, so are culturally East Asian, Mongolia, Chinese, Japanese, they prefer this image

23
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:29,510
here on the right, and people from Western cultures, even if you&#39;re racially Asian but

24
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:36,510
you grew up in a Western Culture, you&#39;re more likely to prefer images on the left.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
One of the explanations for this, or the interpretations, is that east Asians prefer

26
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:52,930
context in the images that they create and generate, whereas westerners: it&#39;s more object and person based

27
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:02,069
than it is context based. Try to guess which pictures were drawn by people from Western

28
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:08,609
cultures versus east Asian cultures. Put your hand up if you think this was drawn by a Westerner.

29
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:15,499
Put your hand up if you think it was drawn by an Easterner. Can anybody try and articulate

30
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:20,999
what they found that the difference was. Westerners pretty much stuck to exactly what you said

31
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:26,079
to put in, and the Easterners added some extra stuff in there, and we kind of kept it pretty basic.

32
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:31,900
Yep. The sky, it looks blue to us, but like in the air at the moment you can&#39;t see blue.

33
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,600
If there was a mirror maybe where that table was, and that was a wall,

34
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,600
I feel like I would be able to see myself in it. I assumed that because it was going

35
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,200
forward that the air at that speed would push the bomb backwards,

36
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,600
if that makes sense. I have no idea. I really have no idea about physics and

37
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:58,000
I was just kind of, you know it&#39;s moving forward, which would kind of push it back a little bit, that sort of thing.
