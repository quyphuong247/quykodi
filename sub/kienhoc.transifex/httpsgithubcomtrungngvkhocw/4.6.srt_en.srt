Tell me: where there more males or females on that list?

1
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:14,319
Well, it was a bit of a trick question, I think. We had 48 names in that list, 48 faces,

2
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:23,379
48 celebrities actually. Of the 48 celebrities, we had half of them were male, and half of

3
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:31,680
them were female, and so there was no correct answer for the quiz.

4
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:38,680
But what we did do was we took the male faces, the 24 males, half of those, 12 of those were

5
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,480
famous celebrities. People might remember from the list there was Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise,

6
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:56,040
Steve Jobs, people—faces that most everyone in the course would recognize.

7
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:03,890
Now the thinking here with this sort of experiment—it’s been done time and time again—but the idea

8
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:10,890
here is that my bet would be that most people would have remembered the 12 males that were

9
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:15,319
in that original list—maybe not explicitly, but they may have remembered them—and when

10
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:20,179
they were thinking back to the list of males, these people may have stood out. Now the female

11
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:25,009
list, the 24 of the females, were all B-grade celebrities, for the most part, so a few of

12
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:27,709
them they may have remembered but not many at all.

13
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:33,929
So when you’re trying to make an estimate of males relative to females in that list

14
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:39,189
of faces, hopefully some of the males would have come to mind more easily. The idea here

15
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:45,399
is that it’s that ease of processing, that ease of cognitive processing when thinking

16
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:51,209
back to the males that went down a little bit easier, and so people would misinterpret

17
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:56,899
that ease of processing for the category being larger than the female category.

18
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:02,450
But are people actually remembering? Do they have a list of the celebrities in their heads?

19
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,700
Do they remember Brad Pitt? Is that on internal list?

20
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,599
Not necessarily. I don’t think it has to be explicit.

21
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:14,459
Now there’s another good example that highlights this. What we can do is we can show students

22
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:20,900
in the course these two-letter strings: the letter string at the top and the letter string

23
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:26,459
at the bottom. What we want them to do is estimate, given these two-letter strings,

24
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:32,849
how many words you can construct given the letters in these letter strings. Now even

25
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:39,840
without having any of those words come to mind, people will quickly recognize that the

26
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,069
letter string at the bottom will produce more words than the letter string at the top.

27
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:50,200
It’s exactly the same principle. Both of these examples are examples of the availability

28
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:57,200
heuristic, which is simply the number of instances that come to mind of that particular category.

29
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,430
People misinterpret the ease of processing which could be due to any number of reasons

30
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:11,420
as being indicative of the larger category. I think this happens a lot in the media. When

31
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:18,209
we hear about deaths, we tend to hear about shark attacks and plane crashes and terrorist

32
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:25,209
attacks. We don’t hear much about the people who died that night on the 6 PM news of asthma

33
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:32,959
or heart disease. I’d be willing to bet that people would pay far higher insurance

34
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,659
premiums to protect themselves from the things that they hear a lot in the media about how

35
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:44,709
people die, versus what the base rates might actually show the people are most likely to

36
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:48,549
die of. We have an example of this. A couple of years

37
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:53,769
ago in Brisbane, there was a reasonably major flood. You and I had to leave our homes and

38
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:58,540
find somewhere else. It was a big mess, and it took a couple of weeks to clean up, et

39
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:05,529
cetera. Now after that event, I bet that the people who were directly affected, like we

40
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:12,529
were, by that flood are now far more likely to buy flood insurance than people who were

41
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,450
unaffected, and I think that they’d be far more willing to pay higher premiums for flood

42
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:24,450
insurance. But also, of the time, as our memory fades of that event, I think that willingness

43
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:31,680
to pay those high premiums will drop, and people will be far less likely over time to

44
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:38,229
pay a lot for flood insurance. Exactly. So this link between availability,

45
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:43,150
the availability heuristic, and risk perception has been demonstrated time and time again,

46
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:50,150
and that’s absolutely the case. Obviously the media is extremely important in shaping

47
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:57,169
our perceptions and the decisions that we make. If all we hear about, for example, is

48
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:04,169
as you said, about homicides, about these sort of newsworthy deaths as opposed to things

49
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,160
like heart disease or liver cancer and so on, then we’re going to have enormously

50
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,849
skewed perceptions of how common these types of deaths are. In fact, that is the case.

51
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:19,389
If you were to ask people how likely someone would die from a shark attack, they would

52
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:25,639
say that it’s way more likely than it actually is, at the expense of things like heart disease

53
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:29,430
and so on, which people really underestimate because they never hear about them. You might

54
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,870
hear about them with respect to family members or friends or something but…

55
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,580
Yes, when you’re bombarded every night in the media by these things…

56
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:44,580
Yes, exactly. So the media really shapes that. Danny Kahneman talks about this idea of availability

57
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:52,680
but also the idea of availability cascades. If there’s a relatively minor event that

58
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:59,680
happens—say, a tremor or something like that—and you have this news agency who blows

59
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:06,069
it out of proportion, makes it larger than it actually is, then people start to freak

60
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:11,360
out a little bit more, which then feeds more coverage, which results in people freaking

61
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,889
out a little bit more. It just kind of cascades, and it gets worse and worse. In fact, he talks

62
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:22,180
about these availability entrepreneurs, these people in these news agencies that make a

63
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:29,180
living out of doing this. It’s never been more important, I think,

64
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:36,539
to consider where we’re getting our information and what sort of information we’re exposing

65
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:43,039
ourselves to because that fundamentally shapes the way that we see and perceive the world.

66
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:50,039
If all we’re doing is surrounding ourselves with second-rate news, then we’re at the

67
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,050
whim of these kinds of news agencies.
