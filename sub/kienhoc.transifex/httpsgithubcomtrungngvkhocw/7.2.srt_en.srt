In the last episode, we spoke about the intuitive scientist. In our every day, essentially,

1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,779
we have the same job as scientists. As the MythBusters said, &quot;We are trying to figure

2
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:19,160
things out, to make predictions about the world.&quot; I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything particularly

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:25,000
special about the scientific method or the experimental process that&#39;s off-limits to non-scientists.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,509
It&#39;s really just a matter of thinking critically.

5
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:33,570
I think you&#39;re exactly right. Now when we&#39;re dealing with these sorts of everyday issues—we&#39;ve

6
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,820
talked about it since episode two, in dealing with complex and ambiguous events and trying

7
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,179
to use simplified models to navigate that complexity and ambiguity.

8
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:52,000
One way of doing this, I think, is looking at this idea of bistable images or ambiguous figures.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Now if we take the Necker cube, this can be interpreted in one of two ways:

10
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:05,950
you can look at the Necker cube and see the front face as either being on the lower left,

11
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:10,000
or the front face as being in the upper right.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
These are the two ways of seeing a Necker cube, and you can&#39;t see them both at the same time, obviously.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,900
You can see it one way or another,  which is why it&#39;s bistable.

14
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:26,790
There are several examples of these. Another one is called the duck-rabbit illusion.

15
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,060
Now you can either see this figure as a duck or a rabbit, so the two little bits are either

16
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:41,500
ears or it&#39;s the duck&#39;s bill. Another figure is called the old woman or young woman, depending

17
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:47,850
on how you&#39;re looking at it. So it&#39;s either an old woman kind of looking forward or looking down,

18
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,920
or a young woman who&#39;s looking back. Again, that one takes a little bit more effort

19
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,730
to see exactly what they are.

20
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:59,280
The more recent one—this one&#39;s been going around the internet a lot. It&#39;s called the

21
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,720
spinning dancer. I suspect a lot of people have seen this one. It&#39;s often accompanied

22
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:14,400
by a statement about personality, like—people who are right brained see her spinning clockwise;

23
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:20,430
people who are left brained see her spinning anticlockwise, whatever that means, I don&#39;t

24
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:26,080
know about left brain versus right brain. It&#39;s complete nonsense. In fact, most people

25
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,500
see her spinning clockwise, but it takes a little bit of effort for people who, if they&#39;re

26
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,890
watching this, to spend a bit of time looking at this spinning dancer and see if they can

27
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,640
get her to reverse. That&#39;s just another example of an ambiguous figure.

28
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,640
Now each of these examples in the bistable sort of illusions or figures—there&#39;s only

29
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:54,090
two ways of seeing it: it&#39;s either counterclockwise or clockwise. It&#39;s either a duck or a rabbit.

30
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,580
It&#39;s either a young woman or an old woman. These are kind of toy problems. These aren&#39;t

31
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:06,580
the sort of problems that we encounter every day. Now if you take a more realistic figure,

32
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,569
for example—say, a picture of your mother or of your partner—if you&#39;re looking at

33
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:18,000
this two-dimensional photograph of your mother or partner, depending on who&#39;s looking at

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,990
it, you encounter very different experiences. You interpret them in very different ways.

35
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:27,490
You have a lifetime of experience looking at a photograph of your mother. When you&#39;re

36
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:33,209
looking at that photo, your heart rate might increase. You might look at the—they&#39;re

37
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:39,260
highly familiar. You might have a few memories that come to mind—very different from a

38
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,660
complete stranger who&#39;s looking at that particular face. They might judge it as being attractive

39
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,500
or not, or make a judgment about hair color, any number of things.

40
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:55,500
But these are all just figures, images, photographs. If we take even—it goes a little bit more

41
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:03,360
abstract in looking at this type of things—take an abstract concept like promotion. Imagine

42
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:10,640
that you&#39;ve just been promoted at work. Now that idea of promotion also depends entirely

43
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:18,060
on your experience on—it can be interpreted in any number of ways. You have increased

44
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,939
responsibility at work. It also means you&#39;re going to have to put in longer hours. The

45
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:25,240
way that you look at that promotion is going to be very different from how your partner

46
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,080
looks at that promotion, or your boss looks at that promotion, or your colleagues look

47
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:36,080
at that promotion. That interpretation—or in predicting whether to promote somebody—that&#39;s

48
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:42,909
a completely different frame depending on who&#39;s looking at it, who&#39;s doing the interpretation.

49
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:45,879
These are the sort of problems that we&#39;re dealing with every day. These are the same

50
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:51,909
problems that scientists have to navigate, particularly psychologists—cognitive psychologists—when

51
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:58,400
trying to predict people&#39;s behavior in the future. That complexity, that ambiguity, is

52
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,669
something that we have to deal with and try to simplify as a result, which is a point

53
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,599
that keeps coming up again and again.

54
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:10,600
Yes, yes. The light physicist Richard Feynman talks about this in a series called &quot;The Pleasure of Finding Things Out.&quot;

55
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:17,009
Now you&#39;re talking about predicting human behavior, but let&#39;s say we&#39;re trying to predict

56
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:22,139
where something will land when we drop it. So if we have a perfect sphere in a vacuum,

57
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:27,289
you know, in this perfect environment, we have some reasonably good mathematical models

58
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:30,039
about predicting where exactly that sphere will land.

59
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:36,419
Now if you scale that up just a little bit and predict where feather will land if I drop

60
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,930
it on the floor, think about the factors that are interacting with that feather that will

61
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:47,509
determine where it lands. You&#39;ve got wind resistance, friction, gravity, the surface area.

62
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:52,949
There are factors in the environment that will determine where that thing will land.

63
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:59,949
The complexity balloons out when we just increase it a little bit.

64
00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:07,369
Now scale up from predicting where that feather will land to predicting what this bag of cells

65
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:14,099
will do tomorrow—to predicting human behavior. The complexity explodes. There are millions,

66
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:21,099
billions, trillions of different factors that will determine what we will do, and we&#39;re

67
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,199
trying to predict that behavior in the future.

68
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:33,199
So how do we do that? Well, what scientists do is try and reduce that complexity and ambiguity.

69
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:39,879
They try to isolate the variables that they think will be important that will make good

70
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:45,710
predictions. That&#39;s what we have to do in our everyday lives as well. Now think about—you&#39;ve

71
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,960
got 30 minutes in a job interview. You&#39;re trying to interview somebody to decide whether

72
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,069
to give them a job or not. Now, as we said, I think in episode three, there are lots of

73
00:06:55,069 --> 00:07:00,909
ways that the complexity there makes it such that the interviews are not very predictive

74
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:06,240
of their future behavior, but if you constrain that complexity a little bit by doing a structured

75
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,309
interview, that will help you make better predictions in the future.

76
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:13,099
Ask them all the same questions exactly in the...

77
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:19,689
Exactly. You&#39;re reducing the ways that—you&#39;re reducing the number of variables that can

78
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:25,460
have an effect and so, therefore, hopefully increasing your ability to predict that behavior

79
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,669
in the future. It&#39;s the same for whether you&#39;re trying to figure out how well you&#39;ll do in

80
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:36,180
a final exam. You can look at your past behavior and see. Don&#39;t rely on that feeling of learning,

81
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,749
as we spoke about in episode five. Rely on your previous behavior and this objective

82
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:47,900
evidence that you have, and I think that will help you make better predictions about human behavior.

83
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:52,009
That&#39;s right. We&#39;re going to talk about that even more next. We&#39;re going to talk about

84
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:58,099
this idea of multiple predictors: all of these interacting complex factors that we&#39;re trying

85
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:05,099
to constrain, trying to overcome in predicting future behavior, future events, and that kind

86
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,509
of leads to things like magical thinking, superstition, as we&#39;ll see next.
