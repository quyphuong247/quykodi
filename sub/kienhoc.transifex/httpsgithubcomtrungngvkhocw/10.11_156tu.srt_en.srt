This very idea—the one that we&#39;re going to be focusing on today—we couldn&#39;t have

1
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,540
just introduced on Day 1. We had to lay the groundwork first.

2
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,430
What information do you want that will help you make that decision? What do you think

3
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,160
will give you the power to make an accurate prediction?

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:28,160
People overestimate the degree of cross-situational consistency and they make trait attributions

5
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,369
in general when they shouldn&#39;t.

6
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:35,600
Now what do you do? Do you stick to your guns? You can quite clearly see that the answer

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,859
is B, and do you shout out &quot;B,&quot; or do you go with the group?

8
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:44,460
What are the elements of the situation, the circumstance, the context? What are the trigger

9
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:51,059
points that are necessary in order to elicit the behaviour that we&#39;re looking for?

10
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:58,200
But even when they&#39;re as plain as the nose on my face, I miss them. I tend to... I&#39;m just not thinking straight.
