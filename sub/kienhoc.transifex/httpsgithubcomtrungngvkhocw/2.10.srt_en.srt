We tend to believe that, with the exception of a few tricks or illusions and so on that

1
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:16,260
might fool us into seeing things a particular way, that the world is essentially as it is.

2
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,260
I mean, this is kind of an extension of this idea of the videotape, that we&#39;re just going

3
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:27,650
through the world and taking things in; it&#39;s being recorded and we can reproduce it faithfully.

4
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:33,280
Obviously, that&#39;s not the way the world works, but this idea that the world is like

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:41,200
that, the world is as it is and we just interpret in particular ways—it&#39;s called naïve realism.

6
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:48,250
This is a notion that Lee Ross has been working a fair bit on. He told us a little bit about

7
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,960
naïve realism and how he sees it working. Here&#39;s what he had to say.

8
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:00,820
Human beings necessarily think that the world is the way they perceive it to be. If I look

9
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:13,200
around this campus, I see walls and windows and grass. To me, that is the way the world is.

10
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,479
Einstein memorably said, &quot;Reality is an illusion,&quot; and what he meant by that is

11
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:26,479
that what we experience in reality is kind of the interaction that occurs between the

12
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:32,560
kind of stardust that we&#39;re made of and the kind of stardust that&#39;s out there. To

13
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,560
a physicist, the world is made up of these infinitesimally tiny strings of matter and

14
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:47,049
energy fields—nothing like the way we perceive it to be. What we perceive as reality is our

15
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:53,579
way of responding to that input and that construction.

16
00:01:53,579 --> 00:02:00,579
Of course, we have to assume that the world is the way we perceive it, and in many ways

17
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,310
we perceive the world similarly. It serves us really well to believe that: this naïve

18
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:12,209
belief that there&#39;s a one-to-one relationship between the way we perceive and the way they

19
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:18,069
really are, but it can get us into trouble, particularly when other people come to that

20
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:24,650
world with different histories, different needs, different goals, different biases,

21
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,830
different experiences.

22
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:31,360
That&#39;s really cool. The exact same thing came up in my conversation with John Vokey.

23
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,010
The world doesn&#39;t really look the way you think it looks. As you know, even what you

24
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,680
call solid objects are just made up of molecules. There are big spaces between them, so it doesn&#39;t

25
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,819
really look like that. There are no colors in the world. Color is something you bring

26
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:49,689
to the processing of the information you receive.

27
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:55,530
So, in some sense, what you just said is always true. You&#39;re never really seeing what&#39;s

28
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:01,939
out there. That&#39;s one level of explanation. In fact, hearing things that most other people

29
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:05,299
would argue are not there or seeing things that other people would argue are not there

30
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:09,000
is not saying much because that&#39;s always true.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,049
What, I think, is meant is to try to dissociate, I think, what you&#39;re asking about from a

32
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:20,069
straight hallucination, when there actually is no input source that should lead to that

33
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:24,209
conclusion about something being out there, which is usually the result of brain disease

34
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,950
or probably induced with some chemicals as well, where the brain&#39;s processing gets

35
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,819
quite distorted and it&#39;s actually doing more than just trying to put together a reasonable

36
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:40,390
construction—it actually creates it, whole cloth. There are people who do suffer

37
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,969
from various diseases that in fact lead them to really see things that aren&#39;t out there

38
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:48,120
in the sense that another person standing right there with them is just, &quot;There&#39;s

39
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,129
nothing there, nothing.&quot; Those are hallucinations, though.

40
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:55,189
We&#39;re talking about in these particular cases where we could lead people to think

41
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:58,579
that they heard, &quot;I saw a girl with a weasel in her mouth,&quot; something a bit different.

42
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:04,780
We&#39;ve given enough information. Much like we do in the real world, these aren&#39;t threshold

43
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,950
phenomena that either is or isn&#39;t. It&#39;s that your perceptional systems are accumulating

44
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:14,359
evidence. Then you can also make use of all sorts of biases that you&#39;ve developed over

45
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:19,030
your lifetime to, at some point, say, &quot;Yes, I&#39;m confident enough to go with claiming

46
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:23,190
I hear this or see this,&quot; and later it turns out, &quot;Oh, it was just the way the blanket

47
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,390
was folded.&quot; &quot;I thought it was my dog in the bed, but it turns out it was the blanket

48
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:30,630
that was folded, but because I expected my dog there, that&#39;s what I saw.&quot; That would

49
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:39,300
be not a hallucination. An illusion of the sense or type, I guess, is the way to think about it.

50
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:43,530
That&#39;s all we&#39;re really doing, and that&#39;s just standard normal processing. There&#39;s

51
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,320
nothing unusual happening here. It&#39;s just what we&#39;re doing all the time. We&#39;re not

52
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,590
really seeing the world as it is; we&#39;re just trying to create something that&#39;s reasonably

53
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,890
predictive of allowing us to act in the world.

54
00:04:54,890 --> 00:05:00,700
Hopefully, people are going to recognize how naïve this idea of naïve realism actually

55
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:06,780
is. As Lee Ross, and now John, have indicated, it doesn&#39;t really make sense to talk about

56
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:13,780
things objectively as seeing objects and events as they are in the world instead of being

57
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:20,340
filtered by our own experiences. It should be clear now to people watching this that,

58
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:26,480
again, seeing, hearing, and remembering all involve considerable knowledge of the world.
