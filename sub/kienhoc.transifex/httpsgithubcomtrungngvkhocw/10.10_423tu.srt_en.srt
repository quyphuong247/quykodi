Today we&#39;re going to be talking about specific health claims that we want you to investigate.

1
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:21,930
Specifically: whether caffeine helps you study; should fluoride be added to my drinking water?

2
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,420
and, can meditation reduce symptoms of depression?

3
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,779
So first of all, we want you to rate your first impression. We want you to make a commitment,

4
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:35,460
and then we want you to do some research. Summarise the evidence. And finally, rate

5
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,760
your final impression: whether you changed your mind about that particular topic.

6
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,640
Think about what you&#39;re doing. You&#39;re trying to distinguish fact from fiction in an area

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,540
that you probably have no expertise in. So you&#39;re going to have to read, again, past

8
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:56,460
the headline, past the first couple of quotes, and get to the references. This is an expertise

9
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,700
effect. I can&#39;t give you the tools to discriminate fact from fiction. You have to keep looking

10
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,450
at it, get feedback on your own decisions. That&#39;s what we do in our PhDs, and I think

11
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,799
we can do that better in our everyday lives as well.

12
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,649
I&#39;ve been drinking coffee for a whole lot of time, and I don&#39;t know very much about

13
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:21,200
it other than the structure of the molecules. Does the molecule help you study, or does the symbol help you study?

14
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:27,500
There was limited but some evidence that there was some improved memory recall, but only over a 24 hour period.

15
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,639
There was no available evidence about the side effects of water fluoridation, that was

16
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:36,840
actually peer-reviewed. We don&#39;t know if this was a publication bias.

17
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,749
Topically, yes there&#39;s lots of evidence to say that that&#39;s fine, if you just put it on

18
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:44,359
your teeth, it works well. But actually, when you look at putting it in the general water

19
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,719
supply, the quality of the research isn&#39;t that good.

20
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:52,279
In conclusion we found that meditation may be able to help with certain symptoms of depression,

21
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,299
but there&#39;s still further research needed.

22
00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:00,049
Mindfulness based meditation can reduce state levels of depression and anxiety. However,

23
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:03,569
it needs to be constantly practiced to maintain the reduced levels.

24
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:09,530
Most of the studies said that, &quot;Yeah, people who were doing meditation felt better,&quot; but

25
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,099
that is easily explained by something like regression to the mean. Because we don&#39;t have

26
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:16,829
a &#39;no treatment&#39; group to compare to. And if you&#39;re motivated to feel better, you&#39;re

27
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:21,150
going to start thinking more positively anyway, and you&#39;re going to feel better.

28
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,379
To really be able to say yes or no, we actually have to go and look.
