When I&#39;ve watched &quot;CSI,&quot; you get the impression that the tests that they run, like a DNA test

1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:15,670
or fingerprint comparisons, are completely objective measurements made by a machine.

2
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:20,300
You&#39;ll stick the sample into the machine, the machine will flash &quot;Match&quot; and maybe even

3
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:27,300
put up the picture of the person who matches this fingerprint or this DNA profile. I think

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,870
what the shows miss is the extent of which a determination that something matches or

5
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:43,400
is similar depends upon a subjective judgment by an expert. In other words, human beings are involved in it.

6
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:48,760
That&#39;s part of what makes forensic science interesting to me as a psychologistâ€”is how

7
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,800
much human judgment and decision-making is involved in the production of forensic science

8
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,160
evidence. The evidence that&#39;s presented to the jury is not the product of some machine

9
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:07,160
only. It&#39;s also the product of a human being&#39;s analysis of what the results of the instrument

10
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:15,689
mean or what the comparison means. The surprising thing is how often different experts can reach

11
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,509
different conclusions when evaluating crime scene evidence.

12
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:28,319
How is it that two people or a person can look at some piece of forensic evidence and

13
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,789
come to the wrong conclusion? What are the cognitive mechanisms that might be going on?

14
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:39,789
Well, it can only happen when there is some ambiguity in the evidence itself. As I said

15
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:44,729
earlier, in some cases the evidence is just clear-cut and no one would disagree, but in

16
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:51,800
other instances, there&#39;s an ambiguity; there could be multiple interpretations and an expert judgment is required.

17
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:58,889
Okay, when experts approach a task like that, just as any other human beings, they can be

18
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:08,630
influenced by what they expect to see or to some extent by what they desire to see. People

19
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:15,320
who expect to see something and are highly motivated to see that thing are more likely

20
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:21,260
to see it. They&#39;re more likely to interpret an ambiguous stimuli in a manner that&#39;s consistent

21
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:28,260
with what they think or want to see. We all do this. Most of the time our use of expectations

22
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,090
to help us interpret stimuli is very helpful because most the time our expectations are

23
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:46,620
correct, but sometimes they aren&#39;t correct.

24
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:53,620
The problem for a forensic expert is how to prevent this process of what&#39;s sometimes called

25
00:02:54,490 --> 00:03:00,090
Observer Effects, the tendency to see what one expects or desires to see, how to prevent

26
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,610
that from coloring one&#39;s interpretation of the evidence in ways that undermine the quality

27
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:10,010
of the evidence that&#39;s going to be presented to the jury. I think the best way to do that

28
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:17,010
is to try to minimize the amount of contextual information that the expert receives. If the

29
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,530
expert approaches the comparison not knowing whether it&#39;s supposed to match or not supposed

30
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:29,530
to match, or what the answer is supposed to be, then it&#39;s more likely that the expert&#39;s

31
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:36,740
judgment will be determined just by the scientific data and won&#39;t be colored by the surrounding

32
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:43,740
contextual information that may create what we would think of as a bias.

33
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:49,640
My sense is that the justice system works best if the scientific experts are basing

34
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,810
their conclusions purely on the science and don&#39;t allow those conclusions to be influenced

35
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:01,810
by other factors, such as other evidence that might suggest that the person did or did not

36
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,920
do it, or police theories of the case, or their suspicions about the case, and so on.

37
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:16,970
The same argument is made for use of blinding procedures in other areas. When instructors

38
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,889
grade exams, often they do it without knowing the student&#39;s name. I think it&#39;s a good practice

39
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:26,430
because it prevents the professor from being influenced by other information about the

40
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,779
student that may lead the professor to think that this student is likely to perform well

41
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:37,779
or not perform well. We would like the instructor&#39;s grading of the examination or the paper to

42
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,199
be based on what&#39;s in the examination or in the paper and not in any of the surrounding

43
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,560
information. Same thing should go for forensic scientists.

44
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,659
This course is about the science of everyday thinking. What advice do you have for people

45
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:55,650
out there who want to think better and do better in their everyday lives?

46
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:02,650
That&#39;s a good question. Boy, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve mastered how to think well myself. I

47
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:14,029
think we all struggle with thinking clearly, with marshaling our thoughts. Sometimes when

48
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:22,279
I have been benefited by trying to be very systematic and decompose problems into elements

49
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:28,389
and think about them carefully, piece by piece, but the fact is I rarely make actual decisions

50
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:35,389
that way. I think a lot of our decision-making happens intuitively, through processes that

51
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:43,879
we don&#39;t fully understand and really can&#39;t analyze. The kind of advice that I give people

52
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:57,200
about making better decisions is to be careful about what information you allow yourself to consider.

53
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,939
If you&#39;re a forensic scientist and if you want to avoid being influenced inappropriately

54
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:10,349
by extraneous information, make sure you don&#39;t know that information. If you&#39;re an instructor

55
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:16,499
and you want to avoid being influenced by how attractive or charming the students are

56
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:21,409
when you grade their exam, grade their exams blindly.

57
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:28,409
There are circumstances in which less information sometimes leads to better decisions. Knowing

58
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:35,039
what those circumstances are and then blinding yourself to inappropriate information is maybe

59
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,309
one of the best ways to improve your decision-making.

60
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:44,729
My name is Bill. I think about proof. I think about how proof is generated. I think about

61
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:50,300
how people respond to proof. I think about proof that&#39;s put forward that isn&#39;t really proof.

62
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:52,249
What don&#39;t you think about?!
