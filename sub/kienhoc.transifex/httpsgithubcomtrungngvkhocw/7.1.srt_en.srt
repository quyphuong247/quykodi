One of the hardest things that we have as academics is to inspire students. Obviously,

1
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:16,000
you guys have no trouble inspiring people. What&#39;s the key to getting people excited about science?

2
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,580
We are not trying.

3
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:25,580
Yes. We just do what we find interesting and fun, and Discovery and our production has

4
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:29,290
found that if we&#39;re having a good time, it makes for good television.

5
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:35,170
They really have been great about getting out of our way. We got hired into this show.

6
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,390
We didn&#39;t conceive of it. We got hired in this talent, and then we sort of grew up and

7
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,880
into and around the show. It grew into being ours. We&#39;re now executive producers. But throughout

8
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,610
all of that, we&#39;ve never been thinking about inspiring kids or making science palatable.

9
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:56,090
We&#39;ve really concentrated on solving our own curiosity and telling a good and reasonable

10
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,910
narrative story about that. That&#39;s it.

11
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:06,149
We get e-mails every week from like PhD grads that say they got into their field because

12
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:11,170
of us. That&#39;s how long we&#39;ve been on the air. We still try not to think of the children

13
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:17,000
when we&#39;re making the show because as Jamie says, &quot;Yes, we&#39;re just trying to write a story about our own curiosity.&quot;

14
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:22,340
Well, the beauty of that is that it puts out a message that science isn&#39;t just for guys

15
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:28,999
in lab coats. It&#39;s for anybody that simply wants to do a good job of answering a question,

16
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:34,670
and so that&#39;s all we do. We simply want to do a good job when we got hired to do this

17
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:40,619
show. We&#39;re dealing with urban legends. We got to figure out some solution to some problem

18
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:46,749
or answer a question, so we started to get real methodical about it. Well, that&#39;s science.

19
00:01:46,749 --> 00:01:53,749
I think that one of the things that we do do that makes the show connect with all different

20
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,229
ages is that we really always try and start from the idea: what would two guys on a Sunday

21
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:02,459
do in their garage to figure this out?

22
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:07,560
The first test is the stupidest—not the stupidest, but the simplest. Well, you know,

23
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,620
we could—and we often have to un-fancy our ideas. We start off on a wild case, &quot;So, first,

24
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,819
we&#39;re going to get some tubing and we&#39;ll run some valves at...&quot; &quot;No, no, no. Let&#39;s do it

25
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:21,409
with razorblades and chewing gum. We can set something up and just try it.&quot; Always trying

26
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:26,700
to start from the simplest and then moving to the complex, so that there really is a progression.

27
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:29,890
One of the things that we&#39;ve learned is that science programming up until &quot;MythBusters&quot;

28
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,860
is what we would call science demonstration programming. Say, here&#39;s a concept, terminal

29
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,099
velocity, and here I&#39;m going to show something that demonstrates it. We don&#39;t have any of

30
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:41,099
that background, so we&#39;re like, &quot;All right. Well, what&#39;s the terminal velocity of a penny?&quot;

31
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,400
&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; &quot;Well, instead of doing it with math, let&#39;s actually conduct an experiment

32
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,269
that figures it out.&quot; That experimentation is—the audience is right with us. They don&#39;t

33
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:55,019
know what&#39;s going to happen, and neither do we. The fact is that there&#39;s no producer that

34
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,019
writes down the story of our episodes before we start to film. We have an outline, and

35
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:03,609
we almost never follow it. When we come to a result we didn&#39;t expect, we change directions.

36
00:03:03,609 --> 00:03:09,030
So why do you think people find science so intimidating?

37
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,140
There&#39;s a place in which culturally we&#39;ve place science in this elite category. It&#39;s

38
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:21,140
like, &quot;Well, that&#39;s for people who are smart,&quot; and it&#39;s not. It&#39;s for anybody.

39
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:25,420
When we started doing this show, we thought we came to the table with some skills because

40
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,239
we both worked for decades in the special effects industry. About three or four years

41
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,989
ago, we were on a plane, and we were just kind of reassessing what we&#39;ve learned over

42
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:38,719
the previous eight or nine years. We were like, &quot;Wow, it&#39;s totally incredible,&quot; just

43
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:45,670
from our own personal standpoint. All we&#39;ve been doing is arguing over critical thinking

44
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:52,670
and an ethical methodology that is robust and rigorous and makes sense to both of us.

45
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:58,989
Those sort of arguments, while in the momentj they might not be entertaining to be having,

46
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:06,700
the fact is that they breed such a refined result that we totally understand that that&#39;s part of the process.

47
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,469
I was talking to a friend the other day who&#39;s an editor. He&#39;s a filmmaker, and a wonderful

48
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:17,079
filmmaker. Somebody asked him if he was good at math. He says, &quot;I&#39;m great at math. I&#39;m

49
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:22,400
just not so good at numbers.&quot; He had a beautiful point because, as an editor—of course, editing

50
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,350
is all about this careful math and alchemy of timing and rhythm and beats in telling

51
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,810
a story. It&#39;s not about doing equations or an algorithm, but it&#39;s really about being

52
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:37,880
sensitive to a rhythm, and that&#39;s math. He&#39;s right. He is great at math, even though he

53
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,670
can&#39;t add or balance his checkbook. If more people understood that, more people understood

54
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:48,840
that science is merely thinking critically—so you could answer a question that someone presents

55
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,980
to you just by sitting down and running some numbers, or thinking through the whole problem

56
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,060
rather than thinking, &quot;Well, that&#39;s something for smart people to figure out.&quot;

57
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,440
Do you think people can—I mean, obviously, you guys have the equipment and the time.

58
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:08,440
It&#39;s your jobs to do this sort of thing. Can everyday people do myth-busting?

59
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:15,100
The simple translation of what you just asked is: can everyday people answer questions, ask and answer questions?

60
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,920
Yes. Can they think critically through a problem?

61
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:24,920
Yes. Yes, absolutely, they can do that, and they can do it in more or less degrees of

62
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:34,790
diligence and care. That&#39;s dependent on the nature of what the question they&#39;re asking

63
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:42,140
is and how important it is, how methodical they want to be.

64
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:48,590
What I was saying is that this was something that we came into—to realize by accident

65
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:55,590
was that we don&#39;t start doing one of these experiments saying, &quot;Let&#39;s go do some science.&quot;

66
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:01,480
We just want to do a good job. So any average person out there that wants to do a good job

67
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:07,480
of understanding their world is in effect doing some form of science. They&#39;re just being

68
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,300
methodical and careful about how they&#39;re moving through the process of answering that question.

69
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,360
I&#39;ll give a great example of this. I had someone e-mail me a few years ago and said, &quot;Hey,

70
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:23,360
I heard that the air around the Eiffel Tower weighs more—if you bound the Eiffel Tower

71
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,890
in a box, the air in that box would weigh more than the actual Eiffel Tower.&quot; I was

72
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:34,440
like, &quot;That sounds like a total BS,&quot; but it also sounds like math that I can do. So I

73
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,160
figured out what the square of the base of the Eiffel Tower was. Then I figured out what

74
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,650
the height was. Length times width times height. I figured out how much air on the average

75
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:49,650
weighs. Lo, not the case. But wait, I was measuring the square of the Eiffel Tower.

76
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:56,080
What if I drew a cylinder with the square bound within a circle? At that point, the

77
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,880
air did weigh more, and I was accounting for the thinner air at the top, averaging across.

78
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,480
It was five minutes of sitting with a calculator on my computer, just adding some numbers and

79
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,180
putting them into a form and thinking about it, and I answered a question.

80
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,620
I found myself thrilled by the process. It&#39;s not that complicated to think critically through

81
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:20,670
a problem and think, &quot;Am I not thinking this clear enough? I&#39;m doing a square. Let&#39;s circle it,

82
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:25,300
and let&#39;s see what happens there.&quot; That&#39;s the kind of stuff we do on the show every day.

83
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:31,470
I personally find that the smartest people I meet, that we get to meet and spend time

84
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:37,270
with, are always willing to say they don&#39;t know something. That&#39;s one. Two is they seem

85
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:43,520
to be, generally, serially fascinated by many things. That is something that comes from,

86
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,410
I think, I believe, from critical thinking, that you may have your field of expertise,

87
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:53,240
but if you&#39;re genuinely interested in it and you&#39;re interested in thinking critically about

88
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,980
it to understand what its shortcomings are and maybe you can overcome them, then actually,

89
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:01,540
all of a sudden, all these other fields become much more interesting because you can apply

90
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,470
your own analysis to them. You can apply your analysis to the news that&#39;s happening. You

91
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:09,590
can apply your analysis to a report about a scientific paper and say, &quot;Actually, I don&#39;t

92
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,380
think that their—it doesn&#39;t sound right to me. Let me look into their...&quot; I mean,

93
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,570
we do that, and we know people that do that.

94
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,910
It&#39;s like whenever we go to NASA. Every scientist we&#39;ve ever worked with at NASA has incredible

95
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:26,330
hobbies that they do on the weekends. Either they race cars, or they fly RC planes, or

96
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,960
they&#39;re interested in fluid dynamics. Whatever it is, they give their all to it in their

97
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,950
off time. These are people who just need to feed their brains. The fact is, is that it&#39;s

98
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,500
exponential: the more you do it, the more you want to do it.
