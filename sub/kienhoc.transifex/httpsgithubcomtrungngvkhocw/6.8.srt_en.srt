We&#39;re going to see whether people can tell the difference between a red wine and a white

1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,820
wine. Now we&#39;re going to see whether they can tell the difference between a young wine,

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:20,820
say at 2012, and an older wine about four years older, 2008, and specifically whether

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:28,779
people can tell the particular grape that the wine is. We have a bunch of different

4
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:35,779
kinds. We have a chardonnay. We have a Riesling, pinot noir, and a merlot. What we&#39;re going

5
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:43,860
to do is have people taste each of these wines and see whether they can tell the difference,

6
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,760
whether they can actually tell what it is that they&#39;re drinking, but it&#39;s going to be

7
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,649
completely blind. People are going to be wearing these blindfolds, these little eye masks,

8
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:55,510
and so they won&#39;t actually be able to see what they&#39;re drinking.

9
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:01,730
A few components of the scientific method that we have to look at—so, for example,

10
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,750
if I just gave you one glass and poured one of these wines into it and blindfolded you,

11
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,439
and then asked you what it was, you might get it right; you might get it wrong, right?

12
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:11,710
Yes.

13
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,299
So you have a 50-50 chance of being correct, for example, at telling what color it is.

14
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:17,310
If I was just guessing.

15
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,420
If you&#39;re just guessing, exactly. Or we wouldn&#39;t be able to tell if you&#39;re guessing or whether

16
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,229
you actually could do it or not because you only had the one. But if we do it eight times,

17
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:33,229
right, with some white, some red, and you get them all right, then that happening by

18
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,259
chance—so guessing each of those just by chance—is going to be pretty impressive,

19
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:43,200
right? It would be very unlikely that you&#39;d get all eight right if you were just guessing alone.

20
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:50,290
So the best way to do this is to have more of this. Not just that, if we&#39;re also going

21
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,770
to be testing whether people generally can tell the difference between, say, a red and

22
00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:01,770
white wine, then we want more than one person. We want people who—maybe some people who

23
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,680
have a bit of experience with wine, some people who don&#39;t have experience, complete novices.

24
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,340
That&#39;s what we&#39;re dealing with.

25
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:15,049
We tried to get—people are about to come over any minute now, but we have some people

26
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:18,600
who know very little about wine, I know that for certain, and some people who know fair

27
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,500
a bit, and I know that for certain. In order to test whether they have wine knowledge or

28
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:31,500
not, we have this paper by Bob Boakes and Angus Hughson from 2001. Bob—he&#39;s actually

29
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:39,690
at the University of Sydney—wrote this paper. They came up with a pretty interesting little

30
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:46,359
wine-knowledge test. It asks things like: what is the main great variety used in Grange?

31
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:51,109
It&#39;s kind of Australian, which is fine because we&#39;re in Australia. We&#39;re going to have each

32
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:58,109
of our guests taste, take this test and see how well they do and see if they&#39;re more like

33
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:04,130
a high-knowledge group or more of a low-knowledge group. We have about a dozen people, about

34
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:09,590
10 people, I suppose, coming over, and hopefully have half the people who are high-knowledge

35
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,350
and half the people that are low knowledge after they take this test.

36
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:21,350
Then another problem that we have with this sort of wine tasting is that, well, what if

37
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:28,560
we give them all of the chardonnays first, followed by all the pinot noirs, for example?

38
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:35,540
Then there&#39;s something called order effect. There might be something about that order

39
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,750
of things that people pick up on, and they get it right more often than they would if

40
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:47,750
we kind of mixed them up. So what we need to do is to scramble the order that they receive

41
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,549
these wines. So, beforehand, I drew a bunch of—essentially, I drew a bunch of names

42
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:59,549
out of a hat or a bunch of wines out of a hat. We have the first guest, Bridie, is going

43
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:08,160
to get this particular order, so wine F, E, A, B, H and so on, where we have each of the

44
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:16,070
wines that are located here listed A to H, which is random. I&#39;ll just randomly assign

45
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,190
this to those particular wines.

46
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:25,190
The way that it&#39;s going to work is we have a person come in; they sit down; they&#39;re going

47
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,050
to sit here, and we&#39;re going to pour them a glass of wine. They&#39;re going to take a sip,

48
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:36,050
and they&#39;re going to guess whether the glass of wine is red or a white wine, and then whether

49
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,320
it&#39;s a chardonnay, merlot, pinot noire or a Riesling. Those are the four different kinds

50
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,140
that we have here. If they guessed it random, then they&#39;d be about 25 percent correct, whether

51
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:51,550
it&#39;s more like a 2008 or a 2012 and whether they think it costs more like a 20-dollar

52
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,630
bottle or a 50-dollar bottle.

53
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:58,300
That&#39;s the importance of scientific method, and that&#39;s why we&#39;re doing this. Hopefully,

54
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,910
we&#39;ll see a difference between the capabilities of people and whether people can actually

55
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:08,370
tell the difference between, say, a cheap wine and an expensive wine, or red wine or

56
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,270
white wine, or a Riesling and a pinot noir.

57
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,920
What does this tasting tell us about how people drink wine in everyday life?

58
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,590
Well, the only thing that we can do, really, in order to find out, for example, whether

59
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:28,590
people can tell the difference between white and red is to control it very tightly. I mean,

60
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:34,580
if we were just to go out and test people in a pub, or see them, and then close their

61
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:41,300
eyes, and give it to them in a very sort of uncontrolled situation like that, then we

62
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:47,650
really can&#39;t conclude much. I mean, we really can&#39;t tell as much as we can under these very

63
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,530
tightly controlled conditions.

64
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,260
We&#39;re dealing with wines here that are around the 20-dollar mark to a 50-dollar mark. I

65
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:59,450
mean, we&#39;re not dealing with a 500-dollar, but we could go quite extreme. I think the

66
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,530
wines that we have here from our local bottle shop. They&#39;re the kind of wines that you and

67
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:10,530
I would drink, or most of our friends at least, so I think I&#39;m pretty comfortable with the

68
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:15,730
way that this—what this might tell us. I think the results from this, I could use in

69
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:20,340
my everyday life to be able to figure out, for example, whether I should splurge and

70
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:25,260
by the 50-dollar bottle or maybe just settle for the 20-dollar. I think it&#39;s a very understudied

71
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:30,530
field despite the fact that everybody does it. People would rely on sommelier ratings

72
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:35,650
when buying wine. We rely on medallions on wines and so on, but we really don&#39;t know

73
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:40,000
an awful lot about how well we can do this.

74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,650
Sure.

75
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:47,650
One important aspect of this experiment is something called blinding. If you are a participant,

76
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:53,400
if you&#39;re one of the people that show up for the party, and you try a wine and you don&#39;t

77
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,520
know what it is, that means that&#39;s the single blind experiment. If I just put one of the

78
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:05,520
masks on you, and you sit there and try each one, then you&#39;re blind to what it is that

79
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,790
you&#39;re tasting, right? That makes sense. In most of the experiments, that&#39;s kind of what

80
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,270
you would want to do.

81
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,260
We&#39;re going to take it one step further, and we&#39;re going to do something called double

82
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:20,790
blinding. Now that means that the person who&#39;s pouring the wine and who&#39;s serving it, the

83
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:27,260
participant, is also blind, so they don&#39;t know what it is that they&#39;re pouring, okay?

84
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:34,260
What were going to do in order to do that is to wrap each of the bottles in aluminum

85
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,960
foil and then in a plastic [sic] bag, and then we&#39;re going to label them. The reason

86
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,240
that we want to blind the experimenter or the person who&#39;s actually pouring each of

87
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:52,110
the wines is because they might be able to cue the participant. They might be able to

88
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,010
inadvertently give them clues about what it is that they&#39;re drinking. Now that might be

89
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,230
something like putting the white glasses a little bit closer to them, or it might be

90
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:06,740
any number of things. I mean, this is kind of what they do in medicine all the time.

91
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:12,699
When you give a person a pill, the doctor doesn&#39;t know whether the pill is a placebo

92
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:19,460
or the actual medicine that they&#39;re given. Neither does the patient. We&#39;re doing the

93
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:24,330
same sort of thing here. The person who is tasting the wine doesn&#39;t know whether it&#39;s

94
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,930
a chardonnay or Riesling, and neither does the person who&#39;s serving it.

95
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,419
So how did people doing the wine tasting?

96
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:38,419
They did pretty well in some respects and not so well in others. Now, remember, we had

97
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:44,460
several tasks that each person had to do. So they had the glass of wine; they could

98
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,040
smell it; they could taste it; then they made different judgments.

99
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,430
The first judgment they made was whether the wine was red or whether it was white. Now

100
00:08:53,430 --> 00:09:00,430
we had 10 people participate in total. We found that in judging whether the wines were

101
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:08,230
red or white, people on average across the 10 were 89 percent correct at judging red

102
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:10,560
or white.

103
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,460
That&#39;s pretty good,

104
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,339
Remember, if they were guessing completely, they&#39;d be at 50 percent because there&#39;s two

105
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:21,750
options—1 out 2 is 50—but they were 89 percent correct, which is pretty great, I

106
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,650
think.

107
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:29,650
Now the second task: we asked them, after judging the color of the wine, was it a Riesling,

108
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:38,740
a chardonnay, a pinot noir or a merlot? They had a choice of four grapes. They were 50

109
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,790
percent correct at this one. Now, remember, there are four choices, so chance, guessing

110
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:51,790
randomly, is 25 percent correct. So they were not bad. I don&#39;t know really...

111
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,600
So they could do it reasonably well, better than, I would say a little better than chance,

112
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,850
but you be the judge. They were 50 percent correct. Guessing randomly is 25 percent correct.

113
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,480
Their next task was to judge whether it was young or whether it was old, so whether it

114
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,700
was more or like a 2008 or more or like a 2012, because those were the averages. Each

115
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:20,900
of the wines that they tasted were four years apart. Now could they tell that they were four years apart? No.

116
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:27,950
In judging whether they were young or old, they were 61 percent correct. Again, chance,

117
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,900
guessing randomly, is 50 percent correct. So they were not much better than chance, really.

118
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:41,950
Finally, their job was to judge whether it was an inexpensive or expensive, more like

119
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
a 20-dollar bottle of wine or more like a 50-dollar of wine. They were only 56 percent

120
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:57,620
correct at this one. Chance is 50. So in judging whether it&#39;s a cheap win or more expensive

121
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:05,480
one, a 20-dollar bottle versus a 50-dollar bottle, you&#39;d expect them to be at 50 percent

122
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,649
correct if they were guessing totally. They were at 56 percent, so they weren&#39;t much better.

123
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:10,710
Not great, yes.

124
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:17,710
Yes. Now we also had each person complete a quiz beforehand. People, on average, didn&#39;t

125
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,250
do so well on the wine-knowledge quiz, but we did have three people out of the 10 who

126
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:28,990
would be classified as high knowledge, as more of an expert taster.

127
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:34,779
Now the only place that it seemed to matter whatsoever was judging the price point. So

128
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:41,170
I said that, on average, across all 10 people, people were 56 percent correct at identifying

129
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:47,100
the price. Well, if we look at our high-knowledge people specifically, they were 67 percent

130
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,200
correct at identifying the price—so a little better. Again, chance is 50 percent, so they

131
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,930
were a little bit more. Not great, but okay.

132
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:03,930
The low-knowledge people were only 52 percent correct. Again, chance is 50. So the low-knowledge

133
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,370
people—yes, no hope.

134
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:14,370
So in general— I should mention, we also had one bottle of really nice expensive wine.

135
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:22,089
I think it was 2006 pinot noir. It was a 100-dollar bottle. Now 100-dollar bottle—and we asked

136
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:26,410
people again whether it was more like a 20-dollar bottle, more like a 50. This is more like

137
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:32,550
a 100-dollar bottle. But only 6 people out of the 10 were able to identify it as the

138
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:37,200
more expensive option. Four people said that it was more like a 20-dollar bottle than a 50-dollar bottle.

139
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:42,290
I&#39;m sure most of them never tasted a 100-dollar bottle, of that sort of caliber. You&#39;d think

140
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:45,290
it would really stand out, but obviously...

141
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,680
That&#39;s right. Well, only two out three of the high-knowledge people got that one right

142
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,510
in particular, actually, so, yes. I mean, I&#39;m not sure, really, where that leaves us.

143
00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:00,380
But overall, people can identify the color of the wine, red versus white, reasonably

144
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:10,100
well— quite well, actually. The grape—not bad. The year and the price—they were pretty much hopeless.

145
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:15,670
Again, this is—the reason that we went through this process was to give people an indication

146
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:21,589
of what the experimental process, the design of an experiment, looks like. It&#39;s really—I

147
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:26,580
mean, this is way over the top as far as what most people could do, but as far as designing

148
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:32,290
experiments and methodology, more than they probably want to do, but at least it gives

149
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:39,000
them an indication of how they might structure these things if they were curious about asking these sorts of questions.
