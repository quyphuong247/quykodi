Sounds like Facilitated Communication then would be quite useful. Previously, the autistic

1
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:17,369
individuals weren&#39;t able to communicate, locked in, in a sense, and unable to communicate

2
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:24,130
with their parents or their loved ones. It sounds like it could be really, really the

3
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,150
holy grail for parents of autistic kids. Is it?

4
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:34,270
It looks like it&#39;s really life-changing because you get these kids who aren&#39;t able to communicate.

5
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:39,690
They can&#39;t say even a single word to you, and with the help of a facilitator, now they&#39;re

6
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,000
able to tell you what they did on the weekend; they&#39;re able to write poetry; they&#39;re able

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
to go to school, finish high school, and so on. The impression that you get if you see

8
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:59,879
this stuff in action is, &quot;Wow, this is huge.&quot; We&#39;re freeing these kids. As you say, these

9
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:06,879
kids who&#39;ve been locked in, we got the key, man. Unlock that door. They&#39;re out. They&#39;re

10
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,880
communicating. It sounds wonderful, absolutely.

11
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:18,880
Yes. Interesting. Obviously, we&#39;re introducing this topic for a reason. It&#39;s not all that

12
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:25,980
it&#39;s cracked up to be. Can you tell us what the problem is exactly with this technique?

13
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:32,780
Sure. There&#39;s one really critical question that has to be answered here. It turns out

14
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:38,020
to be a very simple question once you calculate what that question is, but you have two people

15
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:43,460
involved here. You have a facilitator who is guiding the movements of the client, and

16
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:50,460
then you have the client. The two people involved have different pieces of information, and

17
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,730
then if you interrogate that pair—so you ask them to type something with the help of

18
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:01,980
the facilitator—if they each have different information in their heads, you can tell by

19
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,100
which information you get out of the pair who it came from.

20
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,120
What you would do is set-up a scenario, for example, where the facilitator who is guiding

21
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,880
the arm of the autistic individual sees, for example, a photograph of a pair of socks.

22
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:24,700
If the autistic individual sees something else, say, a pair of keys, and so you have

23
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,450
these two differences; they&#39;re seeing two different things, and then you see what comes

24
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,960
out in terms of the communication. If it&#39;s the socks, then it&#39;s the facilitator. If it&#39;s

25
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,780
the keys, then it&#39;s the autistic individual. That&#39;s the sort of experiment that&#39;s been

26
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,410
done in the past.

27
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:46,720
Exactly, multiple times. In the early 1990s, there&#39;s a whole raft of these experiments.

28
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,540
This is when Facilitated Communication was getting popular, and there&#39;s a whole raft

29
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:56,150
of these kinds of experiments that tested this idea by making sure you have different

30
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:02,709
pieces of information in the two individuals. Look to see what comes out. Across all the

31
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:09,250
experiments, there were different denominators in terms of the results that came out—that

32
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:18,900
is, over different numbers of trials on which you could get information or evidence of information from the client.

33
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,010
One study by Wheeler and his colleagues at the Heck Center that was using this technique—if

34
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,080
I remember correctly, I think it was about 140. I can&#39;t remember. It might have been

35
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,090
160. There&#39;s 140, say, of these trials on which you could have gotten information coming

36
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:39,090
from the client, and they got information clearly coming from the client on zero of

37
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:45,150
those trials. None at all. Throughout all these studies that have been done, the numerator

38
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,349
never changes. The denominator may change—maybe 60 trials, maybe just 30 trials, maybe it&#39;s

39
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:55,240
45 trials—but the number of trials where we actually get solid evidence of information

40
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,970
coming from the client in all those cases is zero. None.

41
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:05,060
What happened? I mean, what&#39;s the fallout of this? Did they just stop doing Facilitated

42
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:11,110
Communication? What happened after these experiments came to light?

43
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:18,110
I think some of the steamroller effect of this procedure dissipated, but it&#39;s still

44
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:24,699
the case that people are using Facilitated Communication these days, and this is 20 years

45
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:31,699
after the bulk of the really unequivocal evidence has come in to say the technique is not working.

46
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:37,699
There was an interesting study by—one of the major studies that was done in the early

47
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:44,020
90s, done by Doug Wheeler and his colleagues at OD Heck Center in I think it was Schenectady

48
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,469
in New York. They were using this technique, and they&#39;re having wonderful result, or at

49
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:51,930
least they thought they were having wonderful results with it. You can imagine being one

50
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:58,900
of these therapists working with these kids. You come in to work, and you&#39;re talking to

51
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:05,059
these kids who, for the last four, five years, you have been unable to get a word out of,

52
00:05:05,059 --> 00:05:09,550
and now they&#39;re telling you about what they did on the weekend; they&#39;re joking with you;

53
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:14,779
you&#39;re having conversations with them. Can you imagine, as a therapist, how rewarding

54
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:17,520
that is? I mean, that&#39;s why you got into the business in the first place, was to be able

55
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,960
to do this kind of thing, and it felt wonderful.

56
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,789
They decided, when the people start criticizing this technique, they decided, &quot;Okay, we&#39;re

57
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:30,330
going to show them how this works.&quot; They ran the study. They looked to see who the information

58
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,159
is coming from, and the data are very clear. It&#39;s coming from the facilitator. Any information

59
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:40,620
that is coming over the pair of them at all is coming from the facilitator, not from client.

60
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,759
They&#39;re absolutely devastated.

61
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:50,539
To their credit, they stopped using Facilitated Communication. They said, &quot;We can&#39;t, in good

62
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:53,749
conscience, use this technique. No matter how good it makes us feel, no matter how good

63
00:05:53,749 --> 00:06:00,089
it makes the parents feel, it&#39;s wrong. These kids are not communicating. They&#39;re acting

64
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:07,089
like they are, but they&#39;re not really.&quot; They were absolutely devastated. I think it&#39;s a

65
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,979
real testament to their integrity, of the therapists at this place, that they said,

66
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,740
&quot;We&#39;re going to have to go back to square one.&quot;

67
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:23,139
Someone might argue then that: what&#39;s the harm in that kind of case, particularly with

68
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:28,369
Facilitated Communication? I mean, you have parents who are—they haven&#39;t communicated

69
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:34,439
with their children. I&#39;ve seen reports of this. The child can report, for example, &quot;I

70
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:41,439
love you, Mom.&quot; Is it that bad? What&#39;s the harm in doing that sort of thing?

71
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:52,080
There&#39;s a few of them, actually, I think. The first is, we lost I don&#39;t know how many

72
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:59,279
person years of research time into the causes, the procedures, the what-goes-on-in-autism

73
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:06,960
because, remember—well, at the time, people were saying, &quot;Look, if this Facilitated Communication

74
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:15,300
is working, then we have to fundamentally rethink what autism is. It&#39;s not at all what

75
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,610
we thought that was. It&#39;s something completely different. It&#39;s not this maybe withdrawal

76
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:26,009
from the world and those sorts of things. It&#39;s a communication problem, and that&#39;s all

77
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:29,360
it is. We just need to allow people to communicate.&quot;

78
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,059
Well, people went off and started studying this stuff, and it was a wild goose chase.

79
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:38,180
We spent I don&#39;t know how many millions of dollars, how many, like I say, person years

80
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:45,180
of research time, off chasing this wild good chase. There&#39;s a societal cost because those

81
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:52,879
people could have been actually investigating worthwhile avenues, rather than these goofy

82
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:59,879
ones. There are costs to the individuals involved because if you focus on this bogus communication,

83
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:05,939
you may miss communication that they actually are able to do.

84
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:12,939
There&#39;s a lovely description of that in the report on that study by Wheeler and his colleagues

85
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:20,869
from the Heck Center, where they said at one point there&#39;s one kid who was shown an item—let&#39;s

86
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:28,849
say it was a car—and the child pointed at the car, made a manual sign for the car—this

87
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:36,310
kid knew sign language, so he made a manual sign for the car, whatever that is—and uttered

88
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:43,310
the first consonant. He&#39;s going, &quot;ca-ca-ca,&quot; and the facilitator who is watching the kid&#39;s

89
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:50,579
hand on the keyboard completely ignored that information, and he typed out balloon or something

90
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:55,889
instead. So you have these legitimate attempts to communicate that are missed because people

91
00:08:55,889 --> 00:09:01,130
are focused on the bogus stuff. That&#39;s a cost to those individuals because they&#39;re not able

92
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:07,300
to communicate. You&#39;re blocking the real communication with the bogus stuff, with the stuff that&#39;s not real.

93
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:14,370
I think there&#39;s another piece, and I have a hard time of describing it. I think there&#39;s

94
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:24,029
a sense in which this bogus belief that there&#39;s some more intact individual inside the person

95
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:32,990
that you&#39;re able to access denies the validity of the person who actually is in there, who

96
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:39,130
may not be able to communicate, who may not have in some sense anything to say, in the

97
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:43,790
sense of being able to write poetry and so on. So what? They&#39;re still human beings. They&#39;re

98
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:50,790
still valuable, real people who deserve respect and proper treatment and so on for who they

99
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,449
are, not for who you&#39;d like to believe they are.
