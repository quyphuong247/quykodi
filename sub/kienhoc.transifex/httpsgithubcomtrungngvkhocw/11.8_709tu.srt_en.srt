Today, what we&#39;re planning on doing during the episode - during class - is talking about some of your topics.

1
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,119
What I think is happening with a lot of people who are selecting your topics, and struggling

2
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:24,409
with your projects, more generally, is that this is kind of how they&#39;re stated, at least

3
00:00:24,409 --> 00:00:26,519
in the spreadsheet that we have shared at the moment.

4
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,179
So when I ask you what your project is on, you&#39;re saying the project is on gay marriage,

5
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:36,640
or is on mental illness, or on study habits, right?

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:43,600
What we want you help you do today in today&#39;s class is to help clean these up, to ask questions

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,700
that are going to help clarify what the project is about, and how to do it really, really well.

8
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,550
So what&#39;s a good project topic? Facilitated communication, right? That would be an outstanding one. 

9
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,200
As I said, I&#39;ve watched the documentary 36 times. We&#39;re using it for a reason.

10
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,690
But the question, if I were to ask you what your topic was on, it&#39;s not &quot;is Facilitated

11
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:10,510
Communication effective?&quot; Instead, it&#39;s &quot;why do people believe that Facilitated Communication works?&quot;

12
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,100
The first one has to do with the technique—Facilitated Communication—

13
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,780
The second one has to do with psychology.

14
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:23,810
Take vaccinations, same issue: when it comes to vaccinations, it&#39;s not &quot;are vaccinations effective&quot;,

15
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:30,700
or &quot;do vaccines cause autism&quot;, right? It&#39;s &quot;why don&#39;t people vaccinate their children?&quot;

16
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:37,430
Sophie Collombet case - is anyone not familiar with Sophie&#39;s murder recently?

17
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:42,960
This was right in our backyard, and she took the CityGlider, she was going to get a ride

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,710
from her friend but she declined and said she was going to take the bus, and something

19
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,409
happened between her getting off at the Cultural Centre and walking along the riverside, and

20
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:53,700
getting to the Go Between bridge.

21
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,390
There weren&#39;t that many people around, and she was murdered.

22
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:04,000
After this unfolded and they caught the guy, I was walking to uni one day, chatting with

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,830
one of my colleagues, who is also in Psychology, and she&#39;s a runner.

24
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,360
But I said, &quot;Hey, what are you doing, you normally run at night, after work&quot;?

25
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,430
Well, she said says &quot;Well, not any more because of the Sophie Collombet case.&quot;

26
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:24,430
I said, &quot;Hang on, do you really think this is endemic-that this is something that is

27
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:33,400
going to continue? They caught the guy, are murders after dark increasing that would justify your decision to stop running?&quot;

28
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:40,480
We want you to come up with a question that would properly investigate this issue.

29
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:47,810
This is really easy to find this kind of information, you just essentially type in the postal code

30
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:54,900
of the suburb that you want to find information about, and it gives you all sorts of crime data.

31
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:58,080
But think about how you might scale it up, okay?

32
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,959
If you literally wanted to show people this thing that everyone here was astounded by,

33
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,900
that this information was available, searching the information within your own building to see the crime statistics.

34
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,200
If you wanted to tell people about that, you felt passionately about it, what could you do?

35
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:19,700
Possibly, I&#39;m thinking wrong, you know? My thinking is wrong about this and maybe I should be more careful.

36
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:26,780
But if it&#39;s just a once-off event that happens once a year, or rarely, then it&#39;s like why

37
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,129
am I going to freak out about something that just happened that once?

38
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,800
Women are supposed to be comforting and they&#39;re supposed to be helping and supposed to be

39
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,879
aiding and that&#39;s what we think women should be.

40
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,879
So when someone violates that, when they want to be promoted, when they want to be assertive,

41
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:46,300
when they want to get ahead, we go, well, it&#39;s like it violates your fundamental assumptions

42
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,450
and you just go, &quot;Nope.&quot;

43
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:57,000
Are people&#39;s concerns warranted? Has the world actually changed, or is this an availability effect?

44
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,200
If people start changing their habits then everyone&#39;s running in the morning, say, then

45
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,900
that just creates a different target - it&#39;s not actually going to solve anything.

46
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:13,239
You&#39;re more likely to be hit by a car crossing the road to avoid someone you think is going

47
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,769
to attack you than you are dying at their hand, of their attacking you.
