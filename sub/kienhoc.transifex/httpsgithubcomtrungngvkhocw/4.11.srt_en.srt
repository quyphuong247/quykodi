In this this activity, we are going to be sending a postcard to our future selves.

1
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:13,269
I want you to reflect on something in your life, something reasonably significant that&#39;s

2
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:14,799
happening in your life right now.

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,529
Both describe how you&#39;re feeling right now, but also project yourself ahead a little while

4
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,910
and think: when you&#39;re looking back on this, how will it make you feel then?

5
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:30,500
Alright, this is called a clocks demonstration. What I’m going to do is flash a bunch of

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,029
analogue clocks at you.

7
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:36,690
You’re going to see clock after clock after clock and you need to indicate the time of

8
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:43,690
those clocks as quickly and as accurately as you possibly can.

9
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,399
Not easy, right?

10
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,960
What I want you to do next is take the sheet that you wrote all the times on and fold it

11
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,590
in half lengthwise, or however you want you make your favourite paper airplane.

12
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:04,670
We&#39;re going to throw these and your job is to get it all the way up here and hit me.

13
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,369
Count of three: One...

14
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,719
Two... Three!

15
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:14,979
I think one hit my foot...

16
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:21,979
What we&#39;re actually going to do is do a memory test.What we&#39;re going to do is present two

17
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,619
times at you.

18
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:28,229
One is going to be one that you&#39;ve seen before from the previous clock faces. The other one

19
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:28,829
is not.

20
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:35,579
Fast as you can: is it the top or is it the bottom? Which is the one you&#39;ve seen before?

21
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:42,579
Alright, how did you go?

22
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:49,219
How many people got 10 out of 10? 9 out of 10?

23
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:53,159
Now I lied to you, obviously. Maybe you didn&#39;t recognise it.

24
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,419
In fact, none of the times that I presented to you in the digital times were from the

25
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:02,109
old clocks that you&#39;ve seen.

26
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:08,899
Okay, the simple rule was-you ready?-all of the clocks that you saw were between 6 o&#39;clock

27
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:11,009
and 12 o&#39;clock.

28
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:18,009
It&#39;s relying on something called &quot;fluency&quot;, &quot;cognitive ease&quot;. The one between 6 and 12

29
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,909
washed over you more easily and you chose that one as opposed to the other.

30
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:29,250
Last week in some of the activities that we&#39;ve done, but especially in the past couple of

31
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,420
ones that we&#39;ve done today, I&#39;m convinced.

32
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,680
What clinched it for you?

33
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,579
Probably the clocks.

34
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:37,650
Yeah? Because I got most of them right but not all

35
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:44,650
of them, and then when he said like NONE of them, I&#39;m just like ñ what was I thinking?

36
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:45,840
Exactly.

37
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:50,049
Before the last couple of weeks, I&#39;ve got to have some idea of what&#39;s going on up there.

38
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:54,079
But after reading the Gilovich readings and then doing this...

39
00:02:54,079 --> 00:03:01,079
It&#39;s just like ñ you can just keep going the way you&#39;re going or have an existential

40
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,430
crisis and like, not do anything.

41
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,230
I don&#39;t know anything about myself.

42
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,319
A week later or an hour later or whatever it is, it seems that the choice you made was

43
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,989
like a hundred times better than the choice you didn&#39;t make.

44
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:17,989
For me I guess it&#39;s just a way of confirming to myself that I did the right thing. No one

45
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,760
likes to feel they made the wrong decision or made the wrong choice.

46
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,980
The other options, they&#39;re the things that you didn&#39;t choose and they&#39;re the things you

47
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,810
can&#39;t get back. So you&#39;re always second-guessing against even the one you choose, EVEN if it&#39;s

48
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,230
the best, you&#39;re comparing against the others.

49
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,340
Isn&#39;t that like, do we understand what happiness is and does it matter?

50
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,700
And if you&#39;re too busy looking back at the other options or other choices you could have

51
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,269
had, then you won&#39;t be happy.

52
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:48,819
But are you in charge of it? Are you physically in charge? Do you know that you&#39;re actually

53
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:49,400
unhappier?
