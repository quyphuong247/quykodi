The title of this episode has been Extraordinary Claims, and so we&#39;ve been talking about some

1
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:17,340
fairly strange things like Susan&#39;s out-of-body experience. We travelled to the MindBodySpirit

2
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:26,220
Festival and talked to people about UFOs, prayer batteries, horoscopes, kinesiology,

3
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:33,330
auras, psychics, tarot cards, everything under the sun. I think it&#39;s really interesting to

4
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:37,739
think about these things in terms of their cognitive explanations.

5
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:44,739
Now what do we mean by that? These are real explanations for why people believe strange

6
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:52,940
things, like perceptual reasons, attention, memory, as opposed to motivational explanations,

7
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:59,379
like people take comfort in the paranormal, or they like their own beliefs and that&#39;s

8
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:06,379
why they believe them. I think that&#39;s going to take people quite a bit further in understanding

9
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,250
these things and applying them in their own lives.

10
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:18,250
Now we&#39;ve dealt with each of these paranormal claims that people probably see a fair bit

11
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,790
in their own day-to-day encounters, but what I really hope people are going to do here

12
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,490
is take this and apply them elsewhere—around the dinner table. If somebody makes a wild

13
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:36,490
claim around the dinner table—to think about these mechanisms we&#39;ve been discussing and

14
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:44,479
to recognize ambiguity when they see it, to pinpoint this as an example of multiple endpoints,

15
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:51,689
and to recognize and not necessarily call people on it and say, &quot;Well, you&#39;re behaving

16
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:58,430
irrationally,&quot; but to at least recognize when they&#39;re happening, and to potentially—and

17
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,990
maybe think about it in terms of the six leads that we talked about last week.

18
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,790
If you wanted to change someone&#39;s opinion about something, how would you go about doing

19
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:14,790
it? Again, just saying that, &quot;You&#39;re being silly. Straighten up, fly straight, think

20
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,819
more clearly,&quot; isn&#39;t really going to cut it.

21
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:24,950
So I think we&#39;re getting closer in terms of—hopefully we&#39;re getting closer—in having people, just

22
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,640
as Susan said in the last episode, that sort of approach isn&#39;t going to change anyone&#39;s

23
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:36,640
mind. But thinking about the mechanisms, thinking about why people believe these things, is

24
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,379
going to get you a lot further in understanding their origin and hopefully getting people

25
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:51,100
to think more clearly, and at least recognizing where people&#39;s failings are when they&#39;re not thinking clearly.

26
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:56,569
Next week, we&#39;re going to move from the extraordinary to the ordinary, so instead of talking about

27
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:02,180
claims of the paranormal, we&#39;re going to be dealing with claims about health and applied

28
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,980
claims in the next two episodes. We&#39;re going to be dealing with topics now that are going

29
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:13,090
to really hit home with people&#39;s lives and livelihoods in a very real sense.
