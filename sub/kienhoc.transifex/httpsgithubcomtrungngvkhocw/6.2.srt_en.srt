There seems to be a few parallels between the science of everyday thinking and science

1
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:14,010
of cooking. What we&#39;re trying to do in our course is get people to think more scientifically,

2
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:20,619
I suppose, about their everyday experience. What you&#39;re doing in Science and Cooking is,

3
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:27,009
obviously, trying to bring food and the scientific method to the way that people do things even

4
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:32,079
in their own kitchen. How does science apply to cooking specifically?

5
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,890
The point of our course—it sounds like it&#39;s very similar to the point of yours— which

6
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,700
is that we wanted confront things that they think about and do every day and realize that

7
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:47,300
there&#39;s science around them, you know, every place and, moreover, that the scientific ways

8
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,830
of thinking are embedded in what they&#39;re doing—just to sort of give a concrete context for learning

9
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,110
what science really is.

10
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,840
Just as an example, I mean, one of the simple questions that we ask our students is to consider

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:05,330
the recipes for cooking pasta. If you go and you take a box of pasta, then it tells you,

12
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:10,060
roughly, that you should boil water, and it tells you to boil a lot of water, so, roughly,

13
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,950
if I&#39;m remembering it right, for half a kilogram of pasta, it tells you to put four liters

14
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,850
of water, maybe even six liters of water in the pot, bring it to boil, then you pour the

15
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:24,060
pasta in. Then there are all of these, I guess I would call them myths, that sort of go along

16
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,060
with that. There&#39;s the notion that you should put salt in the water to sort of affect the

17
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,119
boiling properties. You should put oil in the water, and that might—these are just

18
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:35,840
the myths. Then the recipe is really the goal with pasta making.

19
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,659
So, you know, part of science is learning to question everything, and one can certainly

20
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:46,350
question pasta-making and even question the recipe on the box. For example, you can ask

21
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,149
yourself: &quot;Does it—if you were to use a small amount of water, could you still cook

22
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,719
the pasta? Is it really true that you need so much water?&quot;

23
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,810
One of the things that we do in our class is we ask the students to both—you know,

24
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,799
as if they understand the scientific basis for what is actually happening in the water

25
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,429
when you put the pasta in, you can sort of think through that yourself, like, &quot;Will it

26
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:11,060
make a difference?&quot; Then of course you can always go and do the experiment. You can cook

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,180
pasta the way it says on the box, and you can cut the amount of water substantially

28
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,879
and cook the pasta again. You can then boil them both according to the recipe. You can

29
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:23,099
serve them to your family and discover if they can tell the difference. If they can&#39;t

30
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:26,209
tell the difference, then clearly there is no difference.

31
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:30,849
One of the points of science, at least for us, is that it allows you to generalize. It

32
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:35,819
allows you to take ideas that you know apply in one situation—for example, the molten

33
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,480
chocolate cake—and learn how they can be used, and what appears at first sight to be

34
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,600
an entirely different situation—the cooking of a steak—and really map the two on to each other.

35
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,670
Do you think people&#39;s tastes are kind of shaped by our experience?

36
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:58,250
I think it must be. I mean, I think that&#39;s one reason, for example why tasting a fruit

37
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:03,459
for the first time can be sometimes unpleasant, or you can have a certain experience with

38
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:10,170
it and then over time you kind of get used to it, or your experience of that food changes.

39
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:16,230
I think also as we experience foods as children, and then we grow up and suddenly we learn

40
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:22,409
to appreciate coffee. I&#39;m sure that has something to do with that. Our taste buds are—our

41
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:29,349
experience of it is changing. I&#39;m sure there is a cultural component as well. I wouldn&#39;t

42
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:34,920
be surprised if there are subtleties to this that—I mean, you know how you get your favorite

43
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:41,920
food that you can only get at home that your grandmother cooks for you, how that just tastes

44
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:50,239
so special to you, whereas for an outsider it&#39;s just meatballs or whatever it would be.

45
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,230
The scientific method is very useful for finding out whether there is something to a myth or

46
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:00,659
not. Do you have any examples of myths in cooking?

47
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:06,180
One great example, which is one of the labs for our Ethics Course, which is to make mac

48
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:12,239
and cheese, and according to cooks, there is four ways to thicken a sauce. Of course

49
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,980
the whole idea with thickening a sauce is really so that it clings to the food better

50
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:22,090
so that we can sort of scoop the sauce and it will stay in your mouth and give you that

51
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:27,449
sensory experience. So according to cooks, there are four ways. One of them is just to

52
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:32,560
reduce the sauce which is just boil off the water. One of them is to use starch, and starch

53
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,889
expands when you put it in water and when you heat it, and so this thickens the sauce.

54
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:44,100
Another way is just to add fat, and this creates an emulsion in which also thickens the sauce.

55
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:51,100
Then you can use various modernist thickeners such Xanthan gum or gelatin, things like that.

56
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:58,889
One of the things we were asking students to do is to look at a mac and cheese recipe

57
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:05,360
and to exclude each of these ingredients—exclude the cheese, exclude the flour—and see how

58
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,389
much the viscosity changes, and so you would get a very tangible way of seeing, &quot;If I exclude

59
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:18,389
the flour or if I exclude this much flour, this is how the viscosity changes.&quot; There

60
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,770
are of course very fancy ways that you can measure viscosity, but there is also very

61
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:30,580
simple ways, and so we&#39;re asking students to take a tall glass, a transparent glass,

62
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:36,160
put macaroni in it, pour sauce on top, and basically measure how long it takes for the

63
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,169
sauce to meander its way through to the bottom which is viscosity, and its exactly getting

64
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:50,800
at that property that we want from the sauce—sticking to the macaroni and sort of giving us the whole dish.

65
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:56,949
I think as scientists we often work with this very fancy expensive equipment in our laboratories,

66
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:03,819
but a lot of those equipments are just, you know, fancy ways doing something that is actually

67
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:06,629
very simple, and a lot of it we can do on our own.
