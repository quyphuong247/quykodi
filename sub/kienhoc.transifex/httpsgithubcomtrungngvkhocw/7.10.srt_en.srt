So there I am listening to wonderful music, sitting on the floor, really tired, a little

1
00:00:09,379 --> 00:00:13,889
bit stoned, going down a tunnel. And I was going down a dark tunnel towards a bright

2
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:18,369
light. I&#39;d never heard of tunnel experiences. The term &quot;near death experience&quot; hadn&#39;t been invented.

00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:25,689
What makes her so outstanding is that she was the one who studied parapsychology. She&#39;s

4
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,100
the one that had this experience and changed her opinion.

5
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,219
I&#39;ve seen some pretty convincing examples of psychic ability. A psychic might claim

6
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:41,900
that something will happen in the future and it seems very detailed and specific. What&#39;s your response to that?

7
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:47,309
I think when you go to a psychic or a medium, that there are several psychological mechanisms at play.

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,600
...three and a half to four feet tall... they had inverted, pear-shaped heads... large, dark eyes...

9
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:58,449
I&#39;m just a vessel. So the light goes where it needs to go.
