Do we know what makes us happy?

1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,119
A lot of the time, we don&#39;t. Now of course I know that if my kid gets a great report

2
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:14,939
on his report card, I know that makes me happy. It does make me happy. On the other hand,

3
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:18,449
these are not trivial things. Everybody thinks they&#39;ve got Blue Monday. Actually, it&#39;s not

4
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:30,500
really true. Everybody thinks that a variety of things that have a big impact on them don&#39;t really.

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,900
Wilson has also shown that people are terrible about predicting what kinds of effects things will have.

6
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:43,960
You&#39;ve got people who are—college students who are dating and you ask them, &quot;What do

7
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:49,380
you think—what would it do to you if you were to break up?&quot; &quot;Miserable. I wouldn&#39;t

8
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:56,380
be able to hold my head up. I couldn&#39;t sleep,&quot; and so on. Actually, that&#39;s not true. The

9
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,630
unpleasantness only lasts for a small length of time.

10
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:08,630
You ask people who are just coming into a university, freshman, &quot;What if you got dorm X?

11
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:15,380
What do you think it would mean to you?&quot; They&#39;d say, &quot;Oh, my god, that&#39;s terrible.

12
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:22,000
It&#39;s dark. It&#39;s gloomy. The people there are boring. It would wreck my life.&quot; Actually, they&#39;re no less happy.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,030
Everybody assumes they&#39;d be thrilled and delighted forever if they won the lottery. That only

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,970
lasts for a few weeks, and actually lottery winners end up being less happy than they

15
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:37,780
were before. I mean, neighbors are begging them for money, et cetera.

16
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,330
The flip is true as well. I think it happens with death?

17
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,220
One&#39;s own?

18
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:50,220
No. That would be interesting. Death doesn&#39;t—bereavement doesn&#39;t last as long

19
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,430
or it is not as bad as we think or predict it would be.

20
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,360
Right, right. Bereavement doesn&#39;t, but if you asked people, &quot;What do you think it would

21
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,420
do to you to become paraplegic? You couldn&#39;t move your legs,&quot; people take it for granted

22
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,830
that would wreck their lives, and of course it&#39;s terrible for a while, but eventually—I

23
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,899
mean, they&#39;re never as happy as they were before or as the average person, but the misery

24
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:20,500
does not last, and they find pleasure in things that we don&#39;t. They&#39;d say, &quot;I enjoyed brushing my teeth today.&quot;

25
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:27,540
Wilson and Dan Gilbert, his colleague, have a notion that we don&#39;t understand how good

26
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:36,040
our psychological immune system is, that is, ways we have of lifting ourselves up. We don&#39;t

27
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,420
know what the hell is going on. Dissonance reduction is one. If somebody moves from the

28
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,090
Midwest to California, but it&#39;s a different job and he has to go to a small house and

29
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:53,090
so on, &quot;How do I...&quot; He&#39;s going to lose something, but he reduces dissonance by saying, &quot;Who

30
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:58,050
wants to take care of a big house like I had in the Midwest,&quot; and, &quot;The weather here just

31
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:04,900
covers a multitude of sins,&quot; and so on. We&#39;re very good at rationalizing, explaining away

32
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:11,900
and making things better than we think we could. They have a concept of immune neglect.

33
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,020
We don&#39;t understand that about ourselves. We don&#39;t understand that we will adapt.

34
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:26,099
It&#39;s amazing how ignorant we are of things that are really important to us and how much

35
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:32,530
we insist that we know why these things happened or would happen.

36
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:39,530
My favorite study in this whole line of work was done with Harvard women. They were asked

37
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:48,540
for a period of a month, maybe more, at the end of each day, &quot;How good was your day?

38
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,700
How happy were you? How satisfied with it were you?&quot; Then they answered a number of

39
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:01,500
other questions to evaluate what went on during the day, or just report what day of the week

40
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:10,200
was it, how was their sex life that day, how did the work go, how much sleep did you get,

41
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:17,229
et cetera. Now at the end of all of this, you can see how much these things actually

42
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:21,769
affected their mood, and you ask people, &quot;By the way, we&#39;d just be interested in knowing

43
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:27,680
how much you think each of these things influenced your mood in general?&quot; There was no correlation

44
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:34,000
whatsoever between the actual impact of these things on people&#39;s mood and people&#39;s reports about the mood.

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,120
If instead of saying, &quot;How much of these things affect you,&quot; you would say, &quot;Let&#39;s take a

46
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:46,290
hypothetical person—Jane. Tell me how you think each of these things would affect her?&quot;

47
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,240
Well, she gives the same answer that she would have given for herself. She&#39;s no more right

48
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,210
about Jane than she is about herself.

49
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,900
Here we have a conviction that we know things like—I mean, &quot;You&#39;re telling me I don&#39;t

50
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,500
know what makes me happy or unhappy? I mean, give me a break.&quot; Sorry, I can&#39;t give you a break.

51
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,500
My name is Richard. I think about inference.
