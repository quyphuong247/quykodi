Now they set up a table at market on a busy Saturday morning with four pairs of stockings

1
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:12,930
that they labeled A, B, C, and D. Now what people didn’t realize was that the four

2
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,100
pairs of stockings were identical.

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,810
We think we know what’s going on. I mean, it’s just—before, I didn’t know the

4
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:25,050
half of it. Most of what goes on in our heads, we have very little inkling of.

5
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:32,050
We’re just horrible. I mean, it’s like we only see the best situation that’s going

6
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:33,860
to get us from point A to point B.

7
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:38,850
These people aren’t any happier than anybody else. The people in these seemingly unfortunate

8
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,140
situations are just as happy as the people in the seemingly fortunate situations.

9
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,460
At any given moment, you have things working for you and things working against you. When

10
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,190
you take long-term behavior, it’s very unlikely that everything’s going to work for you

11
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,089
or work against you all at once.
