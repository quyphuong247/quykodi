You were involved in the early '80s in quite a bit of controversy with the band Judas Priest.

1
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:17,400
The claim, I think, was that they had backwards messages in their rock music that led to some

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,320
unfortunate outcomes. Can you tell me a little bit about that?

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:27,320
Two young men, two days before Christmas were sitting in their basement of one of their

4
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:33,400
houses, drinking beer, smoking marijuana, and listening to Judas Priest all afternoon.

5
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:40,400
Then at the end of the afternoon, they picked up a shotgun, walked to a local church playground,

6
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:46,960
with the swings and teeter-totters, that kind of thing, proceeded to sit down on the swings

7
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,240
or a bench—I can't remember the details now—and attempted to commit suicide. One

8
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,310
of them succeeded. The other just blew his face off but managed to survive.

9
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,970
In the hospital, immediately after, when the police asked them, "Why did you do this,"

10
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:05,530
the response of the survivor was, "Life sucks," which is not an uncommon response

11
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,180
among teenagers, as they were.

12
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,810
The parents then—a few years later, actually—decided to sue. They didn't decide to sue the gun

13
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:19,470
manufacturer. They didn't decide to sue the brewery that provided the beer or the

14
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,140
place that sold it. They didn't decide to go after the drug dealers who had sold them

15
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,590
the marijuana. No, they decided to go after Judas Priest and CBS Records.

16
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:35,590
I received a phone call from the head lawyer for Judas Priest and CBS Records. It was actually

17
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,250
a whole firm of lawyers in Reno, California [sic] which is where the trials came to take

18
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,250
place. It's about a year before the trial. I received this phone call because of the

19
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,990
work I'd done on backward messages in rock music with Don Read, a colleague of mine then

20
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:56,020
at the University of Lethbridge, that we'd done in response to this pastor from California

21
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:01,190
coming to town and holding his big rallies about backward messages in rock music that

22
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:07,400
were leading young people down the path of life such as sex and drug use. He claimed

23
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,659
it was because of the backward messages in the rock music. It led to a big rally at the

24
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:17,790
end. I was two days there, where people showed up and broke records and things like this.

25
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:23,549
It was quite the cause célèbre in Lethbridge. I was a brand-new professor in 1982. I'd just

26
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:30,549
arrived in Lethbridge. And so I got a phone call back then from a local announcer of a

27
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:40,419
rock station in Lethbridge, calling me up after Pastor Greenwald had arrived, saying,

28
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:46,299
"Is there anything in psychology that we could use to speak about this alleged backward

29
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:51,389
messages in rock music," or subliminal messages, they were calling them. I turned to my colleague

30
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:56,680
Don Read. We both went, "Not that we're aware of." We did a little research. We

31
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,290
couldn't find anything on backward messages.

32
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,010
So I went to one of his—actually, more than one of his rallies—to find out what he was

33
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:08,079
doing. Out of the basis of what he was doing, it seemed to be pretty clear that there really

34
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:13,010
wasn't the effect that he thought was going on, but rather just some standard psychological

35
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,590
phenomena that we were all aware of—old, old phenomena in psychology. So it was on

36
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:24,189
that basis then that Don Read and I said, "To be fair, we should run some research,"

37
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:28,730
because this is a claim nobody has investigated. He was earnest. It wasn't like he was just

38
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,769
a conman or something. He was actually earnest. As far as I know, he still is. He actually

39
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:38,620
believes this is true. So we decided, "Well, fair enough." Now his claim—and it's

40
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:45,620
more subtle than most people think, so when it really hit the press in the mid-'80s,

41
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,059
people had the wrong idea of what, in fact, he was claiming. So his concern is not that

42
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:57,609
messages are being inserted in the rock music. There's obviously the forward messages in

43
00:03:57,609 --> 00:04:01,459
many rock songs that promote drug use and the like.

44
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:02,639
Right, yes.

45
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,269
So that wasn't his concern. His concern was that, as he rephrased it at one of his

46
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:12,430
meetings—I'm paraphrasing now—is that, well, good Christian teenagers, with a forward

47
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,579
message, would hear it, understand it, and reject it. But his concern was this—it was

48
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,579
much more subtle. To be fair, I thought the guy deserves a shake because he's not just

49
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:25,430
thinking very glibly about this stuff. His concern was that because it was backwards

50
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:31,090
and it's hard to register consciously, if the message is still getting through, the

51
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,800
meaning of the backward version of the message was getting through, then they would be unaware

52
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,259
of the source. They wouldn't be able to attribute it to the record. But the thought

53
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:43,139
popped into their head by some unconscious mechanism—he never specified what that would

54
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:46,270
be—but if it did, then they would have a message in their head with no attributable

55
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,129
source except themselves.

56
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:49,759
Yes, and so they couldn't protect themselves against it.

57
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:56,830
Exactly. So they would now be looking at—thinking, "It's fun to smoke marijuana. It must be my idea."

58
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,379
So what he would do is he would then come in; he'd say, "Okay, this is," for example,

59
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:06,699
"Queen in 'Another One Bites the Dust,'" and he'd play a passage of Queen's "Another

60
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:13,699
One Bites the Dust" in the forward direction.

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It'd sound perfectly fine to you—a famous song. Then he'd say, "Now here's the

62
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,580
same section I'm going to play backwards, and I want you to listen for," in this particular

63
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,909
example, "It's fun to smoke marijuana."

64
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:41,909
Sure enough, everybody starts laughing because everybody hears it. We use it as a classroom

65
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:59,729
demonstration now. It's quite apparent. Yes, it sounds like that, sort of, but it's

66
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,409
like visual illusions. You're also aware at the same time that it isn't really like

67
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:09,620
that. It's got those two levels going on the same time, but you could go, "Yes, okay,

68
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,199
I see what you mean. It does sound like, 'It's fun to smoke marijuana.'" And he has many

69
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,580
other examples like that. That's his procedure, and he just comes in for about an hour, says,

70
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,310
"Here's another passage I want you to listen for," and then plays it. By the time

71
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,969
he's done, after about an hour, people were totally convinced. All these backward messages,

72
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,419
I heard them all when he asked me to hear them.

73
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:33,370
So we thought, "Okay, he's got a theory. He's got an explanation of why he's concerned:

74
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,439
that if it did manage to get in without you being aware of the source, that in fact could

75
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:42,680
be of some concern." So we thought—and there was no research—so why don't we

76
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,849
actually see if you can influence people's behavior consistent with the meaning of the

77
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:50,189
backward passage? But they're not hearing the backward passage. That's the point.

78
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:51,660
They're going to hear it in forward direction.
