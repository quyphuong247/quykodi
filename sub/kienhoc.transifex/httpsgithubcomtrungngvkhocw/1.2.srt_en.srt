Right now there are 75,000 people who have just signed up for this course, right across

1
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,780
the planet. I've been dreaming about this course for, honestly, we've been working

2
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,720
on this for the last year, straight.

3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,410
What we're trying to do in this course is to give you the best on campus experience

4
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,720
that we possibly can. So you're going to be taking this live course, the edX course

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,750
along with 75,000 other people, but you're also going to be doing this on campus course.

6
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:40,579
If they are exactly the same, then we've failed. So what we're trying to do is figure

7
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:45,010
out what we can do live that we can't do online. And that's going to be a lot of

8
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:51,500
this. There's going to be a huge amount of discussion, debates, banging fists on tables about various issues.

9
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:56,719
I like the idea of—a lot of the bulk of the information being available online beforehand,

10
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,010
and then coming in and being able to discuss it. Because I think that's what's important;

11
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,920
the discussion face-to-face with people.

12
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,460
I can't stand people who close their mind off to a possibility. If there is no solid

13
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,800
proof that something does or doesn't exist, you shouldn't close your mind off to it.

14
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:18,800
I really don't, I don't think it's real, I don't think that could possibly happen,

15
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,980
because it doesn't make any sense. But I can almost swear that I've had a dream about

16
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,700
something happening before.

17
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,200
Even if we don't agree with that view, we just have to take the opposite side of it, just to have a discussion.

18
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:33,930
In Episode 4, it's something called System 1 and System 2. So System 1 is the fast, intuitive sort of thinking.

19
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:39,510
As much interaction as possiblef—fany and all interaction. Because that's what you

20
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:44,700
really like. You just need to feel like you're actually engaging with the content, with the

21
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,120
people, in a way that you can't just engage with it sitting in your bedroom.

22
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:57,500
To see that sort of live interaction, on the very same topics that you're learning about—that's massive.

23
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,159
In the next episode we're talking about various illusions. And, hopefully, with 75,000

24
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,180
feelers out, across the internet, they can give us perspectives, they can give us examples

25
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,530
that we would have never considered before.

26
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,360
What we've done, is that we've traveled the world and we've talked to all of these

27
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,900
people face-to-face. When you log in to these websites you'll see just everyone that we've talked to.

28
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,000
Well, kudos for not doing any of those super awkward icebreakers, because, no, no, they're horrible.
