Over the last year, we&#39;ve traveled right across the planet to talk to some of the best people

1
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:26,770
in the world about the science of everyday thinking. Starting right here in Australia,

2
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:32,090
we talked to Ian Frazer about vaccinations, flew to New York to chat with Danny Kahneman

3
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:38,149
about intuition and rationality. We went to England to talk to Susan Blackmore about consciousness

4
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:44,500
and her out-of-body experience, and to Arizona to chat with Richard Nisbett about the person and the situation.

5
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:52,900
Yes. They&#39;d never been asked their advice for how people can improve their everyday thinking, so we asked them.

6
00:00:52,999 --> 00:01:00,400
Start with your intuitions. Watch yourself. Feel those intuitions coming up and question them.

7
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:07,420
At least part of the answer is a healthy skepticism. Let&#39;s see some proof. I want to see some evidence.

8
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:14,420
A key feature of storage in our memories is that that&#39;s a process of linking up any new

9
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,400
information with what we already know. In fact, rather than thinking of your memory

10
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,830
as some sort of box or tape that the more you have in it or on it, the less room you have

11
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:33,030
—actually, memory storage creates capacity for additional storage. The more knowledge

12
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,970
you have in some domain, the more ways there are to link things up and hook things up.

13
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,090
The best way to think about, &quot;Will I be able to do something well in the future,&quot; is to

14
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,620
simulate it in the present. Without a good simulation, we&#39;re really going to make a lot

15
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,570
of mistakes about our own abilities and how we will perform in the future.

16
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:58,570
One is to recognize that we know much less than we think we know. People who think they&#39;ve

17
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,180
got everything figured out are almost always wrong.

18
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,000
Understanding the scientific process—the fact that you can make a hypothesis, or call

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,819
it a guess, if you like, and then test it, and then at the end of the testing be reasonably

20
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:18,200
confident about whether your guess was correct or not—that is the basis for making decisions about things.

21
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,510
That&#39;s the message that I would always leave people with.

22
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:27,510
Pick a few areas and pick a few things where you want to change what you&#39;re doing. Focus

23
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:34,249
on those. I mean, do not expect that you can generally increase the quality of your thinking

24
00:02:34,249 --> 00:02:39,129
because I think you really cannot. If there are repetitive mistakes that you&#39;re prone

25
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:45,510
to make, if you learn the cues, the situations in which you make that mistake, then maybe

26
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,810
you can learn to eliminate them.

27
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:55,700
Do not just read things that make you happy because people agree with you. Challenge yourself by stepping outside that.

28
00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:01,420
Just because it&#39;s expressed in confidence, in detail, with emotion, it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s

29
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:08,420
really a true memory. Without independent corroboration, you can&#39;t know for sure.

30
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:15,840
There are a lot of ways in which we could be biased as consumers. From little things

31
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:21,209
that really shouldn&#39;t make a difference—like I was describing earlier, the name of the

32
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:25,989
wine. That&#39;s something very subtle that could impact the consumer.

33
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:32,019
Read, read, read, read and more reading.

34
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:38,889
It&#39;s also that we&#39;re playful with the things that we approach. It helps take something

35
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:45,889
that might be just a random pile of data typed on papers, laying on the table, and turns

36
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:51,609
it into something that is real because internalizing it means that you bring it into your head.

37
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:57,400
People make all kinds of errors because they can&#39;t think statistically. They make all kinds

38
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:02,180
of errors where they don&#39;t understand the need for a control group in something.

39
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:07,609
 I mean, 28 people took a weight loss program, and nearly all of them lost weight.

40
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:09,349
 Well, what was the control group for that?

41
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,329
Very clearly, the single best predictor of how good you are is how much you know about

42
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:18,700
the domain, not what problem-solving skills you bring to bear on it. We began there. That was wrong.

43
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:25,739
Paying attention to the message of Danny Kahneman&#39;s book is a starting point—and that is, there

44
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:34,530
are many, many sources of error or bias that we learn about in psychology. The message

45
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:41,389
is: when we&#39;re doing one of the tasks that we know that people have difficulty with or

46
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:48,389
are subject to particular biases, just take a little time, reconsider it.

47
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:56,729
The equivalent  to not pressing the send button when you&#39;ve written a message that you&#39;re not sure about.

48
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:01,560
It&#39;s a good idea just to stop and take a little time and reflect.

49
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:08,090
I mean, I&#39;d like to think that in general, thinking about the fact that you can test

50
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:15,090
things yourselves and asking questions about that, that that applies to anything in life,

51
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:20,569
and so even just the realization, &quot;Can I ask a question about this,&quot; and, &quot;How would I

52
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:27,060
test this if I wanted to find out?&quot; I think it applies to anything.

53
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:34,060
The kind of advice that I give people about making better decisions is to be careful about

54
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:41,590
what information you allow yourself to consider. If you&#39;re a forensic scientist and you want

55
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:51,000
to avoid being influenced inappropriately by extraneous information, make sure you don&#39;t know that information.

56
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:58,039
Aside from the obvious: exercise, good diet, get a good night&#39;s sleep... No, I don&#39;t know

57
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:01,020
what my research says about that. Part of what it is, if you&#39;re thinking about, say,

58
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,310
Danny Kahneman&#39;s recent book on thinking fast and slow, there are certain situations you

59
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,310
see outlines where the thinking fast really gets you into trouble, but it also in many,

60
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:16,400
many situations where it gets you out of trouble, where thinking slow would not. There&#39;s not a simple panacea here.

61
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,750
To be honest, I think actually what helps you more is common sense. The problem is that

62
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:29,419
common sense isn&#39;t very common—to use the old phrase. Lots of the time, people cling

63
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:34,560
to their hopes, and their wishes, and their dreams. They think that without putting much

64
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,610
effort in, these things will somehow come true. That&#39;s often underlying a lot of actual

65
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:45,060
belief in the paranormal and a lot of the self-help literature as well.

66
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:51,000
If psychology tells us anything, it&#39;s for the most part, success is associated with hard work.

67
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,700
In terms of every day thinking, I would say you&#39;ve got to put the time in. There&#39;s no shortcuts here.
