It was my first time at university. I was burning the candle at both ends. I was really

1
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,110
tired. I joined the Psychic Research Society, just as you do—something interesting. We&#39;d

2
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,720
had a Ouija board session, which is a bit of a daft thing to do and puts you in a bit

3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,800
of a funny state anyway.

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,800
I went back to a friend&#39;s room afterwards, smoked a joint—this was 1970; what we did,

5
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:32,200
that that wasn&#39;t unusual—and listening to some music, which I think was probably Pink

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,739
Floyd but I&#39;m not sure. So there I am listening to wonderful music, sitting on the floor,

7
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:41,870
really tired, a little bit stoned, not very much, going down a tunnel. I was going down

8
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,969
a dark tunnel towards a bright light. The tunnel was made of trees. You know, I&#39;ve never

9
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:51,210
heard of tunnel experiences. The term near-death experience hadn&#39;t been invented. But there

10
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:57,300
I was, in retrospect, I can see, going through the classic thing: down the tunnel, out of

11
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,260
the end. Suddenly I&#39;m on the ceiling, looking down. There&#39;s my body down there. There&#39;s

12
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,710
my two friends over there. I&#39;m on the ceiling, looking down, and I could see the mouth down

13
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:11,090
there going, &quot;I&#39;m on the ceiling, looking down.&quot; This is the real me. That&#39;s just a

14
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:16,580
shell. All those intuitions we have about being a spirit or soul or something inside

15
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,840
the body that can leave us—wow, it&#39;s really true!

16
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,760
Then one of my friends said, &quot;Whoa! Can you go, move?&quot; And I went shooting off and I travel—I

17
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:32,030
mean, it&#39;s a long story. To cut it very short, I seemed to travel the world, to fly over

18
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:38,190
the sea, to become really—I was originally a sort of human shape, but then I became other

19
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,970
shapes. Then I thought—I got a bit frightened, and I thought I had to come back, and I couldn&#39;t

20
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,620
get back. I got back to the room, but I was so disoriented. I tried to go inside the body,

21
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,300
and I went smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller. I&#39;ve never heard of any of these things.

22
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:57,500
They happen to people quite—not commonly exactly but, you know, all over times and places, they&#39;ve happened.

23
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,410
So I tried to get bigger, so I got bigger and bigger and bigger, and that led me to

24
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:07,410
the classic experience, mystical experience of oneness, where everything was me and not

25
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:13,319
me. The concept of me made no sense. Time and space sort of—there were time and space

26
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:19,700
but not in the ordinary sense we know at all. Things happen but not within a matrix, like

27
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,980
we normally think of it.

28
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,549
Then I was left at the end with a very powerful sense of: where ever you go, there&#39;s always

29
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:33,659
something further. I came back saying that. It took me a couple of days to get remotely

30
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:38,639
back to normal. I had a very supportive friend who helped me.

31
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,670
You can imagine, I was studying—cutting up rats&#39; brains to try and understand memory.

32
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,329
That&#39;s the sort of thing we did in those days, long before the cognitive revolution, and

33
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:52,810
long before people were talking about meditation or mindfulness or anything like that. There

34
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:59,810
I was. What&#39;s going on? Looking back, I can understand why I leapt at paranormal explanations

35
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:03,400
even though they&#39;re hopeless and don&#39;t get you anywhere—because how could I possibly

36
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,459
understand it? Now the science is catching up, but it&#39;s taken all those 44 years to make

37
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,469
sense of what happened remotely.

38
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:17,469
Obviously, moving from that amazing out-of-body experience to studying paranormal psychology

39
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,560
and ultimately becoming a skeptic didn&#39;t happen overnight.

40
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,269
No.

41
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:28,269
Can you give us a sense for how that path happened from moving to that experience to

42
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:30,469
where you are, I suppose, now?

43
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:36,219
Yes. I struggled along. That was the first year of my—first term of my three-year degree.

44
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:40,529
I loved studying the physiology and psychology, but I kind of struggled along all the time

45
00:03:40,529 --> 00:03:44,919
with this in my mind. I ran the Psychical Research Society at Oxford for the whole time

46
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:50,169
I was there. We did experiments not just with Ouija boards but telepathy and clairvoyance.

47
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:55,069
We went and visited haunted houses, and we invited mediums to come and communicate with

48
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:59,109
the dead with us. I did a lot of that as an undergraduate.

49
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:03,279
Then I was absolutely determined that I was going to become a parapsychologist because,

50
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:06,749
by then, I discovered there was this thing called parapsychology, that there were very

51
00:04:06,749 --> 00:04:11,840
few scientists out there in the world studying these things scientifically. That&#39;s what I

52
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,750
wanted to do. My tutor said, &quot;No way. That&#39;s rubbish. You mustn&#39;t do that.&quot; I got a sensible

53
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:23,180
PhD place studying rat brains, which I turned down. Eventually I found the university that

54
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:28,639
would let—I had to pay my way, got a job, did a part-time PhD, which was really unusual

55
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,500
in those days, and funded my way, worked my way through a PhD, and designed all these experiments.

56
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,440
I&#39;d got this grand theory of the akashic records, and the psychic field, and the phenomena out

57
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,590
there, that, really, memory is not in our brain at all. It&#39;s all out there, and that&#39;s

58
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:51,600
therefore when I get something telepathically from you, it&#39;s really the same thing as a memory. Lovely theory.

59
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,990
I discovered two things. One, I wasn&#39;t original in this. There are versions of that, have

60
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:03,990
been—Bergson back in 1910, going way back, lots of them. Secondly, it doesn&#39;t work.

61
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:08,629
I did experiment after experiment after experiment. The first two or three experiments got little

62
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:14,190
hints of what looked like ESP, but as soon as I timed up the methods, got the statistics

63
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:19,639
right, did the experiments well, all the effects went away. I did dozens of experiments that

64
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,509
showed no sign of any telepathy or clairvoyance or precognition or anything.

65
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:29,509
So I thought, well, I still know Tarot cards work. By then I&#39;d learned to read the tarot

66
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:34,419
cards. I had my crystal ball, and I&#39;d learnt—I could stare into the crystal ball and see

67
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:38,710
things, all this stuff. I believed in those, and I&#39;d had this extraordinary experience.

68
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:42,580
So of course all my tutors are wrong. They&#39;re close-minded scientists. They don&#39;t realize

69
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,440
there&#39;s more in the world than your philosophy—all that stuff, you know.

70
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,139
I stayed like that for quite a long time. It is like the world, the truth, the evidence

71
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:57,830
was eating away my beliefs, and I had to drop that and drop that. Then there was another

72
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,949
corner and another corner to turn, and drop that.

73
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:04,460
Then there came a point—and I can remember it. It was one of those flashbulb memories.

74
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,360
Although I could have invented it because we know the doubts about how memory works,

75
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,470
but it has some truth in it at any rate. There I was sat in a bath one day in my house in

76
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:20,060
Guildford, and I thought, &quot;What if none of it&#39;s true?&quot; It was awful to then have to go

77
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:26,520
through all I knew over the next weeks, really, and think, &quot;Is it possible that I was completely

78
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:32,120
wrong?&quot; That experience happened. My memories of that are very clear. They could be a bit

79
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,009
distorted and I&#39;ve selected bits and so on, but I cannot deny the experience. I met loads

80
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:42,590
of other people who had extraordinary experiences, too. Somehow, those experiences have to be

81
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:49,039
valid, meaningful, life-changing experiences without there being telepathy, clairvoyance,

82
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:56,600
other worlds, all of that stuff which after experiment after experiment, I&#39;d found just isn&#39;t there.

83
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:03,180
In a way, the rest of my life has been that unfolding. I&#39;ve had jobs as a university lecturer

84
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,990
and reader, and now a visiting professor at Plymouth, but most of the time I haven&#39;t had

85
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:13,159
a job. I guess, I just wanted to do my research. I want to write my books. So I sort of limped

86
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:17,000
along, kind of, and made a life out of exploring these things.

87
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Sure. Can you give us a sense for what one of these experiments might look like?

88
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,789
Someone who might not be familiar with the experimental method and so on—if you wanted to test,

89
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:37,789
for example, tarot cards, or whether one of these claims were true, what would it look

90
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,139
like? How would you do the experiment?

91
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:47,139
I&#39;ll tell you about three very different approaches. Where I started was very lab-based straightforward

92
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:54,319
tests of telepathy and clairvoyance. A simple example: I would get—I used to teach a parapsychology

93
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,719
course to a lot of students at Surrey University. I&#39;d have maybe a hundred of them in a lecture

94
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:03,039
theater. We would have hidden targets in another room, and they would sit there with a sheet

95
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,780
and they&#39;d have to, on a time signal, they&#39;d have to think what the hidden target was and

96
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,849
tick it off. Then you do all the statistics and you compare it with how many correct you&#39;d

97
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:16,650
expect by chance. It always came out just what you&#39;d expect by chance.

98
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:21,400
Those sort of experiments, you can say, &quot;Well, that&#39;s not telepathy in the real world. In

99
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,509
the real world, it happens between twins; it happens when people are in special states

100
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:31,139
of imagery or relaxation.&quot; So I moved on from those to get people into special states, to

101
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:38,139
put them in the ganzfeld with great relaxation and white noise and things over their eyes,

102
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,510
to get them to imagine things. No better results.

103
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:48,680
A completely different kind of experiment—you mentioned the tarot. Now I&#39;d become a competent,

104
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,170
not brilliant, but a competent tarot reader, and people said things: &quot;How did you know

105
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,940
that? That&#39;s amazing,&quot; you know, all that stuff. So I devised a method for doing the

106
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:04,940
tarot reading in two separate parts so that an assistant would sit down with a person,

107
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,870
do all the laying out of the cards, get them in the right frame of mind and so on, get

108
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:15,010
them to shuffle the cards, lay them out and so on, and then turn them away, give me the

109
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:19,310
order of the cards. I would get myself into the right frame of mind, imagine that the

110
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:24,310
person was there, which they weren&#39;t, and do the reading to myself and then write it

111
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:30,300
all down. Do that for ten people, and see: can those people pick their own reading out

112
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:36,240
of the ten? No, they can&#39;t. Trying all the time not to make it so artificial

113
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,889
to try to make it more realistic.

114
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:44,680
Finally, you mentioned out-of-the-body experiences. I have, for a very, very long time in my house

115
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:51,100
in Somerset—I used to have targets in my house. I met this strange young man who ran

116
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:57,450
an astral projection group in a magazine and so on. He came to visit me, and we talked

117
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:03,300
about all this stuff. He said, &quot;If you put a five-digit number in your house, I will

118
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:09,100
come and visit.&quot; And he said, &quot;I have out-of-the-body experiences spontaneously at night. I can&#39;t

119
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,970
say when they&#39;re going to happen, but if you have that there all the time, when I have

120
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:17,199
one, I will come and visit.&quot; And he said, &quot;Cook me an apple crumble every so often.

121
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:21,680
That will bring me back. That&#39;s my favorite thing,&quot; so I would do that, too.

122
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,970
This is not an artificial lab experiment. This is an ongoing experiment. Now I had to

123
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:29,589
put it where nobody could come—and I didn&#39;t think he would—but I had to make sure he

124
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:33,529
couldn&#39;t look through the window. I had to change the number every so often. For the

125
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:37,800
first few months, every Sunday evening I&#39;d change the number. I had word chosen from

126
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,050
one in twenty words. I had a small object like a toothbrush or a penny or something,

127
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,050
and I stuck that on the wall. There were three possible things. Every time I met someone

128
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:52,670
else who had spontaneous out-of-the-body experiences, I would explain that to them and say, &quot;Anytime

129
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:58,699
you come...&quot; In all those years when those targets were there, I had three people who

130
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:05,700
wrote to me and said, &quot;I&#39;ve been to your house, and I&#39;ve seen it,&quot; and none of them got it right.

131
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:06,019
Really?

132
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:12,220
One got one word right, but you know that just appears in the noise. They were sure

133
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,040
they&#39;d seen it. You see, when you have an out-of-body experience, it looks so vivid

134
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,700
that you can&#39;t help but believe that you&#39;re actually seeing something physically there, but you&#39;re not.
