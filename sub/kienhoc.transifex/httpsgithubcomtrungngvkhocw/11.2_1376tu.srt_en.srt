You and Lee Ross have written a book about the distinction between the person and the situation.

1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,250
 Can you tell me about that distinction?

2
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:19,250
Well, the effort in the book was to examine how people explain their own behavior and

3
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:27,660
how they explain other people&#39;s behavior. There are two broad classes of factors that

4
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:33,190
would help to explain someone&#39;s behavior: what kind of situation is the person in, and

5
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:38,019
what kind of person you have. Obviously, any behavior that you get out of anybody is a

6
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:45,019
function of what&#39;s going on, what he&#39;s responding to, and what&#39;s in the person: what traits,

7
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,679
what kind of temperament the person has, what kind of abilities the person has. These are

8
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:58,679
enduring aspects of a person which we call dispositions. Situational factors are: what&#39;s

9
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:07,180
the weather; am I talking to somebody I enjoy talking to; am I getting paid for this. 

10
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,619
All kinds of things that have nothing—I mean, conceptually—have nothing to do with the

11
00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:17,060
person. They&#39;re just things that are out there. And the person&#39;s attributes and his current

12
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:23,689
state—emotional state, and so on—and that situation are what&#39;s producing the behavior.

13
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:30,689
We have a problem, however, which is that, for other people, it&#39;s much easier to invoke

14
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,619
these dispositions to explain their behavior because when I&#39;m looking at you behave, I&#39;m

15
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:44,380
looking at you. I mean, that&#39;s my focus, and I&#39;m not attending that much to other things.

16
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,630
It may be literally invisible to me, things that are visible to you, but in any case they&#39;re

17
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,909
not as salient because you are what I&#39;m responding to.

18
00:01:54,909 --> 00:02:01,909
While we&#39;re talking about this dispositionism, one of the things that&#39;s worth noting is that

19
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:07,899
in our culture, it&#39;s kind of overdetermined in part because we observe people in the same

20
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:14,269
situations most of the time; in part just because when we see someone act, we focus

21
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:21,269
on the actor, not on the situation. In our particular culture, it&#39;s almost a theory that

22
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:28,480
people are responsible for their behavior. We don&#39;t look kindly on people who are fair-weather

23
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:36,000
friends, or who adjust their—trim to their behavior to the sail to the prevailing winds, we would say.

24
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,200
Also, even our language predisposes us. You notice we talk about an honest person, but

25
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:49,200
we don&#39;t have a term for a situation that prompts honesty. We have to say, &quot;Well, this

26
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:56,239
is the kind of situation of which the average person is honest, and only very dishonest

27
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,250
people will be dishonest in this situation,&quot; or, &quot;It&#39;s a kind of situation in which most

28
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:07,379
people take some liberties, but only the most extremely honest people can be counted on.&quot;

29
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:13,010
We have to engage in this very complicated language. But we can say, &quot;This is an honest

30
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,959
person,&quot; and that&#39;s a shorthand for saying something about what we expect the actor to

31
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:23,700
do across the situation. And we can say, &quot;How would you characterize a situation in which

32
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,220
you expect most people to be brave?&quot; We literally don&#39;t have a word.

33
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:33,090
Now it isn&#39;t that we can&#39;t conceive of such a thing. We do have one domain, one that we

34
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:39,420
care about a great deal in our culture, where we do have that. When we talk about a test,

35
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:46,040
we can say the test is easy or hard. That&#39;s a really useful shorthand for saying we expect

36
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:53,000
most people to do well at it, or only exceptionally able people to do well at it, and that kind of thing.

37
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:59,129
We also have it for emotion words. We can talk about a scary movie or a sexy poster

38
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:06,000
or things like that, that again have that property that they&#39;re telling us what to expect from the average person.

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,100
But it&#39;s interesting that we don&#39;t have these terms when it pertains to what we normally think of as personally traits.

40
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:21,180
It&#39;s even worse than that. You can have a subject interact with someone else and say,

41
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:28,759
&quot;We want you to find out whether this person is an extrovert or an introvert. Here&#39;s the

42
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,889
list of questions that you&#39;re going to ask, and I&#39;m going to tell you which of these responses

43
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:41,889
that subject is to give.&quot; The experimenter says, &quot;Okay. Wouldn&#39;t you say you&#39;ve been

44
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,490
the life of the party sometimes?&quot; the subject.

45
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,940
&quot;Yes, I&#39;ve been the life of the party.&quot; You&#39;d say, &quot;Yes, I&#39;ve been the life of the party

46
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:56,470
sometimes.&quot; I have told this person what to say, and after I&#39;m through with it all, if

47
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,199
I told him to present himself as an extrovert, then you ask me, &quot;What do you think of that guy?&quot;

48
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,190
 &quot;He&#39;s kind of extroverted, I think.&quot;

49
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:10,870
Or in the case of, &quot;Write this essay,&quot; if I put you through the situation yourself,

50
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,270
&quot;Here, I want you to write an essay, pro-French. Do that right now.&quot; &quot;By the way this guy wrote

51
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,360
an essay, pro-French. What do you think of him?&quot; &quot;He&#39;s probably pro-French.&quot; &quot;How do

52
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,550
you feel?&quot; &quot;Well, neutral. Maybe a little negative.&quot; We just don&#39;t pick that social

53
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:28,560
influence up, which just seems so obvious to you when you state it like that.

54
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,100
Given what we know about the weakness of personality factors and the strength of situational factors,

55
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:41,940
if I were an employer hiring a new employee in my company, what sort of advice would you

56
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:48,600
have then for what would be the most predictive of their future behavior?

57
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,840
Well, obviously if you had evidence about how they&#39;ve behaved in very, very similar

58
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:01,840
situations in the past, that would be useful. But my advice to an employer would be to create

59
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:10,370
the kind of context—the kind of corporate norms—and reinforce them in such a that

60
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:17,750
they produce the kinds of behavior that you want. That is to say, I&#39;d try hard to model

61
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:24,520
that kind of behavior; I would celebrate it when I saw it; I would respond immediately

62
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,460
to behavior that is inconsistent with what I wanted.

63
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:34,160
We see this in the area that I work in. Conflict resolution is often a feeling that you have

64
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:41,160
to find the right guy to make a deal with. The evidence that we find is that the same

65
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:50,750
person who might be a terrorist at one point in time can become a heroic peace fighter

66
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:56,599
at another period of time. This was true in the work we&#39;ve done in Northern Ireland where

67
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:03,330
we looked at ex-bombers who became peace activists. To some extent, it&#39;s true even in the life

68
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:10,330
of Nelson Mandela. Lots of times people say, &quot;We&#39;re looking for a Mandela on the other

69
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:20,800
side,&quot; when what they should be doing is, &quot;How can we create a context that creates a Mandela on the other side?&quot;

70
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:27,280
Are we good at putting ourselves in the shoes of others?

71
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:34,280
We tend to be blind to some degree about many situational factors that are affecting people.

72
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,870
It&#39;s going to be hard for us to put ourselves in their shoes because we don&#39;t even know

73
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:46,870
they&#39;re wearing shoes. I mean, if you don&#39;t see the situation, it&#39;s very difficult.

74
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:57,500
Just a point about—since I mentioned Lee Ross who is my life-long friend—he happens

75
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:05,370
to be extremely good for giving advice about how to deal with some problem. Most of our

76
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
problems, many of our problems, are interpersonal problems: 

77
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,129
&quot;I&#39;m having a real problem with this guy.&quot; He&#39;s amazingly good.

78
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:21,479
I&#39;m sitting there and, &quot;My god. That probably would work,&quot; and then it does work. I asked

79
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:25,629
him, fairly recently, &quot;Why are you so good at this?&quot;

80
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:29,500
He says, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s easy. Most of the time you say, &#39;I&#39;m having this problem with this

81
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,690
person,&#39; and people say, &#39;Terrible. He&#39;s a terrible person. Terrible you have to deal with that.&#39;&quot;

82
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:42,500
Lee doesn&#39;t empathize with you. He says, &quot;I&#39;m guessing this is the situation you&#39;re confronting.

83
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,760
I&#39;m guessing this is what this guy is concerned about. I&#39;m guessing, you did this thing...&quot;

84
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,440
In other words, buying completely out of me, he&#39;s trying to scan the situation, suggest

85
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,280
things to me that might have been going on, and it&#39;s tremendously useful. I don&#39;t need

86
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,500
somebody&#39;s commiseration. I need their help in solving the problem, and he can do that

87
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,900
because he is genuinely much more attuned to situations, far more than I am. That&#39;s for sure.
