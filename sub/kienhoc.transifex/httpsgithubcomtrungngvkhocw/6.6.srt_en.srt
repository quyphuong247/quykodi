Hopefully people came up with a few suggestions about what it would take to convince them

1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,879
of this sort of claim. Now this is a really nice example because it brings in a few of

2
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:18,900
the ideas that we were talking about previously, about what would you include in the experimental

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:25,460
design, how you could use experiments and science to inform everyday decision-making.

4
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,800
One of the things—I mean, if you put yourself in that position, what would it take to convince you?

5
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:36,720
If I prepared a cup of tea, behind myself here, and I had tea and I added a little bit

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,500
of milk, and I gave it to you and I asked you, &quot;Did I add the milk to the tea, or tea

7
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:47,450
to the milk,&quot; and you were correct, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be terribly convinced. I don&#39;t know

8
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:52,130
whether you were actually just guessing or whether you can legitimately, truly tell the

9
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:57,410
difference between milk added first or second. Better—probably, I think—would be if I

10
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,300
had two cups of tea, one with milk added first, one with milk added second, and then gave

11
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,460
it to you and shuffled them around maybe, and you had a sip of each, and then made a

12
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:11,600
guess. So that&#39;s two, but even still I don&#39;t think that&#39;s terribly convincing. I think

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,570
people would probably share the same sort of intuition. How many cups of milk, how many

14
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,969
cups of tea, and how many of these sorts of things would it take to convince you that

15
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:27,869
someone can tell the difference between tea added first or tea added second. Is it two?

16
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:34,560
Is it three? Is it four? Is it five? How many would it take to say, &quot;Okay, I believe you.

17
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,880
I think something&#39;s actually happening here.&quot;

18
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,880
Well, if we go back to Ronald Fisher&#39;s case, the way that he set it up was he had eight

19
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:50,030
cups of tea. He had eight cups of tea. Four of the eight had milk added first. Four of

20
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:55,249
them had milk added second. He told the woman that this was going to be the case, &quot;We&#39;ll

21
00:01:55,249 --> 00:02:00,359
set this up. We have four here, four here, and we&#39;ll prepare these for you, and I&#39;m going

22
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:06,619
to hide which of these are which. I&#39;ll present them to you one at a time. You can taste them,

23
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:12,100
and then you have to guess whether it&#39;s milk-first or milk-second.&quot; Now one of the important

24
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,409
elements here is that he would have to present them randomly.

25
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:22,290
Now if you think back to episode three, where we were talking about the stocking task, where

26
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:29,290
people had a very right-handed bias in selecting the stockings that they preferred, then the

27
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,720
same thing could be happening here. If you just had, for example, all of the milk-firsts

28
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,590
on the right, all the tea-firsts on the left, people might just chose the one and say all

29
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,640
of the ones on the right are milk-first. So in order to account for that, what you need

30
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,700
to do is shuffle them up. You need to present them randomly to the woman.

31
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,049
But what do you mean by randomly? Because we just learned that we&#39;re quite terrible

32
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:58,439
at coming up with random sequences, so if you were to give the eight tea cups to the

33
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:03,939
woman in the sort of random order that you came up with, you might just choose milk-first,

34
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:10,200
tea-first, milk-first, tea-first. She, being the same at picking up these non-random things,

35
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,939
might go milk-first, tea-first, milk-first, tea-first. She would do that same random order.

36
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:19,560
So it would look like she&#39;s responding correctly, but actually she is just picking up on the

37
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,230
same sort of non-randomness that you created

38
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:28,469
That&#39;s exactly right. In fact, Ronald Fisher pointed that out, not explicitly pointing

39
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:34,319
that out, but he suggested when selecting this random sequence that you use some objective

40
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,760
device, like a coin flip, or the roll of a dice, or cards, or, I can&#39;t remember, something

41
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,840
like—things that you would normally use in games of chance.

42
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,689
A random number generator.

43
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:50,650
A random number table, he actually said, because at the time they had those. Exactly. So you

44
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,049
present these randomly to the woman, and she would have a sip, and then she would make

45
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:58,879
a guess as to whether it was milk-first or tea-first.

46
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,950
He had eight of these cups. Now I don&#39;t want to get into the mathematics, but one of the

47
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:08,569
elements that we want to highlight here is that he has eight cups of tea, of which four

48
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:15,140
were milk-first, four were tea first. She had to get a sufficient number correct in

49
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,030
order for people around the table to believe her, but the question is: what is that number?

50
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:23,639
What would it take to convince people around the table that she got it right? Well, what

51
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,889
if she got two of the eight right, three out of the eight?

52
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:31,310
Well, he didn&#39;t actually say in the experiment—when he wrote this up in the chapter, he didn&#39;t

53
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:36,910
actually say how many she got correct, but imagine that she got all eight correct, that

54
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:42,919
she could correctly distinguish between the cups of tea with milk added first and milk

55
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:48,960
added second. How strange is that? Well, there&#39;s eight cups of tea and—I mean, again, I don&#39;t

56
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,740
want to get in the mathematics here—but if you were to actually calculate the way,

57
00:04:53,740 --> 00:05:00,690
the possible, all of the possible ways of doing that, there are about 70 ways of making

58
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:06,539
a choice in that scenario but only one way of getting it correct. So there&#39; s a 1-in-70

59
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:13,539
chance, which is pretty unlikely, that she would be able to do that by chance or that

60
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:21,620
she would be able to guess correctly without any sort of real capability of doing that.

61
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:29,710
It seems that sufficiently weird&#39;s, sufficiently unlikely to be able to say that, &quot;Well, hang

62
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,370
on, maybe there is something here.&quot; But you could set the criteria and wherever you like.

63
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:40,240
It&#39;s not just eight cups. You could demand 9 cups, or 10 cups, or 20 cups. If you had

64
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,870
20 cups, that she had to guess all 20 correct before you believed her, the possibilities

65
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:51,900
of doing that are about—I don&#39;t know—1 in 5,000, I think, of doing that correctly

66
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:58,900
by just guessing alone, which is pretty unlikely. I&#39;d be pretty inclined to say that she can

67
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,110
do what she claims if she guessed all 20 correctly—or even eight of those correct.

68
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,349
I think that&#39;s a really nice example for the experimental method and highlighting this

69
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:12,389
idea of fishiness, of lumpiness, in chance.

70
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:18,509
Yes, that&#39;s exactly what scientists do every day. They&#39;re designing experiments and then

71
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:23,319
trying to figure out whether there&#39;s anything strange going on here. You and I are actually

72
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:29,479
cognitive scientists. That&#39;s how we spend most of our days, and we—some of the things

73
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:35,379
we&#39;ve been working on in our lab is testing claims such as fingerprint identification.

74
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:39,789
There are people who testify in court, usually police officers, about whether a crime scene

75
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:44,870
print matches a suspect or not. They&#39;re called fingerprint Experts, but do they have genuine

76
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,889
expertise? Are they better at—any better at matching prints than you and I are?

77
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:50,650
We&#39;ll find out in episode 10.

78
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,889
Yes. Another one that a colleague of ours Wen Wu is working on is whether honeybees

79
00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:01,879
can tell the difference between artwork by Picasso and artwork by Monet. Something else

80
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:07,300
we&#39;ve been working on is that flashed face-distortion effect that we saw in episode two where the

81
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,930
faces look strange and distorted. We&#39;ve been trying to manipulate ways to strengthen or

82
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:19,930
to exacerbate that effect and what creates it. Again, we&#39;re setting up experiments and

83
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:26,300
trying to convince ourselves and our colleagues and everybody else that there&#39;s something

84
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,550
going on here or maybe not.

85
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:35,490
Something—one claim that&#39;s really interesting me at the moment is wine expertise or wine

86
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:41,650
taste-testing. There&#39;ve been a few articles in the popular press very recently kind of

87
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:47,180
saying, &quot;There&#39;s actually nothing to this. Wine tasting is junk. People can&#39;t tell the

88
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,439
difference between cheap and expensive wine, or even red and white wine.&quot; There might not

89
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:59,439
be anything to wine expertise, so I spoke to Toni Mantonakis about exactly this.
