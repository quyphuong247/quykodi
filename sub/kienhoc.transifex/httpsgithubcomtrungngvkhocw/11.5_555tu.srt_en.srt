Early in the course, we discussed our failure to recognize the extent to which our interpretations

1
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,539
are shaped by our prior knowledge and experiences. We called this the fundamental cognitive error.

2
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:20,520
We also discussed another failure in which we don&#39;t account for the multiple ways in

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,140
which a situation could be viewed. Now this is related to something we learnt later on

4
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,730
which was the false consensus effect where we tend to think that other people think the

5
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:35,710
same way that we do—that other people have the same beliefs and opinions as we do. But

6
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,890
it&#39;s just not true.

7
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:43,390
Now we have the fundamental attribution error, and that&#39;s another failure to recognize the

8
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,350
power of the situation in making predictions about human behavior.

9
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:54,079
That&#39;s exactly right. It is fundamental, and it&#39;s not easy, though. What is easy are personality

10
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:01,079
traits, so saying that somebody&#39;s laid-back or generous or honest or messy. These sorts

11
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:07,570
of things just roll off the tongue, and it&#39;s a knee-jerk response that we use to explain

12
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,799
people&#39;s behavior in new situations.

13
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,799
Again, we&#39;ve just seen several landmark demonstrations of the power of the situation that I think

14
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:24,450
do a far better job of explaining and predicting people&#39;s behavior. But it&#39;s not easy. It&#39;s

15
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:31,450
a fundamental shift in how we think about people and predicting behavior.

16
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:36,830
I think this is related to something called channel factors. What is it? What is it about

17
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:43,830
the situation—about the context, the circumstance—that needs to be in place in order for that behavior

18
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:48,110
or that action, that communication, what is it that&#39;s going to make the thing happen or

19
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:54,909
not? It&#39;s not easy to identify. It&#39;s entire pursuit of social psychology, essentially,

20
00:01:54,909 --> 00:02:00,310
to figure out what these small components are and how to put them into place in order

21
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,450
to elicit these different types of behaviors.

22
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,070
Yes. Let&#39;s go through them then. What are the channel factors in the experiments that

23
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,209
we just discussed?

24
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:13,040
In the Good Samaritan, it seems to be the amount of time people had available to help.

25
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,040
If they had time, they were more likely to help.

26
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,569
In the Milgram experiment, there are a couple of channel factors operating there. One of

27
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:26,569
them was gradual escalation. Just putting the shocks up by 15 volts each time was probably

28
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,610
a channel factor that led to them going all the way to the end, to the triple X. If you

29
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:41,500
ask people to go from 15 up to triple X in one go, they are probably unlikely to make

30
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,020
it.

31
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:47,980
Another one was there wasn&#39;t a clear way to exit the experiment. There wasn&#39;t a big red

32
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,860
button that you get to press to say, &quot;Look, the experiment is over.&quot;

33
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,800
There&#39;s a third one in Milgram that I&#39;m forgetting.

34
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,770
Yes. Essentially, the fact that he was in a lab coat.

35
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:05,770
Yes. An authority one, yes. He&#39;s there in a lab coat, and it&#39;s a diffusion of responsibility

36
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,590
again, on to this experimenter. You&#39;re not taking a responsibility for that learner&#39;s

37
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,940
shock and pain.

38
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,940
The third one we looked at was the bystander effect. The channel factor there seems to

39
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,180
be the presence or absence of people in the room.

40
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,750
Now we spoke to Richard Nisbett and Lee Ross about the role cannel factors in predicting

41
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,249
behavior, and here&#39;s what they had to say.
