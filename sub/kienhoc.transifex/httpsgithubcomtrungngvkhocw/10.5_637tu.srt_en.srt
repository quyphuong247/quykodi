As Scott said, these Experimenter Expectancy
Effects or Observer Effects, as they are also

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:14,000
called, are really quite common. We've seen
them today in Facilitated Communication, in Clever Hans.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,230
There's also a cool example called water dowsing,
where people use these divining rods to find

4
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:26,769
water under the ground, or treasure, or jewels,
things like that. The dowsing rods are actually

5
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:29,569
quite sensitive to the subtle movements of
your hands.

6
00:00:29,569 --> 00:00:34,649
There's also a really cool paper by Lisa Lit
that asks the question whether sniffer dogs

7
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:41,600
can actually detect drugs or explosives, or
whether just the dogs are responding to the subtle cues of their handlers.

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,530
That's right, and this is why we do experiments,
right? Like Lisa Lit, you can test whether

9
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:53,160
sniffer dogs can actually detect explosives.
You can test whether Clever Hans is actually

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,999
counting and doing complex mathematics. This
is what we do every day, and this is why we

11
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:02,710
design the experiments the way that we do.

12
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:08,580
Take any area. I have colleagues in Developmental
Psychology, and they're interested in measuring

13
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:14,510
infant responses. Obviously, infants can't
speak, but they can look. You might show them

14
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:20,440
a picture of a face, for example, and measure
how long they look at this face compared to

15
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,920
this face on this side. You simply measure
how long the infant's staring at one face,

16
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,810
or you show them something odd and measure
how long they look at it, compared to something

17
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:35,810
else. But the people who were doing the analyses,
the people who are scoring these videotapes

18
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,350
for the looking time in infants don't know
a thing about the experiment.

19
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:47,330
We talked about this blind procedure. There
it is an action. You can actually see the

20
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,390
person who's measuring it, and all they're
doing is just measuring, "Okay, left, left,

21
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:57,310
left," with a stopwatch. "Right, okay, now
they're on that side," and so they can't

22
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:03,200
possibly be swayed to go to one side or another
because they don't know which hypothesis they're supporting.

23
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:10,069
I did a bunch of work in graduate school with
Japanese quail. Now I won't get into the specifics

24
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:14,070
of why, but we were measuring how much time
they spent on that either side of the cage.

25
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:19,050
They'd spend it on this side or this side,
and I was there, literally with a stopwatch

26
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,800
measuring how long they were on one side versus
another and writing down the times. I didn't

27
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,800
know which side of the cage they should have
been spending their time on essentially.

28
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:39,050
That's the nature of blind experimentation,
and that's why we do this. By not knowing

29
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,730
what's happening or not knowing what to expect,
you can't possibly be swayed in the same way

30
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:49,120
that you were, like the facilitators were
in the Facilitated Communication, or sniffer

31
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,020
dogs, or anything else. That's why we design
them this way to be intentionally naive so

32
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:02,020
you're not going to sway or influence other
people. It's one of the most important elements

33
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,580
of the scientific method, and that's why we
do it.

34
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,319
Yes. I hope that these expectancy effects
are really quite familiar to people because

35
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,450
we saw them in episode two. When you're told
specific information about what to listen

36
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:22,590
for, for exampleâ€”so if you're told, to hear,
"It's fun to smoke marijuana," when you

37
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:28,709
listen to Queen backwards, you will hear it.
If the information is ambiguous enough, you

38
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:34,880
can bend it to suit your expectations and
you interpret it. You see, hear, and remember

39
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,090
it in a way that you expect based on that
specific information.

40
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:46,090
Now expectancy effects play a really large
and important role in forensic science. We

41
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:52,240
travelled to California to speak to Bill Thompson,
who researches this stuff. He's interested

42
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:57,760
in how people interpret forensic evidence
like DNA, and here's what he had to say.
