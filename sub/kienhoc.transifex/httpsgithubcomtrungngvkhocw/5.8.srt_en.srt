In Think101, we&#39;re trying to essentially practice what we preach. We just learned a fair bit

1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,420
within this episode about learning to learn, and desirable difficulties, and the best way

2
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,949
to learn information and retain that information over a long period of time.

3
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,689
So what we do with this sort of information? How do we apply it in the course? Well, students—hopefully

4
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:32,689
they can use this is as an exercise to see, for example, how the spacing effect is imposed

5
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,940
in our course, or massed versus spaced learning, or interleaving content or retrieval practice.

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,780
Some of the examples include, for the spacing effect, we have it spread over 12 weeks instead

7
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,540
of releasing all the content all at once in 48 hours, for example. There&#39;s a quiz every

8
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,830
single week instead of just a midterm and a final so students are having to retrieve

9
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:01,230
that information week by week. At the end of every episode, we have people provide an

10
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,869
example from their everyday lives. So if they can see, if they&#39;re actually working on the

11
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:11,070
content, they&#39;re discussing this material around the dinner table or with friends or

12
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,740
they bring it up at the pub, the more that they do this, the more that they retrieve

13
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,520
this information and work on it outside of the course, the better it&#39;s going to stick

14
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,969
in memory and the longer they&#39;ll have it.

15
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:29,899
There&#39;s a bunch of these examples—spaced learning, interleaving. Every single episode,

16
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:35,689
people might notice a shot in a different location. We have the lawnmower that starts

17
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:40,579
in the background. We have lorikeets that are flying in the back. The idea here is that

18
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:47,579
we have—people don&#39;t just associate a particular concept with a particular location. We have

19
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:52,219
the availability heuristic, and they don&#39;t just associate that with Danny Kahneman&#39;s

20
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:56,929
apartment. They learn it and they see it in a whole bunch of different contexts, and that&#39;s

21
00:01:56,929 --> 00:02:02,039
obviously important. There&#39;s a bunch of these sort of context effects that we&#39;re relying

22
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:07,920
on throughout the course to try to make learning stick, to make these things stick in people&#39;s

23
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,030
memory for a longer period.

24
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:16,670
The problem is we have to balance these things with interest. It&#39;s a difficult sort of thing

25
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:23,670
to do, as we said, because we have these desirable difficulties. We have these sort of effortful

26
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:29,670
processes. It&#39;s hard. If we did this right, we would make this sort of material very difficult

27
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:36,150
for students to organize and everything else, but that&#39;s at a cost. We have tens of thousands

28
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,730
of students in this course, and we want to keep them around week to week. It&#39;s not like

29
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,780
a university course where they have to be there in order to get certified. People are

30
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,939
doing this on their own time. They&#39;re actually sitting back and watching this almost as entertainment.

31
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:55,000
If that&#39;s the case, you can&#39;t make it really effortful for people in the same sense that we can in the university.

32
00:02:55,099 --> 00:03:01,610
So the way that we&#39;re trying to make it interesting is to have really high-production-value video,

33
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,400
to shoot in interesting places. We&#39;re interviewing some of the best people on the planet. In

34
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,219
a couple of weeks, we have the MythBusters. That&#39;s going to be exciting. This is hopefully

35
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:16,860
going to keep the people interested in the content. We have, Coming Up in the Next Episode,

36
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:23,049
we have highlight reels. All of this is designed to keep people&#39;s interest, but at the same

37
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:28,620
time we&#39;re trying to balance that with these sort of desirable difficulties to make the

38
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:35,620
material stick and last longer. It&#39;d be an exercise for the students to watch each of

39
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,109
these episodes as we do them to see what sort of learning principles that we&#39;re applying

40
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:45,890
and see whether they can recognize what sort of things that we&#39;re doing.
