Now let&#39;s go back to this distinction between system one and system two. Now earlier on,

1
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:15,610
you gave us a few examples that come effortlessly to us, so, &quot;Two plus two equals&quot; appears,

2
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:21,200
and recognizing an angry face just sort of happens. But there are groups of people that

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:27,550
we call experts who can do some pretty amazing feats effortlessly, tasks that you and I might

4
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:34,550
find difficult as novices. For example, chess experts can identify and remember just thousands

5
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:42,710
of chess moves, and they can quickly decide what the next move is way better than novices.

6
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:48,940
Radiologists, medical examiners, can put two mammograms, two breast scans, side by side

7
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,899
on the screen, and in just a blink of an eye, can tell you whether a person has cancer or

8
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,769
not. There&#39;s another example that you and I have worked on for fingerprint experts.

9
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:04,940
Again, if you put two fingerprints side by side on the screen to a fingerprint expert,

10
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:10,010
they can, in a blink of an eye, tell you whether those prints came from the same person or

11
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:16,980
two different people. Right. It&#39;s this idea of expertise, which

12
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,510
I think is really quite interesting from a systems perspective. When you&#39;re talking

13
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:28,510
about chess experts or diagnosticians, these things which were system two is now system

14
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,400
one. When the diagnostician or radiologist is looking at a breast scan, they can tell,

15
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:43,700
as you said, within 250 milliseconds, whether the scan is normal or abnormal. Now obviously

16
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,300
that didn&#39;t happen overnight. They can&#39;t just look at it without knowing anything about

17
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,220
a breast scan, and so they need to know what they&#39;re looking for, but after they&#39;ve

18
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:59,080
accumulated thousands of experiences with that particular class of materials, then it

19
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,350
becomes a system one process, then it feels like it&#39;s just birth equipment, like it

20
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:08,310
just happening to them. That&#39;s the hallmark of expertise.

21
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:14,450
Now we talked earlier about pupil dilation. Well, the same thing actually happens. Imagineâ€”so

22
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:20,110
going back to the example that I&#39;ve provided before in terms of driving. Now the same thing

23
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,100
happens when you&#39;re learning how to drive for the first time. If I were to measure the

24
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,660
pupil dilation of a novice driver, imagine all of the things that they have to pay attention

25
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:33,700
to when you&#39;re learning how to drive, particularly if it&#39;s a manual transmission: the friction

26
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:40,700
point of the clutch; you have where the pedestrians are, where your indicators are, everything

27
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,500
else. You&#39;re paying attention to a million things at once. If I were to measure the pupil

28
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,980
size of the novice driver, they&#39;d be like saucers, wouldn&#39;t they? But as you learn

29
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,980
how to drive, these things get easier and easier as you accumulate hours at the wheel.

30
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,090
Eventually, after 10 or 20 years of driving, you&#39;re eating a sandwich; you&#39;re carrying

31
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,160
on a conversation; you&#39;re talking on the phone; you&#39;re swerving between traffic.

32
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:11,530
It&#39;s like breathing. It feels like an extension of you, if anything. It&#39;s truly a system

33
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,790
one process. If you were to measure the size of the pupils of the expert driver, they&#39;d

34
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:23,300
be just tiny by comparison to the novice driver. I think that&#39;s a really nice example of,

35
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:29,270
again, the difference between system one and system two and how that develops as you develop

36
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,610
expertise. Another really good example is faces. We&#39;re

37
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:39,610
all experts with faces. If we were to show people upright faces, you have all of these

38
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:45,099
tasks that you can instantly recognize whether it&#39;s male, whether it&#39;s female, even who

39
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:50,680
the person is. That&#39;s only because we have experience with upright faces that we have

40
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,790
experienced our entire lives. But if we turn the faces upside down, then it&#39;s a completely

41
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:02,849
different story. People are not good at recognizing upside-down faces, so much so that there&#39;s

42
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:07,790
a whole different bunch of demonstrations that I think are really quite impressive.

43
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:13,709
But this is only because we are not experts with upside down faces, only upright faces.

44
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:20,250
I asked Danny Kahneman about this idea of expertise, and you may have heard the number

45
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:27,250
10,000 hours, so it takes ten thousand hours to become an expert. I asked him about this

46
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,500
idea of expertise and how to turn novices into experts more quickly, and here&#39;s what he had to say.
