Tim Wilson talks about this idea of inside information. You can imagine that information

1
00:00:12,459 --> 00:00:18,590
that you&#39;ve experienced firsthand seems like it&#39;s more relevant to the decisions that you

2
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:24,450
make. You could take an example like if you&#39;re trying to decide whether to invest money in

3
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:31,080
a bakery, say, so you have Bakery A and Bakery B. You go in to Bakery A and you&#39;re talking

4
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,879
to the employees; you&#39;re sampling the goods; you talk to the manager about their business

5
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:42,809
plan and everything else, but you don&#39;t do that for Bakery B. Bakery B, you just read

6
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:48,780
about in the newspaper or some report or something. Now when it comes to investing money in the

7
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,499
two, you feel more confident with A than you would with B, but you probably, when you&#39;re

8
00:00:54,499 --> 00:01:01,489
actually tallying the results of doing that investment, you probably wouldn&#39;t be any better

9
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:08,489
with A than B. If anything, that inside personal information that you have with A might actually

10
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:15,470
hurt you in the end because it feels like it&#39;s something that you have privileged access

11
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:24,300
to, so it&#39;s probably going to give you misinformation about that bakery and about the investment that you&#39;re about to make.

12
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,700
The same holds for job interviews, right?

13
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,250
Absolutely.

14
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,620
We think if we can spend ten minutes with a person, we would be able to predict exactly

15
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,910
what kind of employee they will be, so, &quot;Yes, she was very confident. I think she will be

16
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:42,830
able to lead a team very well,&quot; or, &quot;I&#39;m not so sure about her. She was unsure of herself,

17
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:49,530
and I don&#39;t think she&#39;s the best fit for this organization,&quot; but the data say that interviews

18
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,030
are entirely non-predictive of the performance, of job performance.

19
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,960
That&#39;s right. In fact, there has been a—we keep talking about these giant analyses. There

20
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,960
was one done by I think it was Frank Schmidt and Jack Hunter [sic], and they looked at I think

21
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:13,000
it was 32,000 employees across every job that you can imagine, from farmers to musicians

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,970
to sales people and so on. They actually tried to figure out—so they did the experiment

23
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,920
to see how people would predict that people would do, the employees would do in a particular

24
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,440
job, and how they actually did after the fact on the basis of these interviews.

25
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,530
They found that pretty much these standard interviews were almost completely useless.

26
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,930
I mean, I think it accounted for what&#39;s called eight percent of the variance. To put that

27
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:48,930
in lay terms, it means that—for example, if you had, if you placed your 100 employees

28
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:55,880
on a scale from the best to the worst, and then you actually saw how they performed,

29
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,600
and then ranked them again from the best to the worst, you would be right on about eight

30
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,459
of those people, in putting them in the correct spot, out of 100 employees. That&#39;s not really good.

31
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,930
Now, remember, the point to this episode is that we don&#39;t really have much insight into

32
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,770
our own behavior. These experiments in this topic mean that we&#39;re not very good at predicting

33
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:23,490
other people&#39;s behavior as well. In fact, we&#39;re not much better, as Richard Nisbett

34
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:30,100
said, we&#39;re not much better at predicting our own behavior compared to other people&#39;s behavior.

35
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:36,040
The reason that interviews are so bad, I think, is because of something called the confirmation

36
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:43,040
bias. We see what we expect to see. When you&#39;re interviewing a job applicant; you&#39;ve read

37
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:47,819
their CV; you&#39;ve read their resume, you have a pretty good idea of whether you like the

38
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:52,520
person or not before they even enter the room. Then when they enter the room, you ask them

39
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:58,500
questions. The thing you ask them is going to be consistent with what your expectations are.

40
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,620
So the question might be, &quot;Are you a strong leader?&quot;

41
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:06,379
Exactly. So, &quot;Are you a strong leader,&quot; or you only ask them about the things that will

42
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:10,200
confirm your beliefs. So the very questions that you ask are only going to be ones that

43
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:18,500
make them look better, that they might respond well to. That&#39;s why these standard interviews are so bad.

44
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,070
What&#39;s better is something called a structured interview. If you asked every single applicant

45
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:29,270
that comes in the door exactly the same things, then it gets a little better in terms of predicting

46
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,860
their behavior and in terms of future performance.

47
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,370
Better would be to have—this is work by a colleague of mine, Kevin Eva, and what he&#39;s

48
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:44,370
doing is interviewing medical school applicants, who are already exceptionally good because

49
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,570
by virtue of applying for medical school, but what they found is that if they asked

50
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:54,460
people in different rooms and different scenarios—you have different people that are asking these

51
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,210
same people different things completely independent of one another—

52
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:03,690
then that is even better than a structured interview. The same person asking this—you

53
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,750
have different people asking very structured sorts of questions, and that even gets you

54
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,970
a little bit further. The sort of standard interview that we&#39;re used to, that most of

55
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:18,190
us have had throughout our careers, is virtually useless, I think.

56
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,720
I think it&#39;s also true that the best predictor of future behavior could be the past behavior,

57
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,169
so, yes, you could do a structured interview, but even better might be to get a sort of

58
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:32,830
standard measures of people&#39;s performance in the past. Whether you&#39;re trying to select

59
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:39,220
a job applicant or even a roommate, how—in the past, have they paid their rent on time?

60
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:46,220
In the past, have they had good performance evaluations and good outcomes?—things that

61
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:53,160
it&#39;s difficult to fake or control—it seems that those things, that those standard measures

62
00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:01,100
over a long period of time, are much better at predicting job performance or behaviour in the future.

63
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:06,000
Absolutely, and it&#39;s not just—so it&#39;s sort of these long-term predictors, as you&#39;ve said,

64
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,889
so, for example, if in university, it would be GPA or even high school, right?

65
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:10,210
Yes.

66
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:15,000
So these grades that you&#39;ve accumulated over a period of four years, it&#39;s hard to fake that, right?

67
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,600
On the other hand, if you have, say, a final exam—one high-stakes testing is what they

68
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,750
call it—so if you have one exam, one critical exam, like the Graduate Record Examination

69
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:29,250
or your LSATs or MCATs or, you know, all of these different sort of standardized exams,

70
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,900
those really aren&#39;t good predictors because you could be sick that day; you didn&#39;t have

71
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,699
much sleep; you had a bunch of things working against you.

72
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:42,710
This is the idea of what&#39;s called multiple independent error factors. At any given moment

73
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:48,340
you have things working for you and things working against you, so, yes, &quot;I missed my

74
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:53,620
alarm,&quot; &quot;I missed the bus,&quot; &quot;I didn&#39;t eat breakfast,&quot; all of these kind of things that

75
00:06:53,620 --> 00:07:00,620
just happen randomly work against you, and it produces the worst test-taking. Your neighbors

76
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:10,400
were up the night before, and they kept you up, and you just studied all the wrong things, it seems like.

77
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,660
It works in the other way as well. I mean, in some cases everything is going to work

78
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:20,800
for you. So you had just the best sleep. You had the best meal. You studied just the right

79
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,800
things. But, again, in every circumstance, when you take long-term behavior, then it&#39;s

80
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,110
very unlikely that everything is going to work for you or work against you all at once

81
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:39,250
because there are many times for these things to rear their heads, but on a one-trial task

82
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:46,250
like a single test, then, yes, you&#39;re at the whim of all sorts of things, which is why

83
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,800
it&#39;s not a very good predictor of future performance.

84
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,720
What do you think the upshot is then if we don&#39;t have much of an insight into our own

85
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,840
behavior or the behavior of others?

86
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,840
Well, the title of this episode is called &quot;Know Thyself,&quot; and I think that&#39;s fairly apt.

87
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,539
One of the other titles that we&#39;ve covered is the title of Tim Wilson&#39;s book, called

88
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:14,830
&quot;Strangers to Ourselves,&quot; and I think you&#39;re going to see this theme playing out throughout

89
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:21,410
the entire course. We&#39;ll see in the next episode, for example, that we have to resolve this.

90
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:27,630
If we can&#39;t, if we have no insight into our own behavior, into why we do the things that

91
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:34,630
we do—and we saw in the last episode that the way that the world works may not be exactly

92
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:40,020
as it seems, so seeing, hearing, remembering all involve considerable knowledge and so

93
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:47,020
on and we&#39;re being swayed by any sort of factors whatsoever, whether media reports and everything

94
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:54,080
else—that&#39;s a problem. What are we going to do about that? I mean, if we don&#39;t even

95
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:01,080
know when it&#39;s happening, and these things are actually operating, then what? I think

96
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,940
we can get there, but it&#39;s going to take a little bit of work.
