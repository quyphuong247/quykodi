John Vokey and Don Read wanted to find out exactly what people could do with backwards

1
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:14,219
messages, so they did an experiment. They recorded a bunch of voices from different

2
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:19,529
genders, so male and female. They recorded a bunch of voices of people from different

3
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:25,039
countries, so different languages, so French, German, and English. They recorded people

4
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,169
asking questions, and they also recorded people just saying declarations.

5
00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:38,169
The question was: what can people do with these messages when they’re played backwards?

6
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:46,410
So what exactly does a backwards message sound like, and what can people pick up?

7
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,920
They found there are a couple of things that people could do with backwards messages and

8
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,809
a couple of things that they couldn’t do.

9
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:03,070
The things that they could do with backwards messages was tell the difference between gender,

10
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,640
whether it was a male or a female speaker talking. They could also tell the difference

11
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,630
between different languages, so whether somebody was speaking German or English. They could

12
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,909
also—so when there were two males speaking backwards, they could tell the difference

13
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,790
between speaker A and speaker B.

14
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,750
There were also a couple of things that they couldn’t do well. So you might be able to

15
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,890
think—you may think that participants could tell the difference between a question and

16
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,030
a declaration because a question sort of ends with an inflection, but they couldn’t do

17
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,060
that. They also couldn’t tell the difference between a sentence that was with words in

18
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,890
the correct order and a sentence where it was completely scrambled.

19
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,950
But the most important thing they were trying to tap into with this experiment was unconscious

20
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,899
processing. Is there anything that people are able to pick up without their awareness?

21
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:59,899
So they asked people to categorize these backwards sentences as either Christian or Satanic or

22
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:07,950
even pornographic, and they found that people could not correctly classify these things.

23
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,540
One of the sentences played forwards was: “Jesus loves me. This I know,” and people

24
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,889
couldn’t correctly classify it as pornographic or Christian.

25
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:19,340
So what happened with the Judas Priest trial?

26
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,070
Well, I told you it was an awesome story. Now you’ve seen how John Vokey looks, you

27
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,249
should see how it played out in court.
