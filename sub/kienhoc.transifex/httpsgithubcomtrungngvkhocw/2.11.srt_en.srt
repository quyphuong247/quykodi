Welcome to week two, of the science of everyday thinking.

1
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:15,280
Now there is up to 80,000 people who are taking the course, and we asked everybody,

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,080
including you, a few questions about yourselves and about your beliefs.

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,640
So we asked you about witches, and yetis, and UFO&#39;s and all sorts things like that.

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,840
Tens of thousands of response to this one. 50% of people said yes. So 1 in two people

5
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,440
said yes, there is something that science can&#39;t explain.

6
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,680
Question 3. Do you think that there are health practices, herbal medicine, spiritual harmony,

7
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,860
dietary practices, traditional healing, that are not being investigated either because

8
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,200
medicine and the drug companies don&#39;t like them

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,559
or because they don&#39;t fit current scientific theories?

10
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:55,690
It is actually 84% that yes to this one. These are tens of thousands of people,

11
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,770
this is so awesome.

12
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:04,770
We asked our guests in think101x to pick one word to describe what they think about. What

13
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:08,100
single word describes what you think about?

14
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:15,100
Go to that URL and enter a couple of questions for us.

15
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,790
I am going to go crunch the data, right now.

16
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:24,500
Talk among your small groups and see what the difference is between the way you responded

17
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,530
and the way everybody else on the planet would have responded.

18
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:34,530
This is what you wrote. People, life, belief, thinking, family, curious, psychology, science.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,600
And this is what the 75,000 people actually wrote. Future, curiosity, interesting, happiness,

20
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,869
life, thinking, improvement.

21
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:49,579
What you are trying to do is to put yourself in the shoes of someone else who lives across

22
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:54,090
the planet. So someone in Sudan, someone in Bangladesh, someone in India.

23
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,920
One of the main points that we are going to be making in Episode 2 and Episode 3 is that

24
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,659
it is really difficult to know the contents of your own awareness.

25
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:09,829
What we are essentially going to be doing in the first couple of episodes is shattering

26
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:13,950
some myths about the way that you think the mind works, the way that you think the world

27
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:19,590
actually operates. And, one of the ways that we&#39;re going to do this is to start with

28
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,150
this interesting illusion.

29
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,900
On each of these screens, what I am going to be doing is alternating this picture with

30
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,150
another picture and there is one thing in this picture that&#39;s changing. Okay, I want

31
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:37,150
you to spot what it is in the picture that&#39;s changing as I present it.

32
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:45,170
Hands up when you see it, 1, 2, 3 ,4. Morgan, you&#39;ve seen this 100 hundred times man.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,680
The way that people think the mind works. The way that perception, the way that memory

34
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:01,370
works, is very wrong. And so we need, up front in this course, to at least challenge some

35
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,810
of these basic beliefs that you have about the way that perception works, like this,

36
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:11,510
change detection, choice blindness and the way that memory works.

37
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:11,909
And it&#39;s probably not what you think.

38
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:17,959
I can bet you right now that I think completely different to anyone here at this table. Because

39
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:20,290
we can&#39;t expect that the whole world is going to think exactly the same way that we

40
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:20,340
do. It&#39;s just absurd.

41
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,239
Two of the people on our table put science as what they think about most, so, and I put

42
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:29,239
a similar answer. So we are thinking that a lot of people would of put that they think

43
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:37,819
about like how the world works.

44
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:38,959
I think I more was trying to choose a word that described me in a whole.

45
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,430
Science does have a role in that sort of stuff. So, attributing that to science rather than

46
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,860
to the more supernatural could have a big role.

47
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:50,430
Um, I am guessing that the course content is going to challenge that original, your

48
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,650
original beliefs of things. And well at least that&#39;s what I hope.
