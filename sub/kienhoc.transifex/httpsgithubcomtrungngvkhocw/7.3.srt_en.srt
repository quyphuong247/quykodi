In episode three, we touched on multiple independent error factors. Now imagine you&#39;re applying

1
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,110
for a job. You&#39;ve got a job interview. Now on the particular day, there&#39;s going to be

2
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,340
some things working for you and some things working against you. Now imagine if you had

3
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,150
a migraine, or—think about this—an hour or two before your interview, your pet dog

4
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:28,480
died. That&#39;s not good. There are going to be some things working for you. You might

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,559
have had an awesome night&#39;s sleep. The sun is shining. You just feel amazing. These are

6
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,190
the things that are going to have a really large impact on how well you impress that

7
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,010
interview panel and whether you get the job or not.

8
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,550
So, number one: they&#39;re multiple. All of these factors are—there&#39;s lots of them, and they&#39;re

9
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,440
easy to ignore. Statistically, we call this noise.

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,329
Number two: they&#39;re independent. The relationship between your dog dying and the sun shining

11
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:06,329
is probably not linked. Those things are—I&#39;m fairly confident that they are independent.

12
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:11,720
These factors are going to have much more of an impact. They&#39;re going to have a large

13
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,950
impact on how well you perform in that interview.

14
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:21,240
That&#39;s right. It comes down to the fact that on any sort of event, some things are going

15
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:28,240
to work in your favor. It feels—again, imagine, sometimes it feels like that, right? Things

16
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,990
are conspiring against you in the world. It feels like the world is ganging up on you

17
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:39,290
and everything is just going really badly. It&#39;s maybe even the source of depression.

18
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:43,530
On the other hand, some things that just feel—you know, on top of your game, and you have soundtrack

19
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,700
playing in your head; you&#39;re walking around; it&#39;s fantastic. Everything you touch turns to gold.

20
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:56,790
As we&#39;ve just seen in the last episode, these random events are lumpy. Sometimes these things—sometimes

21
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:04,299
there are runs of good things. Sometimes there&#39;s runs of bad things, but they end. I think

22
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:10,189
that idea, the fact that chance is lumpy, the fact that these multiple independent error

23
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:14,780
factors are operating, it&#39;s related to this idea of something called regression to the

24
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:21,780
mean, or Sir Francis Galton called it regression to mediocrity. The observable thing is exactly

25
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:32,099
as we&#39;ve described. In the long run, things tend to balance out. These lumpy things that

26
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:37,110
happen initially tend to smooth out later on. That&#39;s really what we&#39;re talking about

27
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,050
here with regression to the mean.

28
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,910
We see it all the time in sport. You have the star athlete who performs exceptionally

29
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:51,590
well. As Tom Gilovich said, they end up on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; or the &quot;Madden

30
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:58,520
NFL&quot; game—the front of the videogame cover. There are all sorts of superstitions, jinxes,

31
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:05,069
that surround these phenomena, so that star athlete doesn&#39;t perform as well after being

32
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:10,810
featured on the cover. Now that has nothing to do with any sort of superstition or magical

33
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,080
belief. It just has everything to do with this idea of regression to the mean. That

34
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,920
lump smoothed out in the long run and their behavior kind of tapered off.

35
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,220
I think it&#39;s important that we make this idea, regression to the mean, a bit more concrete.

36
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:33,220
Let&#39;s take an example. Imagine that we have a class, a classroom, people sitting at their

37
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:37,409
desks, 100 students. They&#39;re all sitting at their desks, and we&#39;re going to give them

38
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:44,409
an exam. The exam has 100 questions on it, all true and false, so each question on the

39
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:51,629
exam is either true or it&#39;s false. Now all 100 people who are sitting in that classroom,

40
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:59,620
not a single one of them speak a word of English. They&#39;re completely, completely novices when

41
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:05,200
it comes to speaking the English language, and so they don&#39;t understand a single question

42
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:12,800
on that entire exam. They&#39;re just reading this gibberish, and then marking either true or false as a response.

43
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:19,479
Now, as a result—so we have 100 people, 100 questions. As a result of taking that

44
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:24,129
test, you&#39;re going to have some people who took that test. Most people are going to get

45
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:29,289
about 50 percent on average, but some people are going to perform better than 50 percent.

46
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:34,430
In fact, with a group of about 100 people, I would imagine you&#39;d have 2 or even 3 people

47
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:41,150
who score 60 percent or even higher, say 65 percent. Say we have this top performer, Billy,

48
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:48,150
in this test. Took the exam, doesn&#39;t understand a word of it, but he scored 65 percent just

49
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:54,659
by chance, just completely randomly. We have another student—say, Jane. She scored, on

50
00:04:54,659 --> 00:05:00,069
the other hand, 35 percent correct. We put Billy over here, the top performer; Jane over

51
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:05,439
here, she&#39;s the bottom performer. Now what we want people to do is imagine what happens

52
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:11,499
on day two. Day two, we perform exactly the same test, a different test, different questions,

53
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:14,409
though it doesn&#39;t really matter—they&#39;re guessing anyway. But we sit them down at their

54
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:20,809
desk to take another exam and ask them to mark true or false. What&#39;s going to happen

55
00:05:20,809 --> 00:05:25,999
on day two? How would you expect Billy to perform on day two, and how would you expect

56
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:32,400
Jane to perform on day two? We&#39;ll ask the students to go ahead and make their predictions before we move on.
