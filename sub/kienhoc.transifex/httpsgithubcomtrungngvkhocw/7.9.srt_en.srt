The title of the last episode was &quot;The Experiment&quot;. Now, in the experiment we talked about, we

1
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:27,800
had this wine tasting, we designed a double-blind experiment, and we talked generally about randomness.

2
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:33,360
We&#39;re going to start of today, kind of gauge your understanding of what we mean by &quot;chance&quot;.

3
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,120
Let&#39;s discuss that as small groups.

4
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:42,300
Tutors sometimes use chance and probability like interchangeably, but I think that&#39;s probably not really accurate.

5
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:50,400
Yeah, I guess chance is just kind-of stuff happening, and probability is trying to measure how likely it is that stuff happens.

6
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,300
Chance looks like something when it isn&#39;t.

7
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,409
Whether you&#39;re actually detecting something in the sky or something, you&#39;re comparing

8
00:00:56,409 --> 00:01:00,580
it to nothing at all; you&#39;re comparing it to the absence of structure.

9
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:05,890
Doesn&#39;t the whole Schrödinger&#39;s cat experiment kind of violate that?

10
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:11,010
Well even a coin flip. I mean, if you had a really good physicist and a lot of time,

11
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,979
and you flipped that coin; you could count, you could compute, you could write an equation,

12
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:22,200
specifically for what that coin is going to come out. Whether it&#39;s going to be heads or tails.

13
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:29,700
I don&#39;t know how she does it, she just goes: &quot;That machine, play that machine and play this amount,&quot; and it will win!

14
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,280
Maybe the universe is randomness and chaos, and we&#39;re just seeing patterns.

15
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,140
Chance and randomness are just words we use to describe things when all the external factors

16
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,800
aren&#39;t immediately quantifiable.

17
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,540
What causes superstitious belief?

18
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:53,700
How do we go from, &#39;a black cat crossed my path this morning&#39; to &#39;I broke both my legs on the train later today&#39;.

19
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:59,380
You say you have no superstitions? Yes.

20
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,800
My example was, people might fall down the stairs and break their legs, and they don&#39;t

21
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,040
want to say, &quot;it&#39;s because I was careless&quot; or &quot;because I&#39;m uncoordinated,&quot; They want

22
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,629
to blame it on the fact they opened an umbrella inside like on the way to work, or something.

23
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:17,780
You believe in things because it&#39;s a cultural thing, it&#39;s been passed down from your family,

24
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:23,110
and it just becomes part of something you can draw on. You remember those instances

25
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:31,200
more than perhaps other things. So next time you see a black cat all these examples might come rushing to your mind.

26
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:38,269
A common aspect is the pattern recognition system. I think Gilovich talked about how

27
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,670
we have this cognitive machinery to see patterns in everyday life—which is really useful—but

28
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:53,300
it&#39;s fallible in a sense, like it makes mistakes. That can sort-of cause the creation of superstitious beliefs.
