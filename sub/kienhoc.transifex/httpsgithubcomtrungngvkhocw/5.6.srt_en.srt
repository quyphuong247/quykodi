I think in the early &#39;90s, you coined the term &quot;desirable difficulties.&quot; Now these

1
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,850
are obviously not the sort of things that would occur to the students who would immediately

2
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,300
think of them when studying for an exam or something. Could you just explain desirable difficulties?

3
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:27,210
Well, the notion of desirable difficulties is that it refers to a set of manipulations

4
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,870
that all have the property that they create challenges, a sense of difficulty, during

5
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,860
the acquisition process. That&#39;s the sense in which they are difficulties. They&#39;re

6
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:46,860
desirable in the sense that they enhance long-term retention and transfer. So therein the conditions

7
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:54,969
of learning or practice examples, rather than keeping them constant and predictable, reducing

8
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:02,170
using tests rather than presentations as learning, interleaving the separate things to be learned

9
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:09,170
rather than blocking practice on each at a time—there&#39;s a whole set of these that

10
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:16,610
create this misimpression. Actually, I&#39;ve just given you the desirable difficulties.

11
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:23,890
They create the sense of difficulty but then are associated with better long-term retention.

12
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:31,369
Really, another way to put all this is a very old distinction going back to the 1930s between

13
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:41,570
performance and learning. Performance would be like how accurate you are, how rapidly

14
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:48,700
you can do something during the acquisition process. Learning is those changes, and relatively

15
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,880
permanent changes, that will support your being able to recall and use this information later.

16
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,520
That&#39;s what we would like to optimize.

17
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:05,520
But what happens is we can confuse performance during the process as evidence of learning.

18
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:13,530
Many things that make performance go up very rapidly—massed practice, continuous feedback,

19
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:20,400
keeping conditions constant and predictable—make performance go up really rapidly and then

20
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,790
are associated with very poor long-term learning.

21
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:29,230
The other thing that&#39;s made these results so important is various things where you ask

22
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:34,439
people, &quot;What helped you learn better: this condition or that condition,&quot; or, &quot;Predict

23
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:40,120
how well you&#39;ll do on a test that comes in a week.&quot; It shows that people are really

24
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:46,180
fooled by their current performance. It&#39;s not only an unreliable indicator of whether

25
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:51,189
learnings happen. It&#39;s sometimes exactly the opposite of that.

26
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:58,189
We&#39;re really at risk of misinterpreting whether we&#39;ve acquired the skills and knowledge

27
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:05,569
that we are intending to acquire. On one hand, it&#39;s never been more important to know how

28
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:15,379
to learn because more learnings happen outside of formal supervision: we&#39;re on our own;

29
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:20,809
we&#39;re at a computer; we&#39;re doing this; we want to learn some new tech feat for job

30
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:27,809
purposes or whatever, across a whole lifetime. We need to know how to learn, but it&#39;s not

31
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:35,669
easy. Our intuitions mislead us. A lot of the standard practices that we&#39;ve been exposed

32
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:41,129
to in schooling are not optimal. We would just—natural for us to think, &quot;Well, if

33
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:47,370
our teachers did that, that&#39;s the way we should do it,&quot; and that&#39;s often wrong.

34
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:54,370
It&#39;s really a critical kind of juncture of: can people learn how to manage their—be

35
00:03:55,999 --> 00:04:02,800
effective stewards of their own learning? And that&#39;s the ultimate sort of survival skill.

36
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:05,919
My name is Bob. I think about learning.
