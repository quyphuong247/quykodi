Are there wine experts? Are there people who claim to be better at tasting and appreciating

1
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,959
wine than, say, you and me?

2
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:21,410
Well, there are certainly experts out there in terms of the level of training that they

3
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,900
might have or being a sommelier. Certainly here at Brock University, we have our Cool

4
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:32,369
Climate Oenology and Viticulture Institute. A lot of our students who are in that program

5
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:39,219
know quite a lot about wine, and when we have them come in as part of our participant pool,

6
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:46,219
sometimes those students come and participate, and it&#39;s very easy to say, &quot;Well, I&#39;m and

7
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:52,840
expert.&quot; In our research, what we rely on is a wine knowledge questionnaire. We usually

8
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:59,840
give this questionnaire to our participants to see an objective—well, it is an objective

9
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:08,080
way of seeing how much knowledge somebody really has.

10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,640
But wine tasters, like these expert wine tasters who evaluate wines and give them scores out

11
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:20,640
of 100 that are used to put the medallions on the wine and things like that, are they

12
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:27,840
better at identifying and talking about wines than I am?

13
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:36,729
That&#39;s an interesting question. I know there are some studies that show that experts really

14
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:43,090
aren&#39;t experts, and there are some studies that show that they really are experts. I

15
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:50,090
think, at the end of the day, the scores that are given for consumers again is used as a

16
00:01:53,140 --> 00:02:00,140
useful piece of information for the consumers, and the judges or the wine raters, as you

17
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,880
call them—they are probably more knowledgeable than the average consumer. So I think that

18
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:17,190
there is—because they do have training and they do have more expertise than the average

19
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:24,190
consumer, so I would say that there is a basis for that.

20
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:31,580
Having said that, I think that it might also depend on the definition of expertise. I have

21
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:40,819
two black wine glasses here, and most people can&#39;t tell if there&#39;s—you know, when you

22
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,340
lose those visual cues of the actual color, if you&#39;re to sample these wines, most people

23
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:55,879
can&#39;t tell if the glass contains a red or white. Now I haven&#39;t done an experiment like

24
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:02,879
this with a trained sommelier, but I&#39;d like to one day. It&#39;s that kind of thing where,

25
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:12,330
well, you know, can a sommelier tell the difference? They probably can, but somebody like you,

26
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:12,790
I&#39;m not sure.

27
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,560
I&#39;m a bit scared.

28
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,720
I don&#39;t know if I can.

29
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,720
We want to get our friends to run an experiment, where they find out whether novices undergraduate

30
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,120
students can tell the difference between wines on a whole bunch of levels. Can they tell

31
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,040
the difference between red and white? Can they tell the difference between the grapes?

32
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,470
Can they tell an expensive bottle from an inexpensive bottle? Without going into detail,

33
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,989
can you run through some of the things that they should really consider when they are

34
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:48,300
designing a well-controlled experiment to find a reasonably good answer to some of these questions?

35
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:55,330
Well, one way to—in terms of looking at price, having this wine in a brown paper bag

36
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:05,379
so we don&#39;t get any other cues of where the wine is from and what vintage it might be

37
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:12,049
and so on, or if there might even be a price label on it—we want to hide all that. We

38
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:18,120
can pour from the brown paper bag into glasses so that, again, we&#39;re trying to—if price

39
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,500
is a variable you&#39;re looking at examining, try to minimize any other influence that might

40
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:31,180
affect the consumer&#39;s judgment. If you can get a hold of these black glasses again, we&#39;re

41
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:37,560
trying to take away any other visual information maybe that the respondent, based on their

42
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:44,560
own personal experience or something else that they might think, that if it&#39;s a darker

43
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:51,710
color red, that it might be more expensive, whatever, maybe. If you want to kind of eliminate

44
00:04:52,010 --> 00:05:01,500
those other cues that they might use into their judgment, try to isolate whatever variable it is to examine.

45
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:08,550
If we did this properly using the experimental method, we would probably take a sample of

46
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:17,790
sommeliers, a sample of maybe high-knowledge consumers, sample of low-knowledge consumers,

47
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:24,790
and see after various trials. We might not just do one trial. We might do several trials

48
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:30,320
and with several different types of grape varietals, so not just pinot noir versus Gewürztraminer

49
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:37,320
but maybe also, you know, like you said, like a Malbec or Shiraz versus oaked Chardonnay

50
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:43,990
or something else, so that over, consistently over many trials and across different grape

51
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:50,990
varietals with a representative sample for each category of consumer, is there a statistically

52
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,400
significant difference that would not be due to chance? If you guessed correctly by chance,

53
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,490
which is what you said earlier, &quot;Well, you know, how do we know that I didn&#39;t just guess

54
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:10,490
the correct one,&quot; then it would be 50-50 that people said this was red and this was red.

55
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:17,400
It would be 50-50, right? So what we&#39;re looking for—let&#39;s say, you&#39;re in the group of...

56
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:17,830
Low...

57
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,330
You would say low?

58
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,080
Yes, yes.

59
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,410
Okay, well, fair enough. If we were looking at the group of low-knowledge consumers, we

60
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:32,410
might see: is the rate at which they are saying red 50-50, or is it higher than 50-50?

61
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:35,830
Okay.

62
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:41,330
So is it higher than chance? You use a statistical technique called chi-square, which I won&#39;t

63
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:48,330
get into, to determine whether that probability or that rate of responding red for this one

64
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:58,130
is higher than 50-50. Now we&#39;ll do that also for the high-knowledge consumers. Are they

65
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:06,790
saying red for this one or Red for this one 50 percent of the time, or is it higher that

66
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:12,630
they are saying red for the actual red one? We will do the same thing for the sommelier

67
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:18,330
group. That would be a proper test to answer this question.
