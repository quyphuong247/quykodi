We&#39;ve heard a lot of extraordinary claims from a lot of people at this festival, and

1
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,820
they&#39;re fairly common. We&#39;ve chatted with a bunch of our students about some of the

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:19,900
extraordinary claims they&#39;ve experienced, and I&#39;m sure people at home have had some similar experiences.

3
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:25,000
One of the ones that I remember: it was a student who said that she was walking through

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,619
a shopping mall, and it just so happened that this was the anniversary of her grandmother&#39;s

5
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,140
death. While she&#39;s walking through the shopping mall, over the loud speakers, there&#39;s music

6
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:41,300
playing, but midway through a song, it cuts out and it shifts to her grandmother&#39;s favourite song.

7
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,659
Another common one is premonition, so dreaming about something and then it coming true, and

8
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:50,370
this isn&#39;t innocuous stuff like dreaming about an apple and then seeing an apple the next

9
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,269
day. These are really specific things that they&#39;re remembering: dreaming about a crow

10
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:59,710
jumping from tree to tree and then seeing it the next week, or dreaming about an old

11
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,760
friend and having them appear on your doorstep the next day.

12
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,760
That&#39;s right. This is our job here. It&#39;s to figure out why people believe weird things.

13
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:15,170
It&#39;s not enough just to say, as we said before, that people like to believe in weird things

14
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:19,500
or they take comfort in the paranormal. That doesn&#39;t really explain anything.

15
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,280
Instead what we&#39;re trying to do is to focus on the cognitive mechanisms, to focus on explanations

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,740
in terms of perception, attention, memory. One of these that things we&#39;re going to be

17
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,399
dealing with is ambiguity, which is really important. We&#39;ve touched on it a few times

18
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:41,100
in the course. Last episode we talked about the Necker cube, the spinning dancer, and

19
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,229
a bunch of different things, bistable illusions.

20
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:50,289
This is a really nice example. The figure here, the letter B or the number 13 is ambiguous.

21
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:56,259
In the context of A and C it looks like a B. In the context of 12 and 14, it looks like

22
00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:02,079
a 13. Again, this is two different ways that you can interpret this event.

23
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:09,079
Another example is by Tom Gilovich. He provides a smiling person. Now the smiling person can

24
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:16,100
either be interpreted as being friendly. It&#39;s a genuine smile, if you like the person.

25
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:22,200
If you don&#39;t like the person, you might interpret it as a smirk, as being malicious somehow,

26
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,569
or they&#39;re up to something. But it&#39;s exactly the same smile being interpreted in two different

27
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:28,810
ways, which is a little bit more realistic.

28
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,680
Yes, so that&#39;s ambiguous information. I think there&#39;s a second factor going on, called multifaceted

29
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,980
expectations. Yes, with the A, B, C and the 12, 13, 14, there are really only two ways

30
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,860
of seeing it. Just like the spinning ballerina: it spins left or it spins right. The Necker

31
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,239
cubes pops out or comes back in. They&#39;re two dimensions. They&#39;re two ways of seeing it.

32
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,799
But much of the objects that we deal with and the events that happen in our everyday

33
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:59,620
lives are not two-dimensional. They&#39;re not even three-dimensional. They&#39;re multidimensional.

34
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,629
They&#39;re multifaceted.

35
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:05,659
In one episode, we talked about talent, and there are several different ways that can

36
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:10,689
be viewed. We talked about some things as innocuous as a job interview and how many

37
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:17,069
different ways that can be viewed. Dealing with that complexity and ambiguity, there

38
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:24,060
are so many ways that these things can be viewed. That&#39;s when our pattern recognizers

39
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,060
really kick in. We really see what we expect to see when we have multi-dimensions.

40
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,090
That&#39;s right. And the two can operate together. You can have ambiguity and these multifaceted

41
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,450
expectations working in conjunction.

42
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,780
One really nice example of this was when we visited the horoscope booth at the MindBodySpirit

43
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:48,780
Festival. Now they prepared these personalized portraits that, on the basis of where the

44
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,989
planets are and how they&#39;re interacting in the sky—and these portraits that they create

45
00:03:53,989 --> 00:04:00,989
are anything but personalized. They&#39;re extremely multifaceted and extremely ambiguous. One

46
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:06,590
of the examples that they provide was from the sign of Venus. Now it says, &quot;A beautiful

47
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,569
mind and a mind for beauty.&quot;

48
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:14,040
There is somebody who has a beautiful mind and a mind for beauty. You can read here,

49
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,700
when it comes—I can&#39;t even see it—when it comes to personal relationships, you tend

50
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,639
to be rather idealistic. You seek a lover who is both intelligent and good-looking.

51
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,180
That&#39;s because it&#39;s in Libra, in the Fourth House. You&#39;re also going to have—it has

52
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,789
something to do with your home. Your home is also going to be that way as well. So Venus

53
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:37,789
is very important in this persons&#39; home life. Their house has to be beautiful. Whereas if

54
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:45,880
it was in the First House, they themselves would be quite beautiful—they would be very

55
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,150
focused on their own appearance. Whereas here, this person here, because of the position

56
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:55,970
in the sky, their home is where they focus their sense of beauty on or their sense style.

57
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:02,200
And because it&#39;s in Libra, they probably have a very good sense of style because that&#39;s a Libran thing.

58
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,770
Now these portraits that they&#39;ve put together are really anything but personalized. They

59
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:11,770
would really apply to anybody. I mean, what do you mean by idealistic, or good-looking,

60
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:17,310
or charming? These are very general statements. As Richard Wiseman said, these are called

61
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,740
Barnum statements, or the Barnum effect is the fact that there&#39;s something for everybody,

62
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,360
that there&#39;s an enormous amount of overlap between your own characteristics and these

63
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,500
sort of statements, and anybody who&#39;s reading them would be able to find something of themselves

64
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,380
in them. They&#39;re often very flattering as well to say that you have untapped potential

65
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:41,060
or that you&#39;re an independent thinker. Who doesn&#39;t want to think that about themselves?

66
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,440
Yes. Another factor that&#39;s operating, I think, is multiple endpoints. Now we need to think

67
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,259
about this when we&#39;re trying to assess the validity of these claims. The analogy is casting

68
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:56,300
a wide net, catching a big fish in that wide net, and then claiming that you caught it with a spear.

69
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:01,060
This is very common in psychic prediction. A psychic may say something like, &quot;I see an

70
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:06,229
older gentleman in your family is having heart problems. I see some pain around the chest,

71
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:11,970
and there&#39;s a weight there.&quot; Now what can that mean? Again, it&#39;s multi-faceted. What&#39;s

72
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:17,440
the older gentleman? It could be my older brother, my father, my grandfather. It can

73
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,330
happen across that dimension, and it can also happen in time. What kind of heart problem

74
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:28,810
are we talking about? A death? Is it a diagnosis? Is it a prediction that&#39;s going to happen?

75
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:35,810
What is a heart problem? Does angina count? Does forgetting your heart medication on that

76
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:43,599
particular day coming back from the doctor with a diagnosis of high blood pressure—does that count?

77
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:49,280
Let&#39;s not forget about just the base rates—that is, just the probability of you having anyone

78
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,009
in your entire family with any sort of heart issue whatsoever is really likely. I mean,

79
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:58,789
just thinking of my own family, I could think about a dozen people in my family or extended

80
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:03,569
family that might count as part of that, right?

81
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:09,800
I think one of my favorite examples of this was in your conversation with the chiropractor

82
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:16,800
at the Mind Body Festival. In that conversation, he rattled off at least a dozen possible symptoms

83
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:21,860
that you might have as an indication that you might need some chiropractic treatment.

84
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:27,300
As your spine comes up, all of you tends to lean in that direction. Now if your spine

85
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,069
was lovely and straight, your head would be sitting over here. Obviously it&#39;s not. So

86
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:35,500
it would suggest that your spine comes up as a little bit of an S-shape and might trigger

87
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,440
another weak area here. It can present itself as either neck pain, shoulder pain, or headaches.

88
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,639
And of course the nerves in that part of the spine deal with cardiovascular function, so

89
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,009
low energy, trouble sleeping, snoring, shortness of breath, hay fever, asthma, allergies, blood

90
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:53,940
pressure issues, chest pains, angina, functional heart problems, dead. Those sorts of things

91
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,830
may be symptoms.

92
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:59,710
Got you. None of those. Not sure about death. Hopefully not that.

93
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,090
Yes. But just because they&#39;re weak areas doesn&#39;t always mean they present as symptoms.

94
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:09,259
Now he just rattled off a whole bunch of different symptoms, everything from trouble sleeping

95
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:14,379
to lower back pain to death, but I think most people, when listening to this set of symptoms

96
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:19,680
who are considering the possibility of chiropractic treatment, would be able to find something

97
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,080
in their own experience to cling on to. He cast a really wide net, and so I suspect that

98
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,379
he&#39;d catch somebody within that net if it&#39;s cast wide enough.

99
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:37,110
I think if you combine these multiple endpoints with ambiguous statements, like we talked

100
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:44,200
about before, then that&#39;s nicely captured in the Japanese healing booth that we visited as well.

101
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:51,280
Now they made some really ambiguous statements about the effects of their treatment—for

102
00:08:53,250 --> 00:09:00,250
example, improved well-being or increased happiness or strengthening the immune system.

103
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:07,580
What do these even look like if you were to test whether somebody&#39;s well-being was improved?

104
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,070
What would that actually look like? It&#39;s a really broad characterization.

105
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:16,780
Yes, and think about another dimension that&#39;s operating in time. We&#39;ve got multiple windows

106
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:22,740
of time that are happening here, so if a prediction is made, when do you stop looking for hits?

107
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:29,740
If a healer says they&#39;ve healed you or they&#39;ve treated you, when should you stop looking?

108
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:34,640
When should you expect to feel better? When should you stop looking to feel better and

109
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,590
say, &quot;Well, that healing mustn&#39;t have worked&quot;?

110
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:43,260
Tom Gilovich has spoken about this previously. It&#39;s a common belief that things happen in

111
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:49,950
threes. Homicides, natural disasters, these things occur in triplets. But when do you

112
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,060
stop counting it as a triplet?

113
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,930
When you get to three.

114
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:59,620
Yes, exactly. So if you allow for enough variability in these windows of time, these predictions

115
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,790
can only be confirmed. It&#39;s very difficult to disconfirm it.

116
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:09,100
That&#39;s right. A nice example of this is quite a personal one, actually. I was talking to

117
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,960
my mom on the phone in preparing for this course and preparing for this segment in particular.

118
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:19,260
I&#39;m telling her about going to the MindBodySpirit exhibition and so on, and talking to tarot

119
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,920
card readers. She said, &quot;I went to a tarot card reader once about 30 years ago, I guess.

120
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Thirty years.&quot; Yes, I was about nine or ten years old. She went to this tarot card reader,

121
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,950
and it kind of freaked her out actually a little bit because the reader said that she

122
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:43,860
would be in a large fire. She&#39;d be okay, but the rest of her family might not be. So from

123
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:50,860
that point on, she actually lost sleep in thinking about this, in dwelling on what she

124
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:58,020
said during the reading. If you fast forward, she still remembers that reading 30 years

125
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:04,870
later. So you can imagine if there was a fire a decade later or something, she would probably

126
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,790
be very likely to attribute it as a success on behalf of that particular reader.

127
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:14,190
Yes, or if it was just a fire down the street or your next-door neighbor or a brush fire—all

128
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,750
of these things would probably count.

129
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:21,480
Exactly. There&#39;s enough variability in what counts as a fire, in the time that it takes.

130
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,890
It could be 30 years on, and you can still count it as a hit on that part.

131
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:32,400
So that really freaked her out. When she had this reading and there was the possibility

132
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:38,250
that her family was going to burn in the fire, that&#39;s kind of scary. When you&#39;re thinking

133
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:44,250
about whether to count the prediction as a success or not, there&#39;s a whole bunch of things

134
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:50,330
that can vary in terms of the nature of the fire. We actually, a few years later, had

135
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:56,470
our Christmas tree burned down due to my remote-controlled car. Does that count? Is that a fire? It could

136
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:02,470
be a brush fire. It could be a fire at our neighbor&#39;s place. That&#39;s close enough. Or

137
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:08,940
when? It&#39;s 30 years later, and she still thinks about that particular reading. And if there

138
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,960
was something 30 years on, she still might be able to make that link.

139
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:20,600
So I think these things, variable windows in time, multiple endpoints, I think are really important.

140
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:25,780
We&#39;ve gone through a few of these general mechanisms that are operating in paranormal

141
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,820
phenomena or in predictions such as these. We&#39;ve got a couple more to get through, but

142
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:35,000
let&#39;s ask people a few questions before we move on to make sure they really grasp what&#39;s going on here.
