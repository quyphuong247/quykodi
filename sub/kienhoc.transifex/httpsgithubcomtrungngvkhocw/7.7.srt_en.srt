One of the things that you guys do extremely well, that I can&#39;t say so much for my scientific

1
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:16,950
colleagues, is admit when you&#39;re wrong and recognize that we make mistakes.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,279
Does that happen often? Have you guys made many errors?

3
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:26,919
Actually, that&#39;s probably the most important question to ask here. The thing is, we love

4
00:00:26,919 --> 00:00:33,870
it when we&#39;re wrong. It&#39;s like the best possible thing that can happen to us—is to be wrong.

5
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,110
The simple reason is that that&#39;s an opportunity for us to learn something. If we weren&#39;t wrong,

6
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:45,160
then we&#39;re just wasting our time. We didn&#39;t learn anything. When there&#39;s a failure or

7
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:51,750
if we&#39;ve taken a particular course that has led us down a path that&#39;s been unproductive,

8
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,470
we have to stop and ask, &quot;Well, why? What was it that I was doing wrong?&quot; That&#39;s when

9
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:03,880
the light bulb goes off, and that&#39;s when you&#39;re on your road to do some new adventure or discovery.

10
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:09,899
Without being wrong, you&#39;re just going through the motions.

11
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:15,549
When you construct an experiment and you believe your methodology is as robust as you could

12
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:20,479
have possibly made it, then you come to an answer that is the opposite of what you expected

13
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,219
to happen, and you run and check your numbers and you realize that it is genuinely the opposite

14
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:30,740
of what you expected, it&#39;s thrilling. It&#39;s absolutely thrilling.

15
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:36,310
Someone said, &quot;Do you mind busting things?&quot; We&#39;re totally agnostic when it comes to whether

16
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:41,789
it&#39;s busted, plausible, or confirmed. We don&#39;t really care. But what we genuinely do love

17
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:46,759
is learning something. Yes, like Jamie said, it&#39;s learning something new.

18
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:53,759
Science is messy. The two most important science teachers I had in all my schooling—both

19
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:59,549
were willing, when I asked a question, to say, &quot;Actually, that&#39;s something I don&#39;t know.&quot;

20
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,319
These are people in authority, and teachers generally don&#39;t like to say they don&#39;t know something.

21
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:08,300
These were teachers who were willing to say that, and that showed me that there

22
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:17,700
was a space to be—there was a space that I could perhaps both learn and potentially contribute. That&#39;s totally vital.

23
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:24,700
Have you been surprised before in one of your—really surprised? I mean, you&#39;ve absolutely lined things up and...

24
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:30,549
I have a great example of when we were genuinely shocked. We did a story a bunch of years ago

25
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:35,209
called &quot;Killer Cable Snap.&quot; Now there&#39;s not a fisherman in the world who doesn&#39;t believe

26
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:39,599
that if a braided steel cable on a boat gets stretched to its breaking strength, that when

27
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,459
it breaks, it can whip around and slice right through you. Now I&#39;m eliminating aircraft

28
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:48,409
carrier cables because those are about this big around, and that&#39;s more like getting hit

29
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:54,980
by a building. That&#39;s not a &quot;whipping cable.&quot; But there&#39;s thousands of anecdotal reports,

30
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,799
legs severed—and I&#39;m also eliminating things like a boat rope pulling you against the dock

31
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:03,849
because of the storm and slicing your legs off. That&#39;s totally happened. We&#39;re talking

32
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:07,360
a whipping cable having enough energy to slice through you.

33
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,610
So we built a methodology where we figured out how to cut a cable stretched to its strength

34
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,090
around a bollard so that it whipped around at this incredibly high speed. We then got

35
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,829
several grades of cable and a hydraulic cutter. We got a hydraulic puller that would stretch

36
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:28,810
the cable to within 85 percent of its breaking strength, and then we&#39;d slice it. Right at

37
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:35,329
the apex of the cable&#39;s whip, we placed pigs, real pigs. We really thought we were going

38
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:38,530
to cut these beautiful high-speed shots of the cable slicing right through.

39
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,090
Pigs didn&#39;t like it much.

40
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:46,939
They were already dead. Come lunchtime, we tested three different cables, and we&#39;d only

41
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:53,939
been denting pigs. We hadn&#39;t even broken skin. We called up our producer on that, Linda,

42
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:59,010
and we said—she&#39;d been researching this for months—we said, &quot;In all of the research,

43
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,640
do you have a single first-hand visual account of this happening?&quot; She said, &quot;I&#39;m sure I

44
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,700
do. I&#39;m sure I do,&quot; and she went and she called back an hour later and said, &quot;I don&#39;t.&quot;

45
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,499
We realized we&#39;re going to have to bust this because the evidence does not support that

46
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:17,850
this has ever happened. There are plenty of other ways to get sliced in half by ropes

47
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:22,770
and cables on a boat, but whipping is not one of them, and we totally busted it, and

48
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,530
we began the day totally believing we were going to totally confirm it.

49
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:34,500
Those kinds of things happen all the time. The longer we do this, the less cocky we get about our...

50
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,870
Yes, totally.

51
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,949
There can be some really stupid simple question about something that, &quot;Of course that&#39;s going

52
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:44,560
to happen,&quot; and then, &quot;Darn, I didn&#39;t think that wouldn&#39;t happen.&quot;

53
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,710
In fact, given the vagaries of making a television show, there are times that we have to shoot

54
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:56,050
out of order because we lose a location or we have some sort of snafu or something occurs.

55
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,889
It&#39;s happened. We are good at doing what we call backfilling: go in and shoot what we

56
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:05,870
need, and then we&#39;ll backfill it later when we find out what the actual results are.

57
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,139
But, occasionally, we have placed ourselves in a position of shooting out of order, going,

58
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:13,620
&quot;That&#39;s okay. We can shoot out of order because we know what the results of that experiment

59
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,860
are going to be.&quot; We don&#39;t do that anymore because every single time we&#39;ve done it, every

60
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,090
single time we&#39;ve put our eggs in the basket of well-we-know-how-that&#39;s-going-to-turn-out,

61
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:28,280
we&#39;ve been boned. We stopped ever expecting, even when we&#39;ve seen people do it and we&#39;ve

62
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,400
had experts tell us, &quot;This is what&#39;s going to happen,&quot; we don&#39;t count on it until we&#39;ve seen it.

63
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:39,460
How about your viewers? Have they been fairly reluctant often to change their opinion if

64
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:44,620
you do bust or confirm a myth that they hold dear?

65
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,550
Absolutely. The best known one was a plane on a conveyor belt, and the idea was that

66
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:56,470
if a conveyor belt is going in one direction fast enough, a plane that&#39;s sitting on it

67
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:02,639
can&#39;t go fast enough in the other direction and take off. That&#39;s just...

68
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,740
The question itself has a trick within it which leads you to believe that the plane

69
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,910
will somehow remain stationary. The fact is the plane will never remain stationary. The

70
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:16,340
plane will always push forward no matter how fast the conveyor belt&#39;s moving. We demonstrated

71
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:21,910
this on the show—to much of Jamie&#39;s chagrin because he was like, &quot;Why are we even testing?

72
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:25,940
It&#39;s stupid. It&#39;s totally obvious what would happen.&quot; We tested it on the show, and, I

73
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:32,000
mean, back then Jamie&#39;s shop number was—you could find it online if you looked hard enough.

74
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,430
When that show aired people were calling his number all night long and screaming at him

75
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,720
that we had somehow cheated the data and we were lying, and it was all because we&#39;d come

76
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,590
to a different result than they expected. They were open about saying that, &quot;Well, they&#39;re

77
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,660
wrong.&quot; Well, why? &quot;Because they came to a result I didn&#39;t expect.&quot;

78
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:52,849
Yeah, I think that was one of the first times that I really—it put it front and center—this

79
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:59,849
whole thing about belief—that is, people—they just want to believe stuff. If you can present

80
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:09,009
evidence that denies it, it doesn&#39;t seem to affect people. I mean, there&#39;s a lot of things

81
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,460
to do with religion that line up with that.

82
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,879
Global-warming, politics, etcetera.

83
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:23,879
Personally, I, on the other hand, I ask myself, &quot;Is there anything that I actually simply

84
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:32,110
believe in?&quot; Belief sort of implies believing things or an understanding that does not require

85
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:43,729
proof or evidence. You simply accept it. And I can&#39;t think of anything that, personally,

86
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,610
I simply accept. I&#39;ll accept it until...

87
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,759
Until the evidence to the contrary.

88
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:56,319
Yes, that&#39;s pretty much all there is to it. It amazes me that in this day and age that

89
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:02,879
a lot of people, if not the majority of people in the world, aren&#39;t that way.

90
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,960
Yes. I mean look, the fact is—and the argument will get put out all the time on the line

91
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:14,379
in other debate forums that, well, science is a religion. Science is a religion that

92
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:18,960
is based just as much on faith in science, as religion is based on faith in a supreme

93
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:25,849
power, except that, as Tim Minchin says, &quot;No, that&#39;s total BS,&quot; because science adjusts

94
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:30,830
its views based on evidence. It actually will change its understanding of things, and this

95
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:36,000
has happened multiple times throughout the history of science. It&#39;s still happening today

96
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,089
with major experiments, changed whole fields overnight, when the data gets confirmed. And

97
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:47,459
that&#39;s as it should be. Like we said, it&#39;s a messy process, and people would benefit

98
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:53,300
from understanding that it&#39;s a messy process, that it&#39;s one that we could all contribute to.

99
00:08:53,320 --> 00:09:00,320
Well, we get referred to in a lot of cases as scientists, and the fact is that neither

100
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:08,149
of us have science educations per se, like a formal university-type science education

101
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:14,430
or degree or background. But I think one of the strongest things that would actually say

102
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:20,490
that we are scientists would be that both Adam and I have sort of a pact that if there

103
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:26,180
is evidence to the contrary—like, in particular, when we&#39;re arguing amongst each other over

104
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:31,430
some particular thing that we&#39;re trying to problem solve, as to how we problem solve

105
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:37,589
it or what the results are—the minute that there&#39;s clear evidence to the contrary, even

106
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:43,250
though this may have been an idea that one of us has been championing just to the death

107
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,550
that this is the way to do it, the minute that there&#39;s anything that pops up on the

108
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:54,550
radar that changes that, it&#39;s point of pride for us to do immediate, without hesitation,

109
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:04,680
back flip and agree with the other person or go off in a new direction. I would like

110
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,350
to think that&#39;s fundamental to science.

111
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,940
Ideally.

112
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:18,750
It&#39;s also fundamental to us wanting to understand, really understand, the world and our place

113
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:25,750
in it and the things that we run across. There again, it plays towards science isn&#39;t just

114
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:35,300
for scientists. It&#39;s for anybody with integrity that really honestly wants to understand their world.

115
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:39,860
Yes. When you&#39;re on the veldt and you&#39;re trying to kill an animal and you learn that one

116
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:45,529
kind of sharpened stick works better at killing them than another, that&#39;s a scientific experiment.

117
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:51,320
Humans, by their nature, are scientists. We are explorers; we are tinkerers and thinkers;

118
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,060
and we want to understand the world around us. Every time you come up with a better method

119
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,740
for doing something, you have applied the scientific method in order to determine that.

120
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,339
You&#39;ve taken variables; you&#39;ve looked at them; you&#39;ve compared them; and you&#39;ve chosen the

121
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:11,070
one that works better, really, that&#39;s it. That&#39;s science, baby.
