One of things that we&#39;re trying to do in this course is give a realistic idea about

1
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:10,800
how the mind is actually working so we can take that and use it to improve our everyday thinking.

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,020
The world is extremely complex and extremely ambiguous, so most of the decisions that we&#39;re

3
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,670
making aren&#39;t immediately apparent.

4
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:27,700
There is a lot of mental life that is completely effortless, and then there is some of mental life that feels like work.

5
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:34,020
We&#39;re operating under less-than-ideal conditions, and so we have to rely on shortcuts in order

6
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,110
to be able to navigate the world, obviously.

7
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,980
The world is complex and ambiguous. There&#39;s so much information coming at us, sometimes

8
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,660
misinformation. How do we deal with it all?

9
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,230
Merely telling people how to do something is not going to turn them into experts, and

10
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:56,900
repeatedly telling them the same thing is not going to help. It&#39;s a lot of practice, with feedback.
