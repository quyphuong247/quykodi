So far in the course, we&#39;ve been talking about essentially the way that the mind doesn&#39;t work.

1
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:15,350
It doesn&#39;t work like a video camera. You can&#39;t go back in time and review what

2
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:21,250
it is that you experienced again. We don&#39;t have any sort of privileged access into the

3
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:26,730
workings of our own memory, and we&#39;re not very good at predicting other people&#39;s behavior

4
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,940
under most circumstances. We&#39;re not great at doing this sort of thing.

5
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,410
That&#39;s right, and I think we could spend episode after episode just going through each of these

6
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,870
myths and trying to shatter them. I mean, some common examples are: we only use 10 percent

7
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,250
of our brains, or right-brained people are more creative than left-brained people, or

8
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,559
you can tell whether someone&#39;s lying from a polygraph test. We dealt with subliminal

9
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,809
messages in rock music a couple of weeks ago. The thing is there&#39;s very little empirical

10
00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:02,940
evidence for these claims. It seems that they don&#39;t do what we think they might.

11
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,280
But as well as shattering these myths, I think it&#39;s important that we replace our beliefs

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,189
with something. So one of the things we&#39;re trying to do in this course is give a realistic

13
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:19,950
idea about how the mind is actually working. We can take that and use it to improve our everyday thinking.

14
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,649
I think you&#39;re exactly right, but we also need to—in order to understand the way that

15
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:31,270
the mind is working and give people a realistic idea about the kind of processes and so on

16
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:38,270
that happen, we need to understand the environment that we&#39;re operating in—specifically, when

17
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:43,409
we&#39;re making everyday sorts of decisions.

18
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:50,409
What sorts of decisions do we make every day? What to wear, or whether to buy a lawnmower

19
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:56,609
or not, or what kind of brand that you should buy, whether to buy a latex mattress or a

20
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:03,609
box-spring mattress, or whether to stay in the same job that you have, choosing a mate,

21
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:08,599
going through a grocery store, what sort of things that you purchase at the grocery store,

22
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:13,140
and so on, whether to spank your child, whether to be a vegetarian or not—the list goes

23
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,450
on. These are the sorts of things that we&#39;re dealing with.

24
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:22,010
If that&#39;s the case, most of these decisions that we make aren&#39;t under ideal conditions.

25
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:28,060
Most of the time, we&#39;re kind of rushed in order to make them. Ideally, in the best-case

26
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:33,280
scenario, you&#39;d have all the time in the world. You&#39;d have a big desk completely empty, with

27
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,600
paper; you could have a pros and cons list, and you can weigh out whether to spank your

28
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:45,280
child or not. You can do some research. You&#39;d have all of the information available to you,

29
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:52,120
about the latest studies, for example, about spanking and the benefits. We just don&#39;t have that time.

30
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,480
I mentioned the latex mattress. Recently, we were going to buy a mattress. It&#39;s kind

31
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,150
of a big purchase, right? You can go as high as tens of thousands of dollars and as low

32
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:11,150
as sleeping on the floor, but I couldn&#39;t find any sort of really good evidence for sleeping

33
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:16,650
on a latex mattress versus a box-spring mattress. If you go into The Sleep Store, they would

34
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,540
absolutely say that there&#39;s a massive difference between them and try to upsell you, but I

35
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:27,000
don&#39;t have all day to sit and do the necessary research to be able to make this sort of decisions.

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,150
The thing that gets me, though, is that even if you do have the time to be really deliberate

37
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,510
and think about this decision like you said, after you&#39;ve made the decision, it&#39;s really

38
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:43,880
hard to get good feedback about the quality of that decision. Whether you decided to go

39
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:49,780
to the movies instead of going to dinner, whether you decided to become a vegetarian,

40
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:56,590
how can you possibly, with a sample size of one, evaluate the quality of that decision?

41
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,709
How do you know you are right?

42
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:03,200
Yes. Especially in hindsight as well. I mean, anything could happen.

43
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,620
The other thing is, though, even if somebody does have the right answer, if somebody knows

44
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,650
whether it was the right decision or not, people aren&#39;t going to tell you because we

45
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:18,650
have these strange social ideas that you shouldn&#39;t critique people too much, so feedback is terrible.

46
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:22,330
The feedback that we get from the world about the basis of our decisions, the feedback that

47
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:27,949
we get from our friends and family and society, is terrible as well.

48
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:34,050
The world is extremely complex and extremely ambiguous, right? Most of the decisions that

49
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,469
we&#39;re making aren&#39;t immediately apparent, so when we&#39;re talking about complex, any of

50
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:44,349
ambiguity, I mean—we gave a few toy examples in the beginning, in episode two, where we

51
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:48,259
were talking about different illusions and how you see them differently. Most of these

52
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:52,990
examples, there&#39;s two ways of seeing it maybe.

53
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:58,490
But when we&#39;re talking in realistic terms, if you talk about something like, I don&#39;t

54
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:05,490
know, talent—when you&#39;re talking about talent, think of how multifaceted that concept is.

55
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,159
When you&#39;re determining whether somebody is talented or not, you can look at that notion

56
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:17,020
in a million different sorts of ways. If that&#39;s the case, then under most decision-making

57
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:22,650
circumstances, there are billions of ways that it could be, so it&#39;s very ambiguous as

58
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:29,650
to whether something is going to be perceived in one way or another. In terms of how we

59
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:37,300
act, there&#39;s a million different ways of acting. So it&#39;s not an easy task, making these sorts of everyday decisions.

60
00:05:37,309 --> 00:05:44,309
It&#39;s clear that the world is complex and ambiguous, so we have to use shortcuts. It&#39;s not ideal,

61
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:50,249
so we have to rely on easier ways of doing things, rules of thumb. Heuristics is what

62
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:54,199
they&#39;re called, and we&#39;re going to talk about that later in the episode. But first, we&#39;re

63
00:05:54,199 --> 00:06:00,759
going to start with a distinction that Daniel Kahneman makes in his book &quot;Thinking, Fast

64
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,569
and Slow,&quot; and we&#39;re going to talk to him in this episode. He makes a really nice distinction

65
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:11,539
between system one and system two, and he talks about them as though they&#39;re characters

66
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:19,800
in his book. System one is it&#39;s fast; it&#39;s effortless; it&#39;s automatic. System 2 is the opposite.

67
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:27,300
It&#39;s slow; it&#39;s deliberative; and it&#39;s very effortful. This is a really nice distinction,

68
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,300
and we&#39;re going to provide a bunch of examples of these because I think

69
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:34,589
it really does a nice job at characterizing the way that the mind works in the way that

70
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:38,250
we&#39;re going to be thinking about these everyday sorts of problems that we just mentioned.
