Danny Kahneman makes the distinction between system one and system two. I think it&#39;s

1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,879
worth spelling out a little bit exactly the character of those two systems. System one

2
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:21,879
is—as I said, it&#39;s fast. It&#39;s automatic. It&#39;s completely effortless. You don&#39;t

3
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,520
even know you&#39;re doing it. A few of those examples include—for example,

4
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,420
you might see a face, an angry face. If you look at a photo and you see the angry face,

5
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:40,230
then you don&#39;t have to build it up. You don&#39;t have to recognize, well, snarling

6
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:47,069
face, frowning, wrinkles on the forehead, showing teeth. None of these things have to

7
00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:51,850
happen in order for you to recognize that it&#39;s an angry face. It just happens. Another

8
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:58,069
example is just, two plus two equals... You know what I mean? Four just pops into your

9
00:00:58,069 --> 00:01:03,960
head. Bread and...butter hopefully pops into your head.

10
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,060
Again, the nature of this processing means that it just happens to you.

11
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:16,660
Another example we revisited in episode two is this idea of illusions. Again, you can&#39;t

12
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,530
help but to see these illusions. We gave the example of the faces appearing on the screen.

13
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,330
You can&#39;t help but to see the faces appear alien-like.

14
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:30,250
This is a really nice example. It&#39;s by Edward Adelson, and it&#39;s called the checker shadow

15
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:36,470
illusion. You see two squares marked A and B. When you&#39;re looking at the squares, you

16
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:42,530
can&#39;t help but to see one square being darker than the other. They look like they&#39;re completely

17
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,210
different, but in fact they&#39;re exactly the same shade of gray. So if you&#39;re to actually

18
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:50,080
measure them—we encourage people to do some arts and crafts here—and you can see in

19
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,720
fact that the two squares are in fact identical, but you can&#39;t help but to see them as completely different.

20
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,840
This is system one. You can&#39;t help it. These

21
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,960
things actually happen to you. You&#39;re not doing anything to see these illusions. I think

22
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,769
that&#39;s really worth pointing out. As we talked about on episode two, people have this

23
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:17,450
conception when it comes to higher order properties like learning and memory that we have some

24
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:24,100
sort of introspective access, that we have some control over these sorts of things, but

25
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:30,300
in fact, as Nisbett said, we actually don&#39;t. That&#39;s system one. These are the things

26
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,160
that happen to you. It&#39;s effortless. It&#39;s automatic.

27
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:39,440
System two is the opposite. Instead of two plus two, we have something like—I don&#39;t

28
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,600
know—17 times 24. Yes, it doesn&#39;t exactly come rolling off the tongue, like two plus

29
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,140
two does. You could compute it. You could sit down. You could probably even do it in

30
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:55,250
your head if you had a bit of time. But it doesn&#39;t immediately jump out at you.

31
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,900
Another one might be—so a system one property might be recognizing a familiar face, so you

32
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,400
can recognize your friend immediately, and you can recognize someone—your mother, for

33
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,040
example—in a crowd even. She would just kind of pop out. When you&#39;re searching for

34
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,120
a friend, for example, in a crowded auditorium and you&#39;re trying to find out who it is,

35
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,530
it&#39;s a serial process. You have to do one thing—&quot;No, not them, not them.&quot; You

36
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:26,530
go through this type of long, effortful process in order to spot that person. That&#39;s kind

37
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,580
of the distinction between system one and system two.

38
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,620
Another one, which I find quite interesting, is driving. I&#39;ve been living in Australia

39
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,080
for the last ten years or so. I&#39;ve absolutely no problem driving on the left side of the road.

40
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,349
It&#39;s completely effortless. It&#39;s largely system one. Particularly on an open road,

41
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:51,069
there&#39;s no processing whatsoever. You can almost forget how much you&#39;ve actually

42
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:57,090
travelled. But when I go back to Canada, where I grew up, and drive on the other side of

43
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,190
the road, it is really effortful. I have to sit and remind—&quot;Okay, drive on the right,

44
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:06,200
drive on the right. Indicators on this side. Window wipers go off every once in a while,&quot;

45
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,530
and it&#39;s not easy. This freaks me out actually. So we recently

46
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,700
went to New York to have a chat with Danny Kahneman, of course you&#39;re driving on the

47
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,379
right side of the road and I&#39;m in the passenger seat. We&#39;re driving through the streets

48
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:24,550
of New York, which is hard at the best of times. Then you&#39;re talking to be about quite

49
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:31,550
complicated scientific processes and principles, and I can tell that your mind is not necessarily

50
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,270
on the road but it&#39;s thinking about these things. That&#39;s another facet of system two

51
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:44,270
kind of thinking actually. System two is slow and deliberate but the resources are limited,

52
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,880
so when you&#39;re trying to do two complex tasks, which is driving on the other side

53
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:55,040
of the road that you&#39;re used to and explaining a complex phenomenon to me, those two interfere

54
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,100
with each other. So I think next time we&#39;re in the US, you

55
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,080
should keep focused on the road, but maybe when we&#39;re in Australia when your system

56
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,870
one is taking control of the wheel, then we can have a chat about more complicated things.

57
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,760
You&#39;d like to think that we&#39;d be immune to these sorts of effects. We talked about

58
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:20,370
this previously I think in Episode 2 where we aren&#39;t any better than anyone else making

59
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:27,370
these sorts of errors. Hopefully, I had somebody in the seat next to me that would say either,

60
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:33,060
&quot;Shut up&quot; or, &quot;Pull over,&quot; and we can carry on the discussion.

61
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,540
Hopefully—I mean, this distinction between system one and system two is quite important.

62
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,270
Everybody should have completed the three questions that we had earlier in the Episode.

63
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:47,090
Now these are part of something called the cognitive reflection task. Do you want to

64
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,020
tell us a bit about the test? Sure. It was developed by a researcher at

65
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,860
Yale called Shane Frederick, and it&#39;s kind of like a three-question IQ test, but it&#39;s

66
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:02,860
a little bit different. It assesses your ability to suppress the kind of quick system one response,

67
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:08,190
and your ability to rely on the slow and deliberate system two response.

68
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:15,190
Here&#39;s an example. A bat and a ball cost a dollar and ten cents. The bat costs one

69
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:21,180
dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? Now when I first heard this example,

70
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,449
my internal monologue was just screaming, &quot;Ten cents, ten cents, ten cents,&quot; but

71
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:30,630
hold on a minute, if the ball costs ten cents and the bat costs one dollar more than the

72
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:37,160
ball, that means the bat costs 1.10 and the ball costs ten cents which adds up to 1.20,

73
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,750
which doesn&#39;t make sense. It has to add to 1.10. So if you spend a little bit of time

74
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:47,780
thinking about this, you realize that the bat has to cost a dollar and 5 cents, and

75
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,110
the ball 5 cents. That&#39;s the only way these two things can add up to 1.10.

76
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:57,440
So as I&#39;ve said, in order to get this question right, you&#39;ve got to really suppress that

77
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,419
initial response and think a little bit more about it.

78
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:07,340
It&#39;s the same thing with the other two questions on the cognitive reflection test. I think

79
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:14,340
the second one is if it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long does it

80
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:21,710
take for 100 machines to create 100 widgets. Immediately, the intuitive sort of response

81
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:23,789
is a 100 minutes. A hundred minutes, yes.

82
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:30,650
But, in fact, that&#39;s not correct. The third question is a question about lily pads on

83
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:37,169
a lake that keep doubling in size each day, and if it covers the entire lake after 48

84
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:41,979
days, how long does it take to cover half of the lake? The first thing that comes to

85
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:45,650
your mind is half of 48 which is 24, which also is incorrect.

86
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:52,259
It&#39;d be great if people could go back to those questions and figure out—use their

87
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:58,330
system two and figure out exactly what the correct response is to these questions.

88
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:05,330
But, yes, it&#39;s not easy. It takes a little bit of cognitive effort to stop and move on.

89
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,190
I hope people don&#39;t feed bad if they didn&#39;t get each of the three questions correct. In

90
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:16,069
fact, it&#39;s extremely rare, as Shane Frederick showed. In fact, they compared people across

91
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:22,259
a whole bunch of institutions from Harvard and MIT and other institutions that aren&#39;t

92
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:26,610
part of the Ivy League and so on, and a lot of people didn&#39;t get it correct, so they

93
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,280
shouldn&#39;t feel bad if they didn&#39;t get all three correct.

94
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,639
It does seem to measure people&#39;s degree of rationality, if you call it. I think Keith

95
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:43,500
Stanovich from Toronto talks about this difference between intelligence and rationality.

96
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,810
Rationality is what we mean by system two processing, the extent to which people put in the effort

97
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:55,810
to process the information a bit more carefully. I think it&#39;s worth keeping in mind—again,

98
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,060
the point of this exercise is to recognize the distinction between system one and system two.

99
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:10,060
Obviously, the grandfather of heuristics and biases and the originator of the distinction

100
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:17,470
between system one and system two is Danny Kahneman. Now we had a conversation with Danny

101
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:23,050
in New York, and he really made that distinction between the two systems.
