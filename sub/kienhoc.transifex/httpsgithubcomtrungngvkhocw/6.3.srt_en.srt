I love the Science and Cooking course. In fact, I&#39;m a student in their course, when

1
00:00:08,379 --> 00:00:13,969
I find the time to actually do the labs and the homework and so on. Pia provided one example

2
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:19,230
of the macaroni and cheese to demonstrate viscosity. Another really nice one is the

3
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:25,630
molten chocolate cake example. Now with molten chocolate cake, the center of the cake needs

4
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:32,630
to be oozy so when you cut into it the middle is raw and the outside is cooked, which is

5
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:39,800
amazing, a really great dessert. In order to get that effect, you need to bake it at

6
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,149
exactly the right temperature. So what they do as one of the homework assignments is you

7
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:51,910
create a single batch of batter for the cakes, and you cook it at different temperatures,

8
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:56,629
and at different times, and so you can see exactly the right temperature to be able to

9
00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:00,309
cook the cake to get that oozing center.

10
00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:03,929
What they&#39;re doing in their course is similar to what we are doing in ours: we&#39;re trying

11
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:10,929
to get people to apply the scientific method experimentation not just in the kitchen but

12
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:18,420
everywhere in their lives, so a few of the examples that we have from science that we

13
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:25,430
can apply to cooking is exactly as they are: experimentation. So if you have a recipe,

14
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:31,960
so if you have this cookie recipe, for example, to create the best shortbread, and you tweak

15
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,060
a whole bunch of things at the same time—so you adjust the recipe, the amount of time

16
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,990
that you whip the thing, butter, sugar, or something—and you get this amazing cookie

17
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:47,430
in the end, you won&#39;t know which of those things actually did it, which of those things

18
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:53,649
were actually effective. If you&#39;re trying to figure out which of these things work like

19
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:58,820
that, you have to do what Michael and Pia did in their course: you have to systematically,

20
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,799
formally adjust one thing—temperature—and see what happens as a result of doing that

21
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,820
one thing. So manipulating one variable at a time is really important.

22
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:14,859
Another is careful notes. We learned in episode two that memory does not work like a video

23
00:02:14,859 --> 00:02:21,859
tape. We often really misestimate how well we are going to remember something when we

24
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:27,730
learn it for the first time. And so if you just jot down the in recipe, in the margins

25
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:33,010
of the recipe, that something is two tablespoons, for example, if you&#39;re not very specific that

26
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:38,419
it&#39;s two table spoons of vanilla, say, then you&#39;re not going to remember a month down

27
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:44,320
the road, and so it&#39;s very important to be very specific of what you&#39;ve done though out.

28
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,590
Another is telling other people about it. Once you create this amazing cookie and you&#39;ve

29
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,040
figured out what it was that you needed to tweak to get it there, tell other people.

30
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,290
Don&#39;t just follow these recipes blindly and pass them down from generation to generation

31
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,729
or just keep them within your family. Tell other people because people don&#39;t do this

32
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:10,010
very often. People don&#39;t manipulate recipes to see what it is that&#39;s effective. They just

33
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,500
kind of blindly follow what other people have done before them.

34
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,120
Yes, there&#39;s a great example. There&#39;s a great story of this. A daughter and a mother are

35
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,820
in the kitchen. They&#39;re cooking a roast. It&#39;s all prepared and ready to go. Then the mother

36
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,970
says, &quot;Make sure you cut off the ends of the roast before you put it on the baking tray

37
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:32,720
and into the oven.&quot; The daughter says, &quot;Why do you do that?&quot; The mother&#39;s like, &quot;I think

38
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,769
it helps release the juices which improves the flavor.&quot; The daughter is not quite convinced,

39
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:42,310
and she says, &quot;Well, come on, why do you do that?&quot; Mother says, &quot;This is the way I&#39;ve

40
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,900
always done it. This is the way my mother, your grandmother, taught me.&quot; So the daughter

41
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,940
gets on the phone to Grandma and says, &quot;Look, we&#39;re making a roast, and I&#39;m wondering why

42
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,660
you have to cut the ends off the roast before you put it on the baking tray and into the

43
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:02,660
oven?&quot; Grandma&#39;s like, &quot;I can&#39;t...&quot; Then it dawns on her, &quot;Dear, dear, the reason I cut

44
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:11,419
off the ends of the roast is because it was too big for my baking tray.&quot; So this is just—it&#39;s

45
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:17,070
a simple story, a simple example, but it gets at that idea of finding things out for yourself

46
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:23,560
firsthand. You could, of course you could, blindly follow what people say, any authority

47
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:30,700
about this. You could be slaves to authority, or alternatively you can go out and find out for yourself.

48
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,320
That&#39;s really important: to find things out for firsthand. There are a whole bunch of

49
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,990
other sorts of cooking myths that propagate exactly like that. I talked about searing

50
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:46,600
meat before. People have the idea that you need to cook a steak, really cook it at a

51
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:52,260
high temperature, and only flip it once, for example, to get the outside nice and caramelized

52
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:57,900
and the inside raw. It captures the juices in more, which is completely—there&#39;s no

53
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,940
evidence for that whatsoever. In fact, it&#39;s the opposite. Another one is cooking off the

54
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:09,800
alcohol, so if you add some wine to a Bolognese or something, the alcohol will burn off or something.

55
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,080
something.

56
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:14,470
Yes. Or that if you cook food in the microwave, it gets rid of the nutrients; or if you&#39;re

57
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:19,700
cooking mussels and they don&#39;t open up after you&#39;ve cooked them, you have to throw those

58
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:25,030
away. I mean, I&#39;ve seen professionals chefs actually propagate these myths.

59
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:31,510
But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s enough to say that people are silly, or people are slaves to

60
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,590
authority, or that they&#39;re gullible, or they&#39;ll believe anything, because we&#39;ve seen that

61
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:42,180
that doesn&#39;t quite work. So what we&#39;re trying to do is find out why we make these mistakes,

62
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:48,410
why do we rely on these beliefs and these myths and these mistakes, and then how we

63
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,670
can avoid them and do better.

64
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:55,460
That&#39;s right. This idea, this is kind of a point that we&#39;re returning to now. I think

65
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:01,550
it was in episode two. We are incredible pattern-recognition machines. We provided a bunch of examples

66
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:08,550
where we see structure; we see signal; we see things that aren&#39;t actually necessarily

67
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:17,120
there. If you look at a pattern of noise, you see faces in the noise; or in oak, you

68
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,889
see the wood paneling and you can kind of see faces looking. We do this all of the time,

69
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:28,700
and most of the time it&#39;s normally fine. I mean, it&#39;s because we do that, because we&#39;re

70
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:37,000
so good at that, at seeing faces that aren&#39;t actually there, that we are so impressive in other domains

71
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:43,830
For example, we talked about the availability heuristic, and we rely on the ease of processing

72
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,600
to give us some indication about the size of the category. With representativeness,

73
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,780
we rely on similarity and familiarity to be able to pigeonhole people in particular ways.

74
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:58,440
Most of the time, it&#39;s fine. Most of the time, that serves us extremely well, but sometimes

75
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,780
it&#39;s not great. Sometimes we do make mistakes as a result. At least we need to figure out

76
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,000
where those happened and why they happened, exactly as you said.

77
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yes, so this idea of seeing patterns in noise, of misinterpreting random events, is something

78
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,340
that came up in my conversation with Tom Gilovich.

79
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:24,500
So why do we believe these strange things in the absence of data or evidence to the contrary?

80
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,630
Yes. Well, there&#39;s a whole bunch of reasons. There&#39;s not a single answer to this. If there

81
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:34,240
was a single answer to it, we could easily teach that to people in school, and then it

82
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,770
would be gone, but a whole bunch of things conspire to it.

83
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:44,770
One of them—and most of them are sort of a side effect of this impressive intellectual

84
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,260
machinery that we have in our heads. Part of its job is to identify patterns out there.

85
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:56,610
It&#39;s hard to get that job accomplished perfectly, so people look out there for patterns and

86
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:01,419
they&#39;re often going to see things that really aren&#39;t there. If you go on the Internet and

87
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:08,090
type in &quot;Illusions,&quot; you&#39;ll see all sorts of them: people spotting faces in clouds,

88
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:15,090
or faces in a cinnamon bun, or what have you. If you take, for example, grab a bag of M&amp;Ms,

89
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:22,530
pour it in a jar, and you look at it, and the different colors are randomly arranged,

90
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,380
they don&#39;t look random. It&#39;s just like, &quot;There&#39;s a bunch of blue ones over there and a bunch

91
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:32,380
of green ones over there.&quot; We sort of see order where there isn&#39;t any. So we can see

92
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:38,210
things happening in threes. We organize things into certain clusters that are really the

93
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,430
kind of clusters that you&#39;d see by chance.

94
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:46,920
Take, for example, the pretty common belief that things happen in threes—you know, natural

95
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,320
disasters, so if two of them have happened in close proximity, people will sometimes

96
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,550
tell you, &quot;Oh my god, I wonder what the third one is going to be,&quot; or homicides, or a fatality

97
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:02,580
on the park, fatalities on the park of famous people. If you look at all of those things,

98
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:11,400
they don&#39;t tend to cluster in threes at all, and so why do people believe those kinds of things?

99
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,640
There&#39;s a belief in the sports world and something called the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; jinx. You

100
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:21,860
get your picture on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated,&quot; uh oh, that&#39;s a terrible thing. Whatever success

101
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:28,860
got you there is unlikely to continue. That&#39;s been shown to be false as well.

102
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:36,920
Another belief in the so-called Sophomore Jinx—you&#39;ve been exceptional as a first-year

103
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:43,920
performer, a rookie, and the thought is that if you&#39;ve done really well your first year,

104
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,820
you&#39;re jinxing yourself.

105
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:52,130
Or more common kinds of things—you&#39;re at a grocery store, and the line you&#39;re in is

106
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,400
really bogged down, going nowhere. There&#39;s someone in front of you with a million coupons

107
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,980
sifting through them, or can&#39;t get their change organized, and the line right next to you

108
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,810
is zipping through. You&#39;re tempted to go to that line. Why stay on the slow one when there&#39;s

109
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:10,450
a faster line over there? Many of us often go, &quot;Wait a minute. I know that if I do that,

110
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:15,200
that line&#39;s going to slow down, and this one&#39;s going to speed up.&quot; I don&#39;t know what principle

111
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,339
of the universe would create that.

112
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:22,630
This a really nice demonstration of what we do as scientists. If you&#39;re looking at this

113
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:28,010
as one observation, this little chunk of the world, you can see whether it&#39;s sufficiently

114
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:35,010
weird, whether it&#39;s sufficiently lumpy or fishy to be able to say that something systematic

115
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,480
is happening, something non-random is going on.

116
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,500
And so next we&#39;re going to talk about the role of chance and randomness and how we perceive this.
