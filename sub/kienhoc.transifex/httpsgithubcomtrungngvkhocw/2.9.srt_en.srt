What Beth&#39;s research really shows is that our—not just what we see and what we hear—but

1
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:17,380
our memories can actually be distorted. They&#39;re plastic and malleable. There&#39;s misinformation

2
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,369
everywhere. We&#39;re getting a constant flow of this misinformation, so it can be from

3
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:25,869
a stop sign or a yield sign or from other people.

4
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:30,169
Think about how this would work. The media could give you information that might bias

5
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:37,169
you in a particular way and create a false memory or an impression of something. But

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,570
it&#39;s only a false memory because it never happened. It&#39;s a real memory. You really

7
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,760
experienced it—just like you see the Dalmatian dog and you hear those sounds. It&#39;s not

8
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,690
like this memory is inferior to others.

9
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:59,900
Beth&#39;s work, for me, really demonstrates that what we remember is shaped by the sum of our experiences.

10
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:06,960
So if memory is not working like a video camera, it&#39;s hard to even recognize that you&#39;ve

11
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,740
made an interpretation at all. All of this stuff is coming at you, and it&#39;s just like

12
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,850
a visual illusion: you remember it vividly and it&#39;s actually happening to you.

13
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,870
Let&#39;s use and example to make that a bit more concrete: with a visual illusion. Now

14
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:28,500
this is an illusion that you and I as—well, as one of my honor students discovered a couple

15
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:35,500
of years ago, and I think we can use it to really highlight the fact that we really have

16
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:41,090
no control. We&#39;re completely unaware of having made, an interpretation and the illusion

17
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:48,090
happens to us in the same way that these memory illusions are just as real as actual memories.

18
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,090
Now we&#39;re going to present you with some faces on the screen, and I want you to keep

19
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:58,310
your eyes on the center of the cross in the middle of the screen. Don&#39;t look directly

20
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,950
at the faces. Keep your eyes on the cross.

21
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:07,950
Okay, are you ready? Here they are.

22
00:02:17,499 --> 00:02:23,019
By this point in the video, the faces should look a little bit strange. They might look

23
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:27,159
a little bit alien-like. Some of the eyes might be a little larger than you&#39;d expect,

24
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:31,939
and they might look a little bit paler. But if you replay this section of the video and

25
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:36,579
look at the faces again, you&#39;ll see that they&#39;re completely normal. We&#39;re not playing

26
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:40,040
any tricks on you. There&#39;s no Photoshopping going on.

27
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:46,129
What&#39;s happening is that the previous face is distorting the face that follows it. For

28
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:51,590
example, if one of the faces has small, beady, little eyes and it&#39;s followed by a face

29
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:58,590
with regular-sized eyes, then these regular-sized eyes look huge. Again, you can&#39;t help but

30
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:03,889
to see these faces as distorted. That&#39;s the nature of the illusion. There&#39;s nothing

31
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:07,719
that you can do about it. You&#39;re not even aware that your visual system is doing any

32
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:11,169
sort of comparison. It&#39;s just happening to you.

33
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:15,709
So think about what&#39;s happening here. With this visual illusion, when the faces are flashing

34
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:20,129
up and they look alien-like, it&#39;s nothing that you&#39;re doing. It&#39;s just happening

35
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:25,849
to you. This is across our senses, so, yes, it&#39;s happening in vision but it also happens

36
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:32,760
in hearing and could even be happening in smell and taste. We haven&#39;t tested these

37
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,090
things. But it&#39;s definitely happening in memory. We&#39;re unaware that we&#39;ve made

38
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:44,090
and interpretation, and the sum of our perception is shaped by the sum of our experiences.
