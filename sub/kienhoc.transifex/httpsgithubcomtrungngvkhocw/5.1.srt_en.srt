Over the last few episodes, we saw that our intuitions about how we perceive and remember

1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:14,850
the world are often mistaken. In fact, we have no real privileged access into the basis

2
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:20,080
of our decisions, how it is that we do what we do. In the last episode, we introduced

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,420
a more realistic account of how the mind works. We spoke about system one and system two and

4
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:30,640
chatted to Danny Kahneman about some the heuristics and biases that we rely on, that we have to

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,100
rely on, in order to deal with the complexity and ambiguity of the world.

6
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,130
One of the things I think is important that people take away from the last episode is

7
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,910
that it&#39;s not really a matter of just slowing down. That&#39;s not really a solution. As Danny

8
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:51,030
Kahneman said during our interview, when we asked him how to improve everyday thinking,

9
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:57,140
he suggested that we pick only a couple of areas and try to improve those, or recruit

10
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,980
the help of a friend, someone who&#39;s looking at the circumstance from the outside.

11
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,780
The reason he made this suggestion, I think, is that—you know, he&#39;s been doing this a

12
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:13,330
long time—50 years, I think, he&#39;s been in this area—and he&#39;s won a Nobel Prize. If

13
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:19,780
anyone is going to improve their everyday thinking by generally improving their problem-solving

14
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,930
skills, it&#39;s going to be Danny Kahneman, and he mentioned that his everyday thinking

15
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,920
hasn&#39;t improved over the last 50 years or so.

16
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,820
So where does that leave us? Well, just being more careful or being more deliberate really

17
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:41,340
isn&#39;t going to help necessarily. That&#39;s only half the story. Of course, learning the names

18
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,010
of these heuristics and biases are important so people can recognize them when they&#39;re

19
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,650
actually happening, but that&#39;s only half the story.

20
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,030
The other half of the story is what we&#39;re going to talk about today, which is learning

21
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:59,030
to learn. We talked to Geoff Norman, who essentially teaches this stuff to doctors about this very

22
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:04,060
topic, and here&#39;s what he had to say.

23
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:11,060
How do they improve as an expert? You mentioned that we—going slow doesn&#39;t necessarily help,

24
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:17,790
being deliberative, and there&#39;s this compounded issue of self-assessment that we often don&#39;t

25
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,980
know how good we&#39;re actually doing at any given case. I mean, what does that mean for

26
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,400
improving practice? How do we get better? How do—the goal of this course that we&#39;re

27
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:34,349
taking is called The Science of Everyday Thinking. So given your experience in the field of expertise

28
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:38,319
and in medicine, how do we improve everyday thinking?

29
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,969
You improve by knowing more.

30
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:43,180
So just the accumulation of experiences.

31
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,159
Yes. It seems so tantalizing. It would really nice if I could be very prescriptive and say,

32
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:51,189
&quot;Well, if you do this, that, and the other thing, then you&#39;ll be much better.&quot; At some

33
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:55,499
level, I guess there&#39;s got to be a bit of a germ of truth in that. This course wouldn&#39;t

34
00:02:55,499 --> 00:03:01,489
exist if we didn&#39;t think that there are some—that being explicit about everyday thinking and

35
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:06,559
the traps in everyday thinking wouldn&#39;t help people think better. At some level that&#39;s

36
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:12,819
true, but that&#39;s generally locked in to what&#39;s been called general problem-solving strategies,

37
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:18,859
which are not very powerful. Sure, that&#39;s going to help a bit. I suppose reflection

38
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:24,480
is going to help a little bit, but it seems that all of these strategies, to sort of generalize

39
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,709
horrendously, are good for about a 10-percent improvement. It&#39;s not zero, but it&#39;s not

40
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:33,549
night-and-day or black-and-white either.

41
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:36,529
Very clearly, the single best predictor of how good you are is how much you know about

42
00:03:36,529 --> 00:03:41,569
the domain, not what problem-solving skills you bring to bear on it. We began there. That

43
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:47,419
was wrong. Question is: are there strategies we can do to optimize the acquisition of knowledge?

44
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:51,209
Again, we&#39;re talking about two kinds of knowledge: formal knowledge and experiential

45
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,809
knowledge. We&#39;re now beginning to discover— and I can&#39;t take any personal credit for this

46
00:03:55,809 --> 00:04:01,489
one; this isn&#39;t my domain—but people like Mayer, Bjork, Roediger had been working hard

47
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:08,489
on taking models of the nature of the mind—short-term working memory, long-term memory, associative—and

48
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:15,939
turning that into very prescriptive and powerful strategies to enhance the efficiency of learning.

49
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:21,620
Things like—an obvious thing like mixing up examples from across multiple chapters

50
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,340
so that you have to try and figure out which is which—it turns out to be an extremely

51
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,520
powerful strategy for learning.

52
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,090
The idea of transfer, which is being able to take knowledge that you&#39;ve learned in one

53
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:36,190
context and apply it to another: one, it doesn&#39;t happen at all as easily as we think it does;

54
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:40,919
but, two, psychologists would devise strategies to make that happen better.

55
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:46,159
I think this is moving much more into the instructional educational psychology end of

56
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:50,669
things. There are things we can do to very much enhance the efficiency with which you

57
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:56,000
acquire the knowledge you need to get the job done as a diagnostician or as a human.

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,639
My name is Geoff. I think about reasoning.

59
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,280
I think it&#39;s really clear now that just telling people to slow down, to be more careful,

60
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,770
is not going to help people improve their everyday thinking. Yes, it&#39;s really important

61
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,460
that we have the vocabulary for this stuff. You need to be able to know what the heuristics

62
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,979
and biases are and point to them and see where they&#39;re operating.

63
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:24,979
But as Geoff said, the key to improving thinking, to thinking better, is to know more. So if

64
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,710
you want to be a better singer, you have to spend time singing. If you want to become

65
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,650
a better cricket player, you have to practice.

66
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:38,789
That&#39;s part of the story, I think, but the other half is, as Geoff said, yes, practice

67
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:44,370
is important. You need to spend the time and the effort actually doing the thing that it

68
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,280
is that you want to improve on, but the other is actually taking the advice or learning

69
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,460
from experts, so reading, right? You need to spend time looking at the things that experts

70
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,439
say are important within that field in order to improve a lot more.

71
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:06,439
So when it comes to sports, knowing where to put your fingers or your feet is critical.

72
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:13,199
In academics, learning from experts or academics tell you what area or what things to read

73
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,000
within that area so you&#39;re not going down blind alleys all the time. They can tell you

74
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,800
exactly where you need to focus your attention. That&#39;s really important. That&#39;s what reading does.

75
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:31,819
But this idea of general knowledge or general problem-solving, as Geoff Norman called it,

76
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:37,710
is a little bit tricky, isn&#39;t it? I mean, he said that, yes, that&#39;s not going to help.

77
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:44,479
Having this sort of generic problem-solving capability hasn&#39;t done very well in the past.

78
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:51,479
Danny Kahneman mentioned that in his interview as well. So just having this sort of blunt-force

79
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:55,680
thing that you can apply to each of these different areas isn&#39;t going to terribly successful,

80
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,819
and the reason it&#39;s not is that it&#39;s so far removed. You have this general purpose

81
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:06,439
tool that you&#39;re applying to all of these different very specific things, and by that

82
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:12,909
very nature, it&#39;s going to be unsuccessful because it&#39;s so far removed from each of these

83
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:19,039
different areas. What is going to be successful is exactly as you mentioned: in order to improve

84
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:28,100
everyday thinking, you need to know more. You need to expand your experiences with that particular domain.

85
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,969
That&#39;s what we&#39;re going to talk about today specifically: learning how to learn. If your

86
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:38,969
goal is to try to improve, is to try to know as much as you can about a particular domain,

87
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:46,009
we can help. We know a lot. We can help you get there more efficiently. We can help with

88
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,669
learning the information faster and hanging on to it for a longer period of time.

89
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:56,529
So we talked to John Dunlosky who&#39;s done an enormous amount of work in this area. He&#39;s

90
00:07:56,529 --> 00:08:01,819
done a massive analysis of all of the techniques that seem to be effective and those that don&#39;t,

91
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:03,189
and here&#39;s what he had to say.
