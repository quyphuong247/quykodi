I think it&#39;s important that we have been spending a little bit of time busting myths

1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:14,070
about how we intuitively think that the mind works, but we need to replace it with a more

2
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,010
realistic version of how the mind might actually be working.

3
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:25,010
Here we&#39;ve introduced the two systems: system one and system two. System one: intuitive,

4
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:32,199
fast and automatic. System two: slow and deliberate. We also discussed that the world is complex

5
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:36,820
and ambiguous. There&#39;s so much information coming at us, sometimes misinformation, how

6
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:42,910
do we deal with it all? Some of the ways that Danny Kahneman in that kind of tradition talks

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:48,510
about heuristics and biases. Today we discussed availability heuristic, representativeness

8
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,260
heuristic, anchoring. These are all ways that we can help deal with that complexity and

9
00:00:54,260 --> 00:01:01,260
ambiguity and do better in the world. Exactly. We ended with this idea of expertise.

10
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:11,039
I think this idea of system one and two is really useful metaphor, as Danny Kahneman

11
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:17,670
points out. If you were to look in the brain and find system one and system two, you wouldn&#39;t

12
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:24,469
find it. I mean, it doesn&#39;t really make sense to talk about the two systems as though

13
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:29,240
you can find them neurologically, as though they&#39;re a thing. They&#39;re not. They&#39;re

14
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:35,649
metaphors. I think it&#39;s useful to think about system one and two in terms of these

15
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:42,229
characters because it reframes the way we think about dealing with these kind of issues.

16
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:49,229
We also talked about it with respect to expertise and the development of expertise, turning

17
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:56,289
the system to the deliberate process into system one eventually.

18
00:01:56,289 --> 00:02:03,289
What we&#39;re going to see in the next episode is how we can turn ourselves into experts

19
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:10,509
in a sense. We&#39;re going to see better ways of learning and retaining information, so

20
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,659
we&#39;re going to see how to boost learning and remember the information we do learn in the first place.
