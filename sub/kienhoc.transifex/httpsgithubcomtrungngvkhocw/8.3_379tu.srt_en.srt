That&#39;s one of my favorite stories of Susan&#39;s. I&#39;d been reading about this almost my entire

1
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:15,109
academic career. The fact—what makes it unique, what makes her so outstanding, is

2
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:22,109
that she&#39;s the one who experienced this. She was the one who studied parapsychology right

3
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,140
through the &#39;70s, all the way until now. In looking at these very claims, she&#39;s the one

4
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:34,140
that had this experience and changed her opinion about these experiences. Imagine being in

5
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,389
that sort of scenario: having this extremely vivid out-of-body experience, something that

6
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:49,389
you couldn&#39;t possibly explain using anything that you have available to you, and she did

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,739
experiment after experiment after experiment, twenty-some experiments, as part of her degree

8
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:02,739
to investigate these things, and all of them just kept coming up empty. She&#39;s amazing.

9
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:10,910
Imagine what it would take to fundamentally change your world view about something as

10
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:15,520
profound, something as vivid as that experience. It&#39;s pretty phenomenal.

11
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,010
Yes, and I think Susan&#39;s in a unique position because, sure, there are many scientists out

12
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,540
there who could have come up with a reasonable experiment to test these claims, but she was

13
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,000
intimately familiar with this area. She lived it and breathed it. She talks about the tarot cards.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,620
So she was able to set up an experiment that had scientific rigor and came up with

15
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:40,720
things that you and I would never have imagined—the combination that the person had to guess and

16
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,800
baking the apple crumble—really, really puts her in a unique position to test these claims.

17
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,659
There are several others like this. There are actually former magicians, or magicians

18
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:57,909
that spend a lot of their time revealing some of the tricks, the secrets, behind things

19
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:04,159
like magic and parapsychology. There&#39;s one: James Randi or his stage name is The Amazing Randi.

20
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:11,159
Derren Brown is another, and Penn &amp; Teller. These guys are again in a unique position

21
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,139
to test these claims because they live and breathe this stuff.

22
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:21,060
Now I spoke to another former magician, or he might still be a magician. He might practice

23
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,300
some of these things every now and then. He&#39;s actually now a professor of psychology.

24
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:33,800
Again, we travelled to Edinburgh to chat to Richard Wiseman about some of the ways that he tries to tackle paranormal claims.
