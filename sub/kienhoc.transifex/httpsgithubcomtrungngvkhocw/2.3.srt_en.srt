How well did I do?

1
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,960
Well, if you're like most people who have done this experiment—this has been done

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,890
a lot of times. In fact, it's based on a board game. People actually try to hum or

3
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,750
they tap a particular song, and other people in the room try to guess what it was. If you've

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:28,110
done one of these games, it's really difficult. In fact, people who guess, an audience of

5
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:33,890
about a hundred people who guess, find that about—I don't know—about 2.5 percent

6
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:39,300
of people guess correctly. So that's pretty bad.

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,800
You remember, we went and talked to Lee Ross at Stanford University. Now he was the supervisor

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,550
of this woman's project, who actually did this experiments formally, named Elisabeth

9
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:55,550
Newton, in the 1980s. She found exactly that. I think people guessed about 50 percent of

10
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:03,180
people in the auditorium would guess correctly, when in fact only about 2.5 percent of the

11
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,920
people in the auditorium guessed correctly.

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,380
So here's what Lee had to say about her project.

13
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:15,380
You had a student in, I think, 1990: Elizabeth Newton, who did a tapping experiment. Can

14
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,659
you tell us about that?

15
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:24,659
Well, I must say the real author of that study was my brother, who's a musician.

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,249
Really?

17
00:01:26,249 --> 00:01:33,249
He used to do this when I was a kid. He showed me this interesting phenomenon, that if you

18
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:40,209
tap out a tune, you think you know for sure what it is. It seems really obvious to you.

19
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:47,209
In part, that's because, when you're tapping the tune, you hear the music that accompanies

20
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:52,840
it, and you know, when you're not tapping, whether that's a musical rest or a sustained

21
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:59,069
note. This is something you only can appreciate by trying it, but I would urge anyone seeing

22
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:05,069
the series to try it on someone. Tap some really familiar song. You know, you can tap

23
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:11,730
the National Anthem or you can tap &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; or something really familiar, and

24
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,670
to you it will seem absolutely inevitable that the other person will know, and they'll

25
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,560
look at you with a kind of blank look.

26
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,880
So when Elisabeth Newton came along, I had described this phenomenon to her, and she

27
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,960
says, &quot;Well, that's great. Let's make a study of it,&quot; and it became part of her dissertation.

28
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,200
Now the idea is that when you're listening to these songs as an audience member to the

29
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,350
person who's tapping and you know what it is that you're looking for, it's extremely

30
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,410
vivid from the inside because you're kind of following along; you're listening to

31
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:51,870
the music, but if you're not familiar with the music, it's just tapping. So it's

32
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,010
really difficult from somebody standing in the shoes of an audience member to guess what

33
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:02,300
it is that you're tapping, but for you it seems so obvious, like, &quot;How could you not

34
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:09,300
guess 'Greensleeves' in this particular case? It's obvious.&quot;

35
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:24,210
But from the audience's perspective, it's not obvious. They're just hearing, you know,

36
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:31,210
songs or tapping on their hand, and they can't interpret what it is that's being portrayed.

37
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,900
Part of the reason, as Lee said in the interview, is that you can't tell whether— a delayed

38
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,850
note, whether it's sustained because it's a note that's carrying on, or whether you're

39
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:47,850
holding it because it's a break in the music. You can only tell that from the inside. You

40
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:52,090
can't tell it, objectively, from the audience member's perspective.

41
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,350
Now this is going to be an example that we're going to return to again and again in the

42
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:02,810
course. The idea is that it's really difficult to put yourself in the shoes or see things

43
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,190
from the perspective of other people. That's going to be something we're going to work

44
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:12,060
on again and again throughout the entire course, and I think this is a really nice example of that.

45
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,900
I've got a great example of this. It's a song by Regurgitator. I've been using

46
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,880
this example for years. Now what I get people to do is I just play the song from the start

47
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,660
without saying anything. I say, &quot;There's an electronic voice here, and it's actually

48
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:31,660
saying English words, and I want you to tell me what the lyrics of this song are.&quot;

49
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:14,310
I play it through, and people say, &quot;I think I got this word,&quot; or, &quot;I think he said

50
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:21,139
salmon or people.&quot; Lots of things come through. Then I say, &quot;Okay, let's play it again,&quot;

51
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:28,139
and this time, as the song is playing, I show the lyrics on the screen as the song is playing.

52
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:14,110
The reaction is incredible. All of sudden, people can hear vividly exactly what these

53
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,990
words are and what the electronic voice is, like it was there all along. People sometimes

54
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:23,520
think that I'm playing a trick on them, that I played two tracks, but, no, when you

55
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,520
know what the lyrics are, the words just sound crystal clear.

56
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:35,410
There's another really good example of this: where people find hidden messages in songs.

57
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:39,199
So you can either play a song forward, or you can play it backward, and when you're

58
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:45,050
listening to it, you can hear messages that may not have been there intentionally on behalf

59
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:52,050
of the band, and so people have some pretty creative interpretations of what the actual

60
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,260
backward or forward messages say.

61
00:06:54,260 --> 00:07:00,139
I spoke to John Vokey about exactly this. He was involved in a legal case, actually,

62
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:05,800
with a band called Judas Priest. He has an incredible story about his involvement in

63
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,310
that case and what happened. You have to hear it. It's fantastic.
