That distinction between performance and learning that Bob mentioned, I think, is really important.

1
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:15,469
I mean, we like to think we know how to learn, how we learn best, in what situations we learn

2
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:20,340
best, and that we know when we&#39;ve learned something. But as we saw in episode three,

3
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:27,340
we have no real insight into the basis of behavior. It&#39;s really difficult to predict

4
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,000
what we&#39;ll learn and whether we&#39;ll be able to retrieve this stuff in the future.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I mean, that&#39;s exactly right. But who better to provide an indication of how much we learn

6
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,769
than ourselves, right? Again, as you said, we saw this in episode three. We are not the

7
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:51,359
best people to determine whether we understand something or not.

8
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:57,449
We keep coming back, to this idea of fluency or ease of processing. System one is responding,

9
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:02,850
and system two is picking up on how easy it was for system one to do that. That&#39;s exactly

10
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,810
what&#39;s happening here with learning. If something is easy, if something goes down easily, we

11
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:14,810
misinterpret that ease, that simplicity, with knowledge, with comprehension, with understanding,

12
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:22,390
and that&#39;s a real problem. It&#39;s paradoxical in a sense because people use that information

13
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,170
to gauge how much they know about a particular concept.

14
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:32,170
I have a really good example of this. It was back quite a few years ago. I was teaching

15
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:37,530
an advanced statistics course for honors students, and it was compulsory. All the students were

16
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,210
required to take this course, a fourth-year honors level course called Advanced Multivariate

17
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:49,210
Statistics. Students were understandably very worried, very anxious about taking this difficult

18
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:58,030
topic, and it was difficult. I worked hard. I really worked hard to try to do everything

19
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,549
I could to make it easier for the students to understand this material. But at that time,

20
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,759
I didn&#39;t really—I hadn&#39;t really read much in this area, and so I didn&#39;t understand the

21
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,160
importance of retrieval and the importance of desirable difficulties.

22
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,600
At that time, I gave—I prepared this lecture. It was a very difficult lecture on eigenvalues

23
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:25,600
and eigenvectors, and I did everything I could to make it easier on the students. For example,

24
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,990
I represented it in a whole bunch of different ways, so you have—you can represent this

25
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:36,990
in matrix notation and algebraically, geometrically. I had diagrams. I was essentially pre-processing,

26
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:45,700
digesting all of this stuff for the students, so all they had to do is just sit back and kind of watch it unfold.

27
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:50,880
Now they did that, and I had one student who came up to me after the lecture. She said,

28
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:57,290
&quot;Jason, you know, I completely understand. I get it. It feels so much better now that

29
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,820
you&#39;ve presented it to me. I understand everything about eigenvectors and eigenvalues.&quot; I thought

30
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,680
to myself, &quot;Well, there&#39;s no way. There&#39;s no way that you could&#39;ve—I struggled!&quot;

31
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,900
It took you weeks to put this stuff together.

32
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,710
Exactly. Preparing it, you have to sit down and work at it, do a few problems in and try

33
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:20,730
to explain it to yourself, and she didn&#39;t do that. Sure enough, when the exam came around,

34
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,760
she didn&#39;t do that well. She clearly didn&#39;t understand it nearly as well as she thought

35
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,980
she did. Yes, the same thing happens to me when I&#39;m watching a documentary on a topic

36
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:35,950
that I don&#39;t know much about. When I&#39;m watching a beautiful BBC documentary by Brian Cox on

37
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,950
the wonders of the universe, he&#39;s talking about a complex topic like entropy, and he

38
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:46,310
goes on and he&#39;s using these beautiful examples with sand and talking about time and how it

39
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:52,050
relates to basic physics and how we perceive time, it just—it looks fantastic. I&#39;m like,

40
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:58,400
&quot;Wow, I&#39;ve never understood this so well.&quot; I guarantee, if somebody paused that TV show

41
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,880
and asked me one thing about entropy, I would not be able to tell them at all. I was fooled

42
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:09,110
by that feeling of fluency. It felt really good, but I actually didn&#39;t understand the

43
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,750
material as well as I thought.

44
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:18,750
That&#39;s really important: to have these checks. That&#39;s exactly what this sort of retrieval

45
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,510
does when you&#39;re actually forced to generate entropy. If you pause the film and said, &quot;What

46
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:30,690
is entropy,&quot; and forced you to say, &quot;Well, it&#39;s, uh—yes, I really have no idea exactly

47
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,610
what it is, but it went down easily,&quot; then I think we&#39;re getting closer.

48
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,150
There are a bunch of strategies that we can use, a bunch of these desirable difficulties.

49
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:47,200
Yes, they are hard, but—one is retrieval, retrieval practice. Another is spacing, putting it time and time again.

50
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,620
Another one that we didn&#39;t talk about is this idea of interleaving. What you can do, if

51
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:58,620
you&#39;re studying, study statistics for a bit, followed by biology, do a bit of English and

52
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:06,030
present these things in kind of an interleaved format, so you&#39;re not just studying statistics

53
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:11,260
in a five-hour block. You&#39;re kind of spreading it across a bit. You&#39;re getting spacing in

54
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:16,430
there as well, but it&#39;s this idea interleaving, of doing one thing for while and switching

55
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,160
to another task. That is also a desirable difficulty.

56
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,340
There are a few others that you can do to make it just a little—restructuring your

57
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:31,340
notes in a particular way, organizing it by theme instead of by topic. Textbook producers

58
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:37,330
do this all the time, right? They present it in exactly that the most logical format.

59
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,480
They highlight the important points for you. They&#39;re doing exactly what I did in my stats

60
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,520
course. They&#39;re pre-digesting all of this information for the students so they don&#39;t

61
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:55,500
have to—so they can just let it wash over them. They mistake that fluency with understanding, and that&#39;s a real problem.

62
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,960
Students in this course should probably be careful as well because, I mean, we&#39;re not

63
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,550
professionals but we tried as hard as we can to make these videos look as good as they

64
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:10,840
can. We tried really hard to make the online experience as best as it can possibly be.

65
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:17,840
But be careful not to be fooled by that feeling of fluency. Instead, pause the video. Spend

66
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:24,770
some time working, actively working, recalling this information and going through that struggle

67
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:29,139
to make sure that you really understand it and that you&#39;re really going to be able to

68
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,560
retrieve this stuff accurately for months and years to come.

69
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Well, we&#39;ve done a few things. In Think101, we&#39;re not just producing this stuff for people

70
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,990
to kind of absorb and then let it ...

71
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,830
Wash over them.

72
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,900
Have them wash over it, exactly. We&#39;re actually practicing what it is that we&#39;re preaching here.

73
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,690
So in the next segment, we&#39;re going to talk about exactly some of the things that we&#39;ve

74
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:59,510
done to take advantage of these desirable difficulties to try to help the learners in

75
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:03,729
Think101 retain the content for a much longer period of time.
