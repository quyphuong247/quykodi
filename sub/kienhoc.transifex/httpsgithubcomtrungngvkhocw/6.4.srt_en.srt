I remember back in 2005, Steve Jobs from Apple was giving a keynote address, and he was introducing

1
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,129
a new feature to iTunes called Smart Shuffle.

2
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:20,440
What&#39;s a Smart Shuffle? You know, we&#39;ve gotten a lot of people say our shuffle is not random.

3
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:26,920
Well, it really is random, but sometimes random means you&#39;ve got two songs from the same artist

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,259
next to each other. It just happens randomly sometimes. So what we&#39;ve added is Smart Shuffle

5
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:38,280
to actually make it less random, if you want. Even though people will think it&#39;s more random,

6
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,300
it&#39;s actually less random. What it is, in preferences—there it is right there—it

7
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,499
says, &quot;Smart Shuffle allows you to control how likely you are to hear multiple songs

8
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:53,109
by the same artist or from the same album in a row.&quot; So you can leave it on random or

9
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:57,460
you can say, &quot;I want it to be more likely I hear songs from the same artists in a row,

10
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:03,400
or less likely.&quot; You can tweak it however you want, and have it come out just like you&#39;d like.

11
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:08,210
Now think about what&#39;s going on here. When people are listening to music on their iPod,

12
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,990
they hear three or four songs in a row by a same artist, and so they think the random

13
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,420
function is broken. People actually wrote letters to Apple saying, &quot;Hey, your random

14
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:25,420
function is not random,&quot; and in response Apple made their random function less random so

15
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:32,210
we would perceive the non-randomness as random.

16
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:39,210
That&#39;s right. I love that example. But this idea of randomness is really old. In fact,

17
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:46,510
it goes back, I think, 65 years when people started looking at how people perceive patterns

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:59,600
and noise. As you said, people tend to think that chance randomness is a lot less lumpy than it actually is.

19
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,840
There&#39;s a really nice way to demonstrate this. What you can do is take a person, put them

20
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:11,840
in a room, and ask them to flip a coin. Their job is to sit there flip a coin—heads, write

21
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:20,190
it down; flip it again, tails write it down, and keep doing this 100 times. After those

22
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:27,670
100 coin flips, you have a sequence of heads and tails. You can then take another person,

23
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:34,860
and put them in the same situation, but this time take the coin away. Their job is to flip

24
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,850
an imaginary coin and write down whether it&#39;s heads or tails. They also do this 100 times.

25
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:46,610
They just think to themselves, &quot;Heads, write it down. Tails, write it down,&quot; and so on.

26
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:53,610
Now if you take those two sequences, those two random sequences, of 100 coin flips and

27
00:02:54,850 --> 00:03:01,180
put them side by side, you can almost instantly see which one was generated by an actual coin

28
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,280
and which one was imaginary, which one was generated by a human. The reason is that the

29
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,680
one generated by a human, our own perception of how random things ought to be, is not random

30
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:19,680
at all. In fact, there&#39;s way too many what&#39;s called alternations, so people think that

31
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:25,240
it should go heads, tails, heads, tails, heads, tails, and so on. Maybe they&#39;ll throw in an

32
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:31,790
odd double-run heads-heads, maybe a triple if they get adventurous, but it&#39;s very rare

33
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:38,790
for them to throw in four or five of these in a row because it just seems like very non-random;

34
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:47,000
whereas if you look at the actual sequence, runs of four and five are actually way more common than what people think.

35
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:52,050
Now I think the reason is—to be fair, I think the reason is people don&#39;t have much

36
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:59,050
experience with truly random sequences or things that generate random sequences, and

37
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:05,989
so what they often think is that, &quot;Okay, well, a coin coming out heads or tails—that&#39;s

38
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:12,989
50-50, whatever that means, 50-50. So it&#39;s two possibilities, 1 out of 2 is 50 percent,

39
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:18,650
and so you would expect that in the short run it should come out heads just as often

40
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:24,070
that it is tails. That&#39;s kind of true, but in fact what happens is something called the

41
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:29,220
law of averages, the law of large numbers. That happens in the long run but not in the

42
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:36,220
short run necessarily. If you flip the coin 1,000 times, or 100 times even, in the long

43
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:43,430
run, yes, it will come close to about 50-50 literally, or 500 and 500 if it&#39;s 1,000 flips,

44
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:50,550
but not in the short run. In the short run, it&#39;s really quite lumpy. You can have, as

45
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:57,550
I said, runs of five or even six in a row in the short run. People misinterpret what&#39;s

46
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,960
happening in the long run for what ought to be happening in the short run. Yes, it&#39;s really

47
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,900
quite common, and it happens way more often than we think, not just with coin flips but in other areas as well.

48
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:15,150
Yes, this misinterpretation of random events is related to something called the gambler&#39;s

49
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:22,150
fallacy. Now if I&#39;m flipping a coin and I get six heads in a row, and I ask people to

50
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:28,570
bet what the outcome of the next flip is going to be, people are far more likely to say it&#39;s

51
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:34,940
tails, right? &quot;Yes, yes, we&#39;re due for a tails because we&#39;ve had six in a row, right?&quot; But

52
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:40,169
think about how that could possibly work. What would be going on there? The coin doesn&#39;t

53
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:47,169
have a memory. There&#39;s no microchip in the coin that remembers the outcomes of before.

54
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,729
What&#39;s more, the coin has no conscience, so it can&#39;t say, &quot;Yes, we&#39;ve had six heads

55
00:05:54,729 --> 00:06:01,729
in a row. We should probably add a tails now.&quot; Each one of these flips is independent. We&#39;re

56
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:08,700
starting with a clean slate every time, so getting a heads is just as likely as getting a tails.

57
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,300
We see this in all sorts of areas. One is with the roulette wheel at the casino—so

58
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,720
picking red or black. The last casino I went to, they were even nice enough to put a digital

59
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,699
display above the roulette wheel showing all the previous outcomes, so if you saw that

60
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:30,200
there&#39;d been lots of blacks in a row, you could make an informed decision and bet on red.

61
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:37,229
There&#39;s a good example of this from way back in 1913 at the Monte Carlo Casino, where there

62
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,419
was some kerfuffle all of a sudden, and then people were running to this particular table

63
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:50,419
where 16 blacks had come up in a row, and people were feverishly trying to put a red

64
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:56,530
bet down because we were due for one, right? What happened? Seventeen, black. Eighteen,

65
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:03,530
black. Nineteen, black. Twenty, black again. It went up to 26 blacks in a row, and the

66
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:10,610
casino made millions of dollars just on those few minutes.

67
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:17,039
It happens with lottery winners as well. They&#39;ll pick numbers that have not come up for a while.

68
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,740
People at slot machines—if it hasn&#39;t paid off for a few hours of them playing, they&#39;ll

69
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:27,740
guard it; they&#39;ll shut it down so nobody else can play it. Now this, it&#39;s intuitive; it&#39;s

70
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,960
common, but it&#39;s false, and this is why they call it the gambler&#39;s fallacy.
