Okay, here's what I want you to do...

1
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,290
Imagine that you're sitting in front of an auditorium, and you're asked to perform

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:13,280
for a roomful of people by tapping out of tune for everyone to hear. The tune should

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,269
be something that you think everyone would know.

4
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:20,080
A few examples that most people would know from North America, Australia, or the UK might

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:27,080
be ‘Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star’,

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:51,000
‘Baa, Baa, Black Sheep’,

7
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,800
or ‘Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head’.

8
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,890
Now imagine that you're standing in Matt's position and that there's a hundred people

9
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,790
watching you perform in front of this auditorium. I want you to estimate how many of the 100

10
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,759
listeners would be able to name the tune that you're tapping.

11
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:30,690
Okay? So go to the next section and enter a number between 0 and 100.
