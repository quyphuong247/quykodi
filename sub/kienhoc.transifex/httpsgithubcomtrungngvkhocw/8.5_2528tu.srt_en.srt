Richard Wiseman talked about a few of the tendencies that people have who believe in

1
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,930
the paranormal, like Barnum statements, which we&#39;re going to unpack here in a second, but

2
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:21,580
I think it&#39;s important to be very clear about what we mean by these paranormal experiences

3
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:27,460
and paranormal phenomena. As Danny Kahneman said during our interview, it&#39;s very important

4
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,300
to be able to recognize these, to see them in action in order to recognize them in new situations.

5
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,370
Yes, and towards this end, you and I spent an entire day at the MindBodySpirit Festival.

6
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,140
We spoke to a few people there to get at some of the claims that are being made here and

7
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,940
to get these firsthand and see if we can try and disentangle some of the general cognitive

8
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:55,940
mechanisms that are operating when people are trying to deal with this stuff.

9
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,170
Can you tell me about what you&#39;re up to here today?

10
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:15,170
Yes. What we do is we give healing, so we&#39;re healers on a micro level and on a macro level.

11
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:22,670
The micro level represents hands-on healing, two individuals. The macro level is we send

12
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:31,920
healing out to the world, and the way we do that is by manipulating the universal life

13
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,920
force or pranic energy, which comes from the sun or conditioned by the sun, and bring that

14
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:46,430
out through the medium of prayer. We can actually store that energy into physical batteries—we

15
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:56,470
call them prayer power batteries—and quantify exactly how much energy is inside those batteries,

16
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:03,950
and then at a particular time of a natural disaster or a man-made disaster, we can discharge

17
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:11,630
those batteries through radionic apparatus, which were designed by our founder, Dr. King,

18
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,510
to trouble spots around the world—whether it be an earthquake or a tsunami and so on.

19
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:23,930
That energy through this radionic apparatus can be pinpointed to the destination. So we

20
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:30,930
drown it out. From the time those peace talks were going on—I think it was in The Hague—we

21
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:39,029
cranked up our spiritual energy as well, our spiritual radiators, worldwide. They&#39;re talking

22
00:02:39,029 --> 00:02:46,000
peace—from the point of America being about to lay eggs on &#39;em, so on and so forth.

23
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:49,739
I mean, it was very nasty at one stage.

24
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:55,409
Got you. How can you tell, though? How can you tell what the outcome was? So if you didn&#39;t

25
00:02:55,409 --> 00:03:00,760
have the prayer things on and they were talking peace, how do you know if it&#39;s the prayer

26
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,000
that&#39;s actually having the effect rather than just people wanting to be peaceful or something like that?

27
00:03:06,029 --> 00:03:09,839
Well, that&#39;s right. You can turn around and say it&#39;s all a great coincidence, but we&#39;ve

28
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:16,430
got coincidence after coincidence after coincidence. I could give you a book full of these stories

29
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:24,400
and their before and after situations. We can track. We&#39;ve stopped hurricanes coming into—

30
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,430
in their formative stages.

31
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,609
You&#39;ve stopped hurricanes?

32
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:29,400
Absolutely.

33
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,189
Wow.

34
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:34,370
Absolutely. We can show you how we&#39;ve done it. You can show the tracking of the hurricane

35
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,849
coming in over the north of Australia, about to come into Wyndham or somewhere like that.

36
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:44,989
We can say this is when the SERs [Spiritual Energy Radiators] were started. This is what

37
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:50,249
happened. It was forecast that there would be a category 5 hurricane over Derby or somewhere

38
00:03:50,249 --> 00:03:53,059
like that. And it just dissipates over the end line.

39
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:56,809
Have you ever had the opposite, though—so a cyclone comes in and you&#39;ve put the prayer

40
00:03:56,809 --> 00:03:59,609
out there, but it actually does develop into a cyclone?

41
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:03,359
Yes, but it&#39;s a less intense cyclone.

42
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:04,439
Hi there.

43
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:07,479
Tell me a little bit about what you&#39;re doing.

44
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:13,869
Well, I&#39;m doing past-life regression sessions here at the festival. They are actually 20-minute

45
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:19,930
sessions for people to have an introduction to past-life regressions. It&#39;s very interesting

46
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:25,569
work. It&#39;s like a meditation that people go into, and they&#39;re able to, through a meditative

47
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:28,580
state, access a memory of one of their past lives.

48
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,360
Can you tell me about the process? How do you elicit these memories from past lives?

49
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,360
Well, it&#39;s really something where if we ask our consciousness to do something like that,

50
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:45,139
then it will form a response. What I do is I help people to get into a very relaxed state,

51
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:49,710
and there&#39;s a very simple process—I just do it with a door, really, for them to go

52
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,330
into their past life—and by suggesting that and asking the person to do that, generally

53
00:04:54,330 --> 00:05:01,169
they find that that happens. But because I&#39;ve been doing the work for 25, 26 years, I&#39;m

54
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:07,169
very much aware of the signs and signals when that person is starting to access the past

55
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:13,479
life, so I can focus on that with them and ask questions to help bring the experience

56
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,150
out from inside of them.

57
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,039
We interviewed another woman called Elizabeth Loftus. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever heard

58
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:23,819
of her. She&#39;s a memory researcher, and she seems to be of the opinion that the research

59
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:30,590
suggests that much of our memory, even for very recent events, is quite reconstructive,

60
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:37,590
so it might not be such a—the recollections that we have might not be accurate descriptions

61
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:43,169
of what actually happened. But what you&#39;re suggesting is that we&#39;re able to access memories

62
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:47,969
that are hundreds of years old, even before we were born. Is that right?

63
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:54,479
Yes, and they do seem to be quite distinctive memories. If a person returns to that life,

64
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,800
there&#39;ll be coherence and consistency about it as well. The things which are very convincing

65
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,800
to people—like, for instance, a person today went to a past life where at some point the

66
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:16,150
animal that they loved very much and themselves died, and it was just suddenly the person

67
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,969
felt the emotion of that and they burst into tears. It was like there was so much connecting

68
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:25,909
to the experience that that&#39;s what happened. That was something which—they didn&#39;t really

69
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:33,700
have any time to construct that. It was just really a completely spontaneous memory that revealed itself.

70
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:40,700
So you take that sort of genuineness, that emotion, as good evidence that these are real memories.

71
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:47,729
Yes. Well, I&#39;m a therapist, so I work to help people through this and to make a meaningful—and

72
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:53,210
to help facilitate a meaningful process for them. What people make of this and what conclusions

73
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,099
they make of it is up to them.

74
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:58,999
So what would you say, finally, to someone who&#39;s skeptical about this, who says there&#39;s

75
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:04,550
very little evidence for past lives or retrieval of these things? What&#39;s your take?

76
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,710
Come and try it. Get in the experience and see what you think then.

77
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:11,520
Okay. Cheers! That&#39;s great.

78
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,889
Everything from lights in the sky, to where people see craft up close, give a really good

79
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:23,400
place descriptions. Sometimes they see them land. Sometimes they see occupants getting out.

80
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:29,180
Sometimes people are having what they refer to as alien abductions, which has been around

81
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:36,180
in the media for quite a while now. They&#39;re taken onboard a craft, and they have samples

82
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:43,240
taken from them, DNA samples, and been returned. Yes, it&#39;s all sorts of things, a whole plethora

83
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:50,319
of people who appear to be of extra-terrestrial origin who look very human-looking and they

84
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:56,050
were being invited onboard a craft. Then through the &#39;90s, we had the emergence of these abductions

85
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:02,400
experiences where people were meeting ETs that were about three-and-a-half to four-feet tall.

86
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,180
They had inverted pear-shaped heads, large dark eyes, didn&#39;t really communicate

87
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:14,830
much. A lot of those reports, people were quite traumatized by those experiences because

88
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,059
they really were alien-looking.

89
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:20,800
The whole thing went rotating underneath, whole lights flying over, all different colors.

90
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,389
All the while this was going on, a massive light show like I&#39;ve never seen in my life,

91
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:28,960
phenomenal. No sound. There was just no sound.

92
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,289
Really?

93
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:33,620
It&#39;s like your brain doesn&#39;t compute with that when you&#39;re looking at such a fantastic

94
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,829
light show and performance and there&#39;s no noise, it sort of confuses you.

95
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:44,820
We do get astronomers who see them, but, you know, in scientific circles, it&#39;s not the

96
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:50,060
appropriate thing to talk about these things because you lose your funding, so they tend

97
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:55,730
to keep their mouths shut. There is no real classic contact as portrayed in the media

98
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:05,200
or in various TV shows. We&#39;ve always received a wide range of descriptions of beings that people are interacting with.

99
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:12,300
Give me a wave if it gets a little strong. We&#39;ll try to keep it nice and controlled for you.

100
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:33,810
We do astrology, and we do proper astrology. I&#39;ve got proper astrology. You probably know

101
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,050
what your sun sign is?

102
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:35,050
Yes.

103
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:35,720
What is it?

104
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,010
Capricorn.

105
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,170
You&#39;re the only Capricorn that&#39;s actually smiled when I said that.

106
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:39,750
Oh, really?

107
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,250
You&#39;re a Capricorn. Yes.

108
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:41,709
Alright.

109
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:43,079
Usually it&#39;s, &quot;Capricorn.&quot;

110
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:46,699
Anyway, when you&#39;re looking at a birth chart, somebody&#39;s chart, you&#39;re looking to see where

111
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:51,220
all the planets are when they&#39;re born because you have a moment in time that&#39;s specifically

112
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,630
yours—time and place. That&#39;s based on your date—time and place.

113
00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:00,339
We take a snapshot of the sky at the moment of your birth and from the place of birth.

114
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:04,529
Then we say, &quot;Well, where are the planets? What do they mean? What kind of angles do

115
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:07,730
they make? Are they all bunched together? What sign is the moon in? The moon tells us...&quot;

116
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,649
I mean, you know your sun sign&#39;s Capricorn, but your moon sign, which is your emotional

117
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:16,820
side—it&#39;s what you need in life—can be very different. So you might meet a Capricorn

118
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:21,670
that needs a lot of sensitivity, and another Capricorn that doesn&#39;t. So depending on the

119
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:27,120
time, the date, the place, that combination of planets says why you, Jason, are different

120
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,259
from all other Capricorns. You&#39;ve got your moment in time.

121
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:34,680
What we do here is we then take basically your one of these, which doesn&#39;t mean much

122
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,959
to most people, analyze it, and we print a booklet like this but specifically about you.

123
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:47,110
An astrologer is an expert at pattern recognition because I&#39;m looking for patterns in here.

124
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:51,660
So you look at that kind of pattern. You look at what sign something is in. So you&#39;re looking

125
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:57,009
at the sign, the house, which is part of the sky, and are there any angles with it.

126
00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:04,009
We do kinesiology. Kinesiology is a modality that works with responses from the muscles.

127
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:14,259
Dr. Anna Rolfes, MD, PhD, did a thesis on the phenomena of accurate indicator muscle,

128
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:21,670
which, through clinical trials, show the validity of unconscious responses from somatic muscles.

129
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:28,670
Once you muscle monitor and tap into that level of muscle response, you start to actually

130
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,920
access this thing, which broadly call the innate awareness. This innate awareness can

131
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,920
give you very, very specific and diverse information in relation to the causes of stress in a person&#39;s

132
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:48,430
life. That stress can be, as I&#39;ve said, very diverse, relating to structural alignment,

133
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:54,740
relating to physiological function, in relation to triggers behind emotional trauma that aren&#39;t

134
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:59,250
even remembered, and in relation to a lot of bizarre, esoteric, and metaphysical stuff as well.

135
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,949
Can you tell us a little bit about what you do here?

136
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:08,040
Sure, posture health. We&#39;re doing spinal screenings to assess whether some of the people coming

137
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,220
through the festival are nice and straight, nice and strong; assessing whether they might

138
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,700
have any symptoms associated with their spine and then maybe offering them some suggestions afterwards.

139
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:18,389
Cool. How does it work?

140
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:22,420
Well, basically we use the SAM machine. The SAM machine is a very simple analog machine

141
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,009
which gives us balance, and we use the measurements to determine what type or shape you&#39;ve got

142
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:31,880
going on. From there, we can determine whether there are any weak points in the spine and

143
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,440
then offer you some solutions after that.

144
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,470
Now if there&#39;s a breakdown in communication because of subluxation, for example, the signals

145
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:43,660
aren&#39;t getting through to the body, and, before you know it, you end up with symptoms. Of

146
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,089
course most people go to their medical doctor to say, &quot;I have a symptom,&quot; and the medical

147
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:50,500
doctor goes, &quot;Well, I&#39;m trained in medicine, so here&#39;s some medicine to fix that.&quot; It&#39;s

148
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,800
not always appropriate. A chiropractor can get the joint free, allow the nerve to do

149
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,690
its job. Your body is an amazing piece of engineering, and it can heal anything given

150
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:04,980
the right conditions. In 21st century society, we don&#39;t live in the correct conditions, so

151
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,339
we pay a service mechanic to keep us straight and level and balanced.

152
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:13,290
So when you say anything, I mean—so cancer? Do we have...

153
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:17,190
Yes. The body can heal anything given the right conditions—anything from the common

154
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,500
cold through to full-blown cancer. We&#39;ve just got to give it every opportunity to do that.

155
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:28,500
What would you say to people that are skeptical of alignment, of health interactions with

156
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,130
spine issues?

157
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:37,130
Yes. I like skepticism because it makes people think. When people think, they take responsibility

158
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:43,449
for their own health. There is no recorded evidence of a chiropractor causing damage.

159
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:49,000
In fact, doctors of chiropractic are trying to heal you. And they do that specifically with the spine.

160
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:53,040
Your medical doctor also wants to make you well as well, but he&#39;s trained in a different

161
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,209
area. As are surgeons—surgeons are trained with knives and scalpels. That&#39;s the area

162
00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:00,190
that they specialize in. Everybody has a specialty.

163
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,480
Yes, there are skeptics out there. I&#39;m okay with that. At the end of the day, chiropractors

164
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,310
do what they do because they have a love of humans and they want to try and help them.

165
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:13,160
You just have to choose which of the sciences that you want to use to do that.

166
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,769
Can you tell me a little bit about what you&#39;re doing here today?

167
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:22,769
It&#39;s a practice from Japan. It hasn&#39;t been in Australia for very long—about 20 years

168
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,440
in Australia. We&#39;re what is called an ohikari, which is a parchment with calligraphy in it

169
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:35,800
that the founder obtained. It was his way of being able to give people a really strong healing.

170
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:42,800
I&#39;m just a vessel. I&#39;m not doing anything. We don&#39;t diagnose. We don&#39;t ask necessarily

171
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:49,420
about a person&#39;s condition. The light goes where it needs to go. The light comes through

172
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:54,620
me, and it is directed to the person through their forehead and the top of their head.

173
00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:00,129
They&#39;re the two main points that have been effective to receive the light, and it goes

174
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:06,480
to where that each individual person needs it. You might have a certain sickness going

175
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,500
on, but I&#39;m not going to direct it to that part of your body. It would just go naturally go there.

176
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,379
Okay. So where does light come from?

177
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:20,379
It&#39;s coming from the higher source, whether you want to call it the universe, god, whatever

178
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:23,649
label you want to put on it, but it&#39;s all coming from the same source.

179
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:27,839
Now there were several very specific claims that were being made at the MindBodySpirit

180
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:34,180
Festival. We spoke to lots of people about prayer batteries, healing, memories from past

181
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:41,180
lives, kinesiology, UFOs. There seem to be several general cognitive mechanisms that

182
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:47,300
were operating here throughout our conversations, and we&#39;re going to try and disentangle those in the next section.
