We have a long history in Psychology of people influencing the behavior of others without

1
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:18,480
being aware of it. There&#39;s a study by Rosenthal and Jacobson back in 1968, called the Pygmalion

2
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:29,500
Effect. Pygmalion in the Classroom was the name of the study, and it&#39;s named after the George Bernard Shaw play.

3
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:34,290
What they did was they brought an experimenter into a classroom, in an elementary school

4
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,800
classroom, and they went through, and wrote down a bunch of stuff and gave the kids a

5
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:46,730
bunch of tests. Then he came back to the teacher and said, &quot;Little Jimmy and Jane and Ralphie,&quot;

6
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,609
and so on—they picked a little bunch of kids, and said, &quot;They are due for an intellectual

7
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:56,690
growth spurt.&quot; The idea was these kids were about to blossom. They&#39;re about to have this

8
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,280
big—like a physical growth spurt, only intellectual.

9
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,280
Then they came back at the end of the year, and they tested all the kids again. Lo and

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,390
behold, these kids that they said were due for an intellectual growth spurt in fact had

11
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,780
advanced significantly more than the rest of the kids in the class.

12
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:22,110
The hitch is they just pull those names out of a hat. They have no way of predicting intellectual

13
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,060
growth spurts or anything like that. They just made it all up. What happened? Well,

14
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:32,659
the argument was that the teachers, although they claimed not to be, were treating these

15
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:37,469
kids differently. If you know little Jimmy is ready for intellectual growth spurt and

16
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:40,469
he&#39;s not quite getting something, well, you spend a little bit of extra time because you

17
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:44,770
have these higher expectations of them. We know if you have higher expectations of kids,

18
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:49,430
they&#39;re going to live up to them, or at least they&#39;re going to attempt to live up to them.

19
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:56,430
A little bit higher expectations get a little bit higher results, a little bit higher performance.

20
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:58,750
That&#39;s what happened.

21
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:04,340
That&#39;s an Experimenter Expectancy Effect. The experimenters were expecting this outcome.

22
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:11,900
In this case, the experimenters are the teachers in the classroom, and it&#39;s their expectations that the kids are living up to.

23
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:18,599
Sounds very similar to the Clever Hans Effect. I can&#39;t remember the details exactly, but

24
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:25,599
it&#39;s something about a horse being able to read the signals provided by the trainer.

25
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:27,550
You know that example?

26
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:34,550
Yes. Back in the late 1800s, so the turn of the previous century, a guy named Wilhelm

27
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,989
von Osten—he was a retired schoolteacher. He thought the so-called dumb animals, as

28
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:43,019
they were called at that time, were getting short-shrifted. They were a lot smarter than

29
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:47,129
people thought they were. He trained this horse to do all kinds of amazing things. The

30
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:53,250
horse could tell you what time it was. He could do arithmetic. He could convert fractions

31
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,739
to decimals, and decimals to fractions. You could ask him questions like, &quot;If it&#39;s 25

32
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:05,409
to 8, where is the little hand on the clock? What numbers is it in between,&quot; and so on.

33
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:11,860
They had these big commissions of inquiry who came to check out Hans and make sure that

34
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,239
that there wasn&#39;t some fraud going on and so on. He passed all the tests.

35
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,580
How does the horse respond in this case?

36
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:24,860
Well, actually, a psychologist named Oskar Pfungst came along and figured out what was

37
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,830
going on in this case. I mean, Hans was very clever, but he couldn&#39;t talk. He wasn&#39;t Mister

38
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:35,830
Ed. What he would do is he would just tap his foot to answer a question. What Oskar

39
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:43,140
Pfungst established was that Hans could answer the questions if anybody in the audience knew

40
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:52,400
what the answer was. Von Osten didn&#39;t need to be there, but someone had to know the answer to the question.

41
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,459
The way he tested this is he would ask one person to whisper a number in Hans&#39; ear, another

42
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:03,239
person to whisper a number in the other ear, say, three and two, and then he would ask,

43
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:10,239
&quot;Hans, add those two numbers. What&#39;s the sum of those two numbers?&quot; Hans would go...and

44
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,730
just keep going because no one was telling him when to stop. Someone always told him

45
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:23,820
when to stop, and the way they did that—Hans was very clever. Not in the way that people

46
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,860
thought, but he very tuned to very subtle movements of people. As Hans started to approach

47
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:35,410
the right answer, people would just lean forward a little bit in anticipation of that answer.

48
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:42,410
If he&#39;s going to five, you know that the answer is five, you go, &quot;One, two, three, four—is

49
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:49,700
he going to make it there—five.&quot; Not nearly as big, there were very subtle movements,

50
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,450
but that&#39;s what Hans was picking up on. Once Pfungst figured this out, he&#39;d get Hans to

51
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:59,380
give whatever answer he wanted simply by making these movements deliberately. Hans was picking

52
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,950
up on these subtle cues from the people around him, none of them knew they were doing this.

53
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:10,950
There&#39;s no reason to believe that von Osten, who is the guy who had trained Hans, knew

54
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:19,190
that he was cuing Hans the answers. He had a point to make, sure, but he wasn&#39;t a fraud.

55
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,780
He wasn&#39;t making money off this. He just thought Hans was as clever as he was and didn&#39;t realize

56
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,590
that he was doing the actual cuing himself or other people in the audience were doing

57
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,380
the cuing when von Osten wasn&#39;t there—because they&#39;d often test without von Osten being

58
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:41,430
there. As you would think, maybe he&#39;s up to something fishy, take him out of the room,

59
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,280
and test Hans. Hans&#39; work just fine, as long as somebody knows the answer because they&#39;d

60
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,690
give those subtle little cues as to where he should be going.

61
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:55,710
If you think about Facilitated Communication, you got someone holding on to your sleeve,

62
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:02,710
or holding on to your arm, helping you reach out, and point and touch the keyboard—very

63
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:11,460
easy for that person, without meaning to, to be guiding your hand in a particular direction.

64
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:20,130
The client is simply passing on the movements that have been started by the facilitator.

65
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,940
That&#39;s how you get the information from the facilitator out through the client.

66
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:35,400
Do you have any other advice for the people who are taking the course on how to improve their everyday thinking?

67
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:42,410
I think, at least part of the answer is a healthy skepticism. The rallying cry of the

68
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:51,680
cynic is, &quot;Bullshit. I just don&#39;t believe anything.&quot; That&#39;s not what I&#39;m suggesting.

69
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,910
What I&#39;m suggesting is being skeptical, &quot;Let&#39;s see some proof. I want to see some evidence.&quot;

70
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,930
Particularly when we see these kinds of claims, &quot;Where&#39;s the evidence? How can we know this

71
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:08,930
for sure?&quot; I think part of being skeptical is keeping an open mind but demanding evidence

72
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:22,000
and not jumping to conclusions, not making up your mind too early that this is a wonderful thing or it&#39;s completely bogus.

73
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:26,560
My name is Scott. I think about evidence.
