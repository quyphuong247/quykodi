In each of the episodes we tackled a different topic, ranging from illusions, rationality,

1
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,280
learning to learn, up to the scientific method, testing claims, and exploiting the situation

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,570
in order to predict and shape human behavior.

3
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:24,570
Pick a few areas, and pick a few things, where you want to change what you&#39;re doing, and

4
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:31,000
focus on those. Do not expect that you can generally increase the quality of your thinking,

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,300
because I think you really cannot.

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,019
The message is—when we&#39;re doing one of the tasks that we know that people have difficulty

7
00:00:39,019 --> 00:00:45,839
with or are subject to particular biases—just take a little time. Reconsider it.

8
00:00:45,839 --> 00:00:50,699
It&#39;s really tempting, when you&#39;re reading a newspaper or a webpage, to just kind of

9
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:55,609
sit back and keep score of who&#39;s right and who&#39;s wrong, but it&#39;s rarely that simple.
