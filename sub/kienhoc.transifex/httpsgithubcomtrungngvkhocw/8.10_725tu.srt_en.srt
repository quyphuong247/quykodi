Alright guys, when you go each of the discussion forums on the edX platform, it&#39;s more of a

1
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:21,619
diary entry for most people. So when you go on them, you can see right at the bottom that

2
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:28,619
there&#39;s 463 pages, which isn&#39;t great. So each person responds with their own little thing,

3
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,800
&quot;how memory works,&quot; and then it just goes off into the ether and nobody ever reads it again.

4
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,830
We can kill two birds with one stone in solving this, and I think the best to do this is to

5
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:45,150
use you to have more responsibility in these discussion forums. So what we&#39;re gonna do

6
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:52,040
is make you, what&#39;s called a &quot;Community TA,&quot; if you wish to do this, it&#39;s completely voluntary.

7
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:57,780
Then when you post, you&#39;ll that little green stripe, and it will say &quot;Community TA.&quot; The

8
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,720
other thing that it gives you, when you&#39;re looking through each of these posts, and it

9
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,689
seems like the person who posted that thing &quot;gets it,&quot; you click that little &quot;endorse&quot;

10
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:13,400
button. It turns blue, and then it flags it as being endorsed by a Community TA.

11
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,170
There&#39;s another feature that we&#39;re going to be introducing. You see at the top there&#39;s

12
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:25,170
the Wiki, Progress, Guests, and on Wednesday there&#39;s going to appear &quot;Think101 Community&quot;

13
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:31,250
that edX has done for us specifically because we have so much activity in our course. This,

14
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:36,100
when you click on it... so it says &quot;Follow Think101 Social Updates,&quot; and so it&#39;s really

15
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:43,100
just kind of amalgamating everyone&#39;s Twitter feed as well as the facebook page updates.

16
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,470
The first thing I want you to do is spend two minutes, get a piece of paper and a pen,

17
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:53,770
and give me an example of regression towards the mean [sic]. Write it down and then I&#39;ll

18
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,870
get you to share it with each other in your groups.

19
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:01,510
It&#39;s sort of like a pendulum swing. One day someone might be doing excessively well on

20
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:05,530
something, and then they come back towards the middle, and people are assuming that this

21
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,159
high note is where they&#39;re going to stay when actually this is where they really belong.

22
00:02:10,158 --> 00:02:14,440
I had a real general one just for everyday life is happiness, like there will be some

23
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,260
days where you can just feel on top of the world, exceptionally happy, like everything&#39;s

24
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:25,400
going your way. The day after you might not feel as elated. Nobody can be exceptionally happy all of the time.

25
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,989
I play tennis, and some days I go and play, and I play really well and other times I go

26
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:35,329
and play and a four year old can beat me. I just do really badly. I suppose it&#39;s too

27
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:37,279
many independent error factors in there.

28
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:38,950
Aw - beautiful. Love that language!

29
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,169
Well the definition of a sacred cow. It&#39;s an idiom, and it is something that&#39;s considered

30
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:49,200
immune from question or criticism. This is something that you truly believe, but nobody

31
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,200
can touch. Now I need you to spend 30 seconds thinking about what your sacred cow is.

32
00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:03,120
Jason thinks that you need to brush your teeth with warm water. Like, &quot;what? why?&quot; Germs

33
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,930
or something? Yeah - think of the energy, the water...

34
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:15,300
Swimming with dolphins is safe. So dolphins keep the sharks away. That&#39;s Rachel&#39;s. Have you looked into that?

35
00:03:15,309 --> 00:03:16,730
No.

36
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,840
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.

37
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,299
You gotta lock your door! Are robbers coming to the door, and checking it, and then leaving?

38
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:25,409
Is that what&#39;s happening?

39
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:28,239
That was fun. Okay. Do your quiz.

40
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,249
Why do people decide to live on the coast or in areas where you&#39;re more likely to get

41
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:40,430
hit by natural disasters, but they still want to live there? Like how all Australians live

42
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:45,230
on the coast, but they just got hit by a big cyclone up north.

43
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,849
I&#39;m super excited about mine.

44
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:47,219
Cool!

45
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:53,569
So my question is: why is monogamy the dominant/normal relationship structure? Why do people just

46
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:58,809
assume that it&#39;s the best and think that they can&#39;t do anything else, without trying it?

47
00:03:58,809 --> 00:04:02,760
I think that it&#39;s really... like people aren&#39;t really aware of what&#39;s going on in the world,

48
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,669
but they just don&#39;t want to admit it. And until something actually truly happens that&#39;s

49
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:10,700
going to devastate their lives, they&#39;re not going to try to attempt to do anything to change it.
