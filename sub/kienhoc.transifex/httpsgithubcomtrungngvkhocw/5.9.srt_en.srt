What we&#39;re going to do today is we&#39;re going to start by having a discussion.

1
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,500
And what we&#39;re going to do is discuss the difference between two positions

2
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,410
when thinking about this stuff.

3
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,600
The first is &quot;ignorance is bliss.&quot;

4
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,270
So this is kind of thinking like thinking about it in a System 1 approach.

5
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:38,399
You can also think about it in terms of various heuristics and biases that people have.

6
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,289
On the other hand, we have the opposite position &quot;the unexamined life is not worth living&quot;.

7
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:48,600
So System 2 thinking: Being critical, thinking carefully about things.

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,170
And we&#39;re going to want you to kind of examine both, carefully, and we&#39;ll talk about those

9
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,700
in our small groups before we move on.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If you are exposed to bad things in life, or you are examining different parts of life,

11
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,100
not just your own, sort of, trivial little world,

12
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,500
it makes good things that happen to you even better.

13
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:14,000
That brings us, kind of, a shallow happiness, but if we overcome or do something about it,

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,600
then it&#39;s better because it has more depth.

15
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,480
I mean, they are little things, but we could be wrong about the choices that we make.

16
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,470
So it&#39;s like we could go through life fairly easily, but we could make better decisions.

17
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,300
I totally agree with Danny Kahneman in regards to just picking a few things

18
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,080
to be really quite good at.

19
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,120
How many of you believe that &quot;ignorance is bliss&quot;?

20
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:41,300
Keep your hands up, and we&#39;re going to ask you to move to this side of the room.

21
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,470
Alright, the rest of the people, go to this side please.

22
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,200
Things exist, you know, there is evil in the world, there is good in the world.

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,730
They exist whether we like it or not.

24
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:56,770
How can you not want to know what is there, and what can go wrong and what can&#39;t go

25
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,050
wrong, and what is possible and what is impossible?

26
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:03,680
Not knowing and being happy is better than knowing and not.

27
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,239
Knowing what we know about representativeness and availability heuristics, and all these

28
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,300
other things in System 1, that&#39;s where racism and sexism and all these other sorts of

29
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,180
stereotypes we create are made.

30
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:22,439
System 2 thinking seems to be the only thing that can challenge that, where you can actually

31
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:26,620
think about things on a deeper level and affect change.

32
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,329
People, I think we like to think that we&#39;re more analytical and deeper than perhaps we are.

33
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:36,249
And you might really believe something, but what information are you relying on?

34
00:02:36,249 --> 00:02:40,800
So, how do we know that the information that we&#39;re using is necessarily true, or,

35
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,590
you know, evidence of one side?

36
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,650
Alright guys, now what we&#39;re going to do is, everyone on this side stand up,

37
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,120
everyone on that side stand up, and swap places.

38
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,900
Are you happy knowing that someone can change the answer you&#39;re about to give by

39
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,209
giving you a different anchor?

40
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:04,329
Acquiring of the knowledge would make me quite unhappy, so I&#39;d be happier just not knowing

41
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:10,329
that these anchors existâ€”just being blissful. I don&#39;t know that people are manipulating

42
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:15,069
me or I don&#39;t know that people are trying to push me in X or Y direction.

43
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:21,680
The video that we saw in Episode 4, Daniel Kahneman even said that this course is going

44
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,680
to do nothing for us. I was quite satisfied with my life before knowing about the process.

45
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,950
If we only listen to System 1, we make wrong decisions. We make quick decisions that

46
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,799
aren&#39;t necessarily correct problem solving decisions.

47
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:43,969
Danny Kahneman is one of the biggest victims for System 1 because his thinking that

48
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:46,100
this course can&#39;t improve your thinking, he might be

49
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:52,900
totally missing out on improving his thinking, and that entire school of thought, just because he&#39;s choosing to be ignorant of

50
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,700
other people&#39;s divergent thinking.

51
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,200
I just think it&#39;s really important to know what&#39;s going on in our heads,

52
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
even if we can&#39;t control it.
