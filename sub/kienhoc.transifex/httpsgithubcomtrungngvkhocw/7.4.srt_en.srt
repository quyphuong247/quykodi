Now most people are going to appreciate that Jane and Billy in this case are going to perform

1
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:17,590
on average on day two. Now what do we mean by that? Again, 100 people who took the exam

2
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:23,220
in the first place—most of them are going to perform, by guessing alone, at 50 percent.

3
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,820
Jane and Billy had a lump in their performance at 65 percent and 35 percent. The next time

4
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,629
around, they&#39;re going to behave like the rest of the class at 50 percent. So the correct

5
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:38,960
response would have been 50 percent, which is the average. Remember, they&#39;re regressing

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,550
back to that mean, back to the average.

7
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,479
Best predictor will be 50 percent.

8
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:48,440
That&#39;s right. The best predictor would be 50 percent. Now I think it&#39;s really important

9
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:55,159
to consider this idea of regression to the mean when it comes to not just a toy example

10
00:00:55,159 --> 00:01:03,900
like this when we&#39;re dealing with random responses to a multiple-choice test, but taking it outside into everyday life.

11
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:10,999
Imagine then that you are feeling really terrible. You walk into a clinic because you&#39;re just

12
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:16,680
feeling bad. You have all sorts of symptoms. You have a sore throat. You have runny nose.

13
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,659
You haven&#39;t had any sleep. Everything—the world just seems to be against you. You walk

14
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:26,920
into a clinic, and somebody hands you a vial of water. There&#39;s not a single drop of medicine

15
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:33,920
in this thing. As a result, as a result of taking this vial over a period of a few days,

16
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:41,340
maybe you start to improve. You feel like, &quot;Hey, I feel fantastic. My runny nose is going away.&quot;

17
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:48,390
But it not might be causal. It might just be the regression to the mean. They might

18
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:55,390
just have—their bad luck has run out, in a sense. Their symptoms have gone away as

19
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,219
a result of the random lumpiness that we just talked about in the last episode.

20
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:08,509
So just like Jane who performed better the next time around—so she was at 35 percent;

21
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:13,480
now she&#39;s at 50 percent—you have the person who walked into a clinic at day one;

22
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:22,900
they took a vial of water; and on day two, you test them again, and they improved, just by statistical chance alone.

23
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,440
This is really common. This happens all of the time. If that happened to you, if that

24
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:33,220
happened to me, I&#39;d be very tempted to attribute that experience to that, whatever happened

25
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:38,020
in the interim, to that vial of water and feel like it has healing properties when it&#39;s

26
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,870
just water. It&#39;s completely neutral.

27
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,420
Well, let&#39;s take this and move it back to the previous example. So we have 100 people

28
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,210
taking a true-or-false exam. The 100 people can&#39;t speak a word of English and, again,

29
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:56,170
they take this exam. Now, on average, we expect people to perform at 50 percent, but, again,

30
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,790
Jane performs poorly on this exam and Billy performs well.

31
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:06,640
Now before we separate Jane and Billy and we go on to the testing on day two, let&#39;s

32
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,740
do some interventions. Let&#39;s give them a vial of water, or let&#39;s give them some brain training,

33
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:22,600
or ask them to close their eyes and to hop on one foot. Now we go to day two, and then they take the exam again.

34
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,360
What do we expect? We expect Jane to regress towards the mean and do a little bit better

35
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,970
on the exam, and we expect Billy, the second time, to drop back to regress towards the

36
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,250
mean and do a little bit worse. Now, exactly like you said, if that happened to me, if

37
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:42,890
I was Jane or Billy, I would attribute the change in their performance to the thing that

38
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:49,830
I introduced. I imagine that Jane would think, &quot;Wow, brain training is amazing. It improved

39
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:55,560
my performance out of sight from last time.&quot; Billy is going to think that vial of water

40
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:02,560
is cursed, &quot;It made me do worse.&quot; Formally, it&#39;s called post hoc ergo propter hoc: after

41
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:13,100
this, therefore because of this. We attribute that intervention, that thing in time, to the outcome.

42
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:19,190
That&#39;s right. I think it&#39;s really important as one of the goals of this course. Most people

43
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:26,190
who are taking this course might be quite willing just to dismiss people who fall into

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
these tendencies as just being silly or stupid, but that&#39;s not enough. I mean, if we can figure

45
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:40,470
out why people tend to believe these things, I think we&#39;re getting a lot further in figuring

46
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,990
out when they&#39;re operating and what we can do about them in that particular case.

47
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,530
So just to make that concrete, let&#39;s ask people at home just to answer a few more questions

48
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,320
about regression to the mean before we move on.
