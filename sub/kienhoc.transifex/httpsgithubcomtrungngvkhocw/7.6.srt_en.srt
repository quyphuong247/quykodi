The first of the six leads is for people to ask themselves: what do you really believe anyway?

1
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:16,430
It&#39;s really tempting to think that things are either for you or against you. They&#39;re

2
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,600
either good or they&#39;re bad. They&#39;re black and white. Tim Minchin has a really nice example of this.

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:27,470
&quot;The Fence&quot; is the name of the song, and picturing the world as either black or white,

4
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:32,300
for me or against me, instead of having shades of gray in between. The same thing happens with opinion change.

5
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:38,040
That&#39;s right. If an observation is surprising enough, it allows you to think about, to understand

6
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,860
what you really believe. What&#39;s really important to you? Now this is actually what a lot of

7
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,770
university courses are trying to achieve.

8
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:53,420
The second of the six leads is: how well based is the opinion that you already hold?

9
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,450
Now sometimes support for an opinion can&#39;t always be based on formal data or experiments.

10
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:05,100
The data may just not be available, so personal experience might be the only thing we have to go on.

11
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:11,240
That&#39;s exactly right. We obviously are looking through the lens of this personal experience

12
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:18,109
that has been heavily shaped by your interpretation, as we&#39;ve just seen throughout the episode.

13
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:22,170
The way that we see the world may not be the same way that other people see the world,

14
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,329
and so that personal experience might be somehow tainted in a particular way.

15
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:35,329
That leads us to the third lead, which is: how good is the evidence? Is it based on experiments?

16
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:41,529
Is it based on that personal experience? How good are the data? How good is that evidence?

17
00:01:41,529 --> 00:01:46,369
What most people do when they&#39;re faced with surprising evidence, like the large class-small

18
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:53,800
class, is they have this new evidence, and then they just disregard it. They just ignore it from that point on.

19
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:59,539
Or look for flaws in the evidence or the data. But, even if you do find a flaw, you have

20
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:06,539
to ask yourself: is that flaw so terrible that you can legitimately disregard this new

21
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:11,300
piece of evidence that you&#39;ve been given? Is the data so bad that you can just ignore it?

22
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:16,010
Like in the large class-small class example, are the experiments that have been done just

23
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,040
so terrible that you can ignore them and continue to believe what you believe?

24
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,500
That leads us to the fourth lead in opinion change, which is: does the evidence really

25
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:32,870
contradict what you already believe? Is there a way of reframing the issue, of stating the

26
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:38,280
evidence in a way that allows you to use this new information, this new evidence, rather

27
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,410
than just rejecting it outright?

28
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,280
Absolutely. Given the problem that&#39;s in front of you, given the evidence that somebody&#39;s

29
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:51,010
presented, if that&#39;s not enough for you to change your mind, change your opinion, then

30
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:56,650
what would be enough? If I&#39;ve just presented evidence or if I&#39;ve just received evidence

31
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:03,650
that&#39;s somehow flawed or somehow insufficient, you need to ask yourself: if that&#39;s not enough,

32
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,640
what would be enough?

33
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,480
Yes, and you need toâ€”if you can&#39;t find any evidence, if you can&#39;t think of something

34
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,000
that would change your mind, then it&#39;s really time to be cautious there about the basis of that belief.

35
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:20,980
Now that leads us to the sixth lead in opinion change, which is: is it worth finding out

36
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:27,980
about, or is just a case of why not? Why don&#39;t I just continue to believe this stuff? What&#39;s

37
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,150
the cost? Can I just persist in this belief? For example, &quot;Should I just take the pill?

38
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:39,250
It doesn&#39;t cost much, and it doesn&#39;t taste bad, so why not stick with it?&quot;

39
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,010
That&#39;s right. Going back to Jane&#39;s case, if she just took the vial of water and she felt

40
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,830
better, it&#39;s water, right? It was cheap. It didn&#39;t taste bad. She took it, she got better.

41
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:54,780
So why just not persist in that belief? That one&#39;s tricky. I mean, yes, but, we need a

42
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:01,550
caveat on that sixth lead where people can really use that one almost as a get-out-of-jail-free

43
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:06,670
card and just say, &quot;Well, the cost is low, and therefore it really doesn&#39;t require me

44
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:13,670
to figure out what I actually believe about it.&quot; So I&#39;d be cautious with that one, but,

45
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:20,900
yes, if the cost is extremely low and the payoff is high, yes, why not? Just go with it.

46
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:25,990
These six leads are going to become extremely important. Now we&#39;re dealing with benign examples

47
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:32,580
at the moment, but we&#39;re going to be moving into things like ESP, paranormal belief, applied

48
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:38,490
claims, health claims, where these issues, these opinions that people have might not

49
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:45,069
be so easily dismissible. I think having these six leads is going to be really useful when

50
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:49,400
people start examining their own opinions, and examining the opinions of other people.

51
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:56,029
If you want to change someone else&#39;s mind or their own mind, then it&#39;s really worth

52
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,439
considering these and keeping these in their toolbox.

53
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:05,669
I&#39;ve asked the MythBusters exactly about this issue of opinion change, both the opinions

54
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:12,180
that they hold or the myths that they test, as well as other people&#39;s, the viewer&#39;s opinions

55
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,710
that they have. Here&#39;s what they had to say.
