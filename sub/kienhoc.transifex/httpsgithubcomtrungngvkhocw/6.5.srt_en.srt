One of my favorite stories about experimentation is one called &quot;The Lady Tasting Tea.&quot; Now

1
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:17,110
this is set in Cambridge, England, at Cambridge University, in the 1920s. It was a bunch of

2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:25,100
university dons, their wives and guests, sitting around the table, on a sunny afternoon at

3
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,900
Cambridge University. They were all sitting around, having high tea. The waiter comes

4
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:38,900
around and he&#39;s pouring tea, and one of the women at the table says, &quot;Could you stop there?

5
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:46,559
I want to add the milk to my tea, instead of having the tea added to my milk.&quot; Everyone

6
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:53,559
kind of looked around the table and thought, &quot;That&#39;s an odd request.&quot; Someone asks, &quot;Can

7
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,260
you tell the difference between milk added to your tea and tea added to your milk?&quot; She

8
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:04,739
said, &quot;Of course. Of course I can tell the difference.&quot; Everyone kind of looking at her

9
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:11,180
skeptically, and one of the men at the table, Ronald Fisher—Sir Ronald Fisher later on—he&#39;s

10
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:16,100
a short, skinny little man with glasses and a pointy beard—stood up and he says, &quot;Well,

11
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:25,200
let&#39;s test this proposition.&quot; He decided to design an experiment, design a test of this woman&#39;s claim.

12
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:31,180
Now what we want people to do is to go into the next section and figure out what they

13
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,430
would do in this sort of—if they were to put themselves in Ronald Fisher&#39;s position,

14
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,490
and they were at tea on a sunny afternoon, and someone made this claim, what would it

15
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,750
take to convince them that someone had this capability to tell the difference between

16
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:53,790
tea with milk added to it or milk with tea added to it, and what would they do to test

17
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:01,200
this claim? How much evidence would it take to convince them that they could in fact do this sort of thing?
