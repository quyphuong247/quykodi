Can you tell me a little bit about channel factors?

1
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:14,519
Well, this is an idea that&#39;s very old in social psychology. You might be interested to know—

2
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,460
I don&#39;t think most social psychologists know this—the field of experimental social psychology

3
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:26,460
was founded by a physicist. That has everything to do with the fact that social psychologists

4
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:33,760
are the ones who are telling us what the situations are that people confront that are going to

5
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,629
have an impact on them. His notion was the field, the social psychologist&#39;s focus on

6
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,510
the field—and that comes from field theory in Physics. I mean, you need to know what&#39;s

7
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:51,510
going on in the whole field in order to understand how to explain behavior.

8
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:58,039
He had a notion that sometimes when we want someone to do something or want some kind

9
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:04,739
of outcome, we would just push. He says, &quot;Look, there may be a channel there through which

10
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,620
you can achieve what you&#39;re trying to achieve. Think about what situational barriers you

11
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:16,620
might remove. Think about how you can give the person a plan that would help them to

12
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,170
go in the direction you want them to go.&quot;

13
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,640
One of the channel factors that I find interesting is this idea of organ donation. It&#39;s such

14
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:32,640
a simple, tiny manipulation of—seemingly tiny manipulation of opting in or opting out

15
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,300
of organ donation. Is that—do you know the details or...

16
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:44,030
Well, I know as much about it as most social psychologists who&#39;ve read the study and taught

17
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:51,030
about it. For many of us, it&#39;s a very powerful demonstration of what Kurt Lewin calls a channel

18
00:01:53,480 --> 00:02:04,800
factor. That is, something that made it a little easier to act in accord with your preferences or with your values.

19
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:11,050
I think there was many, many interesting features in that, but the starting point is just that

20
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:16,920
this was a case of what we might call a natural experiment. It wasn&#39;t a study in which someone

21
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:23,920
manipulated this, although people have followed up on it, including me and my colleagues.

22
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:31,850
The finding, as I think most people in psychology are aware now, is that if you looked at European

23
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:40,470
countries, some of those countries have the policy where you had to sign the back of your

24
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:46,440
driver&#39;s license to make you a potential organ donor. In other places, you had to sign if

25
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:53,440
you didn&#39;t want to be a potential organ donor. The phenomena was incredibly dramatic. I mean,

26
00:02:53,590 --> 00:03:00,590
you found countries as similar as Austria and Germany, or Norway and Sweden, having

27
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:09,950
tremendously different rates, under 10 percent of people in some cases, and over 95 in others.

28
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:15,340
Very, very dramatic. It&#39;s tempting. A lot of people look at that and say, &quot;Well, these

29
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,950
people are lazy,&quot; but it was subtler than that.

30
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:26,260
There&#39;s a stunning experiment. It was a very old experiment done with Yale college students.

31
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:33,260
There was a social psychologist who was scaring the daylights out of these undergraduates

32
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:44,240
about tetanus. He shows some people in extremes, locked jaw and the terrible kinds of things

33
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,819
that could go on. He says, &quot;Look, it&#39;s not just the rusty nail you&#39;ve heard about. I

34
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:54,819
mean, it&#39;s all over. I mean, you don&#39;t recognize how susceptible you are. But not to worry

35
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,690
because you can go to the Health Service, which will be available on Tuesday morning,

36
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:06,690
and you can get an inoculation.&quot; Three percent of students go and get their inoculations.

37
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,880
Even though they&#39;re manifestly scared, and they believed it. The other students, he gives

38
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:18,660
them a map and the Health Service is circled on it.

39
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,430
Now these are, by the way, Yale seniors; they know where the Health Service is. But he circles

40
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:29,200
it on the map anyway and says, &quot;When will be a convenient time on Tuesday morning for you to get an inoculation?&quot;

41
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,629
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know. Ten o&#39;clock when I&#39;m coming out of my chemistry class.&quot;

42
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:38,710
He said, &quot;Okay. Would you mark where your chemistry class is on the map, and then would

43
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:45,710
you draw me the line from there to the...&quot; Now, the compliance rate is 29 percent. This

44
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:54,400
little trivial situational factor, channel that he creates has that massive impact on behavior.

45
00:04:54,419 --> 00:05:00,029
Of course, now to get back to this dispositional versus situational explanation. Here&#39;s Joe

46
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:05,430
who went to get the tetanus inoculation, and Sam who didn&#39;t. Why did Joe? &quot;Well, he&#39;s

47
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,529
was very conscientious; he&#39;s very health-concerned.&quot;

48
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:14,529
Sam, why did he not do it? &quot;Well, he&#39;s kind of, he&#39;s the sort of guy who doesn&#39;t care

49
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:19,759
that much; he&#39;s kind of irresponsible; he&#39;s kind of flighty, really.&quot; There is the situational

50
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,809
factor that affects what goes on, why a factor of nine, and I&#39;m going to attribute it. As

51
00:05:24,809 --> 00:05:31,539
the observer, I&#39;m going to attribute the difference to their personalities.

52
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:37,960
This idea of channel factors that you mentioned with respect to the Milgram experiment and

53
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:44,240
others, it&#39;s extremely powerful, and I think that people aren&#39;t really taking advantage

54
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,159
of it as far as in the Occupy movement or in climate change and so on. In trying to

55
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:56,039
motivate a large number of people to do one particular thing, they don&#39;t really seem to

56
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,919
be taking advantage of the situation as much as they could. Is that true?

57
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:07,919
Well, I think the message has started to become much better understood, actually. We&#39;re seeing

58
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:16,759
in education a number of really dramatic cases where relatively small changes in the situation

59
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:25,759
facing students, just giving messages about whether they belong and whether the institution

60
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:33,199
has confidence that they can succeed. We see big effects of these kinds of manipulations.

61
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:40,199
Certainly, politicians have gotten the message. To some extent, it&#39;s been negative in the

62
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,599
sense that they no longer worry about persuading people. They just say, &quot;How can we identify

63
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:51,430
the folks who are likely to be our voters and make them get to the polls?&quot;

64
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:57,860
It was interesting in the last election. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a big secret that Barack

65
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:04,860
Obama had the assistance of a number of behavioral psychologists and behavioral economists who

66
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:16,719
used a number of different techniques to initially identify and then make sure their voters would

67
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:24,819
actually get to the polls. They did this in very, very sophisticated ways, such that on

68
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:31,949
the night of the election, the Republican strategists were shocked and were convinced

69
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:39,369
that the prediction models that they had were correct and the early polling was wrong because

70
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:45,550
they were saying, &quot;Given everything we know about the economy, and given what we know

71
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:51,909
about popularity ratings, and given what we know about the frequency with which particular

72
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:57,789
ethnic or demographic groups vote, what&#39;s going to happen?&quot; What they didn&#39;t realize

73
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:04,360
was that an experimental manipulation had been done. Some very, very clever and powerful

74
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:13,500
techniques had been used to make people who were favorably leaning, but not likely voters, to actually vote.

75
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,689
What were those? What were they doing exactly?

76
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:18,999
That&#39;s a secret.

77
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,099
Right.

78
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:25,469
But if you read the history of social psychology, you&#39;d be able to predict.

79
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:28,589
I can imagine a couple of them, yes.

80
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:35,250
Yes. One is getting early commitment, getting people who say that they&#39;re going to vote,

81
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:40,750
you say, &quot;Can we count on you? Can we call you back on Election Day and make sure you

82
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:47,029
voted.&quot; Getting to register, instead of saying, &quot;Will you go register,&quot; you say, &quot;Okay, let&#39;s

83
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:51,500
do it right now. Take out your cellphone and make this call, and someone will come and

84
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:58,290
pick you up.&quot; I mean, there&#39;s many, many things that you can do but the point was to make

85
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:05,290
sure that people who generally were disposed to behave in a particular way but, often in

86
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,100
history, have not done so. In this case, they would, and they could be counted on.

87
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,269
My name is Lee. I think about wisdom.
