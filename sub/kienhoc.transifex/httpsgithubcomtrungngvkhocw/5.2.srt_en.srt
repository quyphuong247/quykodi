You&#39;ve done recently an enormous meta-analysis, an analysis of analyses. You&#39;ve looked at

1
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:18,020
a whole bunch of different types of learning techniques, things that students can use,

2
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,009
or do use, to try to improve their learning.

3
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:22,419
Right.

4
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:28,540
Could you tell us a bit about what you&#39;ve done and what you&#39;ve found?

5
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,950
Sure. With a large group of collaborators who actually worked very hard in this project

6
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,770
for almost three years, we just reviewed lots of literature, as you&#39;ve said, about the

7
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,930
effectiveness of a variety of strategies. What we didn&#39;t look at were strategies that

8
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:46,100
involved technology because we wanted to focus on just those things that any student could use.

9
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,240
We chose the strategies for two reasons. Some of them we wanted to evaluate, we thought

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,750
they probably did work, but why not check out the evidence? A couple of other strategies,

11
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:58,180
however, we knew students used a lot. We wanted to know: are these really effective strategies,

12
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:03,030
or should they be doing something else instead? Something that all students use—I still

13
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,150
do it myself—is highlighter. We like to highlight things when reading. It&#39;s like a

14
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,880
security blanket or something for learning. But it turns out highlighting itself doesn&#39;t

15
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,310
really improve student learning. It doesn&#39;t increase achievement in any way. I would never

16
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,590
take a highlighter away from a student. Again, it&#39;s like a security blanket, but it&#39;s

17
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,659
just the beginning of the learning journey. It&#39;s not the end of it. After you highlight

18
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:27,759
all the important stuff—it turns out most textbooks highlight it for you anyway—you

19
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,969
need to go back and use effective techniques to learn that material.

20
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:35,289
At least some of the things that students do like highlighting and re-reading really

21
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:40,889
don&#39;t have a big bang for the time buck, so to speak. We&#39;ll spend time re-reading and

22
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:44,920
highlighting and really not learning a whole lot, when in fact they can replace those strategies

23
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,179
with other ones that really do boost their learning, which is exciting.

24
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:48,859
Sure.

25
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:53,139
Now we just have to retrain students, build a better student, use better strategies.

26
00:01:53,139 --> 00:01:57,139
Interesting. So highlighting, rereading, doesn&#39;t have much of an effect?

27
00:01:57,139 --> 00:02:01,429
No, it doesn&#39;t. Isn&#39;t that strange? You&#39;d think everybody rereads right? You go back

28
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:04,170
to the material. Unfortunately, when you go back to reread, your eyes are moving across

29
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,319
the page, it&#39;s probably late at night, the night before an exam, and your mind is somewhere

30
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:13,060
else, so basically mind wandering as you&#39;re rereading . Students need to do things that

31
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,440
are more—to engage them more actively.

32
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,820
Yes. So in this analysis, you&#39;ve looked at some things also that had a massive effect.

33
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,360
Yes.

34
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:28,970
What—obviously it makes sense. I mean, a lot people, when they are studying or cramming

35
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:34,670
for an exam, these are the things we do but they might not be the most effective. What

36
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,110
are the most effective? What are the things that actually work?

37
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,790
Certainly cramming is not that effective, right? Students think it&#39;s effective probably

38
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,490
because they can squeak by potentially in the exam and then they&#39;ll just forget everything.

39
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,180
I&#39;m not suggesting students don&#39;t study the night before a test. It relieves anxiety

40
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,610
and all that sort of thing, but there are better things they could do. First, instead

41
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,900
of just cramming, begin studying two or three weeks before an exam so you&#39;re distributing

42
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,820
your practice out across time, which is very important. So you&#39;re studying the same material

43
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,510
over and over again. Now that does take a little planning, maybe a calendar to remind

44
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:10,210
yourself, &quot;It&#39;s just two weeks before the exam. Now I really need to hit the books,&quot;

45
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,900
versus just the night before, when you&#39;re panicking and trying to cram.

46
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,560
Distributed practice is really good, but distributed practice just tells you kind of a schedule

47
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,930
of how you should be studying, kind of like the &quot;when&quot; of studying. But there are

48
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,010
lots of &quot;whats,&quot; the things you can do instead of just rereading the material passively.

49
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,850
One that we find that&#39;s really effective, and many others—there&#39;s about a hundred

50
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:33,930
years of research; very exciting—showing how effective this is, is just retrieval practice.

51
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,730
So if you mark up your book in about all the important things, and you go back, instead

52
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:42,090
of just rereading everything you&#39;ve marked up, cover it up with your hand and just try

53
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,900
to recall from memory the content. If the student gets that answer right from memory,

54
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,060
that has a really potent effect on subsequent performance. You really learn it that much

55
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,030
better. Of course if they can&#39;t recall it from memory, then they could restudy at that

56
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,790
point, but then they should come back and keep trying. Just retrieval practice is a

57
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:04,400
really effective way to boost performance, especially if students use it distributed across time.

58
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,290
Sure. So it&#39;s kind of like flashcards, I guess.

59
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,670
Absolutely like flashcards. You know, most students at least say they use flash cards

60
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:17,209
for simple, associate learning, things like foreign language vocabulary, but you can use

61
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:21,700
flashcards for complex materials as well: concepts, or you write the key term on one

62
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,850
side, definition on the other side, and then use that to basically test yourself, and then

63
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:32,160
to restudy. Even important concepts in textbooks—how they take notes. They can take notes in better

64
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,850
ways to actually support this retrieval practice, which is an effective strategy that many students

65
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,100
don&#39;t use. They underutilize it, yes.

66
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:48,100
Retrieval practice—so then it&#39;s, I suppose, really pretty effortful by my comparison to

67
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,850
rereading or highlighting, so it probably takes a fair bit of desire on the part of

68
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,220
the student to want to learn that.

69
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,380
Absolutely, it does. It&#39;s very easy to sit there and reread, especially when your mind

70
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,680
is somewhere else thinking about how fun it&#39;s going to be after you take your exam, that

71
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,230
type of thing. Where it does take a little bit more effort, that&#39;s what engages you to

72
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,980
try to retrieve the information. The nice thing is, out of all these studies that are

73
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:17,430
done to compare rereading to retrieval practice, the time on task is always equated, so the

74
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,810
students who were just rereading spent the same amount of time that the students are

75
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:25,240
who were practicing retrieval. So, yes, it might be a little bit more effortful. It&#39;s

76
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,980
like a little bit more painful to try to retrieve stuff from memory, but even the same amount

77
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,900
of time used in one strategy versus the other, the students who were practicing retrieval,

78
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:41,700
using that little bit of extra effort, are getting the major, basically, increase in their performance.

79
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:48,720
Interesting. And so the other aspect to that, the distributed learning, the spaced learning,

80
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:56,280
what does that entail? Does that entail studying a little bit each day, or is it—how many

81
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,580
days do you need?

82
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:02,940
That&#39;s a hundred-dollar question, or maybe even 10,000-dollar question.

83
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,040
This is how I think about it. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re a student getting ready for an exam, and maybe

84
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,190
you decide, &quot;Okay, I can give this four hours of my time.&quot; Most students, because

85
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,210
they think cramming is good, they&#39;ll spend that four hours the night before the exam—just

86
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,500
study, study, study. They&#39;re going to do lot better off if they take the same four

87
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:26,080
hours and just basically segment it into four one-hour study sessions that are spread across,

88
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,320
say, two weeks prior to the exam. Again, the same amount of time, but now they&#39;re just

89
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,340
spread across time, where you&#39;re coming back to the same material versus just kind of going

90
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,940
over that material over and over again during one four-hour block.

91
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:43,740
How much they need to do for long-term retention? A whole lot. Okay, this won&#39;t be a great strategy

92
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,260
to learn all your course content. You got to decide what&#39;s most important, what you

93
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,500
think you&#39;re going to be tested on, and focus on that material.

94
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,160
Interesting.

95
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,900
But the more, the better. The more often you come back and restudy, of course, and use

96
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,030
retrieval practice, the longer you&#39;re going to retain that material. For stuff that students

97
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:04,020
really need to know, this is an essential strategy, or else they just forget stuff.

98
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,370
I mean, you don&#39;t have to tell a student that after they take a test that they crammed for,

99
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:14,020
the next day they pretty much don&#39;t remember anything that they studied. Distributed practice

100
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,199
ensures that you&#39;re going to remember that for a much longer period of time.

101
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:17,590
Interesting.

102
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,810
My name is John. I think about reflection.
