We just heard Richard and Lee talk about the difference between the person and the situation,

1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:16,260
and they provided a few really good cognitive processes, reasons for this distinction.

2
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,090
One of them was selective attention. We only have a certain amount of information that

3
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,180
we can process and my efforts are focused on you—on what is it that you&#39;re saying,

4
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,840
how you&#39;re behaving—to the exclusion of the context.

5
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,969
Another that Richard made reference to was the cultural difference between—for example,

6
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:42,979
Easterners pay attention to the context and the person is situated within that context,

7
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:49,979
but the context comes first and then the person is located or situated somewhere within that.

8
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:56,399
Relatedly, Lee made reference to the language that we use. We have a lot of words, we have

9
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,399
a lot of language for personality characteristics. We don&#39;t have many words for the situation—the

10
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:10,929
situation where you feel brave or something, or, &quot;Yesterday at work, I was in a very honesty

11
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:18,000
situation.&quot; You almost have to bend over backwards to make a reference to situations that illicit certain behaviors.

12
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:24,420
Yep. I was sitting in traffic the other day, and this car came in and it cut me off.

13
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,399
I knew that he was just trying to get to the front of the line to push in front of me,

14
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:35,399
and I was outraged. I said, &quot;What an asshole! What kind of person would do that?&quot; Then I&#39;d

15
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,439
just been preparing for this episode on the distinction between the person and the situation,

16
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:47,840
and I stopped myself. I said, &quot;Okay, hold on here. What if it had been me who cut off

17
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,969
somebody else in traffic?&quot; The rationalization for my behavior would have been, &quot;Oh, no.

18
00:01:53,969 --> 00:02:00,969
I&#39;m in a rush. I can&#39;t be late to work for the third time.&quot; But when I was sitting

19
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:07,569
there in the car and somebody else cut me off, I attributed their behavior to themselves.

20
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:14,569
This is a common thing. We tend to attribute the behavior of other people to personality

21
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:24,000
situations, to character traits, but we tend to attribute the explanation for our own behavior to situational variables.

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We&#39;ve spoken about, already, the weakness of personality variables in predicting future

23
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,730
behavior, but let&#39;s talk about the strength of the situation in predicting behavior now.

24
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:43,450
We&#39;ve spoken about the Good Samaritan. Now there&#39;s a great study by Solomon Asch. Imagine

25
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:49,090
you were asked to participate in a vision experiment—a visual acuity test. You come

26
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,560
into the room. There&#39;s four other people, and you sit down at the end of the table.

27
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,190
The experimenter shows you some lines. There&#39;s a line on the left of a particular length,

28
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:03,680
and then three lines on the right of differing lengths. Your job is just to say, &quot;Okay. Which

29
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,770
line on the right is the same length as the one on the left?&quot; Okay. You can see quite

30
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:14,450
clearly, in this particular case, that the answer is B. Those lines are exactly the same

31
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:21,450
length. Now the first person responds, shouts out to the experimenter, &quot;C.&quot; The second person

32
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:27,930
responds, shouts out to the experimenter, &quot;C.&quot; The third person, &quot;C.&quot; The fourth person,

33
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:34,070
&quot;C.&quot; Now, what do you do? Do you stick to your guns? You can quite clearly see the answer is B.

34
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,070
Do you shout out, &quot;B,&quot; or do you go with the group?

35
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:43,950
Now what Asch found was that, very often, people will go with the group. They will shout

36
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:50,010
out, &quot;C,&quot; even though they can see the answer is B. This is called social conformity. Often,

37
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,990
people will go with the group because they want to fit in or they think the group has

38
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,130
access to information that they don&#39;t.

39
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:04,130
That&#39;s right. It&#39;s a really strong demonstration of social conformity. Another really landmark

40
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,560
classic, probably the most well-known experiment in all of psychology and probably the most

41
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,720
controversial, is one by Stanley Milgram. In this experiment, you have a similar sort

42
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,910
of setup. You have one person who is working for the experimenter and one person who&#39;s

43
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,560
participating in the experiment. They come into the lab, and they&#39;re welcomed by a man

44
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,560
in a white lab coat. Very official looking character, the experimenter. He has the two

45
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:41,070
people in the experiment. He assigns them: one is going to be a teacher, and one is going

46
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,540
to be a learner. But, in fact, it&#39;s rigged. The person who&#39;s working for the experimenter

47
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:51,880
is always the learner; the person, the actually subject, is the teacher. He brings them into

48
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:58,780
a room and shows them. He hooks up the learner into a chair, almost like an electric chair.

49
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:05,780
He straps them in. They&#39;re completely restrained and hooks up a bunch of electrodes to that

50
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:12,710
person. The idea is that he takes the teacher, the participant in the experiment, into another

51
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:18,540
room where you can&#39;t see the learner. They&#39;re locked away. They&#39;re tied to a chair. What

52
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:25,540
they can do is—the job of the teacher is to teach that person a bunch of word pairs.

53
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,210
They communicate with the learner over a microphone.

54
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,670
A microphone—that&#39;s exactly right. You&#39;re saying over a microphone. You read the question.

55
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:38,860
The learner&#39;s in the other room. They respond in a particular way. If they get it right,

56
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,810
fine. If they get it wrong, they get an electric shock. Okay?

57
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:49,170
Now the experimenter shows the teacher this switchboard of electric shocks. It goes all

58
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:55,480
the way from five volts. You click a little switch, and you click the button, and it shocks

59
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,580
the learner in the other room. Then 10 volts, 15 volts, 20 volts, all the way, gradually

60
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:07,580
going up to 450 volts. They&#39;re reading over the microphone, &quot;Okay, learner.&quot; They read

61
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:13,330
the word list. They give them a multiple-choice question, and if the learner gets it wrong,

62
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:19,480
which they did frequently, they get an electric shock. They&#39;re doing this time and time again.

63
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,480
They&#39;re up to a hundred volts. &quot;Sorry, learner,&quot; and they shock the person, and so on.

64
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,820
Well, if they get it wrong, the volts increase. Every time they get it wrong...

65
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:31,139
That&#39;s right. Each time they get it wrong, it increases. That&#39;s right. Now the whole

66
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:38,139
point of the experiment in this case is to see how far the teacher will go up this gradually

67
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:46,180
escalating ranked set of voltages. It keeps going up, time and time again. How many people

68
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,630
will actually go to the end and elicit 450 volts to that learner in the other room?

69
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,850
Didn&#39;t you say lethal in brackets as well?

70
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:02,050
XXX—that&#39;s right—it says at the far end. It doesn&#39;t even have a label anymore. How

71
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,230
many people will actually go to the end?

72
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:11,230
Clearly, when they&#39;re going through this experiment, often the teachers are very dismayed. They

73
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:17,300
elicit a shock, and they hear the learner in the other room saying, &quot;Stop! Stop! This is hurting.&quot;

74
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:23,900
They look past, and they look back to the experimenter and say, &quot;No, we can&#39;t go on. This is dodgy.&quot;

75
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,699
All the experimenter does is just sit on the chair, and sit back and say, &quot;The experiment

76
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:32,790
requires that you continue. Please continue. Please continue.&quot;

77
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,590
They say, &quot;Well, no. The guy is in the...&quot;

78
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:40,490
&quot;Please continue the experiment. We insist,&quot; and so on. &quot;There&#39;s no permanent tissue damage,&quot;

79
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:45,960
whatever that means. &quot;Please continue.&quot; Now how many people are actually going to obey

80
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,520
and go right to the end?

81
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,820
Now most people predict that it will be nobody. Maybe one person sometimes.

82
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:59,240
Some psychopath or something, right? In fact, the vast majority—it&#39;s quite a few people;

83
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,229
I can&#39;t remember the exact number; I think 30 percent or something, 40 percent [correction: 65 percent] maybe

84
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:07,410
—continued to the very end of the experiment and elicited very lethal

85
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,860
shocks to that person. You even hear them in the other room going, &quot;Stop the experiment!

86
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,669
My heart!&quot; Then they stopped responding, and they continue to elicit shocks after the person

87
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:23,669
is completely silent. This was a real shock. This is an ethical conundrum. This is moral

88
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:32,340
callousness on scale. This is terrible. In fact, just like you or I, anyone in that particular

89
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:38,649
situation is going to be feeling exactly the same thing and will probably elicit shocks,

90
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:39,959
just like they did in that experiment.

91
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:44,350
Yep. A similar one on the power of the situation is called the bystander effect. Now in this

92
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:49,519
experiment, a participant comes into a room and they&#39;re asked to fill out a questionnaire.

93
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,369
The experimenters, they&#39;re not in the room, but they start pushing smoke through the bottom

94
00:08:54,369 --> 00:08:59,019
of the door in the other room, so the smoke just starts billowing in. When people are

95
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:04,269
in that situation, filling out a questionnaire on their own, most of the people take control

96
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:08,399
of the situation. They go outside the room, and they look for help. They think it might

97
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,529
be a fire or something like that.

98
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:15,790
Now the tricky part of this experiment here is we set up the same situation again, but

99
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:19,699
this time we have more people in the room filling out a questionnaire. There&#39;s two more

100
00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:25,360
people to the right of you, but unbeknownst to you they&#39;re actually working for the experimenter.

101
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,389
Now you&#39;re in a room with two other people, filling out a questionnaire, and you start

102
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:34,269
to see the smoke billowing through the room again. You&#39;re looking here, and you look to

103
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:39,930
the right and you can see those other participants are still beavering away at their questionnaire.

104
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:45,240
You can see that they look at the smoke, but then they look away. They&#39;re not too concerned.

105
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,019
Now in this situation, people are far less likely to take control of that situation and

106
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:54,259
move outside the room and look for help.

107
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:58,649
That&#39;s right. This is—in each of these cases, that was the perfect example of the bystander

108
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:04,740
effect. We have social conformity, obedience, bystander. These are three situational factors

109
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:12,200
that are ridiculously robust. Put pretty much anyone in the same circumstance, and you get the same sort of effect.

110
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:19,249
Robust in the sense that it&#39;s far more likely to predict behavior than a personality explanation.

111
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,730
That&#39;s right. Robust in a sense that it happens again and again and again, whoever is in that

112
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:31,730
particular situation. I think this is what Lee Ross regarded as a—he labeled it the

113
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:39,389
fundamental attribution error. It&#39;s so fundamental that most of us in the same situation would

114
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,629
do exactly the same thing.

115
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:48,900
We talked with Lee and Richard about that fundamental attribution error, and here&#39;s what they had to say.
