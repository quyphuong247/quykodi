One thing that psychologists have discovered, and Tim Wilson and I were some of the first

1
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:17,190
to work on this kind of question, is how much that goes on in our heads is unconscious?

2
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:26,900
I mean, we think we know what&#39;s going on. I mean, Freud didn&#39;t know the half of it.

3
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:32,260
Most of what goes on in our heads, we have very little inkling of. Some of the work that&#39;s

4
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:41,800
come out recently about these priming effects, trivial little things, embarrassing that we&#39;re

5
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:50,400
affected by them. You ask me to read a persuasive communication and you happen to have introduced

6
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,489
a fishy smell into the room, I&#39;m not as persuaded by it. &quot;Something&#39;s fishy here.&quot;

7
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,220
Literally. Interesting.

8
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:04,659
Yes, literally. It works, and we know that that&#39;s what&#39;s going on. It&#39;s the fishy thing,

9
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:11,700
the metaphor, because there are some countries that don&#39;t have the metaphor: &quot;there&#39;s something fishy about this&quot;.

10
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,659
That&#39;s your control group, is it? They don&#39;t have the experience.

11
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:18,400
That&#39;s right. There are some cultures that just don&#39;t have that. In Denmark, I think it&#39;s, &quot;I smell a rat.&quot;

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,700
I get you.

13
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,700
Who knows what a rat smells like? I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s rat essence that you can spray in the air.

14
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,369
So then what&#39;s the upshot? You&#39;re saying—yes, so a lot of it is unconscious.

15
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:37,039
Yes, a lot. Process, in terms of my definition, is always unconscious. There is no such

16
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:43,439
thing as awareness of cognitive process. We claim it, but we don&#39;t claim that we have

17
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,460
awareness of the perceptual processes that we have. We have absolutely no idea. All these

18
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:55,689
various sensations are getting treated in—when you teach it in psychology, what perceptions

19
00:01:55,689 --> 00:02:03,700
might be, virtually everything you tell people, they have no idea. There are a million visual

20
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:09,080
illusions, for example, which depend on the fact that we have certain perceptual processes

21
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:15,379
that operate in a particular way. If you give us something that&#39;s slightly off-base from

22
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:21,620
that, we make an error in it because the unconscious procedures that we have for perceiving the

23
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,739
world will lead us astray in those situations.

24
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:33,400
The thing I most want people to understand is that we solve problems—everything, from

25
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,470
the most common everyday problem like, &quot;How do I make up to Joe after my unpleasantness

26
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:46,319
to him,&quot; to, &quot;How do I solve this professional problem that I&#39;m dealing with?&quot; Most of that

27
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,080
goes on—first off, there&#39;s no access to process at all. We know what&#39;s in our heads,

28
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,360
some of it. Huge amounts we don&#39;t know what&#39;s in our head. The procedures that we use to

29
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:07,700
solve problems are often completely opaque to us. We don&#39;t know how we did it.

30
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:14,730
My favorite study like this that was ever done was in the 1930s. A psychologist whose

31
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:24,800
name was N. R. F. Maier had people do a problem, solve a problem. He had cords hanging from

32
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:31,019
the ceiling in different places. He said, &quot;I want you to bring these cords together.&quot;

33
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:39,900
There were lots of things lying all around the room, and somebody would see something

34
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:47,100
that they could use, an extension cord, so they&#39;d tie the extension cord on one and pulled it over to the other—easy solution.

35
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,620
After they had five or six of these, there was one other way to do it that they hadn&#39;t

36
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:58,239
yet discovered, which was much more difficult. After the subject had been stumped for 5 or

37
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,120
10 minutes, Maier, who&#39;s been wandering around the room the whole time, flips one of the

38
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:12,700
cords, sets it into motion. Within 45 seconds, the typical subject tied something to the

39
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,480
bottom of it and swung it like a pendulum, grabbed the other and tied them together.

40
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,860
Maier says, &quot;That&#39;s great. That&#39;s the solution. How did you come up with that?&quot; No one ever

41
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:30,500
gave him the answer—the correct answer. He ran some psychologists through this, and

42
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,590
they were hilarious in their rich accounts of what—&quot;I thought of monkeys swinging through trees.&quot;

43
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:41,910
&quot;The idea of a pendulum entered my head at the precise moment.&quot;

44
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:48,250
You have a slave who&#39;s working for you all the time. That&#39;s your unconscious. And we

45
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:55,070
don&#39;t take nearly as much use of it as we could.

46
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:03,100
There&#39;s a writer for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; who has a wonderful account of how you write,

47
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:09,100
how to do it. He says you have to sit down and think a bit about what you&#39;re going to do.

48
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,510
If you don&#39;t, nothing is going to happen. The next time you sit down, there&#39;s nothing,

49
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:18,420
but if you actually do that, spend a few minutes, think about what the problem is, how you&#39;re

50
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:24,570
going to get this thing across, it&#39;s been handed over to the unconscious and the unconscious

51
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:29,230
is working on it 24 hours a day, no matter what you&#39;re doing.

52
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:35,990
I find that in my own work all the time. When I&#39;m teaching a seminar, I give

53
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:42,030
thought questions. If I wait until just before I have to do those thought questions, it&#39;s

54
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:47,220
an effort; they&#39;re not very good. If three or four days in advance, I sit and wonder,

55
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,930
&quot;What are the best things that I want to make sure come out of the discussion here,&quot;

56
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:58,250
and just spend five or ten minutes on it, three days later when I start to do it, it&#39;s

57
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,800
like I&#39;m taking it by dictation and they&#39;re much better than I would otherwise have come up with.

58
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,780
I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ve ever convinced any students. For that term paper, first day of class,

59
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,850
tomorrow, start working on that term paper. I don&#39;t think they believe me. I don&#39;t

60
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,980
know if I&#39;ve ever gotten it across.

61
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:23,280
I have a lot of examples now of this kind of thing that I think if you spend 20 or 30

62
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,980
minutes with people, they might really come to believe you and might be able to make much

63
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,200
more use of their brain than they are.
