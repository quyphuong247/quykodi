People have really fantastic pattern-recognition abilities, and it&#39;s not just hearing messages

1
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:18,800
that we expect to hear but it&#39;s also visually as well. There&#39;s a bunch of really good examples of this.

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,689
Now many people have seen this picture, but if you haven&#39;t, then it&#39;s not going to

3
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:27,779
make much sense. There are just some black patches on a white background. But what if

4
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:33,200
I told you that the title of this picture is called &quot;Dalmatian Dog&quot;? Does that help?

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,850
Well, if you still can&#39;t see it, then savor this moment because once I show you, then

6
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,160
you&#39;ll never be able to see this photo in the same way ever again.

7
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,969
Are you ready? All right, here it is.

8
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:54,260
Now of course you&#39;ve seen many examples of this. People have reported seeing a face

9
00:00:54,260 --> 00:01:00,769
on Mars, or Elvis in the form of a tree, or even seeing the Virgin Mary in a toasted cheese

10
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:07,200
sandwich. We tend to see faces all over the place. In fact, there&#39;s a nice website called

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,670
Faces in Places where people upload their own photographs of faces that they see in

12
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,110
everyday objects, and it&#39;s filled with hundreds of great examples.

13
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,780
People are really good at perceiving patterns. In fact, we&#39;re essentially pattern-recognition

14
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,640
machines, particularly for faces.

15
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Many times, our basic pattern-recognition abilities are shaped by really specific expectations

16
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,500
like, &quot;It&#39;s fun to smoke marijuana,&quot; and once you know what it is that you&#39;re

17
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,729
listening for, automatically kind of pops out.

18
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:45,729
Again, I mean, this is found, for example, like in a Dalmatian dog. Once I tell you,

19
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,109
for example, to look for the Dalmatian dog in the scene, all of the things that aren&#39;t

20
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:54,950
consistent with the Dalmatian dog just fade into the background, and all the things that

21
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:01,950
are consistent with the Dalmatian dog really pop out. It&#39;s this difference between sharpening

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,470
things that are consistent with it and leveling the things that are inconsistent with that

23
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:14,330
specific message. We see this happens a lot, this sharpening and leveling process.

24
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:20,910
We&#39;re going to see this come up again and again throughout the course, where things

25
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:26,080
float to the top that are consistent with your expectations, and things that aren&#39;t

26
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,890
consistent kind of fade into the background. This sort of expectancy effect is really common

27
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,150
throughout cognition, and psychology, more generally.

28
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:42,980
Many times also, instead of things being shaped by our specific expectations, they&#39;re also

29
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:49,750
shaped by our general expectations, so things like—well, language is a good one. Language—we

30
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:55,950
aren&#39;t even aware, really, of doing any sort of interpretation whatsoever. When you

31
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:01,180
read a sentence, it just kind of emerges, what the meaning of that sentence is, but

32
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:08,180
there&#39;s all sorts of things like syntax and grammar, obviously spelling, word configurations,

33
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,290
sentence structure. These things are all happening, and you&#39;re applying them. You&#39;re making

34
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,690
these interpretations without even knowing that there&#39;s anything going on. There are

35
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,770
some really good examples of this as well.

36
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:26,620
In this example by Steve Pinker, our vast experience with language allows us to deal

37
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:33,340
with these noisy conditions and understand this seemingly garbled passage of text.

38
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,640
The same goes for our ability to interpret bad handwriting, something that humans find

39
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,650
incredibly easy to do. But computer scientists and researchers in machine learning can tell

40
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,660
you about the incredible amount of stored information and processing that&#39;s required

41
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,730
for a computer to understand and interpret something as simple as a handwritten postal

42
00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:01,730
code on an envelope. Subjectively, we just open our eyes and apprehend it as humans because

43
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:07,900
we all have incredible amounts of experience with these sorts of materials that we encounter every day.

44
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:13,730
We&#39;re not even aware of having made an interpretation. I mean, that&#39;s what so cool about this stuff,

45
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:20,730
that when you&#39;re listening to Queen backward, again, that message that it&#39;s fun to smoke

46
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:26,460
marijuana, that message, you can&#39;t hear. You can&#39;t put yourself back into the shoes

47
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:32,569
of yourself, your previous self before hearing that message. You can&#39;t un-hear it. Again,

48
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:37,310
looking at the Dalmatian dog, you can&#39;t un-see the Dalmatian dog. You&#39;re forever

49
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:43,259
tainted. The bits that are consistent with the dog pop out. The bits that are consistent

50
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:48,460
with &quot;It&#39;s fun to smoke marijuana&quot; pop out. You fail to recognize, A: that you&#39;re

51
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:55,460
even making any sort of interpretation whatsoever; and, B: that there are a squillion other ways

52
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:00,360
that you could&#39;ve heard or that you could&#39;ve seen these things.

53
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,740
This is a really important concept, where it&#39;s so important we&#39;re calling it the

54
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:11,490
fundamental cognitive error. This is just this idea that we don&#39;t recognize that we&#39;ve

55
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,500
made an interpretation and that there are a million other ways that it could&#39;ve been interpreted.

56
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:21,139
It&#39;s clear that seeing and hearing both involve considerable knowledge about the world,

57
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:24,120
but we can also add memory to that list.

58
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,379
I spoke to an expert in the area, Beth Loftus, and she explains some of the research that

59
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:36,900
she&#39;s been working on for decades. It turns out that memory doesn&#39;t work as well as we might expect.
