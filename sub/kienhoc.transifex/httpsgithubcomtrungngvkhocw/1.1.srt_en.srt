In Think101, we’re thinking about thinking — that is, we&#39;re thinking about reasoning, about

1
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:24,220
judgment, about the choices we make, decision-making. How do we make choices? How do we think about

2
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,820
things like expertise? How do we turn somebody who knows nothing into somebody who knows

3
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:36,820
a lot? What I think we&#39;re trying to do is bring that kind of scientific thinking, that

4
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:44,460
rigor, that way of approaching problems, of finding things out, out of the lab and into

5
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,530
our everyday lives. It&#39;s never been more important to know how

6
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:58,790
to learn, but it&#39;s not easy, and that&#39;s an ultimate survival skill. You can plant entirely

7
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:04,469
false memories, whole memories, into the minds of people for things that didn&#39;t happen. All

8
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:12,060
that intelligence, all that experience, all that education doesn&#39;t protect you. I think

9
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,479
part of being skeptical is keeping an open mind but demanding evidence. Try and

10
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:21,860
find some evidence first, and then make up your mind.

11
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:27,659
We wanted people to confront things that they think about and do every day and realize that

12
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,600
there&#39;s science around them in every place. The best way to think about: &amp;quot;Will I be able

13
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,140
to do something well in the future&amp;quot; is to simulate it in the present.

14
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:44,110
I would say to both skeptics and believers: &amp;quot;Try and base your thoughts and your beliefs

15
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:48,000
on the evidence.&amp;quot; I mean, that&#39;s what you do in many different areas of your life.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,479
The world doesn&#39;t really look the way you think it looks. There&#39;s not a simple panacea

17
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:59,100
here. I personally find that the smartest people I meet are always willing to say they

18
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,420
don&#39;t know something. Science isn&#39;t just for scientists. It&#39;s for

19
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,810
anybody with integrity that really honestly wants to understand their world. Making mistakes

20
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:15,250
is really important. If it feels easy, you&#39;re probably doing it wrong.

21
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:20,079
People will quickly recognize that the letter string at the bottom will produce more words

22
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:24,379
than the letter string at the top. Why would the order of the stockings affect

23
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:31,019
my judgment? That was disgusting. What was that nice one?

24
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:35,209
What was the really good one? What am I going to do? I&#39;m totally going to

25
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:40,299
take a sip and... Sorry. What were you saying? Hang on. Let me enjoy this wine.

26
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:45,469
One of the things we&#39;re trying to do in this course is give a realistic idea about how

27
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:50,919
the mind is actually working. Think clearly. Think effectively. Ultimately, we want them

28
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,510
to have the tools to be able to change the world.
