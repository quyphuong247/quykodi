What we do in our everyday lives—we may not realised it, but we&#39;re actually using

1
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,410
some of the tools of science as well.

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:15,010
We&#39;re trying—just like the scientist does—to identify &quot;what are the phenomena out there?&quot;

3
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:20,740
We wanted people to confront things that they think about and do everyday, and realize that

4
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,730
there&#39;s science around them every place.

5
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,930
Out own perception of how random things ought to be is not random at all! In fact, there&#39;s

6
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,820
way too many, what&#39;s called &quot;alternations.&quot;

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,570
You know - we&#39;ve gotten a lot of people that say &quot;your shuffle&#39;s not random.&quot; Well - it

8
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:46,300
really is random. So what we&#39;ve added is smart shuffle to actually make it less random, if you want.

Can you tell the difference between milk added to your tea and tea added to your milk? And

10
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:57,600
she said, &quot;of course!&quot; One of the men at the table decided to design a test of this woman&#39;s claim.
