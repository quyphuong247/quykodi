Until now in Think101, we&#39;ve been correcting several myths about how people think the mind works.

1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,559
It doesn&#39;t work like a video camera. Much of our perceptual and cognitive processing

2
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:22,040
happens without our awareness, and our intuitions about how we learn and retain information

3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,410
best is often very wrong.

4
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:29,410
Now in the last couple of episodes, we introduced a few tools that we&#39;ve taken from science

5
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,600
that can help us deal with complexity and ambiguity.

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,470
Yes. I think we&#39;ve been laying the groundwork for what&#39;s to come. This week, we&#39;re going

7
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:43,860
to be talking about extraordinary claims, but everything that we&#39;ve learnt until now,

8
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,630
everything we&#39;ve that been talking about is being applied to these very concrete examples,

9
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:53,720
to these experiences that people have. We&#39;ve talked about the scientific method. We&#39;ve

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:01:00,120
talked about the way that the mind works, intuition, system two thinking. Now what can

11
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:07,800
we do with that? How do we apply this to very real circumstances that people can actually see them in action?

12
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:12,600
So this week, we&#39;re going to be talking about extraordinary claims. Next week, health claims.

13
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:21,300
The following week, applied claims. We&#39;re going to see all of these things in the wild, these things actually happening.

14
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,580
The first of these experiences that we&#39;re going to look at is my favourite. This is

15
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,650
Susan Blackmore. We travelled all the way to Devon in the UK, which is just outside

16
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:40,900
of London, to talk to Susan about this experienceâ€”this out-of-body experience that she had. Which is just fantastic.

17
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,250
Let&#39;s listen to that next.
