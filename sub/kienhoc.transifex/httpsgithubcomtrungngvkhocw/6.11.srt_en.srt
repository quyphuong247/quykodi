We&#39;ve never been thinking about inspiring kids or making science palatable. We&#39;ve

1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:15,000
really concentrated on solving our own curiosity and telling a good and reasonable narrative story about that.

2
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:19,220
There&#39;s only two ways of seeing it: it&#39;s either counterclockwise or clockwise. It&#39;s

3
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,310
either a duck or a rabbit. It&#39;s either a young woman or an old woman. These are kind

4
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,849
of toy problems. These aren&#39;t the sort of problems that we encounter every day.

5
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,980
Things are conspiring against you in the world. It feels like the world is ganging up on you

6
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,590
and everything is just going really badly. It&#39;s maybe even the source of depression.

7
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,290
On the other hand, some things that just feelâ€”you know, on top of your game, and you have soundtrack

8
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,800
playing in your head; you&#39;re walking around; it&#39;s fantastic.

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:54,700
The simple translation of what you just asked is: can everyday people answer questions, ask and answer questions?

10
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,020
Yes. Can they think critically through a problem?

11
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:02,390
We don&#39;t start doing one of these experiments saying, &quot;Let&#39;s go do some science.&quot;

12
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,820
We just want to do a good job.
