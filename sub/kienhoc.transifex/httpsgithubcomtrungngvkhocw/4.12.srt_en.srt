The key to improving thinking, to thinking better, is to know more. So if you want to

1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,370
be a better singer, you have to spend time singing.

2
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,980
Well, the notion of desirable difficulties is that it refers to a set of manipulations

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,980
that all have the property that they create challenges, the sense of difficulty, during

4
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,610
the acquisition process.

5
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:32,000
We like to think we know how to learn, how we learn best, in what situations we learn

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,180
best, and that we know when we’ve learned something. We have no real insight into the

7
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,860
basis of our behavior. It’s really difficult to predict what we’ll learn and whether

8
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,850
we’ll be able to retrieve this stuff in the future.

9
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,560
What we think works for learning—it’s not even that there’s no relationship between

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,489
what we think and reality, but in fact it’s a negative relationship. What we think works

11
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:57,530
is the exact opposite of what actually works.
