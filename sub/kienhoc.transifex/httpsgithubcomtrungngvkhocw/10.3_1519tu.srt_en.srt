Now Facilitated Communication is really interesting, but it&#39;s quite difficult to get your head

1
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,990
around, and I think one of the tools that we can use is one that we saw last week. We

2
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,450
can look at a two-by-two contingency table. Again, there two ways of being right, and

3
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:21,849
two ways of being wrong in this case. You can say that the communication is coming from

4
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:27,710
the client, or you can say that the communication is coming from the facilitator. In reality,

5
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:32,070
what actually is the case, the communication can actually be coming from the client, or

6
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,010
it can actually be coming from the facilitator.

7
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,410
Now let&#39;s take the first case—a hit. You can say that the communication is coming from

8
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:46,410
the client when it actually is. That&#39;s a hit, or there&#39;s a miss. You can say that the communication

9
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:50,289
is coming from the facilitator when it&#39;s actually coming from the client.

10
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:54,620
That&#39;s right, but I think it&#39;s worth pausing there for a second and unpacking what we mean

11
00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:01,219
by a miss here. This is what we alluded to before Scott&#39;s conversation where we were

12
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:08,219
talking about what it would be like to be a parent of an autistic kid who can in fact

13
00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:13,299
communicate, but we&#39;re not essentially giving them the benefit of the doubt. We&#39;re saying

14
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:17,619
that the facilitator is communicating, not the autistic individual, even though they

15
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:22,560
have the capability of doing it. They have the ability to communicate. They have this

16
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,560
rich inner life, and they&#39;re trapped inside. This technique is useful, but it&#39;s the facilitator

17
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:42,000
who is essentially putting the words in the mouth of the autistic individual. Now that&#39;s a miss. That&#39;s really tragic.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,829
There&#39;s a case—we&#39;re going to link with this in Learn More section. It was a &quot;FRONTLINE&quot;

19
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:55,000
documentary that aired in 1993, I think it was. It&#39;s outstanding. It&#39;s called the &quot;Prisoners

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,939
of Silence,&quot; and throughout this interview, throughout this documentary, they interview

21
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:08,369
a bunch of the parents. They show this technique of the facilitators, and it really put some

22
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:13,459
flesh on the bones of this topic that we&#39;re talking about. There&#39;s one—it still gets

23
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:19,180
me, just thinking about it—it&#39;s one of the parents of the autistic kids is talking about

24
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:26,180
what it was like for the first time to have her daughter say, &quot;I love you, Mom,&quot; and your

25
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:34,800
heart just fills. I mean, it&#39;s incredible just to imagine being a parent of this child

26
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,930
who&#39;s never been able to say, &quot;I love you,&quot; and just going through years and years of

27
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:48,349
having a silent child, and then recognizing that, well, in fact they can communicate.

28
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:55,080
The potential cost of a miss is huge. If these people can communicate and we&#39;re not giving

29
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:02,080
them the benefit of the doubt; we&#39;re not giving them the opportunity, then that&#39;s major. That&#39;s

30
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:09,739
massive. We need to consider that. Yes, it sounds—you can have this cheap cynicism,

31
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:18,549
in a sense, that hindsight is operating in 20/20 here, and get outraged &quot;Yes, they can&#39;t

32
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,900
communicate. How could you have been so stupid,&quot; but that&#39;s not enough. What if they could

33
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:29,900
communicate? Think of that. I think the cost of a miss is really worth considering.

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,090
Yes. That&#39;s a miss. Let&#39;s have a look at the other side. Another way that you can be correct

35
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:42,010
is a correct rejection. You can say that the communication is coming from the facilitator

36
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:49,010
when it actually is coming from facilitator. It&#39;s a non-event. There was a claim out there.

37
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,799
We did some experiments and we found, no, there wasn&#39;t much to be had.

38
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:59,610
The other flip side is a false alarm. This is the case where you say that the communication

39
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:05,870
is coming from the client when it&#39;s actually coming from the facilitator. Now the costs

40
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:12,870
there are pretty huge, I think. It&#39;d be tempting to say, &quot;What&#39;s the harm in this case if we

41
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:22,000
do make that kind of mistake,&quot; but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s good enough. The costs are going to be huge for a false alarm.

42
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:27,990
That&#39;s right. Scott alluded to those costs as well during the conversation, of going

43
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:33,780
down this path, of treating clients, using this technique when in fact there&#39;s nothing

44
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:40,780
there to be had, the cost of shifting an entire line of research to Facilitated Communication,

45
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:47,780
where it was completely ineffective, putting money into the research, getting the hopes

46
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:54,020
of parents up, in a sense, and saying, &quot;Well, in fact, no. In fact your child isn&#39;t communicating

47
00:04:54,020 --> 00:05:00,550
at all. It was the facilitator all along.&quot; Imagine that. That would be just as devastating.

48
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:06,069
What gets me about this, which really irritates me about this entire process is the fact that

49
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:11,120
this didn&#39;t need to happen. It didn&#39;t need to get to this point where you are giving

50
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,250
these parents hope and then pulling the rug from underneath them. It didn&#39;t have to be

51
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,490
that way. The way that we could have resolved this entire thing before it started was to

52
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:27,490
have a correct rejection, was to say—was to do a lot of these—we taught students

53
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,750
in this course about blind experiments, about the power of double-blinding, and everything

54
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,800
else. We did an entire episode on wine-tasting and using this double-blind technique.

55
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,960
It was cheap. That&#39;s something you can do on a weekend, but just as easy. You could

56
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,889
do it with something as big as Facilitated Communication.

57
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:49,889
That&#39;s right. I don&#39;t think it would have been outside the realm of consideration for

58
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:53,610
anyone who&#39;s taking this course to be able to design an experiment to determine whether

59
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:58,310
it was the facilitator who was communicating or whether it was the client. Designing this

60
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:05,310
T-maze—this was not hard. You could do this with an afternoon and 100 dollars, to design

61
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:08,840
the mechanism to do that.

62
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:15,840
But it wasn&#39;t done. Research is cheap. Clinical programs are really expensive. When this was

63
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,199
brought over to Syracuse University, where they completely blew this out in the training,

64
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:26,319
and hiring facilitators, and doing this entire process, that&#39;s really expensive, but you

65
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:33,500
could find out whether there was anything to it in an afternoon and a couple of two by fours. I think that&#39;s not okay.

66
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,330
Yes. Still on the costs of a false alarm, there&#39;s a great website called What&#39;s the

67
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:45,330
Harm? This details a lot of alternative therapies and health techniques and healing. It just

68
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,410
has the false alarm cells, so it gives examples of people who have chosen homeopathic remedies

69
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:58,410
over traditional ones, and they&#39;ve died. In the case of Facilitated Communication, there

70
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:06,150
were accusations that autistic children were being abused. The children were typing out,

71
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,660
&quot;My daddy has touched me,&quot; and things like that, and the state took the children away.

72
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:17,440
There were huge court cases. The harm there is huge. I encourage people to go to the website

73
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,349
to push against that idea of, &quot;What&#39;s the harm when we deal with these things? Let&#39;s

74
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:26,650
just let people have these beliefs and go along our merry way.&quot;

75
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:33,650
It&#39;s really tempting to say, &quot;What&#39;s the harm?&quot; People do this all the time. It almost has

76
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:42,500
the sort of liberal cachet to it in saying, &quot;What&#39;s the harm? Just let people do what they do, and it&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

77
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,259
To argue against that is to be seemingly very cynical.

78
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:52,280
Yes, arguing the other side of that—so it&#39;s a response bias, in a sense, a response bias

79
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,409
to say that the thing is working, regardless whether it is or not, whether that thing,

80
00:07:56,409 --> 00:08:02,520
be it psychic phenomena, or homeopathy, or chiropractic treatment, &quot;What&#39;s the harm?

81
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,379
I&#39;ll give it a go and actually see.&quot; Well, that website exactly shows you what the harm

82
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:13,710
is. It shows you that people are now paralyzed from using this particular alternative treatment,

83
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:20,090
or, again, allegations of sexual abuse, when in fact it was the facilitator who was communicating,

84
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:25,729
and on and on and on. Pick your case, and you can see what the harms actually are.

85
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:31,199
It&#39;s exactly the same problem that we faced before. Consider all four cells. That&#39;s what

86
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,540
we want people to do. Just consider both costs. Hopefully, we&#39;ve done a bit of justice here

87
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:42,630
in considering the cost of a miss relative to the cost of a false alarm. Neither are

88
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:51,400
acceptable. Don&#39;t get me wrong. We could have avoided both by doing a little bit of research in the beginning.

89
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:58,410
Yes. In the case of Facilitated Communication, do you—it&#39;s quite clear in the case of Facilitated

90
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:05,310
Communication that the communications were coming from the facilitators and not the clients.

91
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:11,400
What does that mean for the facilitators? Were they aware that they were influencing these communications?

92
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:17,020
I really don&#39;t think so. Again, going back to the cases of sexual abuse, to the allegations

93
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:23,080
of sexual abuse, I can&#39;t imagine anybody in their right mind that would do that, that

94
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:29,940
would actually say, &quot;Your child is being abused,&quot; when in fact they weren&#39;t. I think what—well,

95
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,190
we know what&#39;s actually happening in this case is something called the Experimenter

96
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:45,700
Expectancy Effect. Let&#39;s let Scott tell the story of exactly what was happening in the case of Facilitated Communication.
