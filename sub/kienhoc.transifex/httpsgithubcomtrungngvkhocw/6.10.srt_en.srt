This week we are going to talk about learning to learn. We asked thousands of people online—

1
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,230
on the edX system—a bunch of ways that they study. What we wanted you to do was to go

2
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,960
to the beginning of Episode 5 and answer eachof these questions.

3
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,829
We asked you things like &quot;I typically read sections of a textbook or chapters more than once.&quot;

4
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:42,780
Seventy-one percent of people saying that they reread information in preparation for exams.

5
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,649
Seventy-five percent of people highlight passages of their text. I study large amounts of information

6
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:53,989
in a short amount of time, cramming, 51%. I don&#39;t know about that. I think that

7
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:58,789
one might be a bit higher. And again, this is a nice example of what people say they

8
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:00,640
do versus what they actually do.

9
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,300
So do you study in a way, the way that you do because someone taught you to study that

10
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,159
way or because you learned to study this way on your own.

11
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:14,370
This was the whopping one, 91% of people said that they study this way on their own.

12
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:19,140
So, it&#39;s also clear in this survey, and other surveys, that people have no formal

13
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,680
instructions on learning to learn. A lot of people think that they know how to learn when

14
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,600
in fact, the things that they&#39;re doing are exactly the opposite of the the things that

15
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,410
would actually make the content stick in memory.

16
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:37,020
What I want to do though, is introduce you to what we mean by the testing effect.

17
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,110
Now these are the two groups. Group 1 and Group 2, side by side. They&#39;re studying for exactly

18
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:47,020
the same amount of time. The only difference between them is that first and that third

19
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:52,820
block of trials where Group 1 is studying and Group 2 is testing.  The group that studied,

20
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:58,870
studied, studied, studied, on a final recall test were about 60%. The group who did test,

21
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:05,010
study, test, study, were about 90% correct. Now that&#39;s huge! These effects don&#39;t get

22
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,929
much bigger than this, this is, that difference is called the testing effect.

23
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:11,580
What we are going to do now, is we&#39;re going to have you guys make your own flash cards.

24
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:17,319
So you can see what a good flash card looks like, and then see it in practice, and how

25
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,190
that can help us with retrieval practice.

26
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,440
This whole thing is a setup.

27
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,100
The irony of reading about cramming at 3 in the morning,

28
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,610
cramming for the subject I have at 9am.

29
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,670
You and your friend doing it, and then you switch, you&#39;re going to get more, I

30
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,380
think you&#39;d get more out of that then just you doing it. Because you&#39;d get their perspective

31
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,300
as well and what they know, maybe you missed something.

32
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,300
It didn&#39;t work when it was just random people, but when it was a group of friends, I think

33
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,300
it works better because you&#39;re more willing to say, &quot;No, you&#39;re wrong.&quot;

34
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,980
I have to like, reread which, apparently I shouldn&#39;t do, but I have to, look at

35
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:56,160
it a few times before I really, get the concept. So now I&#39;m like, well maybe I&#39;ll

36
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,959
start of by watching the videos, like today and then doing the quiz on Wednesday and then

37
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,040
doing some of the reading on Friday and that way I can be like, alright, I don&#39;t have

38
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,090
to do it all at once because it can be a bit heavy.

39
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,630
With the question and answers I&#39;ll write a massive explanation for why

40
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,760
that answer was, and that&#39;s pretty much the main way I study for these exams.
