So if you&#39;re a patient, and you&#39;re complaining, &quot;Ugh, my pelvis hurts,&quot; and you go to the

1
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,020
clinicâ€”they&#39;re either going to decide to operate or not on the basis of the information

2
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,289
they have in front of them.

3
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:23,900
Measles is, in most people&#39;s mind dismissed as a just a spotty skin disease. And for many people

4
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:29,800
who get measles, that&#39;s all it is. But one in a thousand will get a serious internal complication,

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,500
and one in a hundred thousand will be left with major brain damage as a result of measles infection.

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,030
The exact same thing is happening with the placebo effect. Again, there are two ways

00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:44,280
of being right, and two ways of being wrong. Four possible outcomes that can happen.

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,839
Most homeopathic remedies are labelled 30C. Which means one part active ingredient, to

9
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:58,500
one hundred to the power thirty parts water. Now, that&#39;s all of the atoms in the entire solar system.
