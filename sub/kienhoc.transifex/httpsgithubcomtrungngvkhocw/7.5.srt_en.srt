Now, given those examples we saw about attributing random negative events to a curse or something

1
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:17,860
like that and attributing random positive events to a magic pill or something like that,

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,590
once you&#39;ve made that false connection, that faulty connection, it would be really hard

3
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:29,640
to sort of un-see it, right? You experienced it. You saw that when you were sick and you

4
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,699
took this, you got better. You saw that when you took an exam and you did this, you did

5
00:00:35,699 --> 00:00:42,699
worse. That experience is real. I know I do this myself. Once I see that connection, it&#39;s

6
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:50,730
very hard for me to change my opinion if somebody tells me that that is not operating.

7
00:00:50,769 --> 00:00:56,889
That&#39;s right. That&#39;s exactly right. I think with opinion change, as we said before, it&#39;s

8
00:00:56,889 --> 00:01:03,889
not enough just to say that people like their own opinions or something like that. Instead,

9
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:12,620
it&#39;s really important to figure out why people are so resistant to opinion change: the intellectual

10
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:20,100
reasons, the cognitive reasons, the machinery, the processes that are operating for that resistance to opinion change.

11
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:26,810
We&#39;re going to talk about those in a second, but I think it&#39;s worth making it more concrete,

12
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:33,810
so let&#39;s give an example. I&#39;ve used this before in some of the classes I&#39;ve taught. We ask

13
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:40,880
people, &quot;Imagine yourself, given the choice between a large class, between taking a class

14
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:48,310
with 500, 1,000 people sitting in this giant lecture hall watching the professor, or taking

15
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:56,250
a small class, say 20 people, with a lecturer standing in front giving the same sort of

16
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,490
thing, which would you prefer?&quot; Now most people in that sort of context would say that they

17
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,190
would prefer the small class as opposed to the large class.

18
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,119
You&#39;ll learn more. You get more interaction and all the stuff...

19
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:13,340
That&#39;s right. As we talked about in episode five that you&#39;ll learn more. You&#39;ll learn

20
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,990
more—you&#39;ll retain it for longer if you&#39;re in a smaller class than in a larger class.

21
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:23,290
Again, going back to episode five, in that conversation with John Dunlosky, I asked him

22
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:29,030
about the difference between a large and a small class. Here&#39;s what he had to say.

23
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:34,510
A lot of students think that there&#39;s a real benefit to small classes over large classes.

24
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:39,560
I mean, we all have experience in sitting in lecture halls, massive, 500 people in the

25
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,270
lecture hall, versus an intimate 20 people in the lecture hall. Is there any evidence

26
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:52,400
that—I mean, we like to think that small classes are substantially better than large classes.

27
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,240
It seems intuitive that they would be, right, because we get more attention potentially

28
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,240
from your teachers and so forth. There is quite a bit of evidence, actually, enough

29
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,630
evidence to do meta-analysis after meta-analysis, and it turns out that the relationship between

30
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:11,060
class size and student achievement really is really small. In fact, it&#39;s almost nonsignificant

31
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:17,700
in many cases, which is startling, that it would be that way. But, in fact, smaller classes aren&#39;t necessarily better.

32
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,830
As John just said, there is this experiment of the difference between a large and a small

33
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:28,880
class and the learning outcomes that result. That&#39;s been done literally hundreds of times.

34
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,420
There has been roughly half of the experiments coming out in favor of the small class, and

35
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,739
roughly half of the experiments that have been done come out in favor of a large class,

36
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:41,690
or no difference between them whatsoever.

37
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:48,090
Now with this as a background, I use this example in my class with my students. I ask

38
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,280
them, &quot;What do you prefer?&quot; As I said, they say, &quot;I prefer a small class.&quot; I say, &quot;Okay.

39
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,280
Now I&#39;m going to give you a whole bunch of money.&quot; Imagine I&#39;m in a position where I

40
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,830
have a heap of research funds, and I give them as much money as they need. I want them

41
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:08,700
to test the difference between a large class and a small class, design the experiment,

42
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:14,110
and so they do. They design this elaborate experiment. We&#39;ve learnt a fair bit about

43
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,980
the experimental method,&quot; so they say things like, &quot;Well, we have to control as much as

44
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:22,389
possible, so you need the person at front of the class to be exactly—in front of a

45
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:26,290
large class to be the same person in front of the small. Maybe record them. Let&#39;s video-record

46
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,840
the person in the two classes and see. Being an audience member in a large class and being

47
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,280
an audience member in the small class, all things being equal, who&#39;s going to learn more?&quot;

48
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,030
They design this very elaborate experiment.

49
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,919
Then I actually give them the punch line. I say, &quot;Okay, this experiment that you&#39;ve

50
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:51,410
proposed has been done. It&#39;s been done a thousand times, and there has been no difference whatsoever.&quot;

51
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:58,410
Then I take another poll and say, &quot;Okay, students, now how many of you are willing to change

52
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,540
your mind? If I gave you the option of taking a large class and a small class now, how many

53
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,990
people are going to take the small class and how many people are going to take the large

54
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:12,790
class?&quot; There&#39;s no change. People who decided, the vast majority of them, if not all of them,

55
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,440
say, &quot;I&#39;d take the small class&quot; are still willing to take the small class despite the

56
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,970
fact that I said this experiment has been done hundreds of times, despite the fact that

57
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,270
there&#39;s no evidence to suggest that there&#39;s a difference between them.

58
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:33,270
Why? This is it. I mean, given this overwhelming evidence against the difference between large

59
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:39,510
and small classes, people just will not waiver. Then I asked them, &quot;Okay, well, why? Why won&#39;t

60
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:43,520
you change your mind? Why would you still continue to take the small classes as opposed

61
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,520
to a large?&quot; They say, &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know. I like them better,&quot; or, &quot;I don&#39;t like the

62
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,470
experiment that you proposed.&quot; But—you designed the experiment, right?

63
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,389
You designed the experiment, yes.

64
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:00,370
You&#39;re the one. That&#39;s why I have them do it because they&#39;re committed, and yet there

65
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:04,630
just doesn&#39;t seem to be any difference. This is the nature of the problem. I mean, we&#39;re

66
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,660
using a friendly benign example about small classes and large classes, but we&#39;re going

67
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:15,660
to see it come out again and again when we talk about extraordinary claims, ESP and things.

68
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:20,150
When we present evidence to people that doesn&#39;t consist with their worldview, what would they

69
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,900
do in the face of this new evidence?

70
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,360
When we ask those students to take it to the next level, to reflect on why people are reluctant

71
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,900
to change their minds, they tend to give motivational explanations. They&#39;re like, &quot;Well, people

72
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,100
don&#39;t like to look stupid in front of their friends and family,&quot; like changing their minds

73
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:44,850
makes them look intellectually weak or something like that. But those motivational examples

74
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,669
aren&#39;t enough. We need to focus on the cognitive, the intellectual explanations, for why it&#39;s

75
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:51,229
so difficult to change your mind.

76
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:58,229
I think there&#39;s two things going on. The first is called source amnesia. We have difficulty

77
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:04,009
remembering why it is we believe in something. Think about this: what makes you think you

78
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:11,400
have access, that you can instantly recall the exact basis for why you believe something?

79
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:18,400
&quot;Yes, I read this paper that found this effect,&quot; or, &quot;I remember doing really well in a small class and not in a large class.&quot;

80
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,229
In 1987.

81
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:24,850
&quot;Yes, my memory is that good—I&#39;m just pulling it all, and that&#39;s why I believe it.&quot; That

82
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:30,800
source amnesia, that difficulty in remembering, is one of the factors that makes it hard to change your mind.

83
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:36,570
The second thing that makes it difficult to change minds is it&#39;s hard to reconcile what

84
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:42,050
it is you believed previously with this new data. Again, that&#39;s cognitively difficult.

85
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,300
You&#39;ve got this new evidence that&#39;s come in, and you have your former belief. That takes

86
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,169
some work to put those two things together. It can&#39;t be done in the heat of the moment.

87
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:56,680
You have to do some work. It might take days. It might take weeks for you to reconcile this

88
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,500
new information with your previous belief.

89
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:04,729
Those are the two things that I think make it difficult for people, for us, to change

90
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:11,729
our opinions. So it&#39;s not enough to say that people are silly to give these motivational

91
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:18,669
explanations. We have to look at why it&#39;s difficult to change minds. Evidence alone

92
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:24,389
is not enough to change minds. You need evidence plus a good story. You need to show people

93
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:26,770
what they can change their minds to.

94
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:32,089
That&#39;s right. I think, going back to the large class-small class difference, for example,

95
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:37,180
I would&#39;ve been extremely surprised if I ask my students, after just presenting a couple

96
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:42,740
of papers or on my authority, to say that, &quot;No, there&#39;s no difference between a large

97
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:48,320
and a small class.&quot; If they just spun on a dime right there and said, &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll take

98
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,490
a large class instead of a small class,&quot; I would&#39;ve been astonished if they would&#39;ve

99
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:58,120
done that for exactly the right reasons. I think, as you said, it takes work. It takes

100
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:04,270
an enormous amount of effort to reconcile the information as new wealth of evidence

101
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:09,940
that they&#39;ve just been exposed to. How do you integrate that with a lifetime of experience?

102
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,420
It&#39;s really difficult. We&#39;re going to help, I think.

103
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:19,520
Next, we&#39;re going to talk about six leads of opinion change. Now these are things that

104
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:26,390
students in the course can use when they&#39;re encountering new evidence that contradicts

105
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:33,390
a belief that they hold dear for themselves or for other people. I&#39;ve done this myself.

106
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,990
These are really useful tools to be able to say, &quot;Okay. Well, here&#39;s something I believe.

107
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:47,640
This is a belief that I hold dear, and I&#39;ve just been presented with evidence that completely

108
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:53,480
obliterates what I had thought was true. Now what do I do about that?&quot;

109
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,209
What do I do? Yes.

110
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:56,560
So what are some of these six leads that we can deal with?
