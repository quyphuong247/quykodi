So, that's the background, published the paper in '85. Come the early '90s, I get a phone call

1
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:14,730
from the lawyers for Judas Priest in Reno, Nevada, where the trial was going to take place.

2
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:22,000
This is a civil suit. The plaintiffs have filed for millions of dollars, by the way, in damages.

3
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:28,220
So she calls me up and says, “You're the only authorities on this. Nobody else has

4
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,750
ever published a paper on backward messages”. They were claiming there were a number of

5
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,910
backward subliminals in this particular album, the "Stained Class" album by Judas Priest.

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,379
I said, "Okay, that's fine. I'm more than happy to serve as an expert for you.

7
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:44,449
I'll provide you with all the research I can get for you and other kinds of things."

8
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:50,300
She says, "Well, thank you very much. It's very nice, but, no, we want you to come and testify for us."

9
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,980
I said, "Well, there's a problem."

10
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,149
She goes, "What problem?"

11
00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:01,559
I said, "You probably want my co-author to do this job. He's actually had experience

12
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,659
in court as an expert witness, not on this domain but an eyewitness testimony."

13
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:10,570
She said, "No, no, you're the first author. We have to have you."

14
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,830
I said, "Well, I'll tell you what, I'll only agree to do all this and come to the

15
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,210
trial if you bring my colleague with me."

16
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,190
She said, "Yes, fine. No big deal."

17
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:26,180
And so a year, or almost a year—she calls me once, twice a week. We talk about things,

18
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,530
"How are things going," and so on. She says, "Okay, so are you ready? Did you get

19
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,250
to think about your testimony," and that kind of stuff.

20
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,970
Well, I said, "I think you really want my colleague."

21
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:39,250
So here's what happens: the day of, we were flying down there for the first weekend meeting,

22
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:45,140
an actual face-to-face meeting. Now the reason I was reticent, and I'd actually told her,

23
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:52,140
is that I actually look like one of the band members—shaggy, long, blonde hair—and

24
00:01:55,070 --> 00:02:02,070
the judge is known for having somewhat a less-than-positive attitude toward people who look like me.

25
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,050
She's all, "Not a problem. Don't worry about it."

26
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:13,040
So the day we were to fly down to meet the team and Judas Priest, Don Read was leaving

27
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,060
from I think it was Vancouver, and he headed earlier to Reno than I did from Lethbridge,

28
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,269
so I'm the last to arrive. It was about five in the afternoon. I go to the cab, and

29
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:25,450
a big law firm, and I go in there, and it was a big meeting room with these big doors

30
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:30,579
that open—very, very dramatic entrance. I come walking in, and there's this woman

31
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:33,189
I've been talking to for years. They had lawyers. All the other lawyers and Judas Priest

32
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:36,209
are around the table. There's Don sitting there. I'm walking in, and she looks up

33
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:40,900
at me, and she goes, "Oh, my God," and then says, "Now, Don, when you're on the

34
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:47,900
stand..." So I actually didn't testify at the Judas Priest trial.

35
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,659
Wow.
