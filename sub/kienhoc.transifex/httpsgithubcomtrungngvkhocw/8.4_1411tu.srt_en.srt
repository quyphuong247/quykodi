Can you tell me a little bit about your research into the paranormal?

1
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:13,389
Well, I started my working life many years ago as a magician, and so lots of my research

2
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:18,000
looks at how people kid themselves that they are looking at something paranormal when actually

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,230
it has a normal explanation. Because that&#39;s what magicians do all the time: they convince

4
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,820
you they&#39;re performing miracles, when actually there&#39;s a very ugly, normal explanation for

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,400
what it is they&#39;re up to. So I guess I use that background to springboard into looking into paranormal claims.

6
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:39,239
What are we talking here when we say belief in the paranormal? Psychics talking to the

7
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,730
dead—what are some specific examples that you&#39;ve dealt with?

8
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:48,090
Yes, I&#39;ve looked at mediums who claim to talk to the dead, psychics who will tell you something

9
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,570
about yourself that they let to be picked up through their amazing abilities and sometimes

10
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,600
predict the future, and that could take many forms. It might be a tarot reader. It might

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,879
be a palmist. It might be somebody looking at the tea leaves or a crystal ball. Very

12
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:08,530
rarely, you&#39;ll get people who claim psychokinesis, mind over matter. They&#39;ll focus on a spoon,

13
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:13,110
for example, and it will start to bend, something like that. All those things would come under

14
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,520
the remit of extraordinary abilities.

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,340
I&#39;ve seen some pretty convincing examples of psychic ability. A psychic might claim

16
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:29,340
that something will happen in the future, and it seems very detailed and specific. Then

17
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:37,700
the person who&#39;s being read—it turns out to be true for them. What&#39;s your response to that?

18
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,920
I think when you go to a psychic or a medium, there are several psychological mechanisms

19
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,810
at play. One is what&#39;s called Barnum statements, these very general statements that are true

20
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,610
of everyone but we think they&#39;re just true of us.

21
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,869
The notion that you look at someone&#39;s palm and say, &quot;You&#39;ve got a lot of untapped creative

22
00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:01,300
potential.&quot; We all like to go: &quot;Yes, my goodness. How terribly insightful.&quot; They&#39;re just true of everyone.

23
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,740
Some of them are double-headers. You&#39;re the sort of person that enjoys going to parties

24
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:11,100
but also you enjoy being alone with a book. Of course that covers both the extroverts and introverts.

25
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:17,260
Other times, there&#39;s a lot of predictions being thrown out. Then what happens is if

26
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:23,020
the prediction comes true, the person remembers the reading and forgets all of the other predictions

27
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,750
which didn&#39;t come true, which is a kind of spread betting, if you like.

28
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,500
Sometimes, they&#39;re self-fulfilling prophecy. You say to somebody, &quot;My goodness, you&#39;re

29
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,489
applying for some sort of new job,&quot; and they go, &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s going to go really well.&quot;

30
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:41,400
Well, now they&#39;re extra confident when they go into the interview, and so the prediction creates the future.

31
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,980
Most of the time, when someone&#39;s talking to us, they talk about what they&#39;re going to

32
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:51,800
do in the evening or whatever, it&#39;s pretty vague, and we sharpen up those comments to make sense of them.

33
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:57,900
That&#39;s what&#39;s happening when you go to a psychic. The difference is they can&#39;t actually predict the future.

34
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,209
The fact that we are so good at communicating with one another, that we can infer what somebody

35
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:07,030
means even though the words aren&#39;t there, means that we&#39;re wonderful interpersonally

36
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,030
and it&#39;s also the price you pay then to go along to a psychic and trip yourself up, thinking

37
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,319
that they can actually predict the future.

38
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:19,629
All these different mechanisms are at play. To me, what&#39;s interesting is it doesn&#39;t look

39
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:23,440
like that. It looks like you go in; this person tells you all about yourself; predicts something

40
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,190
about the future; comes true; isn&#39;t that incredible? Actually, it&#39;s quite complicated. There isn&#39;t

41
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,709
one psychology there. There are several psychological mechanisms.

42
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:37,370
It seems a common explanation for these kind of beliefs, especially if you&#39;re a non-believer in the

43
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:42,739
paranormal is, &quot;People are just stupid; they&#39;ll believe anything&quot;. But you mentioned that there

44
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:49,739
are a lot of psychological mechanisms behind there. Do you think it&#39;s true that psychological

45
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:56,930
mechanisms are a more powerful way to explain this stuff than, say, motivations and personality?

46
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,680
I think the notion that people who believe in this stuff is stupid simply isn&#39;t true.

47
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,330
There&#39;s been some research looking at IQ, which is, if you like, a measure of intelligence

48
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,510
and, I believe, in the paranormal—there&#39;s not much of a relationship there. There might

49
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,920
be a small one, but it&#39;s not particularly striking.

50
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,699
I think what&#39;s happening is that a lot of people want to believe in this stuff. Why

51
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:26,820
else would you go to psychic? You are probably looking for some sort of guidance. So I always

52
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,389
say it&#39;s a little bit like going to a doctor if you didn&#39;t feel very well. The doctor says,

53
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:34,919
&quot;What are the symptoms?&quot; You say, &quot;Well, you&#39;re the expert. You tell me.&quot; It would be a ridiculous

54
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:39,300
thing to say—the two of you are there to work on the problem together. I think that&#39;s

55
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,400
the attitude of most people going to a psychic: &quot;I have a problem. We are here to work on

56
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:51,400
it together,&quot; and so all of those biases flow in as you try and make sense of the situation.

57
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:56,460
There is some research suggesting that if people are having a tough time in their lives,

58
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:01,630
if they&#39;re facing uncertainty, or as a child they faced a lot of uncertainty and upset,

59
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:06,259
then that tends to bias them towards believing in the paranormal, thinking there is a magical

60
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:12,330
solution to their problems. The people who are going along to a psychic or medium can

61
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:17,789
be quite psychologically vulnerable. Of course one of the issues here is whether going along

62
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:24,100
to the psychic or medium helps, and whether they&#39;d be better off in a more sort of mainstream counseling scenario.

63
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:29,020
Can you tell me about the nature of superstitious belief? Why do you suppose it is that we all

64
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,460
believe some pretty strange things?

65
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:37,430
Well, superstition is fascinating in part because it&#39;s so widespread. Although only

66
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,759
a third or half of people believe in the psychic or medium, almost 90, 95 percent of people

67
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,539
would touch wood, cross their fingers, whatever it is. In that sense, we&#39;re all irrational.

68
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:49,430
Let us not believe that we&#39;re rational creatures.

69
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,660
Why do we go for it? Well, I suspect because we&#39;re told from a very young age that there might

70
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:00,569
be something to it. Otherwise, you might get bad luck, and that&#39;s a real problem. It only

71
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:04,990
takes a few seconds just to touch wood or whatever. If it was a very elaborate ritual,

72
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,780
I suspect it wouldn&#39;t catch on quite so quickly. If the idea was you have to do three or forward

73
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:13,620
rows and a star jump every single time you say something like, &quot;I hope that goes well,&quot;

74
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,380
then people wouldn&#39;t be quite superstitious. Part of it is it costs very little and, if

75
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,740
it is true, the benefits are enormous.

76
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:27,819
The other thing is that we often are one-trial learners. If we do something, like we wear

77
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:32,710
a lucky shirt, and we go along for a job interview and, oh my goodness, it goes wonderfully,

78
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:37,889
then we think, &quot;Wow, somehow this shirt is somehow linked to me doing well, and I&#39;ll

79
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:44,380
wear it again next time,&quot; in exactly the same way that sportspeople will lace up their shoes

80
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:50,120
in a certain way because when they did that once, suddenly it was a great performance.

81
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,259
We are naturally good at linking things like that, which leads us to be superstitious,

82
00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:00,229
particularly under conditions of uncertainty. Of course, the most superstitious groups are

83
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:04,750
sportspeople, who have to perform in a certain window of time; actors, exactly the same.

84
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,100
It&#39;s uncertainty that drives that belief.

85
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:14,139
I would say to both skeptics and believers: try and base your thoughts and your beliefs

86
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:18,389
on the evidence. That&#39;s what you do in many different areas of your life. You wouldn&#39;t

87
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:22,990
go along to buy a used or a secondhand car and you go, &quot;I&#39;ll trust my intuition.&quot; If

88
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,910
you didn&#39;t understand about cars, you&#39;d take someone with you who did because this is an

89
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:32,400
area where you need evidence. I would say, if you&#39;re going along to a psychic or a medium,

90
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:39,100
understand the tricks of the trade, be an informed client, and if you see them being used, get out of there.

91
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:41,340
My name is Richard. I think about the paranormal.
