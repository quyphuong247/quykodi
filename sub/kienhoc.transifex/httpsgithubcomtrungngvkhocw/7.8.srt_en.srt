Now, to recap what we talked about today, we started, again, reiterating, picking

1
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,809
up where we left off last week, and thinking about everyday thinking and the intuitive

2
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:23,800
scientist and looking at the world through the eyes, through the methodologies of the

3
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:35,600
scientific method. With the scientific method, this is a way that we need to deal with complex and ambiguous events.

4
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:40,999
One of the complexities and ambiguities that we&#39;re dealing with are these ideas of multiple

5
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:44,519
independent error factors, which we talked about. Sometimes things are going to work

6
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:49,920
for you, sometimes against, and you&#39;re going to improve sometimes after a lump of bad events,

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:57,900
or drop after a bunch of good events, and this is just a natural process called regression to the mean.

8
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:04,320
When dealing with regression to the mean, this is just a statistical phenomenon. There&#39;s

9
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:11,320
nothing fishy or mysterious or superstitious or magical about it, yet we often think that

10
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,590
there is. When you have a vial of water and you get better, you attribute it to the water.

11
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:23,910
You make these false connections. We do this all of the time. We&#39;re starting to get a handle

12
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:29,770
on the cognitive operations for why people believe weird things and what we can do about

13
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:35,570
it. And, as we&#39;ve just seen, now we have six leads that we can use when people have strong

14
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:40,500
opinions about these kind of events. What do you do when there&#39;s evidence that contradicts

15
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,110
a belief that you hold dear? Well, this is a starting point. We&#39;re going to pick up there

16
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:51,700
next week when we deal, as I said, with some more challenging types of events with extraordinary claims.
