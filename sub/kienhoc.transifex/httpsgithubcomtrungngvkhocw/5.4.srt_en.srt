A lot of people who are coming into the course tend to think that the mind or the human brain

1
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:17,790
is like a video camera, so you can rewind and replay faithfully the information you&#39;ve

2
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:24,490
accumulated, or the information is somehow limited, so people can only store a certain

3
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:30,919
amount of information before they lose it to something else. Is that how the mind works,

4
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:34,760
or what&#39;s a better conception of the way that memory works?

5
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:41,760
Now that&#39;s a very good question. I once taught a course where the structure was in

6
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:47,060
all the critical ways that we differ from anything like a tape recorder, and it really

7
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:54,060
is just a whole array of things. But people&#39;s general notion that they work something like

8
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:01,890
a tape recorder or any kind of recorder leads them to do very non-adaptive things. They

9
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:08,030
take notes like a court stenographer in a course, trying to remember something, and

10
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,969
a court stenographer can get every word down all day long and not be able to tell you what

11
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:15,979
the whole trial was about.

12
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:22,979
Then also some notion that when I retrieve information, I leave it the way it was before,

13
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:31,890
which should be true of a compact disc or something, but whereas in the case of human

14
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,630
memory retrieval, it&#39;s a very dynamic process. It alters the state of the system. It makes

15
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,409
what you retrieve more retrievable in the future, things in competition with it less

16
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:49,409
recallable. So both on that kind of what memory researchers call the encoding side, and on

17
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:55,200
a retrieval side, we differ in just absolutely critical ways.

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,700
One of the mysteries, one of the continuing interests in just how people learn and how

19
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:07,700
they should learn, is why wouldn&#39;t we—across our schooling years and stuff, just from the

20
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:13,860
trials and errors of everyday living and learning—why wouldn&#39;t we learn how the thing works? That

21
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,629
really is a mystery. About one component of that, I think, is we may not understand the

22
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:26,629
engineering details of the computer memory, memory in the computer, or how a disc of some

23
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,680
kind works, but we sort of understand the logic of it. I think or we think, well, we

24
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:44,200
probably work something like that. We don&#39;t work like that at all. It&#39;s a very different kind of architecture.

25
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:51,280
So given what we do know now—you&#39;ve had a long career of studying how people remember

26
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:59,409
and retrieve information—what&#39;s the best way to try to maximize that? How do you—again,

27
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,400
some of the people who are watching this course want to know how to study better, how to retain

28
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,019
information better. It probably isn&#39;t very intuitive, given what I know about your work.

29
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:19,700
What they think they know about memory and how to remember information probably isn&#39;t accurate. What is?

30
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:25,840
Yes. It makes a lot of difference what activities you engage in, trying to learn. There are

31
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,879
a couple of key things to remember that then lead to important—just things to have in

32
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:37,489
your repertoire when you&#39;re trying to learn. One is we&#39;ve already sort of mentioned that

33
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:44,489
we don&#39;t work like a tape recorder. A key feature of storage in our memories is that

34
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:52,640
that&#39;s a process of linking up any new information with what we already know. In fact, rather

35
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,859
than thinking of your memory as some sort of box or tape that the more that you have

36
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:04,499
in it or on it, the less room you have, actually memory storage creates capacity for additional

37
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:09,439
storage. The more knowledge you have in some domain, the more ways there are to link things

38
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,900
up and hook things up. It&#39;s almost like a scaffolding structure, that the more it&#39;s

39
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,989
built up, the more places there are to put things.

40
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:23,190
So always, you want to make an effort to link this to your everyday experience, to what

41
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:28,710
you already know; think of an example, try to extend it—all of those things really

42
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:37,100
help at the stage of trying to encode the information. Almost any way you can be active really helps.

43
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:44,120
A very broad principle is to test yourself. Practice trying to generate the information.

44
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:50,180
Do you know it? Get together with your friend. Ask each other questions. When you just look

45
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:55,810
at information in a text or on a screen, your judgment of whether you understand it, know

46
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:02,810
it, could answer questions about it is very flawed; whereas if you test yourself with

47
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:09,690
a friend or by yourself, you get good information about whether you know it or not. Another

48
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:16,800
benefit, of course, I mentioned earlier—is the very fact that retrieving it will make it more recallable in the future.

49
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:22,960
Then there&#39;s a third important thing. It potentiates the effectiveness of your subsequent

50
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,569
study. If you&#39;ve tested yourself—and I don&#39;t mean testing in such a formal way.

51
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:33,370
You can just stop and think: could you summarize this? You&#39;re together with a friend; try to

52
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:38,680
come up with a question and a structure you might ask. Those things will then help you

53
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,880
study better. They&#39;ll potentiate the effectiveness of study the next time you study. That&#39;s

54
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,470
absolutely important. The key is to test yourself.

55
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:54,610
I sometimes tell undergraduate students that, just an overall principle, is that they should

56
00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:01,470
input less and output more. Spend less time highlighting, copying, rereading—spending

57
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:08,300
more time trying to come up with another example, trying to answer a possible question, trying

58
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:15,199
to reproduce the outline of this chapter, all these things, try to sort of generate

59
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,810
this material, rather than trying to have it write itself on you. The whole effort to

60
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:28,009
just copy it down, with the whole notion that it will sort of write itself on you if you&#39;re

61
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:35,009
diligent enough, is just so wrong and so wasteful, that to spend that much time—often, students

62
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:43,050
have come who are disappointed in their exam. I ask them to bring their textbook, their

63
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:49,419
notes, tell me how they&#39;re trying to study. There&#39;s evidence of a massive effort, a

64
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:54,150
huge amount of time spent on this. Sometimes things are highlighted to the point the only

65
00:06:54,150 --> 00:07:04,100
thing that stands out is what&#39;s not highlighted. That activity is not a productive activity, so you really have to learn.

66
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,530
Then there&#39;s other principles like the very well-known spacing effect. If you&#39;re going

67
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:16,009
to study something twice, don&#39;t just read this chapter again right away to try and see

68
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:21,830
what you missed. Go on to other material, other courses, and then come back to it. That&#39;s

69
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:30,700
called the spacing effect, and spacing your study opportunities can lead sometimes to doubling of your later recall.

70
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:37,710
How you manage yourself really matters, and there&#39;s a whole series of things to learn

71
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,190
about just managing your own study activities.

72
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:48,270
Then some sense of how easy it is to get misled—some of the poorest things that you can do from

73
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:55,270
a learning standpoint, create an illusion that you&#39;re learning rapidly. Massing study

74
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,840
sessions that are practiced makes people improve rapidly and then forget very rapidly.

75
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:09,069
Becoming sophisticated as a learner has a lot of components. You have to monitor your

76
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:15,240
state of learning well; you have to control it, a whole series of knowledge about sort

77
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:22,240
of activities, use technologies well, rather than poorly. It matters.
