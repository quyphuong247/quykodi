One area I’m particularly interested in is happiness. We like to think, I like to

1
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,760
think, that I can predict what will make me happy and unhappy. But in fact we asked people

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,910
at the beginning of this course some questions about happiness. We told people at the start

3
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:26,869
of this episode some things about some fictitious people, so for example, Jones, who earns 20,000

4
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:32,000
dollars a year, and Smith, who earns 100,000 dollars year; a couple of other people who

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,399
had really close supervision at work, versus another person who sort of had free reign;

6
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:43,809
a person who is married and someone else who is unmarried; someone who had really good

7
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:47,569
health benefits and somebody else who didn’t.

8
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:53,879
We asked people to predict how happy these two people were, and what people did predict

9
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,829
was that the people in the unfortunate situation would be completely miserable most of the

10
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:03,819
time. They&#39;d just be walking around with a frown, completely unhappy. But the people

11
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:08,649
in the fortunate situation who had excellent benefits and who were earning far more money

12
00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:12,659
than they knew what to do with every year would be really, really happy.

13
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:19,659
For example, Danny Kahneman has done this experiment where in fact these people aren&#39;t

14
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,240
any happier than anybody else. The people in the seemingly unfortunate situations are

15
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,689
just as happy as the people in the seemingly fortunate situations.

16
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:35,500
This kind of highlights one of the points of this episode, and that is: we don&#39;t really

17
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:41,509
have any conscious access to the determinants of our own behavior. Happiness is exactly

18
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:47,409
one example of that, so people in those two situations—I mean, we&#39;re talking about fictitious

19
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:54,189
people in this case, but people don&#39;t really seem to take into account when something is

20
00:01:54,189 --> 00:02:01,189
going to make them happy or unhappy. So we often, as this experiment demonstrated—money

21
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:07,869
doesn&#39;t necessarily buy happiness even though we think that it does. Often we would take

22
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:14,869
a higher-paying job at the expense, for example, of commuting longer. Now commuting longer

23
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:21,660
is horrible for one&#39;s happiness, right? Spending time in traffic is probably the worst thing

24
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:28,110
that people can rate on a scale of happiness. Yet taking more money and moving further out

25
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:35,110
is something that&#39;s commonly done. Again, if you have this idea that money doesn&#39;t buy

26
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,550
happiness, that we have no real insight into that fact, then we might make different decisions

27
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:46,280
about the determinants of our own fates, of what we&#39;re planning on doing.

28
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:53,220
It really seems like we don&#39;t have any privileged access into our own consciousness, and happiness

29
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,400
isn&#39;t really an exception to that rule.

30
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,590
Exactly. Here&#39;s what Richard Nisbett had to say about what makes us happy.
