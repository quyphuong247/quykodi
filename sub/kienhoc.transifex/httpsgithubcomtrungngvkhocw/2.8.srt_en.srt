Many of us have the intuition that we see and hear and remember everything. Does our

1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,820
mind work like a video camera?

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,449
It definitely doesn&#39;t work like a video camera or any kind of recording device. We&#39;re

3
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:23,449
not just taking in information and replaying it later. The whole process is much more complex.

4
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:31,310
Actually, memory is reconstructive. We&#39;re taking bits and pieces of experience—sometimes

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,649
things that happened at different times and places—in constructing our memories.

6
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:40,870
Recollecting.

7
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:47,059
When we recall something, the process is more like one of reconstruction.

8
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:53,359
Okay. Is that a perfect process? Is it fallible? How does it work?

9
00:00:53,359 --> 00:01:00,359
Well, what happens, when you go through life, you have experiences and you may store bits

10
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:07,750
and pieces of information, but later on other things can happen. People can talk to you.

11
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,300
You can tell people about your experiences. You can be fed misinformation about the experience.

12
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:21,300
These activities can change your memory, can transform or distort your memory, so that

13
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:30,300
when you try to call up a memory for a past event, you&#39;re reconstructing, and there can be lots of errors.

14
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:37,360
Okay. But, surely if I&#39;m really confident about my belief or my recollection and it&#39;s

15
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,000
sincere and really emotional, surely that means it&#39;s more likely to be an accurate memory.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,540
Well, it may be slightly more likely to be an accurate memory if you&#39;re really confident

17
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:55,540
about it, but confidence is not a good indicator that your memory is accurate because false

18
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:03,570
memories can be expressed with a lot of confidence. They can be expressed with a lot of detail.

19
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,810
They can be expressed with a lot of emotion. They have the same characteristics as true

20
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:18,200
memories, and just relying on those characteristics can mislead people into thinking that something is real when it&#39;s not.

21
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:24,150
Is it possible to implant a false memory, make somebody believe something happened when

22
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,359
it never actually happened?

23
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:32,359
Absolutely. I mean, in my own work, for example, we&#39;ve changed people&#39;s memories for the

24
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:37,629
details of events that they did experience. We&#39;ve made people, for example, believe

25
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:43,799
that a car went through a stop sign instead of a yield sign, or a guy running from the

26
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:48,439
scene had curly hair instead of straight hair. That&#39;s really easy to do. But you can go

27
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:54,280
further with people. You can plant entirely false memories, whole memories, into the minds

28
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,510
of people for things that didn&#39;t happen.

29
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:01,760
Wow. So surely that has implications for people testifying in court, like witnesses saying,

30
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,859
&quot;Yes, that was the guy that committed the crime,&quot; or, &quot;Yes, the car went through

31
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:10,569
the stop sign and hit the other car.&quot; Does your research have implications for the courtroom?

32
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:16,999
Well, it does because—you know, most of the time little errors that we make in memory

33
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:23,189
don&#39;t matter very much. I mean, it doesn&#39;t really matter if I tell you that I had a hamburger

34
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:30,129
for lunch instead of chicken, but when it comes to the legal world, now very precise

35
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:37,129
memory matters, and so memory evidence is precious. It needs to be preserved. It needs

36
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:44,389
to be protected. Unfortunately, a lot of times, it&#39;s not, and people or circumstances get

37
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:52,230
in there and contaminate those memory traces and lead to travesties of justice.

38
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:55,989
Wow. Are there any famous cases of false memories?

39
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:02,620
Oh, gosh. I&#39;m trying to figure out where I would begin. There are certainly a lot of

40
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:09,620
famous politicians who have had distorted memories. One of my favorite ones is Hillary

41
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:17,169
Clinton, who was running for the presidency of the United States, when she talked about

42
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:22,860
a trip that she had taken to Bosnia. She had a very vivid recollection of landing under

43
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:29,690
sniper fire on this trip. It was supposed to be a greeting ceremony, but instead they

44
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:36,690
just had to run to the base. Later, photographs were revealed of this landing in Bosnia, and

45
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:45,660
it was extremely peaceful. Lots of children there. Hillary&#39;s daughter was there. So

46
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:52,910
what&#39;s going here? She had a distorted memory, one that resulted in a little bit of embarrassment

47
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:59,750
for her because people called her Pinocchio, but she made a mistake. I mean, she had a

48
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:06,750
false memory. Her case shows us that all that intelligence, all that experience, all that

49
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,930
education, all that Yale Law School degree, doesn&#39;t protect you from having false memories.

50
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:19,930
We can all make those mistakes. That&#39;s interesting. Do we ever repress memories? If there&#39;s

51
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,500
something bad that&#39;s happened in our childhood that we might want to forget on some level,

52
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,420
do we ever repress memories, and do they ever come back without our knowledge?

53
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:36,780
On this whole question of repression, I have to say that what we do do is we sometimes

54
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:41,710
don&#39;t think about things for a long time and can be reminded of them. Sometimes unpleasant

55
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,860
experiences, we don&#39;t think about for a long time and we can be reminded of them.

56
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,690
But that is ordinary forgetting and remembering. This notion of repression, that you can take

57
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:58,750
years of brutalization, banish it into the unconscious where it&#39;s walled off from the

58
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:04,560
rest of mental life, and then get it there and reliably recover it all—just no credible

59
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,560
scientific support this. And yet many people have been prosecuted or sued civilly based

60
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,490
on claims of repression and so-called derepression.

61
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,490
Is it possible to tell the difference between a true and a false memory?

62
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,400
We haven&#39;t had very much luck doing that. I mean, we&#39;ve tried looking at emotional

63
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,970
ratings. Maybe people are more emotional about their true ratings, but that doesn&#39;t make

64
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:36,970
a difference. Maybe you see different brain images if you did put people in an FMRI machine,

65
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:42,660
and you&#39;d see differences between true and false memories, but there are barely any differences.

66
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:48,110
Maybe true memories and false memories would persist differentially. Maybe true memories

67
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:55,110
persist longer, but we don&#39;t see any evidence for that.
