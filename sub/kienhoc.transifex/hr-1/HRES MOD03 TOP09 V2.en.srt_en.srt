Hi.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,390
Welcome to topic nine
on informal learning.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,600
Now, there's a few different
ways that we learn,

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,880
and in this topic we'll
really focus mainly

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,220
around informal and
incidental learning.

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,090
And we'll go through what each
of these means in a moment.

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,920
But it's really
important to understand

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,590
that the way that
people learn naturally

10
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,880
is always the best possible
way, because you're

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,680
more likely to retain and
remember the information

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,930
and be able to apply
what you've understood.

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,420
So more than anything, the
focus behind this topic

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,270
is really how do we
foster and how do we

15
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,640
encourage people
to learn naturally,

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,354
because we know we'll get
the best outcome from them.

17
00:00:44,354 --> 00:00:46,519
Let's look at what these
different types of learning

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,140
are.

19
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,810
So, as we mentioned, we
have our formal learning,

20
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,160
which is you're going
to a training session,

21
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,059
or sitting through a
seminar, and that's

22
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,080
kind of structured, formal
systems of learning.

23
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,679
And it can also include
online learning,

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,701
as we mentioned in
our previous topic.

25
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:08,199
So it can be
e-learning, things like

26
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,450
that, structured,
formalized learning.

27
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,950
And this is usually the
one that most organizations

28
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,730
seem to focus on because
it has the greater

29
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,090
perception that we're training
people because they've

30
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,710
been to a course so,
therefore, there's training.

31
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,511
And it's a way to justify
the budget and the spend,

32
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:28,009
but it doesn't
necessarily mean it's

33
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,590
the best way for people to
learn in every circumstance.

34
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,300
Our next one is
informal learning.

35
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,130
So informal learning can really
be a whole variety of things.

36
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,550
And it's often when we
deal with other employees

37
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,690
in our organization.

38
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,950
And it's often
spur of the moment,

39
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,040
and then they've explained
this is how we do xyz.

40
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,410
This is how we enter
something into a system.

41
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,020
And it's learning that's
occurring naturally

42
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,200
just in the process
of communication

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,590
with other employees,
with managers,

44
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,047
with subordinates,
and just anyone really

45
00:02:00,047 --> 00:02:00,880
in the organization.

46
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,410
It's a way that we develop
skills and knowledge

47
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,310
in a less structured way.

48
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,220
And very similarly, if we
look at incidental learning,

49
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,050
incidental learning is
almost learning by accident.

50
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,370
You happen to be doing a task,
and as you've done that task

51
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,070
you've discovered a
significantly faster, easier,

52
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,769
more productive method of doing
this particular task almost

53
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,480
by accident.

54
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,329
So it's learning that
occurs as you happen

55
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,930
to be undertaking activities
and tasks that you

56
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,810
would do in your workplace.

57
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,860
And it hasn't really
been planned for,

58
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,757
so it really is unplanned.

59
00:02:35,757 --> 00:02:38,090
Although informal learning
and incidental learning sound

60
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,400
very similar,
informal learning does

61
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,160
have some degree of planning.

62
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,980
So, for example, when you
enter a new work place

63
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,613
and they may set you
up with a buddy--

64
00:02:46,614 --> 00:02:48,280
so someone else who
is a little bit more

65
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,080
experienced than you-- and
they're explaining to you how

66
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,510
to do different tasks and
processes in the organization,

67
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,450
it's really informal learning.

68
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,129
But it's in a
structured, planned way.

69
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:00,670
And that's one of
the key differences

70
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,850
between incidental and informal.

71
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:07,220
And why we really need to
focus on really fostering

72
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,730
informal types of learning
is because essentially

73
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,590
informal learning makes
up approximately 30%

74
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,260
of all the learning that
we do in an organization.

75
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,590
Whereas, formal learning
only makes up about 7%.

76
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,900
And it's more effective in many
cases than formal learning.

77
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,940
And that's why we really
need to spend some time

78
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,340
and focus and see
how we can encourage

79
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,580
this type of learning
in organizations.

80
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,490
So let's go through a couple
of just quick strategies

81
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,190
that we can use
in an organization

82
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:38,870
to help foster and
encourage informal learning.

83
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,177
I know we all seem
to hate meetings.

84
00:03:41,177 --> 00:03:42,760
Everyone hates having
a meeting and we

85
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,100
do the eye rolling-- oh,
I've got another meeting.

86
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,660
And that often occurs.

87
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,230
But there's value in meetings.

88
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,200
Meetings are actually a very
simple, effective opportunity

89
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,390
for informal learning.

90
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,399
It's often in those
discussions in our meetings

91
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,980
that we learn new
aspects of the business.

92
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,540
We may learn a new method.

93
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,400
We may learn some
information that

94
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,840
will improve the way that we
do a task in the organization.

95
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,630
So they're a really
valuable source, or tool,

96
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,240
for informal learning.

97
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,320
Action reviews are basically
where, for example,

98
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,320
you've undertaken a project,
and at the end of the project--

99
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,190
it's all concluded--
you may sit down

100
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,680
with all the key stakeholders,
all the people involved

101
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,890
in that project, and
you sit and look,

102
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,570
what did we do effectively,
what didn't we do effectively,

103
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,750
what were some of
the barriers to being

104
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,580
able to achieve the goals
that we wanted to achieve.

105
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,789
And you're retrospectively
looking at the project.

106
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,830
And these action reviews
are not about saying,

107
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,200
oh, it's your fault.

108
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,849
You made a mistake on this
or you stuffed up in theses.

109
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,900
It's about going back and
going, what can we learn.

110
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,130
And it's the lessons
learned from the project

111
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,490
so we can improve on
that for the next one.

112
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,540
And that's a valuable
learning opportunity

113
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,490
for any organization.

114
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,390
Surveys are also a great tool.

115
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,750
And often now we
can do them online.

116
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,290
They can be
completely anonymous.

117
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,570
In fact, many organizations
will conduct online surveys

118
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,670
to find out the levels of
engagement of their staff.

119
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,140
And you can really use
it in a number of ways

120
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:14,099
to create, or to identify,
areas for informal learning.

121
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,150
And one on one--
and this is probably

122
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,349
the oldest, simplest
way-- and it's

123
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,670
through that one-on-one
interaction and communication

124
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,990
between managers,
peers, and so on

125
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,280
that helps create those
moments of learning.

126
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,880
And these are really
simple, effective methods

127
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,530
to foster informal learning
in your organization.

128
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,710
So in our next topic-- which
is the last of this module--

129
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,669
we'll be looking
at how we evaluate

130
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,130
training and development.

131
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,330
And this is really the last
stage of the training process.

132
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,099
But before we wrap
up, I just want

133
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,010
you to think about in
the discussion forum

134
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,980
maybe moments where you feel
or you can identify that you've

135
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,810
undertaken some kind
of informal learning

136
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,720
and maybe share your
experiences with others.

137
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,030
