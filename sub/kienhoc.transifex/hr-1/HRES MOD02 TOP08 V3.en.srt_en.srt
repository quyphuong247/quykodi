00:00:08,361 --> 00:00:08,860
Hi.

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,370
Welcome to topic eight.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,910
So we're now at the point
of making a decision.

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,770
So this is often really
the most difficult part

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,759
of the whole
recruitment process.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,420
Because you've gone
through each stage,

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,086
you've met so many
different candidates,

9
00:00:21,086 --> 00:00:22,389
you've screened them.

10
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,360
And now it's the really
tough decision-making time.

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,380
And so we'll be looking at
really a technique to help us,

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,650
or to aid us, in
making that decision.

13
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,739
And often we think of it
as the selection process,

14
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,760
but really right now it's
almost the elimination process.

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,390
Because you generally have a lot
more unsuccessful applicants,

16
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,460
than you do have
successful applicants.

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,480
So as we go through
we'll look at one way

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,690
we can really try
and select people

19
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,669
in a more systematic way.

20
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,630
And one such technique is really
breaking it down into a scale.

21
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,840
So gathering the remaining
candidates that we think yes,

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,020
they may have potential to
be the perfect candidate

23
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,450
for this particular job.

24
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,270
And let's try and match up their
skills, their qualifications,

25
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,750
the information we've
gathered during interviews,

26
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,510
and really rate them
based on a scale.

27
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,650
And this is just an
example of one scale.

28
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,370
So we right one particularly
candidate as an A,

29
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:22,050
because they seem to have met
almost all of the requirements,

30
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,420
and they seem to have
ticked off all of the boxes.

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,710
And then we keep going down.

32
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,410
B, yep, not too bad, acceptable,
they have confidence.

33
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,300
C, yes they're satisfactory.

34
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,024
And then you may not
have many in the D and E

35
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:36,650
stage because you probably would
have filtered them out by now.

36
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:41,110
But it really tries to, I
guess almost prioritize what's

37
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,380
remaining of the candidates.

38
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,259
And help you get an idea
of what you can-- really

39
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,250
of what you can be looking
for in that final candidate.

40
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,000
So to take this technique
one step further,

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,060
you may draft what we might
call an assessment sheet.

42
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,280
So, you're really
giving scores or ratings

43
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,130
based on each candidate's, I
guess suitability for the job.

44
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,929
So we make give one
particular person

45
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,380
a score of 80, another
score of 50, and so on.

46
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,380
And the scoring is based on them
meeting the original selection

47
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,540
criteria for that
particular role.

48
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:18,239
And this is not really a black
and white situation in that,

49
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,740
just because someone
got the highest

50
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,500
score it doesn't
necessarily mean

51
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,990
they're the perfect candidate.

52
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,990
At the end of the day,
these type of tools

53
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,960
are just aiding and guiding
us to making that decision.

54
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,410
They're not really making
the decision for us.

55
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,970
Ultimately, we need to
use our own judgement

56
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,770
to help us identify,
yes, this is definitely

57
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,590
the right person for the job.

58
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,130
So we've now reached
the point where

59
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,180
we know who that candidate is.

60
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,120
We know who we want
to give this job to.

61
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,480
So then we start thinking
about, OK well we

62
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,119
may want to make them an offer.

63
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,090
Often with making
a job offer, it

64
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,770
may be originally
a verbal offer.

65
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,550
You know, yes we are quite
happy with your skills

66
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,270
and experience, and we'd
like to offer you this job.

67
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,450
And then when we
seek some sort of,

68
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,549
I guess confirmation that they
would be accepting the job,

69
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,980
it's followed up with a
written offer of the job.

70
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,090
And again, these help maintain
the legal requirements.

71
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,690
Because we want to make sure
that it's quite clear what

72
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,690
it is that the
organization is offering.

73
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,560
So the candidate is
very clear on what

74
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,106
it is that they're accepting.

75
00:03:17,106 --> 00:03:18,480
So at a minimum,
there's a couple

76
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,160
of things we need to
include in a letter of offer

77
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,290
for a candidate.

78
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,359
And some of them are
quite obvious in that we

79
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,670
would have the position
or the job title.

80
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,339
We'd include the
starting date, which

81
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,410
would have been negotiated with
the candidate at some point.

82
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,170
Obviously, very important,
the wages or salary package

83
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,549
that's being negotiated
with the candidate.

84
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,880
We'll also need to
include legal coverage.

85
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,900
And what I mean
by that, it may be

86
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,920
that that particular
employee is covered

87
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,619
by an industry--
an industry award,

88
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,560
or a enterprise agreement.

89
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,090
Or they may have their
own separate contract

90
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:53,780
of employment.

91
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,570
So we need to clearly
establish what

92
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,902
it is that we're using at
that particular instance.

93
00:03:58,902 --> 00:04:01,109
We also need to mention the
status of the employment.

94
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,855
So again, what we
mean by that it

95
00:04:02,855 --> 00:04:04,850
may be whether it's
a full time job,

96
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:09,420
it's a fixed-term contract,
it's a part-time job, and so on.

97
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,250
We'll also need to
normally mention

98
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,470
termination, in that
we need to be quite

99
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,339
clear on the organization's
expectations of that employee.

100
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:21,719
So we need to be very clear as
to the circumstances of when

101
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,610
the organization would terminate
a contract of employment.

102
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,490
And it's usually, we
usually mention things

103
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,290
like there may be
termination in instances

104
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,400
of serious misconduct,
and the like.

105
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,450
So that's really
just a mention that

106
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,950
should be included
in that offer.

107
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,270
And then we may have special
terms and conditions.

108
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,770
And again, this is really
dependent on the job role

109
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,900
and it's dependent
on the industry.

110
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,530
Maybe in that particular jobs
that that particular employee's

111
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,859
working from home on a
full-time basis, for example.

112
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,870
So that's quite a special
and unique condition,

113
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,040
and we would include that as
a minimum requirement in a job

114
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,170
offer.

115
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,150
So now we've reached
the stage where

116
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,890
we've offered a potential
candidate a job,

117
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,289
and they've now accepted it.

118
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,650
And this is really
essentially the main outcome

119
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,969
of the recruitment process.

120
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,000
So we've reached the best point.

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,160
Now let's not forget about the
unsuccessful candidates, which

122
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,480
is often a very common problem.

123
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,310
Many organizations never
actually get around

124
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,130
to advising unsuccessful
applicants to the job.

125
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,030
But in fact, it's really
an important stage.

126
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,969
Because in many cases, it
really is a small world.

127
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,160
And that one applicant
that never heard back

128
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,500
from your organization
may be quiet disgruntled.

129
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,700
And might not apply for
a position in the future,

130
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,500
for example.

131
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,520
Or it may have some
negative impacts

132
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,520
on the reputation
of the organization.

133
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,930
So it really is a good
practice to do it.

134
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,400
There are many HR systems
that will automatically

135
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,549
generate letters
that can be sent out

136
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,620
to unsuccessful applicants.

137
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,480
So in our next topic, we'll
be looking at induction.

138
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,600
We now have this great
new staff member.

139
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,160
How do we induct
them to make sure

140
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,660
that they stay with
the organization?

141
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,882
