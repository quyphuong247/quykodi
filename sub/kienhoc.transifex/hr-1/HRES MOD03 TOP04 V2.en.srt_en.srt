00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:08,740
Hi.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,280
Welcome to Topic 4.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,610
In this topic we'll be looking
at traditional training

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,600
options.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,219
So these are some of the
ways that historically we've

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,710
delivered training
in organizations.

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,670
And I guess one of the
biggest changes over time

9
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,970
in traditional training is
really the push away from it

10
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,400
being focused and
centered on the instructor

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,549
and more focused on the learner.

12
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,970
So in the past the
instructor really

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,310
was standing here giving
instructions and giving

14
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,940
knowledge, and the learner was
really passive and just sitting

15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,879
there collecting
this information.

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,840
So we've really shifted
away from that model

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,020
to more one where it's
not so much a trainer

18
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,670
but it's a facilitator.

19
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,900
So that person is
there to facilitate

20
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,519
the learning of these people
and requires them to actually

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,880
be part of the training
and to really interact,

22
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,960
and their role is
just to facilitate.

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,630
And that's really been
the key change probably

24
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,470
over the last 20
years in training.

25
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,289
So we'll look through a
couple of different options

26
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,460
that are really the traditional
training and development.

27
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,470
And we'll, I guess,
get a little brief idea

28
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,775
about what each of
them involves just

29
00:01:18,775 --> 00:01:21,400
to give you a broad overview of
what some of these options are.

30
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,303
Before we do that,
we're just going

31
00:01:23,303 --> 00:01:26,420
to look at several
factors that will affect

32
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,470
which one of these options you
choose when putting a training

33
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,720
program together.

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,440
And these are really
just the four key issues.

35
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,090
One is the actual content
itself will really vary.

36
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,550
Is the content about skill?

37
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,050
Is it about giving knowledge?

38
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,090
Is it about developing
a competency?

39
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,111
So based on what that
outcome is and what

40
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:47,610
the content of the
training is, that

41
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,450
will really dictate which type
of option you should take.

42
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,560
There's also an issue
in terms of risk.

43
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,990
So for example, if it's
training in relation to using

44
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,160
a particular piece
of equipment that

45
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,869
has dangerous chemicals that
are used as part of the process,

46
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,020
or something along those
lines, you really then

47
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,539
need to assess the
type of training

48
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,914
that's the most
suitable for that

49
00:02:08,913 --> 00:02:10,440
and that will have
an impact, also

50
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,500
whether or not the
training is mandatory,

51
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,690
as I mentioned in
a previous topic.

52
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,870
In some cases
there's regulations

53
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,530
from government and
legislation that

54
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,552
require particular
forms of training,

55
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:22,010
and also whether
at the end there's

56
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,070
some kind of assessment
of competency.

57
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,760
So at the end of that
training the learner

58
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,530
has to show and demonstrate
that they can do XYZ in order

59
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,550
to be able to go on
to the factory floor

60
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,340
and use that piece of machinery.

61
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:34,840
OK.

62
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,381
So these are really
factors that will

63
00:02:36,381 --> 00:02:39,270
impact which one of these
options you'll choose.

64
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,940
Let's have a look
at our first one.

65
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,590
So presentations, this is really
one of the most popular ways

66
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,380
to impart knowledge and
skills to a certain degree.

67
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,910
And with presentations
it's essentially

68
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,700
someone standing up, usually
using some kind of visual aids,

69
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,399
like PowerPoint or
something similar to that,

70
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,530
and really just discussing
some concepts and ideas

71
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,240
and imparting the information
and knowledge that way.

72
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,900
And lots of people do
presentations very, very badly.

73
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,670
So there really is a skill
to presenting effectively

74
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,260
and getting some
kind of, I guess ,

75
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,310
interaction from the learner.

76
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,010
And that's what will ensure
that the presentation has

77
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,489
a successful training outcome.

78
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,090
Our next one is
group discussion.

79
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,410
Group discussions
are a fantastic way

80
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:29,603
of really pushing the concept
of learner-centered training,

81
00:03:29,604 --> 00:03:31,270
where really there's
just a person there

82
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,560
who's leading the
conversation and getting

83
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,810
the learners, who'll be
employees, to really think

84
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,190
for themselves about
solving a problem,

85
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,550
to think critically about
how to review some work

86
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,850
that they've done in the past.

87
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,519
And it's through
those discussions

88
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,540
that people develop a better
understanding of new concepts,

89
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,890
new processes, and
they develop skills

90
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,160
such as problem-solving skills
or critical-thinking skills.

91
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,440
So group discussions, a really
great, simple, effective

92
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,490
training method.

93
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,580
We also have simulations.

94
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,810
And simulations are
traditional in the sense

95
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,505
of the ones that
are computer-based.

96
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:09,970
So for example, the
ideal example, really,

97
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,190
is the airplane pilot simulator.

98
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,880
So for example, every pilot has
to do a certain number of hours

99
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,529
in a simulator before
they can fly a real plane.

100
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:23,010
And that's probably one
of the best examples.

101
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,635
It really allows a
real-life interaction.

102
00:04:25,635 --> 00:04:28,700
It allows someone to practice
doing a particular task

103
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,479
but without all the
risks associated

104
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,910
with actually doing it.

105
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,180
And when we look
at the next topic

106
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,330
and we look at the online
learning environment,

107
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,270
that's really taken simulations
to a whole other level.

108
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,349
On a silly note, my
seven-year-old daughter

109
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,890
has a tablet application where
she can perform open heart

110
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,180
surgery through this
simulation, and she'll

111
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,730
tell you where she needs
to do the-- where she need

112
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,840
to cut, where the
incision needs to go,

113
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,099
how many seconds she has left
before the patient will die.

114
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,160
And so they've really
taken simulations

115
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,520
to a whole other level.

116
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,729
We'll also look
at training games.

117
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,830
Now training games are
a great way, again,

118
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,849
to try and draw the learner
into the training itself.

119
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,372
I've used several
types of training games

120
00:05:13,372 --> 00:05:14,580
before and training sessions.

121
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,650
One of my favorites
in a strategy class

122
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,169
was really giving the
learners some hard-boiled eggs

123
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,450
and giving them a whole bunch
of different bits and pieces

124
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,325
of sticks and string and
sticky tape and whatever,

125
00:05:27,325 --> 00:05:28,700
and really creating,
getting them

126
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,039
to think about a strategy
on how that would create

127
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,000
some kind of solution
or way to get

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,120
this egg from a fifth-story
balcony building

129
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,140
and drop it to the ground
floor without the egg breaking.

130
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,460
And little things
like that are really

131
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,440
what we can use as
ways to teach people

132
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,310
a skill or some
piece of knowledge

133
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,210
or to demonstrate that they're
thinking outside the box,

134
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,140
for example.

135
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,450
And there's a whole
variety of training games.

136
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,440
If you look online you'll find
there are so many websites that

137
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,790
offer free advice on different
types of training games,

138
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,010
and it's a great
source of information.

139
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,560
So the next option
is role plays.

140
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,360
Now role play is a
really fantastic tool

141
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,010
for trying to get someone to
practice a particular skill

142
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,440
in an almost real-life setting.

143
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,560
A great example would be
around customer service,

144
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,600
so having two participants
in the role play.

145
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,870
One is the complaining
customer, and then

146
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,290
the other participant's
job is to then show

147
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,100
how they would
handle that complaint

148
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,390
and what they would do and
how they would implement

149
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,849
the organization's complaint
process, for example.

150
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,410
So role plays provide
that real-life interaction

151
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,110
that allows for
improvement in skills.

152
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,820
And lastly, I'd like
you to think about one

153
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,417
of these training
options and one

154
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:47,000
that you may have
actually encountered

155
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,530
in one of your work places.

156
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,320
And share your experiences
with others in the discussion

157
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,146
forum, what you found worked
and what you found didn't work.

158
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:56,770
And that's really a
good way to reflect

159
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,409
on the success of training.

160
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,880
In our next topic we'll be
looking at the online learning

161
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,380
environment and the
impact that it's

162
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,515
had on the way that training and
development's been implemented

163
00:07:05,515 --> 00:07:06,460
in organizations.
