00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:08,820
Hi.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,320
Welcome to Topic 6 on
addressing poor performers.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,080
So this is one of the
most critical areas

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,120
because often people
will really want

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,730
to avoid dealing with
an underperformer

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,820
in an organization.

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,230
It's often awkward and an
uncomfortable conversation

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,520
to have to explain to
someone that they're not

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,100
performing to where
they should be.

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,210
And often many
just don't actually

12
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,410
have the skills to enable them
to effectively communicate

13
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,129
with someone who's
underperforming

14
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,540
in the organization.

15
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,449
And we really try.

16
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,490
And we need to take a
really structured approach

17
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:44,890
to managing underperformers.

18
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,600
Because if left as
they are, it not only

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,630
effects that individual
employee's confidence

20
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,220
and their job
satisfaction, but it also

21
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,060
effects others in their team.

22
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,350
Because then the workload
is often increased on others

23
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,350
because that person
is underperforming.

24
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,322
Or it adds to a low
morale in the team.

25
00:01:02,322 --> 00:01:04,530
People are not feeling that
it's quite fair that they

26
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,290
have to do all this extra work
because this one person can't

27
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,620
keep up.

28
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,690
And then eventually that
leads to the underperformance

29
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,020
of the team as a whole.

30
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,520
Which again it is not fair
on the rest of the team.

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,200
So it's really critical that we
try and address underperformers

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,990
as soon as it's identified.

33
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,820
The earlier we can get in,
in developing a strategy

34
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,089
to support this
underperformer and really

35
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,212
help them to get to where they
need to be, the more likely,

36
00:01:29,212 --> 00:01:30,670
or the better the
chance is that we

37
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,180
can turn them around
and really avoid things

38
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,680
like having to terminate
their employment.

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,150
We really try and avoid that
at all costs because it really

40
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,560
is a very expensive
activity to have

41
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,680
to recruit someone
from scratch again.

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,950
And there are a variety
of tools and techniques

43
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,930
and strategies, ways that we can
try and help an underperformer

44
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,730
really get to where
we need them to be.

45
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,800
OK, let's just have a look
at some of the initial steps

46
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,679
that we can take to try and
help manage an underperformer.

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,620
And often this will start with
identifying the work standards

48
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,840
or the performance standards
that we expect them to reach.

49
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
Without them having
a clear understanding

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,100
of the standard of
their work that they

51
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,359
need to have reached,
without really giving them

52
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,650
that information and
reiterating it to them,

53
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,440
it's hard to expect
them to reach it.

54
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,900
And a performance
standard or work standard

55
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,110
is really a benchmark.

56
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,650
It's saying, this is
where you need to be.

57
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,110
And then we can compare
where they actually are.

58
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,190
Without that, it's
very difficult to do.

59
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,100
Often it's a really
good idea to have

60
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,070
probationary periods in place.

61
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,816
So if this is the case, where
we've just recruited someone,

62
00:02:36,816 --> 00:02:38,190
they're quite new
to the company.

63
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,859
And they're underperforming
early on in their career

64
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,200
or in their time with
the organization,

65
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,959
a probationary period in
their contract of employment

66
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,980
is really important
because it gives us

67
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,390
a chance as an
organization to see,

68
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,480
can we fix this
underperformance.

69
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,119
Because if we can't, it's
really not a good idea

70
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,731
to keep someone who
may be then effecting

71
00:02:57,731 --> 00:02:59,230
the rest of the
team and, therefore,

72
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,850
the rest of the organization.

73
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,579
It's also worth conducting
a performance assessment.

74
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,510
Again the earlier we can
do this, the better chance

75
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,513
that we have at improving
this person's performance,

76
00:03:10,514 --> 00:03:11,930
really assessing
their performance

77
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:16,190
and comparing it back
to our work standards.

78
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:20,079
And lastly, communication
is key and critical

79
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,510
in these situations.

80
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,530
Without communicating the
fact that some kind of gap

81
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,470
or deficit in their
performance compared

82
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,220
to where they should be,
without that communication,

83
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,819
that person really doesn't
have a chance at improving.

84
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,359
And in fairness, we
need to give them

85
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,470
an opportunity
because in some cases

86
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,200
the underperformance is
due to many other factors.

87
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,940
And some of those
factors are not always

88
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,510
directly in the control of
that particular employee.

89
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,709
So we want to give
them the best chance.

90
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,510
And that's really only
through communication.

91
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,030
And avoiding an
underperforming employee

92
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,430
by not communicating to them
will never resolve the problem.

93
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,240
There are a number of strategies
that we can utilize once we've

94
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,580
identified that particular
employees is underperforming.

95
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,870
And some of the obvious
ones, potentially adjusting

96
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,830
the position.

97
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,020
This is really a good
strategy where that employee

98
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,804
may have strengths
in other areas.

99
00:04:10,804 --> 00:04:12,220
Or they may be
really, really good

100
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,420
at one aspect of the
job but underperforming

101
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,850
in this particular aspect.

102
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,579
And in some cases,
redesigning their role

103
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:19,959
may help support that.

104
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,450
And in some cases, it
may be a temporary thing.

105
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,460
So we redesign it
for a short period

106
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,400
until they built up the
skills and knowledge

107
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,599
to be able to take the
role as a whole again.

108
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,925
Induction and training,
again, is critical.

109
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:33,550
And as we mentioned
in the last module,

110
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,530
this is really one
of the best tools

111
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,400
that we have in an
organization to help

112
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,289
support underperformance.

113
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,600
And often if we've undertaken
a good induction process

114
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,050
the first place, we're less
likely to have underperformers.

115
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,960
Counseling is a fantastic,
easy, cheap, quick tool

116
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,130
to enable us to support
underperformers as well.

117
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,960
We really need to give
them that feedback

118
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,099
and support to really get them
to where we want them to be.

119
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,080
So what happens if
after implementing

120
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,070
some of these strategies
to try and help and support

121
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,290
an underperformer and
what happens if that fails

122
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,410
and that doesn't work,
what do we do then.

123
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,860
In many cases, the
next stage is really

124
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,280
to initiate the
disciplinary process.

125
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,599
So that may mean
sending a warning letter

126
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,780
or giving a verbal warning
that their performance is not

127
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,219
where it needs to be.

128
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,220
And then you need to follow
the next stage in the process,

129
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,900
and this is obviously not ideal.

130
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,440
We want to try and
fix the problem

131
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,670
and help that person
reach the standard that we

132
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,960
want them to reach.

133
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,690
But in some cases where
that's not going to happen

134
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,510
and it's unrealistic, then
discipline is the next stage.

135
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,940
Although we have
to remember there

136
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,430
are some alternatives
to discipline

137
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,400
that may still help
at that late stage.

138
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,409
Let's consider, for
example, again, training.

139
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,545
It may have been a matter
where earlier on they

140
00:05:52,545 --> 00:05:54,420
weren't given adequate
training, and training

141
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,630
may solve the problem.

142
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,260
Again we're looking
at redesigning.

143
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,980
If we redesign the job, can
we then trying and avoid

144
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,340
having to terminate
that person's role.

145
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,609
Maybe there's another
area or another department

146
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,740
in the same organization where
that particular person can

147
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,030
be employed.

148
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,049
And as we mentioned,
coaching and mentoring

149
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,920
are one of the most effective
simple tools And in some cases,

150
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,920
it may be not that
particular person but it

151
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,070
maybe that the workplace
culture is poor,

152
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,520
and we need to improve
the culture as a whole.

153
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,770
So in our next topic, we'll be
moving onto an emerging issue

154
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,669
which is the use of
social media and how

155
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,830
that may fixed managing
people's performance.

156
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,996
