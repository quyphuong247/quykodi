00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,240
Hi.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,790
Welcome to topic five.

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,510
In this topic we'll
be examining some

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,320
of the legal issues
around recruitment.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,290
And it really comes down
to two key areas in law.

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,400
So we're looking
at ways of trying

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,400
to minimize the
risk of breaching

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,540
anti-discrimination legislation.

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,030
But also trying to ensure
that we're complying with

11
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,280
equal employment opportunity
legislation as well.

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,320
And they're really what
the two key points are.

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,420
In many cases we
really need to ensure

14
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,950
that we're quite careful
of the information

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,330
that we provide
potential candidates.

16
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,100
But also very careful
of the information

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,230
that we're requesting
them to provide

18
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,099
to us as an organization.

19
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,730
And that's why we'll be
looking at the information

20
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,910
we provide in job advertising.

21
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,930
So what kind of information
are we giving and insuring

22
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,310
that that information is
fair and not discriminatory

23
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,216
in any way.

24
00:01:03,216 --> 00:01:05,090
And we'll also look at
our application forms.

25
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,620
So this is the other
end of will the employee

26
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,110
the potential candidate giving
us information and insuring

27
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,910
what we're asking is in
line with the law as well.

28
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:21,000
So if we look at application
forms as an example,

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,550
application forms you may ask
a whole series of questions

30
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,310
which are perfectly acceptable.

31
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,300
So things such as your name,
your address, your employment

32
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,869
history, what qualifications
you may have, and so on.

33
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,940
And that's all OK
because it's directly

34
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,547
linked to that particular job.

35
00:01:38,547 --> 00:01:40,130
But there are many
other aspects where

36
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,509
we have to be quite careful
what we're asking for.

37
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,490
And we'll just look
quickly first at some

38
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,020
of the information that were
considered to be optional.

39
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,660
So we can ask for
this information.

40
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,990
But only under
certain circumstances.

41
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,589
And the general
theme is that if we

42
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,870
can tie that particular
request for information

43
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,930
to some critical or
inherent part of the job

44
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,720
and so it makes it a requirement
for that job, then it's OK.

45
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,210
But if we can't we really
can't ask for this information.

46
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,026
So a good example is age.

47
00:02:12,026 --> 00:02:14,870
Age is only necessary if we
can show that in some way

48
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,940
it links to the
requirements of the job.

49
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,280
Agenda in the same way.

50
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,490
You really need
to show just cause

51
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,770
as to why this particular
employee needs to be male

52
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,340
or needs to be female.

53
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,550
A disability as well.

54
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:35,250
And that ones quite a tricky
one because often some people

55
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,410
with a particular disability can
do 99% of the job requirements

56
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,680
but maybe 1% they may have
difficulty with or have

57
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,560
challenges with so we
need to be really quite

58
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,690
careful with that one as well.

59
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,420
And then we've got
physical attributes.

60
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,459
So things such as
height and weight.

61
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,960
And if we consider the
example of flight attendants,

62
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,850
they may have some
restrictions in terms of they

63
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,630
need to be above
a certain height

64
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:03,700
in order to undertake some
of the safety procedures

65
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,859
on a plane.

66
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,120
So we can tie it in directly
to the job role so that's OK.

67
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,920
We'll now look at
some of the aspects

68
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,450
that we really can't
ask for information.

69
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,630
If we do ask for them, we're
leaving the organization

70
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,180
wide open for a legal
claim down the track.

71
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,550
So some of this
information includes

72
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,170
a person's or a
candidates marital status.

73
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:30,730
Whether or not they're
married or divorced or single.

74
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,450
We can't really tie that to a
particular component of the job

75
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,290
so therefore we can't
ask for that information.

76
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,190
Again sexual orientation.

77
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,542
There really is no
impact on your job

78
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:45,000
and it really is
not something they

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,550
should be requested
at any point.

80
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,860
National or ethnic
origin, again no

81
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,350
relevance to really
any type of job.

82
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,130
And then we have
physical features.

83
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,519
And by physical features we mean
features that can not possibly

84
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,420
have any impact on the job.

85
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,910
So for example, the
color of your hair.

86
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,311
Those type of physical features
really cannot be linked

87
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:07,645
to a requirement in a job and
therefore we shouldn't ask

88
00:04:07,645 --> 00:04:08,780
for them.

89
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,140
So the other area that
we'll be looking at

90
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,510
to ensure that we not breaching
any sort of legislation

91
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,329
is job advertising.

92
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:20,589
So when we first see a job ad
appear on a job seeker website

93
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:23,640
or wherever we happen
to be searching for,

94
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,300
we need to ensure that the
requirements that we're

95
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,990
expressing to potential
job candidates

96
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,500
are quite clear and
specific and also don't

97
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,330
breach any anti-
discrimination legislation.

98
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,820
So it's being careful
of the language

99
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,070
that we might use in
the job advertisements.

100
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,790
So for example having very
gender neutral language not,

101
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:48,170
he shall do this, or we
are looking for a full man.

102
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,410
In keeping it the
applicant will lead

103
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,480
to possess XYZ
skills or knowledge

104
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,790
and ensuring it's
quite gender neutral.

105
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,600
That's a very simple,
easy technique.

106
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,880
And it may be in
other aspects when

107
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,250
we're requesting essential
criteria for the job,

108
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,030
that it is again in line
with the legislation.

109
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,729
That's quite similar
to the information

110
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,770
that we were talking about
previously with application

111
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,299
forms.

112
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,840
We can't request that the
applicant must be male

113
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,280
or must be female unless
there's a genuine job

114
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,479
requirement for that.

115
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,020
And so all those
points we've just

116
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,490
discussed apply in exactly the
same way to job advertising

117
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,700
as well.

118
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,260
So we've discussed
a couple of points

119
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,500
that we really need
to try and avoid

120
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,340
gathering information about
a potential job candidate.

121
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,380
But in some instances
you might think,

122
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,090
but I really do need to know
about these because I feel

123
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,619
it will impact on this person's
ability to undertake the job.

124
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,830
Let's take the example
of marital status

125
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,729
or parent's responsibilities.

126
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:53,810
Yes we can't ask someone
and say are you married.

127
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,270
Do you have children?

128
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,740
But we may be
concerned for example

129
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,440
because it's a job that
requires a frequent traveling

130
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,180
and large volumes of traveling.

131
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,430
And we might be concerned that
someone with four children

132
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,530
may struggle and have
challenges in being

133
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,010
able to meet those
requirements of this job.

134
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,770
So we then need to
rephrase or create

135
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,000
a re-expression of
what we're asking for.

136
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,890
So we're insuring
we're not breaching

137
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,219
any kind of legislation.

138
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,560
So it may be the example of
simply rephrasing the question

139
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:31,870
to, this particular job requires
frequent amounts of traveling,

140
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,060
is there anything in
your personal life

141
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,400
that may prevent you or
provide some challenges in you

142
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,609
being able to travel frequently.

143
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,360
And it's really
as simple as that.

144
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,250
And ensuring that you've
met legislative requirements

145
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,430
and you've given each
potential job candidate

146
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,070
the best possible opportunity.

147
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,849
In our next topic, we'll be
looking at interviewing skills.

148
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,350
And this is really
an area where there

149
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,580
is some lack of a lack of
skills by many managers

150
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,390
so be looking at some techniques
in how best to interview

151
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:06,700
our potential candidates and
take them to the next stage.

152
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,640
