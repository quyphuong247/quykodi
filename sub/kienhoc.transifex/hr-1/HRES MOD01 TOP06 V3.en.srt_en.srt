00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,520
Hi, and welcome to
topic six on bullying.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,930
This topic is quite
serious in that it's

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,350
becoming very prevalent.

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,340
And the potential
outcomes of allowing

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,180
bullying to occur
in the workplace

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,169
are really quite serious.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,110
So organizations need
to make an effort

9
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,450
to ensure that staff
are aware of bullying

10
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,560
and aware of how to avoid it.

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,610
A recent survey showed
that 85% of employees

12
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,970
have either been
bullied themselves

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,500
or have witnessed someone
else being bullied.

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,410
And an additional
50% at some stage

15
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,660
have been bullied in
the last six months.

16
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,800
So they're quite
shocking results

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,910
and it's really an indication
of just how much bullying

18
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,239
has become a real issue
in our workplaces.

19
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,490
So why does bullying occur?

20
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,690
Often management are
aware of it and they just

21
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,680
turn a blind eye to it.

22
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,490
In other cases they're
completely unaware.

23
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,590
And that's really an
indication of a lack

24
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,050
of management control.

25
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,119
And really it is the
responsibility of management

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,930
to know exactly what's
going on in their workplace.

27
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,260
Let's try and think
of defining bullying.

28
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,670
Because it is quite difficult.

29
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,260
Most of the actions are not
really always so obvious.

30
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,560
And there is no one
perfect definition.

31
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,730
We will look at a
definition in a moment.

32
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,050
But let's start off
with an example.

33
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,020
And this is a real
Australian case

34
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,679
that has obviously
gone to court.

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,550
In this particular case it
was a young security guard.

36
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:40,060
He'd been employed for five
years, and in those five years

37
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,080
he endured racial
abuse, physical abuse,

38
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,250
and eventually suffered
from chronic depression.

39
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,590
In the end he
resigned from his job.

40
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,730
And in that
particular case, they

41
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,360
were able to effectively
prove that bullying

42
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,890
had occurred in that workplace.

43
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,750
And that although
the organization

44
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,650
had a policy on bullying it
was effectively breached.

45
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,260
And management really didn't
take any effective action.

46
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,530
In that particular
case the security guard

47
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,130
was awarded $1.95 million.

48
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,720
So it really is of a
very costly mistake

49
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,700
that organizations just
can't afford to do.

50
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,769
Let's have a look
at one definition.

51
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,610
So in this particular
definition we

52
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,320
can see a few
different key words

53
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,579
which really help us
to try and establish

54
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,550
what some of those actions are
that can amount to bullying.

55
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,720
So it's a repeated,
unreasonable behavior,

56
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,690
and it's usually
directed towards a worker

57
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,511
or it can be a group of workers.

58
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:38,510
And at the end of the day
it essentially creates

59
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,940
some kind of risk to
the health and safety

60
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,130
of employees in the workplace.

61
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:47,160
So one thing worth noting is
that bullying doesn't really

62
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,040
have to be repeated.

63
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,290
It can be a one-off
act And ideally

64
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,260
you would want to try and
tackle it in the first instance.

65
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,590
Because the longer it
continues the more severe

66
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,900
the outcomes are
for those involved.

67
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,480
Let's take an example.

68
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,440
This was actually an
example that a student

69
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,950
had mentioned to me in
a training session where

70
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,540
she had spoken to someone in a
workplace who had just started.

71
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,269
And on their first day a
manager throwing a book

72
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,360
at another employee,
who was obviously

73
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,900
upset about something.

74
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,600
And she didn't say anything
and really no one else

75
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,070
in the workplace said anything
and eventually two weeks later

76
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,190
that same manager
threw a book at her.

77
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,540
So we can see that, although
it doesn't have to be repeated,

78
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,440
if you continue to allow
the behavior to occur

79
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,270
it will become a
greater issue and it

80
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,730
does become more
difficult to manage.

81
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,079
So let's consider
some of the costs

82
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,110
of bullying in the workplace.

83
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,170
Similar to one of our issues in
the previous topic in relation

84
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,929
to stress in the workplace.

85
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,220
Absenteeism is a
really critical sign

86
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,730
that bullying may be
occurring in that workplace.

87
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,109
There will also be other
signs like a low staff

88
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,680
morale generally.

89
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,870
And then also when we come to
more serious cases of bullying,

90
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,710
we will also have incidence
of legal claims and workers'

91
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,800
compensation claims and so
on and these are all signs

92
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,680
that there is in fact a problem
in that particular organization

93
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,890
with bullying.

94
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,390
So we've looked at
some of the costs

95
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,490
of bullying in the workplace.

96
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,310
But ultimately in
some cases the cost

97
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,260
is so much higher
than just money.

98
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,550
In one particular
Australian case and this

99
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,610
was a highly publicized case.

100
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,020
It was the case of a young
19-year-old girl working

101
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,719
in a cafe.

102
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,910
Brodie Panlock had
been working in a cafe

103
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,950
and three other employees
had continuously bullied her.

104
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,740
And how did they bully her?

105
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,480
They called her names.

106
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,570
They called her ugly.

107
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,190
In one incident they threw
fish oil over her hair.

108
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,820
In another incident that
told her to take rat poison

109
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,520
and to take here own life.

110
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,070
At some stage she actually
did take the rat poison

111
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,050
and attempted to commit
suicide unsuccessfully.

112
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,090
And the bullying continued.

113
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,539
Eventually she actually
through herself

114
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,280
off a building and
committed suicide.

115
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,520
In that case the
cafe was ordered

116
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,340
to pay $220,000 as a fine for
allowing the bullying to occur.

117
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,729
Each of the three employees
were also individually fined.

118
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:23,200
But in the end the real cost
was this young lady life.

119
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,810
And that's really the message.

120
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,500
We need to ensure that
in our organizations

121
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,090
the bullying is taken seriously.

122
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,590
And that we take effective
approaches and measures

123
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,349
to managing it.

124
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,150
And that's so much
more than just

125
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,140
having a bullying and
harassment policy.

126
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,890
It's ensuring that
everyone is well

127
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:42,719
aware of what is acceptable and
what's unacceptable behavior.

128
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,970
I'd like you to take the
opportunity in the discussion

129
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,770
forum to maybe discuss some
incidents of bullying that you

130
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,710
may have witnessed, or you
may have been exposed to.

131
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,870
And maybe suggest a
couple of strategies

132
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,800
of how your organization
or how you overcame them

133
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,380
now we've come to the end of the
section on stress and workplace

134
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,185
bullying.

135
00:06:02,185 --> 00:06:05,000
We'll now be moving on to
quite a different area.

136
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,990
And in our next topic, we'll
be looking at the impact of IT

137
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,440
on the HR function.

138
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,797
