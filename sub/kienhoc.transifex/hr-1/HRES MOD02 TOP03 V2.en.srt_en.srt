00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,340
Hi.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,770
Welcome to topic three.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,950
In this topic, we'll be
looking at why screening

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,200
is so important as part of
the recruitment process.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,280
And we did mention
in the last topic

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,340
that recruitment is
really quite a costly task

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,950
for any organization.

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,200
Screening is critical because
if it really increases

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,869
the chance of finding
the right candidate,

11
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,560
then that fit between
the job and the candidate

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,080
becomes more critical.

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,809
And in those kind of
cases, we can really

14
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,101
minimize the cost of recruitment
because we've actually

15
00:00:40,101 --> 00:00:43,070
minimized the chance of
getting the wrong candidate.

16
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,040
And that's with screening
really becomes a great tool

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,720
to ensure that
have that candidate

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,160
but we're also minimizing
the cost of the recruitment

19
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,500
process.

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,750
So when we discuss
screening in this topic

21
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,850
we'll just touch
on a few of those.

22
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,960
One common one is through
the interview process.

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,100
So with interviews,
it really is a way

24
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,690
that you're screening the
potential candidate and to see

25
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,330
whether there are
good fit or not.

26
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,010
I will also look at
a variety of tests.

27
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,500
So that may include
psychometric tests.

28
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,300
It may include assessment
type tests designed to you

29
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,310
to check some of
the cognitive skills

30
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,330
of that particular applicant.

31
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,960
We'll also look at the
need for medical tests,

32
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,440
and also for background checks.

33
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,509
Or, in other words,
reference checks.

34
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,540
Which is really, at
the end of the day,

35
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,180
one of the first initial steps
in the screening process.

36
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,120
So very often the
screening process

37
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,870
can kind of look like this.

38
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,580
You've advertised a
job for a vacancy.

39
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,160
You've received a
number of resumes.

40
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,369
You start sifting
through the resumes,

41
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,440
and just looking
for some key-- I

42
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,890
guess some key features
of some of these resumes.

43
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,300
Looking for the aspects
that of each of those

44
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,980
resumes that would fit
well with your job.

45
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,090
And so just by going through
and eliminating resumes

46
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,900
of candidates that
you don't think

47
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,750
meet the minimum requirements
for that particular job

48
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,130
is an active screening.

49
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,019
And that may be your
initial screening process.

50
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,720
And so you've got a few
of those resumes now

51
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,050
that seem promising.

52
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,610
So your next stage
of screening may

53
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,030
be conducting a phone interview.

54
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,790
So hi, John Smith.

55
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,470
And here you might
discuss over the telephone

56
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,310
some of the key
aspects of the role.

57
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,580
So you're in one sense
giving them information,

58
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,540
but then you're also trying
to get information from them.

59
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,989
And really gathering
at a very basic level

60
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,390
what it is that motivates
them and what it is that's

61
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,880
attracting them to this job.

62
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,140
And determine whether that's
a fit for the organization,

63
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,390
and whether it's worth the
investment of time of then

64
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,619
bringing them in for a
face to face interview.

65
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,970
So with each process
of screening,

66
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,520
you're minimizing the number
of potential candidates

67
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,120
to also minimize the number
of candidates that may not

68
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,950
work out and really end up
wasting your time or HR's time.

69
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,530
And then we might go
to that next step.

70
00:03:09,531 --> 00:03:11,030
We've conducted the
phone interview.

71
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,320
So we've then invited them
into the office for a face

72
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,440
to face interview.

73
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,030
And interviewing itself is also
another stage of screening.

74
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,030
Because you're really
screening for maybe

75
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,120
their interpersonal skills,
how they speak and communicate

76
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,220
with you during the
interview process.

77
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,250
How they articulate what their
needs are and articulate what

78
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,830
they can bring to
the organization.

79
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,660
And so that's another point.

80
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,770
After the interview you
might say, OK, well,

81
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,890
this person looks quite
suitable for this job.

82
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,570
They may have potential.

83
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,900
So then you may
take that next step

84
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,510
and go OK, let's call
some of their references

85
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,060
or some of their referees.

86
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,550
And so you may call
their previous employers.

87
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,080
You may call the
other people's they've

88
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,160
listed providing them
with recommendations.

89
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,530
And again that's another
stage of screening.

90
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,220
We are trying to find any
information that could give you

91
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,080
a better insight into the
suitability of that person

92
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,780
for that particular role.

93
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,290
And that's really a very
broad, generic overview

94
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,480
of some potential points
in the recruitment process

95
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,880
where you would be screening.

96
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,769
And with each
incident of screening,

97
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:25,420
you increase the chance of
getting the right candidate.

98
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,860
So we've just been through
a very generic process

99
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,600
and where screening my fit in.

100
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,860
But there are some
additional elements,

101
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,850
depending on the job role and
depending on the organization.

102
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,010
So in some cases, it may be
suitable to actually undertake

103
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,370
a medical test.

104
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,730
And in those cases,
it really needs

105
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:47,680
to directly relate to the
requirements of the job.

106
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,090
Every country will
have some form

107
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,895
of anti-discrimination or
equal opportunity legislation

108
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:55,240
or laws.

109
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,730
And in some cases,
requiring someone

110
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,640
to undertake a medical
test unnecessarily

111
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,650
may be in breach of those laws.

112
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,260
So we only really take these
tests when it's a necessity.

113
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,340
And essentially at
the end of the day

114
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,440
it's often because
we want to ensure

115
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,360
the health and safety of
that potential employee,

116
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,410
and also all the other
employees around them.

117
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,150
Another potential screening tool
is using psychometric tests,

118
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,570
which we kind of just
touched on earlier.

119
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,590
And psychometric tests are
often available online.

120
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,929
And I've placed
a couple of links

121
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,960
and further readings
of some examples

122
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,554
of psychometric testing sites.

123
00:05:34,554 --> 00:05:35,969
And then they're
really a good way

124
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,850
to pick up a potential
candidate's cognitive skills,

125
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,350
their psychological skills.

126
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,860
They look at things like
emotional intelligence.

127
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,600
So how well this person
may cope under pressure.

128
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,130
How well this person may cope
with difficult situations.

129
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,110
And so it really looks at things
like the attitude and so on.

130
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,980
And in some cases, this
is really a helpful tool

131
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,960
to get some insight into
whether this person may really

132
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,859
fit in with the
rest of the team,

133
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,740
really fit in with
the organization.

134
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,670
One of the key benefits
with reference checking

135
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:12,750
is really trying to minimize
quite a significant risk.

136
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,880
The key tool in any part
of the recruitment process

137
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,420
is that initial resume
that's submitted

138
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,150
for that particular job role.

139
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,489
30% of resumes are
in fact fraudulent,

140
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,330
or have components
that are fraudulent.

141
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,539
Which really shows
us, or indicate to us,

142
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,750
why it's so important
to screen them.

143
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,360
And during the
screening process,

144
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,650
that's where you can really
uncover whether their

145
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,789
may be parts of a potential
candidates resume that

146
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,940
are in fact untrue or unclear.

147
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,670
And that screening
process really

148
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,220
culls out any of
those kind of issues.

149
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,180
So in the next
topic, we'll also be

150
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,560
looking at how we might
use social media as part

151
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,260
of this recruitment process.

152
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,740
And again it does link in with
what we've just talked about,

153
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,700
because in some
cases social media

154
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:01,099
can be a tool to screen a
potential applicant also.

155
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,555
