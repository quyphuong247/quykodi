00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:08,770
Hi.

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,149
Welcome to topic four.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,270
In this topic we'll be
looking at the key players

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,660
in the performance
appraisal process.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,220
So who is involved in
performance appraisals?

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,439
Well that will really vary
depending on the organization.

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,050
And we'll look at each one
of the different options

9
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,280
that we may have.

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,010
And then maybe some of the
advantages and disadvantages

11
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,950
of using each one
of these people.

12
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,250
And really, ultimately
the best outcome

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,420
is often using a
combination of these people.

14
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,190
Or involving a
combination of these types

15
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,260
of people in the process to
get the most fair and accurate

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,890
information about
the performance

17
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,850
of a particular
employee or team.

18
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,510
So the number one player in the
performance appraisal process

19
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,699
is you, or the employee.

20
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,570
So often, and in many cases
this is the best way to do it,

21
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,380
is you need to have a
self-appraisal component.

22
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,570
So in any performance
appraisal system,

23
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,280
you really want to
get the employee

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,930
to reflect on their
own performance.

25
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,221
And to tell you what
they think they've done.

26
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:07,179
And whether they think
they've done a good job.

27
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,950
Or in what particular areas of
their role that they think they

28
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,050
were successfully in.

29
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,740
And which areas they don't
think they were successful in.

30
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,399
And in getting them to reflect
on their own performance,

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,240
you're better able to gage
whether the options that you

32
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,679
have to help align
their perspective

33
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,049
on their performance with the
organization's perspective

34
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,590
on their performance, you have
a little bit more flexibility.

35
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,173
And you have a little
bit more support

36
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:31,132
when you're trying
to explain how

37
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,590
the improvement of
performance will

38
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,260
need to be undertaken
in the future.

39
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,430
So with the self-assessments
in the appraisal process,

40
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,940
one of the biggest advantages
is it's easy, it's fast,

41
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,700
you have access to the employee.

42
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,910
You essentially
give them a document

43
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,800
and you may have
a scale on there

44
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,950
where they have to
rate their performance

45
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,940
on particular
aspects of their job.

46
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,550
And we'll look at
performance appraisal forms

47
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,610
in another topic in more detail.

48
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,580
But it would just be an easy way
to get that basic information

49
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,640
about the employee
and their perspective.

50
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,290
The only problem is, sometimes
employee's are a little bit

51
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,240
hesitant.

52
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,540
They feel, oh if I write myself
too high my appraiser will

53
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,940
think I'm a little
bit full of myself,

54
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,540
and I'm not I'm not really
performing to that standard.

55
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,280
Then others will think, oh
if I rate myself too low,

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,540
then I might get fired.

57
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,579
Or-- so there's this
constant almost doubt

58
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,720
in the self-appraisal component.

59
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,680
And you'll find
that people may not

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,670
be as accurate, or as
truthful in what they really

61
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,230
believe about their
own performance.

62
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,100
But it's a critical
first step, I

63
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,420
think in any performance
appraisal process.

64
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,869
One of the key players is the
employee's direct line manager,

65
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,760
or sometimes supervisor.

66
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,109
They are often the best
source of information

67
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,190
because they have the most
interaction with that employee.

68
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,090
And they have the
most access to observe

69
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,550
how they're doing their job.

70
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,110
And it will often
be your manager

71
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,550
that will be conducting
a performance appraisal

72
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,290
interview with you.

73
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,510
The only problem is, again
sometimes it's-- there is that

74
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,359
fear that, well my manager
might think I'm not performing,

75
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,500
but I think I'm performing.

76
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,770
And if I don't say this,
then I might get fired.

77
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,600
And there's this constant fear
of being accurate or truthful

78
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,310
in conversations because
this is the person

79
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,300
that the employee reports to.

80
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,990
And that's often the
biggest difficulty

81
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,270
with managers conducting
performance appraisals.

82
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,910
Ultimately at the
end of the day,

83
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,630
it's about a manager
creating a safe environment

84
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,930
for the employee where they
make them feel comfortable.

85
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,630
That anything that they say
or discuss in a performance

86
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,750
appraisal will really
be taken on in just

87
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,340
in light of improvements.

88
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,630
As a way to help and support
the employee to be the best

89
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,400
they can.

90
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,290
And with that positive
outlook, you're

91
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,459
more likely to get a positive
outcome from the employee.

92
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,780
Peer reviews have also
become very, very popular.

93
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,980
So that's gathering feedback
from that employee's

94
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,742
colleagues, their
direct colleagues.

95
00:04:06,742 --> 00:04:08,450
And they're a great
source of information

96
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,489
because they can observe
the employee, usually

97
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,790
for the longest length of time.

98
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,969
They can see how an
employee talks to customers,

99
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,779
because they're sitting right
next to them in a call center.

100
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:23,170
So there's a variety
of different examples,

101
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,940
but they often can
really see day-to-day

102
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,410
what this person is doing.

103
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,450
And if we use
several peers, and we

104
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,780
kind of average
out the response it

105
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,200
gives us a fairly
accurate reflection

106
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,650
of that employee's performance.

107
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,140
Because four out of five
of their peers have said

108
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,979
they have exceptional
customer service,

109
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,340
and they've observed them
providing exceptional customer

110
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,669
service.

111
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,890
Subordinates.

112
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,090
So that may be in
the case where it's

113
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,080
a manager who's going through
the performance appraisal

114
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,909
process.

115
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,950
And we're actually asking their
subordinates, or the people

116
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,670
that report to that manager, for
feedback on their performance.

117
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,140
And this is a really difficult
one because a lot of employees

118
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,099
have this fear, again,
if I say something

119
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,470
negative about my manager that
will somehow have repercussions

120
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,440
down the track.

121
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,950
It may affect my employment.

122
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,750
And there is the
real critical fear.

123
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,780
And often you really need
to tread quite carefully

124
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,570
with that one.

125
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,680
But it has become more
popular over time.

126
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,910
The key here, is
although you may

127
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,390
have so many different
options, 360-degree feedback

128
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,560
is a fantastic tool
for really implementing

129
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,030
many of these players
in one place, really.

130
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,090
And 360-degree feedback is
just the appraisal process,

131
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,400
but gathered from essentially
all of these people.

132
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,489
And it can also includes
customers, as well.

133
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,790
And we're really gathering
that performance data

134
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,880
from all of them.

135
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,719
It's often anonymous
as well, which

136
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,130
really provides
that extra security

137
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,430
to alleviate the fees that
we've discussed earlier.

138
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,410
And now these days
it's all-- it can all

139
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,200
be done online, on
an online survey.

140
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,240
It's anonymous,
a person logs in,

141
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,160
puts in their input on a
scale, or rating, or whatever.

142
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,130
And then-- and all that data
is gathered and collected.

143
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,370
So in our next topic,
we'll be looking again

144
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,117
in more detail of the
performance appraisal process.

145
00:06:19,117 --> 00:06:20,700
And we're looking
at some of the tools

146
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,170
that we can utilize for
performance appraisals.

147
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,636
