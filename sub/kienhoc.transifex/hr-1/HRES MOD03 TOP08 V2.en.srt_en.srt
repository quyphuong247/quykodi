00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:09,450
Hi.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,350
Welcome to topic eight
on the role of mentoring.

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,879
Now we've been looking at
training and development.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,790
And mentoring, it
kind of fits in both.

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,890
It's really a tool that you
can use to help train people.

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,370
But probably more so
use to develop people

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,470
in the long-term.

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,790
And it's really
about a relationship.

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,520
So what's mentoring?

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,990
It's really a role
modeling relationship

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,809
that should be based
on a process where

13
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,779
you have a mentor and a
mentee, and or a protege.

14
00:00:37,779 --> 00:00:39,820
There's a whole bunch of
different terminologies.

15
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,360
So some will some will
call them proteges,

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,269
some call the mentees.

17
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,090
And so on.

18
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,570
For our purposes we'll just use
the terms mentor and protege.

19
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,460
So the mentors is usually
someone with more experience.

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,550
They're often in a
more senior role.

21
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,250
And they have some kind
of knowledge or skill set,

22
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,555
or experience that they can
impart onto the protege.

23
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:05,060
But don't get me wrong,
it doesn't always

24
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,620
have to be a more senior person.

25
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,750
There is the concept of peer
mentoring, which is really

26
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,390
someone essentially
doing a similar role.

27
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,990
But they may have
had more experience,

28
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,500
and they're really
mentoring a peer

29
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,080
who may have been a new
entry into the workplace.

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,890
And it's a way to develop
them and develop their skills.

31
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,440
So let's break down
the role of a mentor,

32
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,940
and really what that
relationship is all about.

33
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,960
And we can see at the-- I
guess it at its foundation,

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,910
it's about a role
modeling relationship.

35
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,509
So someone role modeling
behaviors, attitudes, skills,

36
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,280
knowledge, that they're trying
to impart on the protege.

37
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,090
And in that we're imparting
information or knowledge.

38
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,590
So it may be information
that's developed

39
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,130
into the organization over time.

40
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,800
It maybe information that's
relevant to a specific job.

41
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,090
It's really about that
transfer knowledge.

42
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,490
It's also a way of
gathering feedback.

43
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,289
And sometimes we
can't get the feedback

44
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,490
that we need from our managers,
or our direct line managers.

45
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,800
And that mentor can
have a different role.

46
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,070
And that's why it's often very
good idea that a mentor is not

47
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,495
the protege's direct manager.

48
00:02:11,496 --> 00:02:13,620
Because there's different
attitudes in how feedback

49
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,550
is given back.

50
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,210
And there's
implications when it's

51
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,000
the manager who's the
mentor, because they're also

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,270
responsible for that
person's performance.

53
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,990
Whereas a mentor can
be that outsider,

54
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,410
and give that objective advice.

55
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,850
They are also there to help
with career development.

56
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,590
Often a mentor
can take this role

57
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,680
of guiding a person
through how they

58
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,410
may progress through
their career.

59
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,660
And mentoring
really is perceived

60
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,820
to be a long term crisis.

61
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,340
I remember one of my own
mentors in my workplace.

62
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,440
She really provided
me with the insight

63
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,430
to see that maybe it
wasn't the right decision

64
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,600
to accept a promotion, because
it was taking my career

65
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,470
in a completely different path.

66
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,010
That she helped me identify
it wasn't really what

67
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,000
I wanted to do.

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,010
So they're able to give
that objective career

69
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,040
advice as well.

70
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,870
They are also for general
guidance, which in some cases

71
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,570
it's professional guidance.

72
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,715
And like we mentioned,
it's supporting someone

73
00:03:07,716 --> 00:03:09,215
through knowing
what to do and where

74
00:03:09,215 --> 00:03:12,290
to move with their career, and
imparting knowledge, and so on.

75
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,600
But it can also have
a personal aspect,

76
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,910
which is quite
important in building

77
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,640
that rapport in
that relationship

78
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,149
between a mentor
and the protege.

79
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,090
So who would be involved
in mentoring process?

80
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,060
When we're talking
about proteges,

81
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,240
it's often people who may
be new to an organization.

82
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,380
It can also be senior
managers though.

83
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,859
In many cases mentoring
is used as a way

84
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,050
to help brings a manager
through and give them the skills

85
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,280
that they need to take
on a more senior role.

86
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,250
So it's often part
of a succession

87
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,310
plan for the organization.

88
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,490
Mentors.

89
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,700
Mentors are often more senior
people in the organization.

90
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,470
But as I mentioned
before, we also

91
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,010
have this concept
of peer mentoring,

92
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,560
that we can learn from others.

93
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,690
And that provides just as
much support and knowledge,

94
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,230
and information as being
mentored by someone in a more

95
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,570
senior role than you.

96
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,109
Mentors can also be
outsourced, so they

97
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,940
can be from outside
the organization.

98
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,890
And their job is to be
a professional mentor

99
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,750
and to support and
develop that employee's

100
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,510
skills in the organization.

101
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,130
Yes, mentoring sounds great.

102
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,120
And it's becoming
really, really popular.

103
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,920
But without it being structured
and having a process in place

104
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,550
to really control
the relationship,

105
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,740
and really try to facilitate
the outcomes that we want

106
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,842
from that relationship,
it does tend to fail.

107
00:04:29,842 --> 00:04:31,550
And we'll look at some
of the key reasons

108
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,690
why mentoring
relationships fail.

109
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,540
The number one reason is
always around planning.

110
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,370
A lack of planning and
management of that relationship

111
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,770
will really reap
very little reward.

112
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,599
Often mentoring is set up
with the best intentions.

113
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,670
But without a structure, a
plan, without for example,

114
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,720
documentations where every
time the mentor and protege

115
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,080
meet, they document
what their outcomes are,

116
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,440
their action items.

117
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,790
Things like that that
really provide structure

118
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,870
to the relationship.

119
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,600
Training.

120
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,940
Not everyone knows
how to be a mentor.

121
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,990
So without adequate
training for mentors

122
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,540
it's likely to also fail.

123
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,400
The selection of
mentor and mentee.

124
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,330
Often there's a
personality clash,

125
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,950
and there really needs to
be time taken to make sure

126
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,860
that there's almost
a personality

127
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,680
compatibility between the two.

128
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,480
So it's the case where a protege
says to their line manager,

129
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,730
I need to go, I have a
meeting with my mentor.

130
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,880
No, you can't go we
have a tight deadline.

131
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,300
You need to do this first.

132
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,010
Without that
organizational support

133
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,539
to see the value of
mentoring, in the long-term

134
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,060
it's very likely to fail.

135
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,110
And lastly, my
favorite, politics.

136
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,510
So there's often reasons
behind-- or there's

137
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,050
issues behind who was chosen to
be part of a mentoring program,

138
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,550
and whether that was going
to lead to a promotion.

139
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,850
And you know, whether it was
fair that they were chosen

140
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,790
or not chosen.

141
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,740
And the implications
on their performance.

142
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,090
And that's often a big hindrance
to these programs actually

143
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,330
being successful.

144
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,120
So just to wrap up.

145
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,630
Yes, these mentoring
programs can

146
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,670
have a great impact
on relationships

147
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,120
in an organization.

148
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,000
We must always remember that
they're a long-term solution.

149
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,760
They are not a quick
fix to anything.

150
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,240
And the key to their
success is to also evaluate

151
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,950
their programs.

152
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,620
At the end of the
programs you go,

153
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,430
what did we hope to achieve,
and did we achieve it?

154
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,360
And what were the costs
associated with that?

155
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,800
So that organizations can
really gain the most benefit out

156
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,360
of these relationships.

157
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,310
In our next topic, we'll be
looking informal learning.

158
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,670
Which in a way,
mentoring can be.

159
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,790
But we'll look at other
aspects of that shortly.

160
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,947
