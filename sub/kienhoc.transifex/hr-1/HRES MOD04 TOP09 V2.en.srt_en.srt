00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:08,740
Hi.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,000
Welcome to topic nine on
the performance appraisal

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,070
interview.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,260
Now, this is one of the
most important aspects

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,540
of the performance
management process.

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,340
And often organizations
will vary in how many times

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,470
in a year, for example, that
they may conduct a performance

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,479
appraisal interview.

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,040
Unfortunately, often it's
usually only once a year

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,160
or annually.

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,380
Many organizations have
moved towards conducting them

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,770
twice a year, and
others have actually

14
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,920
included informal performance
appraisal interviews

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,780
in other parts of
the year as well.

16
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,810
And the rationale
behind that is if we

17
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,069
can capture issues or
problems early on then

18
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:49,860
we can have a better
chance at fixing them,

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,140
and that's really
one of the most

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,740
important factors
of this process.

21
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,150
Now, we'll look at,
firstly, some of the things

22
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,800
that can really go wrong
in a performance appraisal

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,570
interview, and these
are really the types

24
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,790
of problems you want
to avoid at all costs.

25
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,870
So sometimes a very poor
performance appraisal interview

26
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,340
will make the employee feel
that they are undervalued.

27
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,350
So it may be the
comments of the appraisal

28
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:22,350
or it may have been, for
example, they're using a rating

29
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,860
tool and where they've placed
that particular employee

30
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,950
on the scale may make them feel
that their work is undervalued

31
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,220
and so on because it hasn't
been communicated effectively.

32
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,030
In some cases, the appraiser
may seem disinterested,

33
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,140
and this has often happened
because at times organizations

34
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,090
almost force managers to
conduct performance appraisals.

35
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,790
And the managers
haven't actually

36
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,110
been trained on how
to conduct them,

37
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,320
and don't actually understand
the value of conducting them

38
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,649
so it's almost like,
oh, I have to do this

39
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,530
because I've been told
I have to do this.

40
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,160
And so in the end,
the employee feels

41
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,399
that the appraiser is quite
disinterested in what's

42
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,120
going on or their performance.

43
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,030
This is probably one
of the worst ones

44
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,840
that we really
would want to avoid.

45
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,220
And it's really
giving the employee

46
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,630
the feeling that the
appraiser is biased.

47
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,130
And this is not that
difficult to do.

48
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,310
And if we relate
back to our topic

49
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,450
on underperformers, that's often
a cause of this feeling of bias

50
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,709
by the appraiser because
they'll be thinking,

51
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,010
well, my colleague in my team
hasn't done all these things

52
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,480
that I've done, and, yet, we're
being paid the same salary

53
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,480
or yet you've been giving me
negative feedback about my work

54
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,149
and it creates this concept
of bias by the appraiser.

55
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,520
Which really leads us to the
last point, which is-- often,

56
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,910
it can be easy to create this
perception that the performance

57
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,490
appraisal interview is unfair.

58
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,220
Some people may have been
included in that process

59
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,590
whereas others haven't.

60
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,600
And you really want to try and
avoid all these perceptions

61
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,890
by the employee.

62
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,089
We don't want them to
feel any of these things.

63
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,690
Otherwise, the success
of this whole process

64
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,109
is really very, very limited.

65
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,120
So in this second
half of the topic,

66
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,840
what I'd like to go
through is what's

67
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,190
essentially a checklist
of different things

68
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,800
that you can do
to try and improve

69
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,640
the success of a performance
appraisal interview.

70
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,350
The number one thing
to do is to plan.

71
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,720
The more you can plan
ahead, the more likely

72
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,400
that it will actually be
a successful interview.

73
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,810
And, as I mentioned in one
of our previous topics,

74
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,680
it's often a requirement
because there

75
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,040
may be a self-appraisal
component

76
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,170
that the employee needs to
complete before actually

77
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,619
entering into an interview.

78
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,670
So the planning is
really critical.

79
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,010
I suggest at least
setting aside 30 minutes.

80
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,542
There's nothing worse than
being in an appraisal interview

81
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:46,000
and feeling like
it's quite rushed,

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,666
and that's where often
the employee will

83
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,180
feel that the appraiser
is disinterested.

84
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,800
And we really want to ensure
that there's enough time.

85
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,840
And that also adds to ensuring
that wherever the interview is

86
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,080
being held is a space that's
free from distraction, free

87
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,170
from interruptions,
and, again, you

88
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,190
are assessing
someone's performance

89
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,840
and you really want to make
them feel that you've committed

90
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,430
that time to them
at the very least.

91
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,870
Most importantly,
you really want

92
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,850
to create a friendly atmosphere.

93
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,200
If you create a
positive environment,

94
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,130
you're more likely to
get a positive outcome

95
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,694
from the other person,
and in which case,

96
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:23,110
they'll be more likely to be
truthful and honest with you,

97
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,980
and that exchange
will be more valuable.

98
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,960
It's also best to always explain
the purpose of the performance

99
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,169
appraisal interview.

100
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,760
Many people have this fear that
if their performance is being

101
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,480
reviewed or appraised, it
must mean that their job is

102
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,170
in jeopardy, or
there's a possibility

103
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,960
of being demoted or losing
their job and so on.

104
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,180
And it's quite critical to
explain from the beginning

105
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,580
that the purpose is really
to assess their performance

106
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,280
to help them be the best
that they can at their job.

107
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,960
You want to encourage
conversation

108
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,169
as much as possible.

109
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,660
You really want to
encourage the employee

110
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:00,420
to really be freely speaking
of what their perspective is,

111
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,340
and really engage in
discourse with you

112
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,690
and exchange the
information that they have,

113
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:09,040
and you exchange the
information you have.

114
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,096
This is one of the most-- it is
the number one factor in really

115
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:16,220
pushing for the success of
one of these interviews.

116
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,050
If you start an interview
on a negative note,

117
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,170
it's more likely to
end on a negative note

118
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,229
so always start with
the positives first.

119
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:25,020
Start with the positive
feedback that you'd

120
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,349
have for that employee,
all the things that they've

121
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,440
performed really well
on and excelled in,

122
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,950
and then you can move to a more
constructive criticism of maybe

123
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,390
where their job-related
weaknesses are.

124
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,050
And we really want to focus on
just job-related weaknesses,

125
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,770
not weaknesses in their
personality or other factors.

126
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,950
It's really critical that we
maintain a narrow approach,

127
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,860
and we only just look at
job-related factors and nothing

128
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,340
else.

129
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,210
Feedback needs to
be constructed.

130
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,729
And what that means
is that feedback

131
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,090
needs to give some
kind of support

132
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,909
as to how to improve a weakness.

133
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,970
So if you give a weakness,
give a suggestion

134
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,790
on how to improve that
particular weakness.

135
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,637
You need to always refer
back to the work standards

136
00:06:07,637 --> 00:06:09,720
or the performance standards
because that's really

137
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,930
our benchmark that we're
comparing the performance to.

138
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,920
And in the end, you need to
provide clear expectations

139
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,410
on what will happen next.

140
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,610
So in our next period of time,
these are the actionable items

141
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,030
and these are the
expectations of the employee,

142
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,260
and you're more likely to
get a positive outcome.

143
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,990
So I'd like to take
this opportunity

144
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,870
to get you to have a look
at the discussion forum,

145
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,730
and maybe suggest or share
some of your experiences

146
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,210
from a negative performance
appraisal interview,

147
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,039
and maybe explain to us how
that may have impacted you

148
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,204
in the long term.

149
00:06:39,204 --> 00:06:41,370
And in our next topic, we'll
look at the performance

150
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:46,240
appraisal form, and that's our
final stage of module four.

151
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,161
