00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,400
Hi.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,532
Welcome to topic 10, our
final topic of this module.

4
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:14,990
In this topic we'll be looking
at the performance appraisal

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:15,490
form.

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,970
So what I'd like you to do
is shortly pause this video,

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,900
go and find the
performance appraisal

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,099
form that I've loaded for
you in Further Readings,

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,970
and have it ready to go before
you've restart the video.

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,020
Now I've hoped you've
got the form with you.

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,720
Now we can have different
variations of this form.

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,890
But this sample is
just really an example

13
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,210
to guide you through
the rest of this topic.

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,630
And the different components
in a performance appraisal form

15
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,360
can vary, but we're
just going to look

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,880
at the most popular
ones that you'll often

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,990
find appearing in
performance appraisal forms.

18
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,310
I can't stress
enough how important

19
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:53,490
it is to have a good structured
performance appraisal form.

20
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,352
One, it often leads
the interview process.

21
00:00:56,352 --> 00:00:57,809
And it means you
ensure that you've

22
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,330
covered every possible aspect
of their past performance

23
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,470
and of what we're planning to
do with them in the future.

24
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,910
And it also becomes
very beneficial

25
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,590
from a legal perspective.

26
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,170
So in instances where an
employee's performance has been

27
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,540
quite poor, and the ultimate
outcome will be that they're

28
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,550
role will be terminated, or
the job will be terminated,

29
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,580
it's really supporting
evidence to justify

30
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,730
the decision of
management to terminate

31
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,190
that particular
employee's contract.

32
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,120
Now we'll have a look at some
of the most common components

33
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,530
of the performance
appraisal form.

34
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,140
They'll always have
some aspect that's

35
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,779
about the employee actually
appraising themselves.

36
00:01:40,779 --> 00:01:42,570
And reflecting and
assessing on themselves.

37
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,139
And we've touched
on this already.

38
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,080
You'll also have some part that
looks at their achievements.

39
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,050
What have they achieved in
this particular period of time

40
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,980
that's really noteworthy and
worth really highlighting

41
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,320
to be a appraiser.

42
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,770
It will always include our ever
favorite performance standards.

43
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,839
So they're our benchmark,
and it's critical

44
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,480
that they're in the form too.

45
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,750
It will also have a
section on goal setting.

46
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,010
So we may revise previous goals
from the previous appraisal

47
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:12,510
period.

48
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,060
But we'll also be setting new
goals for the next appraisal

49
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,850
period.

50
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,930
And that's always a common
component of these forms.

51
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,410
Often we'll also have a
section around the strengths

52
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,609
and weaknesses of that
particular employee.

53
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,197
So we'll look historically
over that period.

54
00:02:27,197 --> 00:02:28,780
What were some of
the things that they

55
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,900
excelled at and did really well?

56
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,830
And they're a great tool
for reward structures

57
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,860
down the track.

58
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,250
And also for recognizing
that employee's contribution

59
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,120
to a team or a department.

60
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,610
But weaknesses also help
us in a different way.

61
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,670
Because it's from
those weaknesses

62
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,320
that we can identify
potential gaps

63
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,209
that require training
or development,

64
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,810
and that's really
the basis for that.

65
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,090
And that's why we will
always have a section that

66
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,910
looks at training
and development needs

67
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,740
for the future
for this employee.

68
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,380
So we've established
their performance,

69
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,130
and we've established
where they're going.

70
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,210
So what can we do
to support them

71
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,900
in the improvement
of their performance?

72
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,500
And often training
and development

73
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,290
is really a key
component of that.

74
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,880
So we'll outline
some of the things

75
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,689
that the employee thinks
will be beneficial to them,

76
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:14,730
and some of the things
that the manager may think

77
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,700
are beneficial to the employee.

78
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,970
So we've touched on this
concept of always having

79
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,960
a component where the
employee's appraising

80
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,970
they're own performance.

81
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,170
And you'll see that at the
beginning of the sample form.

82
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,149
That's always a really
good starting point.

83
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,980
So we won't get too much into
it because we did discuss it

84
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,299
in a previous topic.

85
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,240
But then you'll also find
the component around goals.

86
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,380
And often with goals
we want to see, well

87
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,829
have they been achieved?

88
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,120
Could they have
possibly not been

89
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,120
achieved for unique reasons?

90
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,700
We'd like to investigate
why they may not

91
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,109
have been achieved
if that's the case.

92
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,350
We'll also look at
things like were there

93
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,880
any-- were there any activities
or counter measurements

94
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,870
that we could've taken, or that
we did take, to try and capture

95
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,510
a problem before it
became a real issue

96
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,450
and led to that employee
not reaching their goals.

97
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,869
We'll also look at
any goals in progress.

98
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,670
Because a performance
appraisal can really

99
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,399
happen at any point in time.

100
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,600
And that employee may be midway
through a particular project,

101
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,550
and the completion of that
project is one of their goals.

102
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,890
So also look at that
progress and how it's moving.

103
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,130
And you'll often
find in these forms,

104
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,880
maybe further towards the end
of the form, where they'll

105
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,070
be asking well what's
the goals that we

106
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,770
need to establish
for the future?

107
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,469
And we'll often break them
down based on individual goals.

108
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,190
We'll also look at things
like the general team goals.

109
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,920
And then maybe how
that individual

110
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,150
can contribute to
the team goals.

111
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,260
So as I mentioned earlier,
performance standards

112
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,909
are really a critical
component these forms.

113
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,840
So even on our sample you
may see several performance

114
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,380
standards.

115
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,650
Some will be about
behavioral traits.

116
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,599
Others will be about key
skills or competencies.

117
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,440
And in this particular
example, we've

118
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,990
used the numerical writing.

119
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,100
So the appraiser
would draw a circle

120
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,890
over where they think
the employee would

121
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,760
fit between one and five.

122
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,390
Usually 10 to 15
performance standards

123
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,719
is a good indication
to help us assess

124
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,580
that particular employee's
skill level, or knowledge level.

125
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,820
Now I want to go back
to the discussion forum.

126
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,990
And if you remember in
topic one of this module,

127
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,430
I asked you about
your thoughts of what

128
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,520
you thought performance
management was about.

129
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,060
I'd like to go back in now
and see what's really changed.

130
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,170
What have you learned
over this period that

131
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,830
has changed your perspective on
what performance management is

132
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,349
all about?

133
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,950
And that wraps up module four.

134
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,969
So over this course we've looked
at some of the changes in HR

135
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,380
and some of these
emerging issues

136
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,380
that have developed
it to where it is now.

137
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,330
We've looked at the recruitment
process from start to finish.

138
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,904
And some of the challenges that
we face now in modern times.

139
00:05:51,904 --> 00:05:53,820
We've also looked at
training and development,

140
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,900
and how this is really
a critical part of how

141
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,929
we keep and retain
our good employees.

142
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,970
And now we've reached
our final stage,

143
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,150
which is the performance
management process.

144
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,909
And I feel now
that you may-- you

145
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,480
may have a better understanding
of what this process actually

146
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,980
means in reality.

147
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,340
Starting from the initial
stage of identifying that there

148
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,219
is a need to conduct things
like performance appraisals,

149
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,890
and all the way through
the tools and techniques

150
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:22,770
to really manage someone's
performance in an organization.

151
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,000
So I hope you've enjoyed
our time together,

152
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,060
and really learned
something new.

153
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,450
And if you're considering
a career in HR,

154
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,800
there are so many options
out there for you.

155
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,540
And if you're not,
I hope you've really

156
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,998
learned something
valuable that you

157
00:06:34,998 --> 00:06:37,719
can take into the workplace
that can help you achieve

158
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,540
the goals that you would like
to achieve in your organization.

159
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,283
