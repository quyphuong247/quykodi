00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,770
Hi, and welcome to topic two.

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,430
In this topic we'll
be looking at how

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,690
to attract the right
candidate for your job.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,189
In particular before we
really get into these,

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,420
I think it's important tonight
that without really knowing

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,040
what it is that your job
candidates and looking for,

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,910
you can't reduce
the right attraction

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,360
strategy to get them to want
to join your organization.

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,460
So we'll look at a few
different strategies,

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,607
and this is not
all the strategies,

12
00:00:34,607 --> 00:00:36,440
but we'll just look at
some of the key ones.

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,309
So we look at job advertising.

14
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,110
We'll also look at potentially
using referral schemes

15
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,920
from within the
workplace internally.

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,820
We'll look at how we
attract graduate positions.

17
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,800
We'll also consider the option
of rehiring former employees.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,809
So we'll get into
that in a moment.

19
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,270
But before we really look at
some of what the strategies are

20
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:01,110
it's good to get an idea of what
some of the key factors that

21
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,690
will impact a job seeker and
what they what would make them

22
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,910
decide to join a
particular organization.

23
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,820
There's been a lot
of research conducted

24
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,089
on what factors are really
important to job seekers

25
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,680
and what really are they
looking for in their next job

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,300
and what's the most important.

27
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,210
So number one was
always salary and number

28
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,119
two was also career progression.

29
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,960
So we're really concerned with
well where is this job taking

30
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,380
me, and also there is a
consideration of salary.

31
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,470
And I mean don't take
this the wrong way

32
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,980
because again so
much of this research

33
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,090
really, really strongly
shows that people

34
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,930
are willing to sacrifice
a little bit of salary

35
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,840
in terms of in exchange for
better job satisfaction.

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,520
And particularly in exchange
for full flexibility

37
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,310
within their job.

38
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:53,050
So it's really about managing
both and the particular trade

39
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,850
offs between salary and
career progression and so on.

40
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,649
But at the end of
the day it will often

41
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,480
comes down to salary.

42
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,330
And if you pay peanuts,
you get monkeys.

43
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,970
So let's look at
our first attraction

44
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,550
strategy, which is advertising.

45
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,120
I know that now so many
people when they think,

46
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,350
OK I need to move on and
look for another job,

47
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:17,720
will quickly jump online and
go to job a job seeker website

48
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,500
and start sifting
through and having

49
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,980
a look at potential
roles that might fit in

50
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,810
with their qualifications
or experience.

51
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,570
And that's now becoming
the primary way.

52
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,769
In fact, a recent survey
showed that 90% of job seekers

53
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,860
will actually go to an
online job seeker website

54
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,980
to look for the next roll.

55
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,220
But in affect to really
get the best possible

56
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,510
out come with advertising,
and really increase

57
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,146
your chances of attracting
the right candidate,

58
00:02:46,146 --> 00:02:47,519
it's always best
to use a mixture

59
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,700
of, or a combination of,
different strategies.

60
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,679
And I know in the past,
newspaper advertising

61
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,380
was quite popular.

62
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,430
Advertising in particular
industry sites or industry

63
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,360
journals was also popular.

64
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,380
But I mean when we look at
a mixture at the moment.

65
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,570
And this topic is
about HR today.

66
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,690
At the moment the real super
star in social networking

67
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,380
sites.

68
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,370
And in particular sort of
side site which is what

69
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,420
we have looked at professional
social networking sites.

70
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,579
And so for example LinkedIn
a lot of organizations

71
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,580
now are mixing the
two mediums together.

72
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:32,880
So we'll have their job placed
on a job online job forum.

73
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,519
And then also have
an advertisement

74
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,930
within LinkedIn for example.

75
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,120
So it's that mixture
that increases

76
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,500
the chance of getting
the right candidate.

77
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,100
So another option
that we'll look

78
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,440
at for attracting a candidate
is referral schemes.

79
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,130
So what are they all about?

80
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,440
Essentially you would be
advertising internally

81
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,680
within the organization
and saying, hey,

82
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,200
we've got a vacancy in
this particular position.

83
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,320
If you happen to know
someone through your social

84
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,320
or your professional
networks that you think

85
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,090
will be suited to
this job let us know.

86
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,920
And if you let us
know we'll give you

87
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,910
a little something on the side.

88
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,440
And that's really how these
referral schemes work.

89
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,340
And their utilizing the
networks of their existing stuff

90
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,269
in order to find and
attract the right candidate.

91
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,740
And in some
organizations they've

92
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,930
been extremely successful.

93
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,790
Snack foods brand Mars actually
recruits 20% of their staff

94
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,220
through these referral
schemes from internal staff.

95
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,260
We've got some
particular law firms

96
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,980
in Australian that actually
will offer a quite substantial

97
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,270
reward for referring on a
senior lawyer for example.

98
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,370
One particular law
firm gives in excess

99
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:48,460
of $10,000 as a reward for
another employee referring

100
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,469
someone else who's
ultimately hired.

101
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,810
So another area is really
graduate recruitment.

102
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,020
And it's a little bit
different because you're really

103
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,330
just trying to attract a
particular part of the job

104
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,490
seeker market.

105
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,300
And with graduates
all the researchers

106
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,310
suggested that their
key driver and I

107
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,520
guess the key factor that's
the most important to them

108
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,960
when looking for
potential employers

109
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,680
is really the reputation
of the organization.

110
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,460
Many graduates really
want to move on

111
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,460
to an organization that has
a really strong reputation

112
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,849
that particular
industry in the hope

113
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,935
that that will then push their
career progression further

114
00:05:26,935 --> 00:05:28,460
on down the track.

115
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,109
And so you'll find
that even know

116
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,060
that's the key point of
importance to graduates,

117
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,040
it's not just so much about as
an organization advertising.

118
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,290
Oh hey we're a great
organization to work for.

119
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,160
We support graduates and
we are this and that.

120
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,780
But you really need to
deliver on those promises.

121
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,830
Particularly in that
graduate market.

122
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,240
In able to retain those
employees that you would have

123
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,080
invested a lot of
time into training.

124
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,810
To say hey we're a very
tech savvy organization

125
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,640
and we're very cutting edge and
then hire a graduate employee

126
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,659
and stick them in a small room
with a computer with Windows

127
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,300
95, you're really not
delivering on those promises.

128
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,620
So a little earlier
we touched on what

129
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,510
was some of the key
factors that attract

130
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,390
job seekers to
particular job roles

131
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,240
and particular organizations.

132
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,360
I'd like you to think about
that in your own experience

133
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,580
in the discussion forum.

134
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,430
And maybe tell us at
least three key factors

135
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,650
that you think are
really important to you.

136
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,330
And that really
impact your decision

137
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,969
to join a particular
organization.

138
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,810
And in our next topic,
we'll be looking

139
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,260
at that next stage, which
is really you've done some

140
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,710
and you've received
some applications

141
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,330
for a particular vacancy and
now we want to start screening

142
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,030
and having a look at
that first instance.

143
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,640
Well who may not
be suitable and who

144
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,200
has potential to
progress further

145
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,990
into the recruitment process.

146
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,240
