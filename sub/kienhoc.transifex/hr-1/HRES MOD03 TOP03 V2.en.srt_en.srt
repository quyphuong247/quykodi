00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,350
Hi, welcome to topic three
on planning for training.

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,100
So in this topic, we'll
look at a number of ways

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,960
that we can try and ensure
the success of our training

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,220
by really undertaking
some planning process is

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,320
to make sure we get
that ultimate outcome

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,150
and we can show value for
money for our training.

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,310
And really, one of the
key ways to do that

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,930
is to identify
what the gaps are.

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,960
And so if we know
what we don't know,

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,880
then we have a better
chance of making sure

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,730
that the training
activities that we create

13
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,129
or training plan that we create
really fills in those gaps.

14
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,270
And that's the ultimate outcome.

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,720
And one of the best tools
for doing this is a training

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,110
needs analysis.

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,700
And when we look
at what that means,

18
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,010
it's a needs
analysis, obviously.

19
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,040
It's around the
series of activities

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,700
where we're looking at
trying to identify problems

21
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,500
or other issues
in the workplace.

22
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,500
It could be gaps.

23
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,090
And we're trying to determine
whether training is actually

24
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,900
the appropriate response.

25
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,310
I know the name
&quot;training needs analysis&quot;

26
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,924
seems to indicate that the
ultimate outcome is training.

27
00:01:13,924 --> 00:01:16,090
But the analysis is really
trying to work out, well,

28
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,310
is it training that's the
best solution to this problem?

29
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,190
Or is there some other solution?

30
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,890
And in some cases, it's
not a lack of training.

31
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,179
In many organizations
where I've worked,

32
00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:27,720
they've been given
adequate training.

33
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,250
They know what they
should be doing.

34
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,916
But they're not doing
it because there's

35
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,720
a cultural problem
in the organization

36
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,160
or there's attitude problems
in the organization.

37
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,050
And in that case,
sometimes it's not

38
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,940
training that's the solution.

39
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,090
So when we conduct a
training needs analysis,

40
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,950
we're trying to identify,
more than anything, a gap

41
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,400
in what we don't know
and what we need to know.

42
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,560
And that's really
the broad outcome

43
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,929
of a training needs analysis.

44
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:54,720
So that's what we mean
by performance gaps.

45
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,840
We want to know what the
difference is between what

46
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,215
we know and what
we need to know.

47
00:01:58,215 --> 00:02:00,730
But it's also often a
matter of compliance.

48
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,010
Again, I've worked in the
financial services industry,

49
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,480
which is very heavily
regulated by the government.

50
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,270
So there's a very large list
of requirements of training

51
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,290
that employees need.

52
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,950
For example, when they're
giving financial advice

53
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,570
to customers on the
phone, they need

54
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,560
to have a whole list of
training under their belt

55
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,930
before they're able to do that.

56
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,930
And so in many cases,
it's about trying

57
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,170
to ensure that we have
compliance as an organization.

58
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,510
It's also a really
critical process

59
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,799
when you have a new
system, for example.

60
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,760
Again, in another
organization I've worked for,

61
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,620
there was a system that
pretty much was implemented

62
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,625
across the whole
entire organization.

63
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:41,750
And everyone had to use it.

64
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,880
It was the main source of
data for the organization.

65
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,000
People need to know
how to use this system.

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,360
And that's where we try and
fill in the gaps with training.

67
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,490
It's also about trying
to identify where there

68
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,454
may be some areas where people
require further development.

69
00:02:58,454 --> 00:02:59,870
Again, the training
needs analysis

70
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,100
will help us with that.

71
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,529
And in the end, it
improves morale,

72
00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:05,820
because they can see that
the organization is committed

73
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,560
to trying to support them in
learning and getting the best

74
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,000
that they can out of them.

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,920
So there are also
a whole variety

76
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,750
of reasons that may
trigger the need

77
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,030
to conduct a training
needs analysis.

78
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,790
And some of the board ones are
around stuff movements, often

79
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,340
when staff have left
the organization

80
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,090
or have been shifted
to other departments,

81
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,380
it creates that
need to know, well,

82
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,579
who needs what training
and what, since they're

83
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,510
moving to different departments
or different areas or so on?

84
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:36,769
Another trigger is often
changes in technology.

85
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,029
In an organization I
worked, they essentially

86
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:42,070
changed their system,
where all their salespeople

87
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,350
were using tablets
while they on the road,

88
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,680
to entering all their data and
all their sales information.

89
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,610
Again, that created
the a for training

90
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,450
on how to use the tablets.

91
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,480
It's also another areas
or another trigger

92
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,690
is new markets-- so where
the organization is launching

93
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,070
a whole new type of product
that they've never had before,

94
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,170
for example.

95
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,079
That will then trigger
the need for training.

96
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,520
And as we mentioned earlier,
legislation or legal compliance

97
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,470
is also a big
trigger for training,

98
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,070
particularly in
Australia, where you

99
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,589
are required to show their staff
have undertaken certain levels

100
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:21,459
of training in order to meet
legislative requirements.

101
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,040
When we conduct a
training needs analysis,

102
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,797
it generates more information
for the organization as well.

103
00:04:28,797 --> 00:04:30,630
So as we're doing a
training needs analysis,

104
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,046
some of the
priorities in training

105
00:04:32,046 --> 00:04:35,229
will start to emerge in that
process, which is also helpful.

106
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:37,270
So we know where we need
to spend our money first

107
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,870
for training.

108
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,700
It will also help
us identify what

109
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,789
may be the best method
to deliver that training,

110
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,990
whether it's a face to
face training course,

111
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,830
whether it's an online
course, whether it's

112
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,219
some kind of informal
training, and so on.

113
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,640
It will also help us come up
with some training solutions

114
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,310
as to whether it requires
several days of training,

115
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,550
a short period of
training, a workshop.

116
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,740
Again, all the logistics
of the training

117
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,135
will emerge through the
training needs analysis.

118
00:05:06,135 --> 00:05:08,010
We'll also look at the
costs and the benefits

119
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,510
and be able to weigh the
two up together and also how

120
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,510
it will affect business
performance and business

121
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,740
efficiency in the end.

122
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,270
So the training needs
analysis is essentially

123
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,789
the first step in the
overarching training process.

124
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,700
We need to conduct the
training needs analysis really

125
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,900
before anything else.

126
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,358
And that's really
why we're looking

127
00:05:26,358 --> 00:05:29,940
at all these different
factors, external and internal.

128
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,990
And then as the progress of
the training process moves on,

129
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,440
it's almost like a cycle.

130
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,350
And often, in many
cases, we'll need

131
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,450
to go back to the
training needs analysis,

132
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,930
because a modification is
required in the training.

133
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,730
Some component isn't
working or some component

134
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,400
could be improved or so on.

135
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,950
And then we end up reverting
back to the training needs

136
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,250
analysis as our first stage.

137
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,910
And that's really how we work
through the training process.

138
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,010
And we will touch
on many aspects

139
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,849
of these throughout the module.

140
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,360
In our next topic,
we'll be looking

141
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,340
at some traditional
training options.

142
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,789
So these are really
things that organizations

143
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:05,580
have been doing for a
very long time-- face

144
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,739
to face training, informal
training, and so on.

145
00:06:07,739 --> 00:06:09,780
So we'll look at some of
these traditional topics

146
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,195
before we get a
little bit further

147
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:13,600
down the track in
this module, looking

148
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,220
at some of the more emerging
online training options.

149
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,111
