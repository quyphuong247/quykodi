00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,329
Hi.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,400
We're now at topic nine,
which is on induction.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,110
You've now got to a point
where you have a nice, brand

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,939
new employee ready
to start work.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,480
And although you may have
given them a lot of information

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,400
during the recruitment
process, it's

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,779
only really one they commence
employment at the organization

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,020
that they really get a feel
for what the job will be like

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,270
and where they fit in.

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,410
And it's a really critical
time for a new employee.

12
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,489
If we don't give them all the
tools and the information,

13
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,880
they can't really succeed.

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,570
And this will affect the
retention of this new staff

15
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,350
member.

16
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,100
So let's just have a look at
a couple of statistics that

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,980
will help us see why
induction is so important.

18
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,269
86% of new hires actually
decide whether or not

19
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,210
they'd like to stay
in the organization

20
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,780
within the first six
months of starting.

21
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,320
And that's really interesting.

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,820
Because it's a reflection
of the information,

23
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,460
and I guess the
support that's being

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,650
provided in those initial
stages of induction.

25
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,510
We also find that
new employees are

26
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,910
69% more likely to stay
for longer than three years

27
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,259
if they experience a
well-structured induction.

28
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,440
Now that's a really high--
it's a really high percentage,

29
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,640
because we really can see
the value of induction here.

30
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,100
Often, induction may follow a
whole variety of approaches.

31
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,619
But really, the best
way is to really try

32
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,020
to blend in a few
different strategies.

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,339
Rather than just
bringing someone in new,

34
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,670
sit down, have a
chat, explain to them

35
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,390
some policies and procedures.

36
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,300
And now you're off on your own.

37
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,820
And there are really some great
tools and innovative techniques

38
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,750
to induct staff and help
retain them for longer.

39
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,600
Before we really get into
some of these techniques,

40
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,774
let's look at the minimum
requirements for an induction.

41
00:01:52,774 --> 00:01:54,440
You really want to
make sure that you've

42
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,830
covered of these basics to
have a nice solid induction,

43
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,860
to help someone ease through
into a new organization.

44
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,690
One, you really want to
deliver a consistent message

45
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,400
so that all communications
from the organization

46
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,789
are really coming
across in the same way.

47
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:13,130
So if you've sent them some
information before they've

48
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,060
started, that same
information should be I guess,

49
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,790
consistent in an
induction session.

50
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,299
It should be
consistent in a face

51
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,650
to face meeting with their
new manager, and so on.

52
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,735
We want to keep messages
always consistent.

53
00:02:25,735 --> 00:02:29,072
And this really gives a new
employee a sense of security.

54
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:31,530
Because they know that they
get-- what they're getting into

55
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,860
is in fact, what will
eventually happen.

56
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,160
You also want to try and
give them some opportunities

57
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,230
to network with other employees.

58
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,160
And a great tool is
using a buddy system.

59
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,780
And it often works to
help buddy a new employee

60
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,550
with a more
experienced employee.

61
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,750
And from there, they're
able to further network

62
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,690
with other employees.

63
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,200
And this really becomes
their support network.

64
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,640
And will ultimately lead to
them feeling greater security,

65
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,380
and they'll be more
likely to stay.

66
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,470
You also want to encourage
feedback from this new starter.

67
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,070
It's really important to
be consistently evaluating

68
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,530
the induction process,
and your new employee's

69
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,210
the best source of
information for this.

70
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:14,420
If we're continually evaluating
our induction process,

71
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,079
we're able to better identify
how we can change our induction

72
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,570
strategies, our
induction techniques,

73
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,180
to better suit new starters.

74
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,060
And again to reach
that bottom line

75
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,150
of where we're retaining these
staff members for longer.

76
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,220
And that's the ultimate
outcome of induction.

77
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,030
Let's have a look
at some examples

78
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,970
of different types of
purchase to induction.

79
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,380
And essentially, the
best outcome to induction

80
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,109
is using a blended approach.

81
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,860
We're using more than
one of these techniques.

82
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,180
A very interesting
and innovative way

83
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,340
of inducting new
staff really can

84
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,980
occur before they've even
entered into the office.

85
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,359
And we call this
pre-commencement induction.

86
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,520
And it's often delivered
to new employees

87
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,780
through online learning.

88
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,890
So for example, a well-known
Australian surf-wear company

89
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,345
came up with a
fantastic idea for

90
00:04:02,345 --> 00:04:04,580
a pre-commencement induction.

91
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,920
So the new employee would
log into the system,

92
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,470
they'd put in their details.

93
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,460
Any they'd go through
different stages.

94
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,000
And often these
pre-commencement inductions

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,320
are trying to
familiarize the employee

96
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,180
with some basic housekeeping
of the organization, parking,

97
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,420
who to talk to in HR, some
basic policies or procedures.

98
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,430
And with this
particular induction,

99
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:32,450
as they went through each stage
of the induction e-learning,

100
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,870
and they successfully
passed that stage,

101
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,260
they were essentially building
a pair of board shorts.

102
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,334
So in the first stage
they chose the style,

103
00:04:39,334 --> 00:04:41,000
in the second stage
they may have chosen

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,700
the color, third stage I don't
know, some print or a pattern.

105
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,330
And by the time
they successfully

106
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,479
completed the online
induction, they

107
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,340
had completed their design
for a pair of board shorts.

108
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,039
They were actually manufactured
for each new starter,

109
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,280
and shipped to them.

110
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,330
So they actually receive their
very own, individual pair

111
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,680
of board shorts as a
reward for completing

112
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,280
the pre-commencement induction.

113
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,520
Which was quite
an innovative way

114
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,990
to really prepare
someone to enter

115
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,590
an innovative organization.

116
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,840
Another popular way of
inducting new employees,

117
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,070
particularly when you have
a group of new employees

118
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,099
starting at the same time,
is through a group induction.

119
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,722
So we would have all of them
sitting into a training room,

120
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:23,180
you'd have a trainer,
and they'd be

121
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,850
going through some of
those basic details

122
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,360
that you require when
you first start a job.

123
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,990
And in some cases we may
then get guest speakers.

124
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,010
So for example,
some organizations

125
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,090
will get the senior
managers to come in,

126
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,729
speak for a couple of
minutes on the vision

127
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,660
of the organization,
where they're heading,

128
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,810
and the strategies.

129
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,260
And this really adds
some level of commitment

130
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,010
to these new starters,
because they really

131
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,909
see that they're
relevant, and they're

132
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,710
important to this organization.

133
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,479
And it's a great
opportunity for them

134
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,660
to network with
other new starters

135
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,010
and really develop that support
system within the organization.

136
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:00,740
Lastly, I don't
think we can really

137
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,350
forget the value of just
a face to face induction

138
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,390
with the new employee's manager.

139
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,640
That time with their new
manager is really invaluable,

140
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,669
and I don't think that
we can ever really

141
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,720
exclude this is an
option in induction.

142
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,120
It's really critical.

143
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,390
Their manager is the one
that will be supporting them

144
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,360
more than anyone in
the organization.

145
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,720
And they're the one that they're
going to for support, not just

146
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,106
within their job, but also
maybe outside of their job.

147
00:06:26,106 --> 00:06:27,730
And they're really
giving them guidance

148
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,370
on what they can and can't do.

149
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,880
And that really
can't be avoided.

150
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,000
Now when we start looking at--
when we think about inductions,

151
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,870
I want you to consider
possibly your own experiences

152
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,680
in an induction.

153
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,010
And maybe discuss them
in the discussion forum.

154
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,409
And share with us some of your
experiences of inductions,

155
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,560
whether good or bad.

156
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,310
So in our next topic we'll
reach the final stage

157
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,809
of the recruitment process.

158
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,350
And this is really
where we're trying

159
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,650
to retain these new
staff for the long-term.

160
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,681
