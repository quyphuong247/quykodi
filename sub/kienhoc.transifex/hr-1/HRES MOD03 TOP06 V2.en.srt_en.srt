00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,090
Hi.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,640
Welcome to Topic 6.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,620
In this topic, we're
looking at lots

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,379
of different types
of online learning.

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,900
So in the last topic, we got an
overview of the online learning

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,689
environment.

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,380
And in this topic, we'll just
look what some of those tools

9
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,070
are.

10
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,820
And we're breaking
it down according

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,300
to different aspects of
the training function.

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,290
So some of the key, I guess,
objectives of a training

13
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,060
department and what they need
to do in an organization.

14
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,670
And then we'll look at
tools for each one of those

15
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,260
that we can apply to deliver
some form of online learning.

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,900
Before we start
though, I think it's

17
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,170
important to differentiate
between online learning

18
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,750
and e-learning because you
would have heard that term.

19
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,030
And it's often used
interchangeably.

20
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,090
And e-learning is really
the overarching concept.

21
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:54,590
OK.

22
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,960
So e-learning is any kind of
electronic type of learning.

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,000
And online learning utilizes,
obviously, the internet.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,379
So remember from the last
topic, we discussed simulations.

25
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,702
And a simulation as a
traditional learning option

26
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:12,160
would have just
been on a computer.

27
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,759
It wasn't necessarily online.

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,459
So in that case,
it was e-learning.

29
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:17,250
And some of the things
we're looking at now

30
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,670
are more so online learning.

31
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,060
And that's really the future
of where we're moving.

32
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,180
So we'll start looking
at different aspects

33
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,330
of the training function and
different tools we can use.

34
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,289
So if we can set up the function
of providing information

35
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,100
in a training department,
some of the online tools

36
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,119
that we can use would
include, for example,

37
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,160
a link to a document on
an intranet, for example.

38
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,780
Or it may be links
to PDFs that can

39
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,760
be downloaded with
instructions or manuals.

40
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,780
It can be any exchange
of various sites or links

41
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,660
to sites that will
provide information

42
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,270
to the [? employer. ?] So they
can be little things like that,

43
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,020
and they are considered to
be a form of online learning

44
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,050
that meets the information need.

45
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,539
And if we look at
the communication

46
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,790
part of the training
function, there's

47
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,289
a whole variety of
tools we can use there.

48
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:12,100
And one of the most
obvious ones is email.

49
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,019
Email is an online tool.

50
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,930
And often when we have two
learners or two employees

51
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,360
communicating and
providing information

52
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,350
about new processes, a new
policy, a new procedure,

53
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:29,010
whatever, that information and
that movement of information

54
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,799
is considered a form
of online learning.

55
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,350
Emails are obviously
the most popular.

56
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,019
It can be also
other things like,

57
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,970
and I guess this is the best
example, is your discussion

58
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,700
forum.

59
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,950
Online discussion forums,
online bulletin boards,

60
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,329
live chat forums, things like
that, where, again, we're

61
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,850
allowing that
communication between peers

62
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,130
or between a trainer
and a learner.

63
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,660
And again, there's
some common tools

64
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,760
for meeting the communication
function within a training

65
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,840
department.

66
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,880
Then we look at the
instruction function.

67
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,500
So obviously training is
about instructing people

68
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,410
on how to do particular tasks.

69
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,060
And when we look at
instruction, the key tool

70
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,310
there would be
forms of e-learning.

71
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,300
So, for example,
some organizations

72
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,190
may have an e-learning
module on how

73
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:22,220
to set up your email
account, for example.

74
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,840
And it would follow through all
the steps that you need to go,

75
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,173
and you'll see it on the screen.

76
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:28,080
You then need to go
here, and then you

77
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,730
need to press this and so on.

78
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,420
And it's providing
that instruction.

79
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:37,799
So e-learning is a great tool to
make that particular objective.

80
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,090
Learning experience, or
creating experience in learning,

81
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,300
is another part of
the training function.

82
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,280
And again, a great
way to do that

83
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,660
is to use tools
such as simulations.

84
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,900
And online simulations can
be probably more engaging

85
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,710
sometimes than the traditional
old school simulators.

86
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,240
Like I mentioned before, there's
a whole variety of things,

87
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,010
and the potential
is really limitless.

88
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,459
But often with the
simulators, you

89
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,970
can really create that
environment without the risks.

90
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,640
A great simulator that I've
seen a piece of e-learning

91
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,149
was one were you actually
have a little person,

92
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,540
and you had to walk through
a virtual workplace.

93
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,570
And as you walk
through the workplace,

94
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,770
you had to identify where the
work health and safety risks

95
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,479
were in that
particular workplace.

96
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,120
So, for example,
there was one part

97
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,200
were there was a cord
in front the doorway

98
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,330
which was a trip hazard.

99
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,109
People could trip
and fall and you

100
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,720
had to identify as
you were walking

101
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,300
through this virtual workplace.

102
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,320
So they're a great
tool for building

103
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,240
that learning experience.

104
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,390
We also have a
performance support

105
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,740
as another aspect of
the training function.

106
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,570
So that's in the form of
things like help tools.

107
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,480
So you may have
used them before,

108
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,720
and they're often
online where you

109
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,970
don't know how to use a
particular piece of equipment,

110
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:54,890
for example.

111
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,870
I've done it many
times with my printer,

112
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,110
and I'm trying to
work out why it's not

113
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,600
doing what I wanted to do.

114
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,250
And you can go to
an online help tool

115
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,810
and basically go through and
search for that information

116
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,490
that you need to help you
solve that particular problem,

117
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,940
give you support.

118
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,810
And the last one in
the training function

119
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,410
is training management.

120
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,150
And if you recall I mentioned
in a previous topic,

121
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,150
these Learning Management
Systems, or LMSs.

122
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:24,010
And they're the key tool for
managing how training occurs,

123
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,860
when it occurs, making
sure people are doing it,

124
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,760
deciding when it's mandatory,
collecting statistics

125
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,150
on how people do it.

126
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,260
So that's really the key
tool in managing training

127
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,280
on an online environment.

128
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,881
And all these
things sounds great,

129
00:05:37,882 --> 00:05:39,840
but with everything,
there's always a negative.

130
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,520
And sometimes that
learning experience

131
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,780
can be limited because
of poor internet speeds

132
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,950
or because of a poor
quality e-learning content.

133
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,930
So with everything,
there's a negative.

134
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,080
And I'd like you to think about
that in the discussion forum.

135
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,169
And maybe share some ideas
about any potential negatives

136
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,686
you think that can occur
from using online learning.

137
00:05:59,686 --> 00:06:01,310
And in our next topic,
we'll be looking

138
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,440
at employee development.

139
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,270
So really how we try and grow
an employee to that next stage.

140
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,544
