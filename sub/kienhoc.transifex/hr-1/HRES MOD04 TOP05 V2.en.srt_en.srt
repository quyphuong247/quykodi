00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:08,640
Hi.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,260
Welcome to topic five.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,010
In this topic we'll
be looking at tools

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,010
that we can use in the
performance appraisal process.

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,190
We'll just be focusing
on four different tools,

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,820
as these are the most popular.

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,180
And it'll-- we'll just
give an insight into some

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,500
of the advantages and
disadvantages of using each.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,986
And then may enable you when
you have to actually undertake

11
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,360
a performance
appraisal yourself,

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,817
to have a better understanding
of what might actually work.

13
00:00:31,818 --> 00:00:33,980
And produce a better
outcome for you.

14
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,790
In many instances though,
the best way to go

15
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,519
is to always use a combination.

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,750
So often, one
particular tool will

17
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,880
have disadvantages
that can be overcome

18
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,900
by using a second tool,
as a secondary form

19
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,180
of performance appraisal.

20
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,020
So let's have a look.

21
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,127
The most popular one is
the graphic rating one.

22
00:00:53,127 --> 00:00:54,710
And we'll go through
that in a minute.

23
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,200
Then we'll look at
the raking tool,

24
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,890
we'll look at forced choice,
and then critical incident.

25
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,690
Now, when we're talking
about the graphic rating,

26
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,518
this may be one that
you may have seen.

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,570
And I've actually included
an example of a performance

28
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,860
appraisal form in
further readings.

29
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,540
And this particular
form actually

30
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,860
uses the graphic rating.

31
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,190
And we use-- you'll
actually see it

32
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,429
because it will have a
scale from one to five.

33
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,300
And it will have a line
to different skills

34
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,259
and different competencies,
and some personality traits,

35
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,120
for example.

36
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,890
And the whole point
is that the employee

37
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,830
first circles what
they think is more--

38
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,600
is the most accurate
reflection of where

39
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,789
they sit between one and five.

40
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,440
And then once the
employee's actually

41
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,970
undertaken a self-assessment,
then the appraiser

42
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,420
would do the same thing
with the same questions.

43
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,430
And then again, circling
between one to five

44
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,610
where they feel the employee
lies in that particular scale.

45
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,929
And this is often one
of the most popular ways

46
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,900
to try and find some way
to rate and determine

47
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,150
the performance of a
particular employee.

48
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,020
It's quite often used
because it's simple.

49
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,839
It's quite easy to use.

50
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,009
It's easy for the
person being appraised

51
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:10,869
to understand where
their performance lies,

52
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,340
because you can
see it graphically

53
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,180
on that scale between one to
10, one to five, or whatever.

54
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,860
And in that sense it
allows better communication

55
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,600
in terms of the performance.

56
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,510
The only problem
is, often people

57
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,070
will be fearful to go
one way or another.

58
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,890
It's quite difficult
in some senses

59
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,029
using this particular tool
to justify a poor rating.

60
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,530
It's hard to say, OK well
I've actually only given you

61
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,260
a one because of
this, this, this.

62
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:40,929
And so on.

63
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,150
And in that case you find
that appraisers will often

64
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,200
stick to the middle.

65
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,100
And you'll find this
central tendency,

66
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,500
where all the scales are
somewhere near the middle.

67
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,640
Because that person
hasn't really

68
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,023
performed at an
exceptional standard,

69
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:57,190
but we don't want to say
that they've underperformed

70
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,010
because then we're
not sure how we're

71
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,790
going to explain to them what
their poor performance is.

72
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,840
And that's often the case
where the person conducting

73
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,710
the appraisal really hasn't
been trained effectively

74
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:12,070
on how to conduct them, and how
to communicate feedback back

75
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,640
to the employee.

76
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,149
And that's one of
our key problems.

77
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,730
But otherwise it's
quite a good tool.

78
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,410
Again, coupled with
another tool you're

79
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,960
more likely to get a
really good outcome.

80
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,300
The next tool we'll be looking
at is the ranking system.

81
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,140
Now, this ranking
tool really looks

82
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,809
at trying to compare people
in a team, for example.

83
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,930
And it's often used where
you'd have a job that's

84
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,360
done in an almost identical way.

85
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,190
And there's a limited
number of employees.

86
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,400
And what we essentially
do, is we rank them

87
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,390
in overall-- their
overall performance.

88
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,260
Who is the best at
this particular job.

89
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:53,329
So Sarah Jones is the best,
John Smith is the second best,

90
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:53,850
and so on.

91
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,269
Until we get down to the
least effective performer

92
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,450
in the group.

93
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,280
It does have its
own problems though.

94
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,440
It is quite simple.

95
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,920
And it seems quite effective,
and it's you know, quick.

96
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,109
But it does have a problem
in that we're not really

97
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,850
assessing aspects of their job
that they're doing really well,

98
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,390
or aspects of their job that
they're doing quite poorly.

99
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,550
We're just looking at
overall performance.

100
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,620
And what if that particular
team or group of employees

101
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,610
is performing poorly as a whole.

102
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,690
We don't see that,
because all we're saying

103
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,690
is this one person is
the best of the lot.

104
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,950
But have they met any
performance standard,

105
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,300
and we don't really know that.

106
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,070
Now we look at forced choice.

107
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:37,469
Forced choice is where
you're given phrases,

108
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,480
and all the phrases appear to
sound equally complimentary.

109
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,390
You can't-- it's difficult to
actually identify if one is

110
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,680
a negative or positive.

111
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,930
And they'll often sound like,
examples of them may be,

112
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,010
completes reports
90% of the time,

113
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,990
appears relaxed in
critical situations--

114
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,870
or stressful situations,
is rarely late to work,

115
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,890
maintains good
relationships with others.

116
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,010
So they'll often be a
statement that's quite general,

117
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,289
and you're really just forced
to choose one of those.

118
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,910
And the best thing
about this tool

119
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,630
is that the appraiser
doesn't actually

120
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,540
know which statement
is a negative one,

121
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,170
and which one is a positive one.

122
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,334
And then behind the scenes the
answers are actually weighted,

123
00:05:21,334 --> 00:05:23,000
and then we are able
to develop a score.

124
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,540
And based on that
score we can get

125
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,690
some idea of the performance
of that employee.

126
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,790
The difficulty with
it, it is quite time

127
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,340
consuming and difficult
to administer.

128
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,599
We'll also look at lastly,
at critical incidents.

129
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,030
Critical incidents is simply
just taking a period of time

130
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,450
where you are observing
an employee's behaviors

131
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,590
and identifying incidents where
they've performed really well.

132
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,890
And incidents where they've
performed really poorly.

133
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,780
And you really try and
avoid being general.

134
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,760
You always need
specific incidents.

135
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,870
You need to try and
avoid using percentages

136
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:02,050
because you're just looking
at actual incidence of action.

137
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,950
And you really need to
describe the behavior, and not

138
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,289
actually the skill.

139
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,120
And it needs to be
observable behavior,

140
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,953
so it needs to be
something that we can see.

141
00:06:14,953 --> 00:06:16,909
So saying oh, I
observed that X, Y,

142
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,520
Z had great knowledge
on this particular topic

143
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,830
is not something, you
can't observe knowledge.

144
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,027
So these four tools are
just really designed

145
00:06:24,027 --> 00:06:26,360
to give you an overview of
some of the options you have.

146
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,490
The best way is always
to combine them.

147
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,430
And in our next topic, we'll
be looking at different ways

148
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,490
that we can try and
help poor performers

149
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,480
and manage them in
the organization.

150
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,873
