00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:08,880
Hi.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,710
Welcome to talk topic
two, why training?

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,800
So in this topic
we'll be looking at,

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,160
I guess what some of the
benefits are of training.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,650
And the real cost
of not training.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,810
And the fact that that's
really a very common practice

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,490
in so many organizations, where
training is really undervalued

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,759
and it really has
a poor investment.

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,040
So we'll look at some
of these factors.

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,330
But firstly, it's
worth looking at really

12
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,199
what the key benefits
are to the organization.

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,150
Because there are
organizational benefits

14
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,108
and there is obviously
benefits to the employee

15
00:00:40,108 --> 00:00:41,708
as well, as an individual.

16
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,750
So let's look at these
overarching organizational

17
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,760
benefits that are really quite
simplistic at this stage,

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,739
but just gives us
a broad overview

19
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,490
of what the impact is of
training on an organization.

20
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:58,600
We'll look at the most obvious
ones is higher productivity.

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,800
If someone knows how to do
their job, they're better at it.

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,489
And it's as simple as that.

23
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,630
And that's what leads
to that increased

24
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,830
level of productivity.

25
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,590
Or if for example they're
given new training

26
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,840
on improved methods
of doing their job,

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,730
their productivity can increase.

28
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,420
So there's a direct
relationship between training

29
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,200
and productivity.

30
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,770
And I think that's a
valuable piece of information

31
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,190
to help organizations
understand why

32
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,289
they need to invest in training.

33
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,130
There's also an immediate
reduction in costs.

34
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,350
So think about
the employee who's

35
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,470
using a piece of machinery.

36
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,150
They haven't been
trained effectively

37
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,070
on how to use that
piece of machinery.

38
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,880
So what occurs?

39
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,190
Wastage.

40
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,440
There's several
pieces of equipment,

41
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,570
or disposable consumable
for that particular piece

42
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,520
of machinery that
are then wasted

43
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,821
because that employee
isn't inadequately trained,

44
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:54,320
and therefore doesn't actually
know how to use that machine.

45
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,580
So there are direct-- there's
a direct reduction in costs

46
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,240
as well, from adequate training.

47
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,289
It's also what I call
an insurance policy.

48
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,770
Well trained staff, a staff that
can really jump in a crisis.

49
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,560
So they're the employees
that can really

50
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,300
react in a sudden change
in the environment.

51
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,920
In a sudden crisis,
they are the ones

52
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,769
who are able to quickly use
their many skills that they've

53
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,020
been given training
on, to be able to get

54
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,920
through that
particular situation.

55
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,070
So in a sense, it's kind of
like an insurance policy.

56
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,680
It's also a
recruitment strategy.

57
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,320
Remember last module we were
looking at different ways

58
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,840
to attract people.

59
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,580
But sometimes there are
alternatives to recruitment

60
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,710
that are just as
good, if not better.

61
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,560
And in this case, it really is.

62
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,720
Re-training someone,
or giving them

63
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,650
training and in a
slightly different area

64
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,550
when we can see that
they have the potential

65
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,780
to succeed in that
particular role,

66
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,470
is really a great alternative
to recruitment as well.

67
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,390
And there are great
benefits in that.

68
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,510
We'll also look at
the employee benefits.

69
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,859
And some of these
are quite obvious.

70
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,260
With training comes
improved career prospects.

71
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,840
If I have training in some
new skill and some new area,

72
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,820
that therefore means I can carry
that through to the next job.

73
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,590
And it improves my
career prospects.

74
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,650
There's also this increased
level of job satisfaction.

75
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,335
If you're good at your
job, and you do it well,

76
00:03:18,335 --> 00:03:19,560
you're happy in your job.

77
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,400
And it's that--
there's that increased

78
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,890
level of job satisfaction.

79
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,399
As well as, which similarly,
you have the increased levels

80
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
of confidence.

81
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,600
Again, when I know how to
do my job I'm confident.

82
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,560
And as a group, training
is often a really great way

83
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,700
to build a team.

84
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,510
And to really allow
that team cohesion,

85
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,899
and everyone to work more
efficiently together as a unit.

86
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,330
And not just
individually as well.

87
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,960
So the benefits are
really two-fold.

88
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,060
For the organization, they're
also for the employee.

89
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,990
The real shame is that
often organizations really

90
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,510
can't see this value,
they can't see it.

91
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,814
Because training just
sounds like an expense.

92
00:03:59,814 --> 00:04:01,480
But the way that we
really need to think

93
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,679
about it is, what's the
cost of not training?

94
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,420
What's the cost of not
training our staff?

95
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,839
And you'd find in many
cases, it's more expensive

96
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,970
not to train someone than
it is to train someone.

97
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,650
Because that lack
of training leads

98
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,079
to all these other problems
that we mentioned earlier.

99
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,864
In lost productivity,
in reduced--

100
00:04:19,863 --> 00:04:22,690
in increased costs or
expenses, and so on.

101
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,790
So you really need to consider
that the risk of not training

102
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,470
more as an expense
than as a liability.

103
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,880
So in one-- or some
employers actually think,

104
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,139
well if I give my
staff training, well

105
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:37,930
they'll just leave.

106
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,513
Because they have all these new
skills and things, and they'll

107
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:41,659
go and find a better job.

108
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,190
And the research actually
suggests the opposite.

109
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,050
Organizations that invest in
training in their staff have

110
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,670
higher retention levels
than those that don't.

111
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,210
And there was one
particular study

112
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,729
that even went so far as to
say, employees who had actually

113
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,870
paid for their own training were
more likely to leave the job.

114
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,000
So we can see that
that investment has

115
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,540
some relationship
with retention.

116
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,820
So it's some of
these direct costs.

117
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,080
Poor quality of work.

118
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,159
Obviously without
training, you're

119
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,180
less able to do
the job correctly.

120
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,490
The quality's reduced.

121
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,374
Low employee morale.

122
00:05:16,374 --> 00:05:19,040
Like we said, if you know how to
do your job, you're more likely

123
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,230
be happier in it.

124
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,660
And the productivity, which
we also mentioned earlier.

125
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,090
And these are direct costs.

126
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,780
We also have risk
factors that can

127
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,750
affect how the
organization works

128
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,350
because of a lack of training.

129
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,070
And they may be
things like accidents.

130
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,680
So when you think about
work health and safety,

131
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,290
there is a reduction in
those through training.

132
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,970
There's a reduction
in employee loss

133
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,812
in terms of retaining
good employees.

134
00:05:41,812 --> 00:05:43,270
Often they'll leave
if they haven't

135
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,780
been given adequate training.

136
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,820
And there's also the
legal compliance issues.

137
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,150
There are many areas
of organizations

138
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,929
where we're required to
give employees training.

139
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,380
And that's-- there's a cost
obviously associated with that.

140
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,110
So in the next topic,
we'll be looking

141
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,180
at how you plan
for that training

142
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,300
in order to make
sure you maximize

143
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,890
the use of your
dollars in training.

144
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,388
