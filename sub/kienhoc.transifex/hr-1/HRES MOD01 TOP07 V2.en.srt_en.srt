00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,360
Hi, and welcome to
topic seven, which

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,100
is on Information
and Communication

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:18,060
Technology, or ICT, and
how it's impacted HR.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,580
Over the last century, we can
really see some major advances

6
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,869
and changes in the way that we
process information and the way

7
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,180
that we communicate.

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,180
And the two key
drivers of that have

9
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,220
been computers and the internet.

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,830
And obviously, they've had
a big impact on the way

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,440
that HR manges people.

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,730
Another new entrant in terms of
ICT and the impact it has on HR

13
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,220
is smartphones.

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,790
Currently in Australia,
smartphones dominate about 65%

15
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,280
of the total mobile
phone user market.

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,460
So they really impact
the way we work,

17
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,230
because they affect how
often we're available.

18
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,239
If you consider the smart
mobile phone allows us

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,750
to access emails, work
documents, phone calls.

20
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,580
So it really creates this
24 hour availability almost.

21
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,750
Another important way
that ICT has impacted

22
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,500
HR is through the
advances in technology

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,940
and tools and different ways
that we can now communicate

24
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,770
with each other even though we
may be geographically dispersed

25
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,039
is really the impact that
has on the availability

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,710
of flexible work arrangements.

27
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:30,009
So it's only through these
advances in technology

28
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,710
that we're able to do this.

29
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,449
In our next topic, we'll look
at virtual work teams, which

30
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,450
is really a great example of a
flexible working arrangement.

31
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,370
And we can see how
improvements in things

32
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,410
like not just the internet,
but the availability of email,

33
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,310
the availability of online
video conferencing tools,

34
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,380
of a whole variety of
technological tools

35
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,479
that allow us to really
bridge the gap of location.

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,930
And so we're able
to then pick out

37
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,310
the best talent from
different locations

38
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,940
from different
parts of the world.

39
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,899
But it means that
we can always be

40
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,919
able to filter into whatever
talent we need from anywhere.

41
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,340
ICT has also had a
significant impact

42
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,490
on training and development
in the HR function.

43
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,230
When we think of things
like this course,

44
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,280
it's only available through
advances in technology

45
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,310
that I'm able to
communicate with you

46
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,420
and you're able to gather
information and learn something

47
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,160
new.

48
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,060
So in the same way, we find
that technology has actually

49
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,717
allowed us to learn
in different ways.

50
00:02:33,717 --> 00:02:35,300
It's allowed us to
have access to that

51
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,830
learning in different locations.

52
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,860
And some of those examples
in a workplace scenario

53
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,550
may be the availability of a
learning management system.

54
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,070
On our learning
management system,

55
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,560
we may have e-learning,
similar to this course,

56
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,620
where we're teaching an employee
about a new policy or whatever.

57
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,490
And then our learning
management system

58
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,610
will tell us how
many of our employees

59
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,922
have done the e-learning.

60
00:02:59,922 --> 00:03:01,630
It will tell us how
many of our employees

61
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,560
have successfully
completed the [? ELE. ?]

62
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,190
And it allows us to monitor the
learning and the development

63
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,240
of our staff, and can also be
used for compliance purposes.

64
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,274
So we know if we have
a policy on bullying

65
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:15,940
and we want to make
sure that everyone's

66
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,970
done some online
learning on the policy,

67
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,850
and once they've done
it, it's ticked off

68
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,260
and we now know that
we've covered up

69
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,239
that particular point from
a compliance perspective.

70
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,700
So we can also
consider other aspects

71
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,730
that ICT has impacted HR.

72
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,760
If you look at what we call
HRIS, which is Human Resources

73
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,880
Information Systems, this is
really another advancement.

74
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,310
It's really impacted
on HR greatly,

75
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,160
because it's reduced
the time it takes

76
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,900
to manage so many aspects
of managing people.

77
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,590
So through these systems,
we can manage payroll,

78
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,360
we can manage leave.

79
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,170
So a great example of a human
resources information system

80
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,450
would be the self-service
site that many organizations

81
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,810
have now implemented.

82
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,470
So on these sites,
the employee logs in.

83
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,560
And once they go to, they have
access to their pay slips,

84
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,380
they have access to see how
much leave they have remaining,

85
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,120
to apply for leave to their
manager for an upcoming holiday

86
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,490
or whatever.

87
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,835
And so we can see some real
productivity improvements

88
00:04:21,834 --> 00:04:23,835
in that sense, because
we improve our efficiency

89
00:04:23,835 --> 00:04:26,349
and maintaining these
type of records.

90
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,390
And in HR, a large
portion of time

91
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:34,280
is taken just on those
administrative types of tasks.

92
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,929
So we've just been talking about
how a lot of these IT systems

93
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,640
can improve our efficiency
from a HR perspective.

94
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,250
Another great tool that
many organizations,

95
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,480
and in fact, most organizations
would have implemented

96
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,190
is a system such as an intranet.

97
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,330
So on an organizational
intranet,

98
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,590
we would have policies and
procedures housed there.

99
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,169
And I guess one of
the great things

100
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,940
about that is that once
you go into the intranet

101
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,590
of your organization, you know
that whatever you're accessing

102
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,400
is the most current
version of that document.

103
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,049
So when we think
back into the days

104
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,800
where everything
was paper-based,

105
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,460
you really didn't have
control over the currency

106
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,799
of important documents, such
as policies or procedures

107
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,740
and so on.

108
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,320
So intranet is also another
source of information.

109
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,190
It's another way that we can
communicate information from HR

110
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,490
onto everyone else
in the organization.

111
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,080
And it's beyond just
policies and procedures.

112
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,750
It can include manuals
and training guides.

113
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,370
We can include
social information

114
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,870
for the organization.

115
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,010
And it really is
essentially a knowledge bank

116
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,300
for the employees of
that organization.

117
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,510
Lastly, we'll look at social
media and how advances in ICT

118
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,099
have allowed HR
professionals to be

119
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,470
able to harness the
power of social media

120
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:56,190
to assist in maintaining and
just keeping up current HR

121
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,670
practices and functions.

122
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:02,630
So for example, we often use
social media or social media

123
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,510
sites, such as LinkedIn to help
us in the recruitment process.

124
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,050
So in many cases,
organizations are now

125
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,720
advertising on LinkedIn.

126
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,370
And you may also
see other people

127
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,310
that you've connected with.

128
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,707
A particular position becomes
available in an organization.

129
00:06:19,707 --> 00:06:21,790
And then we go, OK, let's
have a look at LinkedIn.

130
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,680
And let's see, maybe
they're someone

131
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,720
in our network of professionals
who may be suitably qualified

132
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,090
for this particular job.

133
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,270
So it starts
becoming a tool that

134
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,479
enables us to do some of
these basic HR functions,

135
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,350
like recruitment.

136
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,200
So in our discussion
forum, I'd like

137
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,880
you to think about some ways,
methods, tools, or strategies

138
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,380
that may have been utilized in
an organization you've worked

139
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,490
for or an organization
for which with you have

140
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,630
some kind of association or
you know of and maybe suggest

141
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,550
a couple of strategies that
they've used in implementing

142
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,840
ICT into the
organization, and maybe

143
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,630
some success stories
of how it's really

144
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,719
made some improvements
to the organization.

145
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,790
In our next topic, we
continue on the same theme,

146
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,620
because we look a
little bit deeper.

147
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,250
And we look at a
virtual work teams

148
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,550
and really how not just how
ICT has made them possible,

149
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,530
but about some of the
advantages and benefits

150
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,710
to organizations in considering
utilizing virtual work teams.

151
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,994
