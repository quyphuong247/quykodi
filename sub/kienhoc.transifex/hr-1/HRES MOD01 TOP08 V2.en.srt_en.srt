00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,100
Hi, and welcome to topic
eight on virtual work teams.

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,340
We're carry on the same
theme from the topic

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,710
we looked at on ICT
and its impact on HR.

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:22,120
And virtual work
teams only exists

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,700
because of an
advancement in ICT.

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,780
So what are virtual work teams?

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,460
Essentially, when we talk
about a virtual work team,

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,340
it's quite similar to
a regular work team

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,860
but in that the various
components of the team

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,664
may be geographically dispersed.

12
00:00:37,664 --> 00:00:40,080
So they may be over different
locations, different states,

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,269
different countries.

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,310
And why do organizations
really consider

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,490
utilizing virtual work teams?

16
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,110
Often, it comes down to money.

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,890
Essentially, using
virtual work teams really

18
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,750
has an impact on the
cost for an organization,

19
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,970
particularly when
you have talent,

20
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,699
and you want to
harness that talent,

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,580
but they're in
different countries

22
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,710
or in different
states or whatever.

23
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,990
So we really reduce
the cost, and we also

24
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,020
attract good staff and
good talent that we need.

25
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,860
So an example of a
virtual work team

26
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,930
may be, for example,
a temporary work team

27
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,150
maybe a particular project.

28
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,300
And you would have
various specialists who

29
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,860
would input into that
project, and some specialist

30
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,100
are base in one particular
state while the others are

31
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,339
based in another state.

32
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,320
And so that team
really works to get out

33
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,929
despite the
geographical locations

34
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,670
in very much the same way
as a regular work team,

35
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,010
and we'll look at some of the
tools at that the virtual work

36
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,360
teams can use to really
meet those outcomes.

37
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,370
Now let's explore some of the
benefits of virtual work teams

38
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,580
to an organization.

39
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,720
The most important
one is productivity.

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,460
And really, we've seen
throughout this module

41
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,929
that productivity is
often the key focus of HR.

42
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,390
We want to ensure
that everyone is

43
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,450
as productive as
they possibly can.

44
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,890
And with the virtual
work team, we

45
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,160
can improve productivity because
we're essentially breaking down

46
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,340
barriers of location.

47
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,630
And we're accessing talent that
we may not be able to access

48
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,329
and then that's not available
in our current location.

49
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,630
Another great benefit
to virtual work teams

50
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,030
is the reduction in expenses.

51
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,560
So if you consider
each time you have

52
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,090
to fly an employee to your head
office-- the cost of flights,

53
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,030
the cost of hotels, the cost
of taxis, and so on-- just

54
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,060
to sit through a strategy
meeting for example.

55
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,630
So we can see how those
costs quickly add up,

56
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:45,850
and it really is a great tool
in minimizing those costs.

57
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,400
And when we consider
the third point, which

58
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,010
is accessing this
wider talent pool,

59
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,070
it really provides
a jewel benefit.

60
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,000
We're reducing costs as
well as getting access

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,336
to the best possible
talent that we

62
00:02:58,336 --> 00:03:01,620
can that will help us meet
the objective of a project

63
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,880
or whatever.

64
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,560
And so we're really
getting a double benefit.

65
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,055
The last point seems quite
broad-- happier employees.

66
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:13,240
Why would we have happier
employees in relation

67
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,530
to a virtual work team?

68
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,540
Because often, it's only
through virtual work teams

69
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,220
that we're able to access
a different pool of talent

70
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,010
as well.

71
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,950
So, for example-- mothers.

72
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,890
Many mothers may not
really be able to go

73
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,609
through the regular standard
nine-to-five work arrangements

74
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,310
but have some very
unique skills or a part

75
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,740
of a particular
industry where there's

76
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,670
quite a shortage of
skills or talent.

77
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,109
We can be able to harness
those skills and those talents

78
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,980
by creating the
virtual work team

79
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,869
and allowing access to that
particular talent pool.

80
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,830
And the same goes for,
potentially, employees

81
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,660
who may have a
particular disability.

82
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,440
Again, we're able to access
their skills and their talent

83
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,000
just in another way.

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,780
Let's look at some
of the tools that we

85
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,530
can utilize in a
virtual work team

86
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,680
and it's really only
because of advances in ICT

87
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,370
that we're able to
connect in this way.

88
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,550
And there's a whole
variety of tools.

89
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,400
This one's a little
of the older end,

90
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,200
but one particular tool is fax.

91
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,229
Although, it is becoming phased
out and not so useful anymore.

92
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,570
But we'll also look at the
other tools such as audio

93
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,540
and video conferencing tools.

94
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,150
So, for example, programs like
Skype working extremely well

95
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,460
for collaborating in a meeting
with other project team members

96
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,039
or other employees in
different locations or states

97
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,060
or whatever and allowing
that personal aspect

98
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,290
in collaboration, in
working with others.

99
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,140
We also have a whole
variety of, I guess,

100
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,882
new and emerging programs.

101
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:51,840
And when we talk about
that, we consider things

102
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,760
like Groupware-- so programs
that allow several people

103
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,740
to input and to really
working in a more

104
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,840
direct, collaborative way.

105
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,140
A great tool that
I've used in the past

106
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,979
is a cloud-based program
called Smartsheet.

107
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,030
So Smartsheet is essentially
like an Excel spreadsheet,

108
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,559
and I've worked on
using Smartsheet

109
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,890
with a whole team of others.

110
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,400
And we're working
on a project where

111
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,890
it required regular updates
of progress and status reports

112
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,159
and so on.

113
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,080
And so in using that,
we were each able to,

114
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,530
live, really be able to find
out where each of other team

115
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,429
members were up to at
this particular project.

116
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,210
So there's a whole
variety of tools,

117
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,123
and this is, by no means,
an exhaustive list.

118
00:05:36,124 --> 00:05:38,290
But you'll find it's only
through these advancements

119
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,710
that we're able to offer
the virtual work team.

120
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,049
So we've talked about the
benefits of using virtual work

121
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,420
teams, but I'd like you now to
go into the discussion forum

122
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,290
and maybe think
of some challenges

123
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,890
that virtual work
teams can encounter.

124
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,180
You may have been part
of a virtual work team--

125
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:01,410
either within your organization
or within a study initiative

126
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,290
or whatever-- and
maybe think about what

127
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,830
some of the challenges
are that you

128
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,200
might face in those
circumstances.

129
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,360
