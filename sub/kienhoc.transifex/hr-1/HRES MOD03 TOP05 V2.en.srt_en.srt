00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,469
Hi.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,900
This is topic five on the
online learning environment.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,620
So in this topic, we're looking
at how things like the internet

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,185
and technology have changed
the way that we learn.

6
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,810
And in the last topic
we looked at some

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,939
of those traditional
training options.

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,300
And now we're really
looking at how technology

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,220
has changed and improved
the way that we learn.

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,560
And it can be through a
variety of different things.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,920
We look at things like
online self paced e-learning.

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,100
We look at virtual classrooms.

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,150
We can consider things like even
the uses of tools like Skype

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,890
with video conferencing
and training,

15
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,150
so we can be in lots
of different locations

16
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,990
and all be learning
about something

17
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,810
at the same time in real life.

18
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,250
And it's all these
different tools

19
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,920
that have really impacted
the way that organizations

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,050
can offer training, really.

21
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,040
And we'll look at a
few different options

22
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,040
in this topic.

23
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,320
In particular, we'll
at first look at

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,360
what are the benefits
of the online learning

25
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,200
environment to the
organization, and then

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,680
what are the benefits
for employees.

27
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,260
When we consider
the organization,

28
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,230
there's some really significant
cost savings benefits.

29
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:20,570
And really all of these have
some element of cost involved,

30
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:24,309
which can really improve
or take your training

31
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,110
budget that little bit further.

32
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,090
When we look at it from an
organizational perspective,

33
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,450
the reduction of
cost is around things

34
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:35,750
like having to fly in
sales representatives

35
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,120
from different states
into head office

36
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,900
to sit through a half a day
training session, for example.

37
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,410
Imagine the cost
of all the flights

38
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,033
and all the cost of
the accommodations.

39
00:01:45,034 --> 00:01:47,200
And that's a very
simplistic example.

40
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,670
Where in an online
environment, that training

41
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,550
can be done from wherever the
sales representatives are,

42
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,869
and the cost is
extremely minimal.

43
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,839
So that that's a simple example,
but there's so many other ways

44
00:01:58,839 --> 00:02:00,630
that there can be a
huge reduction of costs

45
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,130
through online training.

46
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,259
Also the other benefit is that
it's standardized, so it's not,

47
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,399
we've had one trainer
give this information

48
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,190
and another training
give that information.

49
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,210
We know the information
is exactly the same.

50
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,090
And its standard.

51
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,150
So each learner is learning
the same information,

52
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,070
same knowledge, and
acquiring similar skills.

53
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,579
It's also really
beneficial in that you

54
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,444
have that flexibility of
development at any time.

55
00:02:27,444 --> 00:02:29,609
And this is particularly
important for organizations

56
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,720
that may offer 24 hour
service, for example,

57
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,570
and they have staff
working in various shifts.

58
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,290
How do you lock
away a block of time

59
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,495
to say, OK you need to
attend these training

60
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:43,770
sessions from two to
three on whatever day,

61
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,020
when you have such a dynamic
working environment where

62
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,750
there's this constant change.

63
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,980
And that's a really,
really important benefit

64
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,890
in today's workplaces.

65
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,119
They really are
constantly changing.

66
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,955
And also, it's centralized.

67
00:02:58,955 --> 00:03:01,590


68
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,930
One location or one
person can really

69
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,880
control who's doing what
training, and which ones

70
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,390
they're required
to do at what time,

71
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,059
and which ones will be
standard or mandatory

72
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,900
for that particular employee.

73
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,320
And that's again a
time and cost saver.

74
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,700
Now let's consider some of
the benefits to the employee.

75
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,737
And flexibility,
obviously, is not just

76
00:03:22,737 --> 00:03:24,570
a benefit to the
organization, but it's also

77
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,611
benefitting the employee.

78
00:03:25,611 --> 00:03:28,160
Allowing them to go, OK,
I have got some down time

79
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,100
in this part of my day where
I don't have so much work.

80
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:35,200
I'm going to jump in and
do my course on whatever.

81
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,299
And really when
you think about it,

82
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,190
it allows employees to
better use their time.

83
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,720
So there's an efficiency in
that as well, a cost saving.

84
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,400
They also get
immediate feedback,

85
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,750
which is really beneficial.

86
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,075
So often many of these
e-learning modules or programs,

87
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:53,200
when you go through and
then you answer a question,

88
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,970
it will tell you immediately,
no, that's incorrect

89
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,590
or yes, that's correct.

90
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,100
And give you some explanation
as to why or why not.

91
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,820
And that immediate feedback
is an important benefit

92
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,359
to a learner.

93
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,000
The accessibility.

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,550
So think about learners
that are geographically

95
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,150
dispersed in different
countries, different states.

96
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,180
Think of learners that
may have a disability

97
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,370
and can't have access to
particular forms of training

98
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,220
in particular locations.

99
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,930
This is really, really
beneficial for those groups.

100
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,010
Also it allows simulation.

101
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,539
As I mentioned in
the previous topic,

102
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,230
the technologies really
allowed simulations

103
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,070
to go where they have
never been before.

104
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,849
And really allow a
real life practice

105
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,400
doing a particular task,
but without the risks

106
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,710
associated with it.

107
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,299
So it's really an
improvement in being

108
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,040
able to work in those
high risk environments.

109
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,710
Even though online training is
still a relatively new concept,

110
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,630
there has been some change
over the last 10 years as well.

111
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,740
Initially when the concept of
online learning first began,

112
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,810
it was really transferring
texts onto a screen.

113
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,630
And that was really
all that it was.

114
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,120
And now we've moved so
much more into a greater

115
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,520
level of interaction.

116
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,020
And when we mean
that, we would look

117
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,159
at tools like
e-learning modules.

118
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,370
You may have come across
them at some point.

119
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,690
It may be worth having
a quick discussion

120
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,910
with others in the
discussion forum.

121
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,322
To say, well, maybe suggest
some of the e-learning

122
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,780
that you may have
done in the past,

123
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,299
and what you found
really beneficial

124
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,990
and what you found
didn't work so well.

125
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,110
So a lot of these
types of learning

126
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,490
have really, really changed
the way that we learn.

127
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,900
There's greater
levels of interaction.

128
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,469
There's the ability to interact
with others through things

129
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,960
like a discussion forum.

130
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,239
I mean, this course is a prime
example of online learning.

131
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,670
It allows interaction between
the learner and the trainer

132
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,290
and allows the interaction
between peers in a course,

133
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,610
for example.

134
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,330
And so we've really
moved further away

135
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,710
from text on a
screen to something

136
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,710
that's really
engaging, and bringing

137
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,000
the learner and the
trainer together.

138
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,560
And the other implication
is that we now

139
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,830
have ways to monitor and
manage that online learning

140
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,919
through systems such as Learning
Management systems, or LMS,

141
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,710
as some people call them.

142
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,289
And LMS is really-- it's like
a platform, a system that

143
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,570
holds all this
information on training.

144
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,420
And again, what
you're doing right now

145
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,680
is hosted on a Learning
Management system.

146
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,050
And all your quizzes, and
your discussion forum, this

147
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,390
is all in the system.

148
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,800
And the great thing about
these systems in the workplace

149
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,340
environment is that they allow
the organization to monitor

150
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,840
the training that's occurring.

151
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,880
To monitor how effective it is.

152
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,290
I mean, organizations where
I've worked in the past

153
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,790
were able to say, OK, we want
everyone to do this training

154
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,630
course on sexual harassment,
for example, because we want

155
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,376
to make sure everyone knows what
they should and shouldn't do.

156
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,000
And so we've placed
the course and then

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,610
we can allocate that course to
particular groups of employees

158
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,190
on the e-Learning
Management System.

159
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,360
And then we can say to these
employees, it's mandatory.

160
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,100
You get an email reminder.

161
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,540
You have to do this
particular course.

162
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,080
Then we can go back and check
who has done the course,

163
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,349
and whether they successfully
completed the course,

164
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,700
or they failed the course.

165
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,640
So again we've really moved
into a whole different learning

166
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,700
environment online
that's really allowed

167
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,140
us to get the most success,
or the most effectiveness,

168
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,400
from the training.

169
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,929
In our next topic,
we'll be looking

170
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,110
at different types
of online learning.

171
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,100
So different tools and how they
meet the needs of the training

172
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,650
function.

173
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,441
