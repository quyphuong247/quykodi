00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,050
Hi.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,850
Welcome to topic seven
on employee development.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,660
So, so far in this module, we've
looked at training or learning

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,085
and in this topic we'll
focus more a development

6
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:19,240
and what that is.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,740
And before anything
we'll really get

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,720
into well what's the difference
between training or learning

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,779
and development.

10
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,490
And really the different
outcomes or objectives of both.

11
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,790
We'll also look at
some development tools.

12
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,659
So different practices
or activities

13
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:36,780
that organizations can use to
help their employees develop.

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,650
And we'll also look at this
concept of blended learning

15
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,239
across both training
and development.

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,420
So starting off, let's
have a look at training.

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,350
Training really is more
so about a specific skill

18
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,590
or task or activity.

19
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,810
Training is more narrow
than development.

20
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,900
We're looking at specific skills
around specific activities

21
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,820
and learning how to
do those unique tasks.

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,560
It's often around
short term goals.

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,020
So we attend a training
session for example,

24
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,240
we take on some training
online for example.

25
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,937
And then we apply those unique
skill sets or that unique piece

26
00:01:16,937 --> 00:01:19,020
of knowledge that we've
gathered from the training

27
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,210
immediately to our job.

28
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,460
So there's a short
term application.

29
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,550
At the application,
yes it may last over

30
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,850
a long period of time.

31
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,169
But it's a ideally training,
apply, training, apply.

32
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,920
And that's the key
focus around training.

33
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,280
It's more of a
short term process.

34
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,310
Whereas if we compare
that to development.

35
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,010
Development is more
about a long term growth

36
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,330
as we mentioned earlier.

37
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,130
Long term growth of an employee.

38
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,929
And that really looks at
some activities or tasks

39
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,820
that try and change their
ability to cope for example.

40
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,080
We might attend a
training session

41
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,990
on how to solve a
particular problem.

42
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,179
And that's training.

43
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,420
But how about learning how
to cope with the unknown.

44
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,430
Or learning how to cope with
not having the information

45
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,530
or the resources or the tools to
overcome a particular problem.

46
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,430
How do you learn that skill
of coping under pressure?

47
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,350
Or coping when you don't have
all the resources you need.

48
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,980
And that's more of an
example of development.

49
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,829
Development is about building
those skills in the unknown.

50
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,340
And that's quite
different to training.

51
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,010
So it's more so
about general skills

52
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,160
like we mentioned, problem
solving and analytical skills.

53
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,020
Coping I guess coping
mechanisms for situations

54
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,730
of pressure or crisis.

55
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,070
And these are all
general broad skills.

56
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,130
And the capabilities
that laid on to them

57
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:48,720
are more so about being able to
really make changes that abroad

58
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,422
and affect the
organization broadly

59
00:02:50,422 --> 00:02:52,880
in the capabilities that are
required for a person in order

60
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,960
to do that.

61
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,400
So when we talk
about development

62
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,875
it's often associated
with more senior roles,

63
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,500
because that's where you really
need those kind of capabilities

64
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,880
to affect an organization.

65
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,829
Let's look at some
activities or some tasks

66
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,904
that we can under take in
the development process.

67
00:03:09,904 --> 00:03:11,570
And when we're talking
about development

68
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,370
there's really two key areas.

69
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,300
So there's direct
development activities,

70
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,600
which are really individual
one on one activity.

71
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,510
And there's group
based activities.

72
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,709
And we'll look at each.

73
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:25,700
So with our direct
activities research

74
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,250
is a very simple,
easy development tool.

75
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,620
And that can be in the form of
researching online, researching

76
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,150
using books, on a subject matter
that's relevant to your job,

77
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,140
for example.

78
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,250
And it's often us going through
and looking at the latest

79
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,310
news in our industry, in journal
articles or industry newspapers

80
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,330
or magazines or whatever.

81
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,260
And that's a really
simple way of developing

82
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,799
a broad level of
knowledge in our industry.

83
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,480
Writing is another
great development tool.

84
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,959
Often people with a wealth
of experience over time

85
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,960
will actually write
journal articles,

86
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,980
or industry magazine
articles, things

87
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,280
along those lines that really
impart their knowledge.

88
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,630
And in imparting their
knowledge on to someone else

89
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,840
or to the general public
they can then also

90
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,790
identify gaps in their skills.

91
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,930
And again it's a way to
develop them more broadly.

92
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,800
Training of this has always
been a great development tool.

93
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,280
When you have to impart
information and knowledge

94
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,309
and skills on to
others you're really

95
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,481
able to see what you're doing.

96
00:04:30,481 --> 00:04:32,230
What you're doing well
and what you're not

97
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,920
doing well through
teaching others.

98
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,080
And you're able to identify
our own gaps as well.

99
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,180
We also group
discussions and this

100
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,810
can take so many
different forms.

101
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,490
So it can be
internal discussions

102
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,660
within say a group of people
within the organization.

103
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,010
It can be group discussions with
an industry body or industry

104
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,530
board.

105
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,309
It can be so many
different ways,

106
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,710
but the purpose behind
those group discussions

107
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,409
is getting like minded
people in a similar industry

108
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,437
really being able to push
the envelope of what's

109
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,520
going on in that industry.

110
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,830
You know, what challenges do
we have how can we change these

111
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,940
and how can we do that.

112
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,590
And in that process of
those discussions again

113
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,489
you're able to develop
your own understanding

114
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,940
and your own skills
and again in some cases

115
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,800
identified knowledge gaps.

116
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,950
I didn't know that.

117
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,570
And therefore that pushes
another level of development.

118
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,150
Let's look at group based.

119
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,510
Group based activities for
development can really vary

120
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,060
and there's a whole
variety of them.

121
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,200
Things like field trips.

122
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,300
So taking a trip
down to another,

123
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,280
another site from
your organization

124
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,650
or competitive site,
and really discussing

125
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,599
what's going on there.

126
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,340
And often it will lead
to a report of some kind

127
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,489
where you're really
extracting information.

128
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,280
Seminars are a fantastic
tool for development.

129
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,419
So it can be a whole
bunch of different things.

130
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,040
It can be skills based.

131
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,860
Could be a seminar on
how to solve problems

132
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,480
how to think
critically whatever.

133
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,250
Networking is also a great
tool that really leads on

134
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,330
from things like
seminars and conferences.

135
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:10,219
Often when we go to these events
we're gathering information.

136
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,770
But we're also
meeting other people

137
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,469
and there's a source of
information and development

138
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,060
from them also.

139
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,080
And the last one is team
building activities.

140
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,890
So that can be, like the
classic scavenger hunt.

141
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,120
And in doing these sort of
skills based tasks with others

142
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,730
you're able to again
to develop your skills

143
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,290
like leadership for example.

144
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,540
Whether it's training
or development

145
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,060
the key to a really
successful strategy

146
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,965
is really around
blended learning.

147
00:06:35,965 --> 00:06:39,440
So taking an approach that
blends as many of these tools

148
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,340
as you can to really offer
the best possible outcome.

149
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,479
So it's a mixture of
face to face training.

150
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,030
It's a mixture of
online learning.

151
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,919
It's a mixture of seminars
and conferences and whatever.

152
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,650
And that blended
approach is really

153
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,049
what often leads to the
best possible outcome.

154
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,030
And in our next topic, we'll
be looking more narrowly

155
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,909
at one particular aspect which
is mentoring in the workplace.

156
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,670
And the effect that can have
on developing employees.

157
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,924
