00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,940
Hi, and welcome to topic four.

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,290
In this topic, we'll be looking
at social media and its impact

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,439
on the recruitment process.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,220
Initially, we'll
really look at how

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,529
social media has
expanded so much.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,900
Alone in just the last
nine years the growth

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,029
has been phenomenal.

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,960
In Australia we're looking
at approximately 11.6 million

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,740
users of a variety of
different social media sites.

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,640
And this is really indicating
that social media is really

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,140
playing an important
role in our lives,

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,130
and is quite prominent
in most of our lives.

14
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,050
And this really provides
a window of opportunity

15
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,849
from a recruitment perspective
because we then now

16
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,850
have this different avenue
to tap into to try and find

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,930
that perfect candidate, and
try to find the perfect person

18
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,710
to fit the vacancy
that we may have.

19
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,980
And when we think of the
more traditional ways

20
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,529
that we've attracted or
sort a candidate for a job,

21
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,010
and we think of things
like newspaper advertising,

22
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,280
and we think of things like
job fairs or job exhibitions

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,890
and things like that,
and really, that's

24
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,970
looking like the past.

25
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,090
And social media is
really pushing us

26
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,620
into what the future will
look like in recruitment.

27
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,580
And in one sense, if
organizations are not

28
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,810
including social media in
some way in their strategy

29
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,920
to attract and recruit
the right people,

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,360
they'll essentially
be left behind.

31
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,460
So now we'll look at
some statistics that

32
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,979
might help us get a better
idea of just exactly

33
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,190
where social media is going, and
how much power we can harness

34
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,980
from social media in
HR and many aspects,

35
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,500
but particularly at the
moment, in recruitment.

36
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,090
So we'll look at some of
the three main sources

37
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,340
or the three sites that
are used most often.

38
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,290
And we consider Twitter,
we'd also consider Facebook,

39
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,010
and we'd also consider LinkedIn.

40
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,140
And we'll in this topic
just stick to those three,

41
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,310
but, obviously, there
are many more out there,

42
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,030
and there are many
that are just specific

43
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,900
to particular industries.

44
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,630
And that's a whole other
level so we'll just

45
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:22,320
look at some three broad sites
for our purposes in this topic.

46
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,060
So let's look at
some statistics.

47
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,430
If we've got 14.4 million
people have used social media

48
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,360
at some point to find a job.

49
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,690
And that's really giving us
an indication of our patterns

50
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,870
and our behaviors as job seekers
in that we're now considering

51
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:46,310
social media as just a regular
part of searching for a job.

52
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,510
And if we look here at
56% of HR professionals

53
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,649
have actually started
using social media

54
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,970
to source candidates.

55
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,190
And that's really interesting
because that's really

56
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,870
essentially half of all
HR professionals, which

57
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,850
is quite a substantial amount.

58
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,820
I would be interested in knowing
exactly how many of them only

59
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,299
use social media as their prime
resource or their primary tool

60
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,280
to attract candidates,
but, again, it gives us

61
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,560
some insight into how much
both job seekers and HR

62
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,730
professionals are now
relying on social media.

63
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,420
So if we look on
our next statistic,

64
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:27,809
we've got 24% of managers found
both candidate personality

65
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,620
and fit from a social profile.

66
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,280
So this is before
they've actually

67
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,090
met this particularly candidate.

68
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,370
They've looked at their profile
on, for example, LinkedIn,

69
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,290
and from that profile they
were able to determine

70
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,310
some personality
and cultural fit

71
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,560
indicators that this
person might actually

72
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,780
work quite well in
their organization.

73
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,360
And that's quite an
interesting concept,

74
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,990
and it really does
bring home that we

75
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:57,280
do need to be very careful
how we present ourselves

76
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,810
on these type of sites.

77
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,390
And ensuring that presentation
is really an accurate

78
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,690
reflection of us if
we're a job seeker

79
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,380
because the reality is, at
some point, the organization

80
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,700
will look towards
your LinkedIn profile

81
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,739
and try and gather some
more information about you

82
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,270
from that.

83
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,120
We will also find here,
which is really interesting,

84
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,519
89% of all companies--
and this was

85
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,340
in 2011-- used social
media for recruitment.

86
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,250
89% is quite a
significant amount.

87
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,430
So we can really see
that this is not just

88
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,754
a passing fad or something that
we've picked up along the way

89
00:04:38,754 --> 00:04:40,670
and it will eventually
die off when we go back

90
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:43,460
to our traditional
recruitment strategies,

91
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,489
but this is really where
we're heading for the future,

92
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,900
and this will then
become the standard.

93
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,239
As was many, many years
ago where the standard way

94
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,510
was to simply put
a job advertisement

95
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,770
in a newspaper,
and that was really

96
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,520
your first point of call.

97
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,115
So we're really moving toward
a completely different reality

98
00:05:02,115 --> 00:05:03,710
in recruitment.

99
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,140
Now, this all
sounds very positive

100
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:10,750
and recruitment through social
media is sounding flawless,

101
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,640
but nothing is ever
really flawless,

102
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,880
and we really need to be quite
careful as to which strategy we

103
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,150
decide to take.

104
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,940
Now, if we're considering
Twitter, for example,

105
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,820
as a tool in
recruitment, we need

106
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,140
to consider the
fact that you have

107
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,961
a very short space or a very
short amount of characters

108
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,460
that you can really
give an accurate

109
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,609
description about
this particular job,

110
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,870
and it's quite difficult to
broadcast that a job even

111
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,710
exists.

112
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,020
And then we may
consider Facebook.

113
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,419
Facebook is primarily
a social site.

114
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,670
So you're really thinking,
am I getting the right type

115
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,340
of people through
something like Facebook.

116
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,060
And again, with increased
privacy settings

117
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,050
and so on, it does become
difficult to actually reach

118
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:56,230
someone that has some chance
of being a potential candidate.

119
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,180
And then we consider
LinkedIn, which will probably

120
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,500
be the most effective
of the three

121
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,430
because it really is a
professional networking site,

122
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:10,120
and it is designed to
be used in that fashion.

123
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,340
There's also limitations
though, obviously.

124
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,419
As you may have
noticed with Facebook,

125
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,160
there's privacy issues, and
the same way with LinkedIn.

126
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,180
You can't just contact
someone you're not actually

127
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,370
a connection with, for example.

128
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,900
So we can't just look through
LinkedIn profiles and go,

129
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,539
hey, this person looks
very well suited to my job,

130
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,990
I might contact them.

131
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,770
It doesn't really work that way.

132
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,010
So it really does
require some refinement,

133
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,770
and there are some limitations.

134
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:43,000
Yes, you can place a job
advertisement on LinkedIn,

135
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,740
but it's in much the
same way that it's

136
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,740
placed on any job-seeker
website so there really

137
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,160
isn't much of a
differentiation that way.

138
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,080
LinkedIn really requires you to
build a network first, and then

139
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,810
be able to tap into that
network to recruit people.

140
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,520
A final consideration for using
social media in recruiting

141
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,599
is really how recruiters
may use social media

142
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,400
sites as a way to search
and see what you're

143
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,280
up to as a potential
job candidate,

144
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,219
and make some assumptions on
your suitability for a job

145
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,677
based on these activities.

146
00:07:14,677 --> 00:07:17,260
So I'd like you to go and have
a look at the discussion forum,

147
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:22,080
and possibly give me some
implications for recruiters

148
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,320
and implications
for potential job

149
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,865
candidates of that
particular activity.

150
00:07:26,865 --> 00:07:28,490
And in the next topic,
we'll be looking

151
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,579
at some of the
legal implications

152
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:31,870
during the recruitment process.

153
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,227
