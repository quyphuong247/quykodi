00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,060
Hi, and welcome to topic
nine on work-life balance.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,320
In this topic, we're
really considering

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,400
what's backed by
so much research is

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,869
that if we reduce
the amount of stress

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,730
and pressure our employees face
in trying to meet the competing

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,260
demands of their work life
and their personal life,

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,450
we're more likely to get
them to be more productive.

9
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,060
And that's really
what the key benefit

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,360
is of providing work-life
balance initiatives.

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,250
We really ensure that we
have increased productivity

12
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,600
and better commitment
from those employees,

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,010
because they appreciate the
fact that their organization

14
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,849
considers that they have
a life outside of work.

15
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,810
And they understand that there's
two challenging pressures

16
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:51,600
there.

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,525
And that's really a key driver
for higher levels of commitment

18
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:59,010
and high levels of
loyalty from employees.

19
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,989
Now let's look at
some current trends

20
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,680
in our workforce in Australia.

21
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,670
At the moment, we
have a large portion

22
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,010
of women in the workforce.

23
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,990
And, generally, women
tend to have the greater

24
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,640
share or greater portion
of responsibility

25
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,000
for the care of children.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,040
And that has a big impact
in applying their skills

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,830
into a workforce or
applying their skills

28
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,580
into an organization, because
there are limitations,

29
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,500
and those pressures
to care for children

30
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,120
are so much stronger
and so much higher.

31
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,420
So that's one aspect in the
current workforce in Australia.

32
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,660
Another one, which
you may have heard of,

33
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,429
is our aging population.

34
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,780
So we have quite a large portion
of the population is elderly.

35
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:49,250
And in many cases, yes, they
may have support or help

36
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,270
or have external carers.

37
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,119
But for a lot of our
aging population,

38
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,870
it's other family members
that are taking care of them.

39
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,790
And, again, that adds
a whole nother pressure

40
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,340
and a whole nother level of
pressure for many employees,

41
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,410
which, again, they're
trying to compete

42
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:10,350
with the pressures in their
work or in their employment.

43
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,350
We also have another issue
in terms of customer service

44
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,290
availability.

45
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,916
So now we're expecting
organizations--

46
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,790
we're expecting more of
our service providers

47
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,769
to be available all the time.

48
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,640
I want to call my phone
company at 12 o'clock

49
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,549
at night, because I want to
know why they've charged me

50
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,240
incorrectly on my last
phone bill, or whatever.

51
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,020
And so our expectations
as consumers

52
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,870
have meant that our service
providers have to essentially

53
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,730
offer or increase the
availability for customer

54
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,609
service.

55
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:44,010
And really that has an
impact on work-life balances.

56
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,850
In many cases, it
means that there's

57
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,440
extended periods of
time or shift work

58
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,190
that needs to occur in order
for the service provider

59
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,140
to be able to offer
that to their customers.

60
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,609
So, as we mentioned,
one of the key benefits

61
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,610
of providing work-life balance
initiatives in an organization

62
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,020
is really the
improved productivity.

63
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,270
And from improved
productivity really

64
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,810
comes a sense of
commitment and loyalty

65
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,240
from that employee
to the organization.

66
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,180
And that can really amount
to a dollar benefit.

67
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,000
So if you think
about it in this way,

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,100
if I'm more loyal and
committed to my organization

69
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,980
because they understand that I
have a life outside of my work,

70
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,649
and I have other
pressures that I need

71
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:32,100
to deal with on a daily basis,
and they offer me and encourage

72
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,430
me to really take on that
balance between work and life,

73
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,300
I'm more likely to
stay in that job,

74
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,019
and I'm less likely to
look for work elsewhere.

75
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:44,560
So you'll find that there's an
increased level of commitment,

76
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,480
which therefore means
there's a decreased

77
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,530
level of staff turnover.

78
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:54,020
Staff turnover does have a
bottom line impact on costs.

79
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,710
Each time a new staff
member is recruited,

80
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,050
there's obviously a
significant amount

81
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,380
of cost involved in that.

82
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,460
And it may vary
depending on the role,

83
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,980
but there are certainly costs
in every process and every time

84
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,510
we need to recruit
a new staff member.

85
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,679
So now we are going to
look at some examples

86
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,540
of Australian organizations
that have really challenged

87
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,029
the way that we think
about work-life balance.

88
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,540
One such example
is the ANZ bank.

89
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,180
They've actually
created an initiative

90
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,385
that's targeted towards
their employees that

91
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:27,460
are over 55 years of age.

92
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,060
So if you're over
55 years, you're

93
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,540
essentially guaranteed
part-time work, which was great,

94
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,740
because it really allowed that
aging part of the workforce

95
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,840
to still continue to
work, but in a way that

96
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,619
still met the needs of
their personal life.

97
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,590
Many people over 55 are
really phasing out employment

98
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,590
and are really
looking to retire.

99
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,650
So it's really benefited
both the organization

100
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,859
and the employees.

101
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,605
Another example is an Australian
law firm, Blake Dawson.

102
00:04:58,605 --> 00:05:02,250
Now, the legal
profession is very

103
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,470
well-known for its lack
of work-life balance.

104
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,910
And this particular
law firm recognized

105
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,700
that really females or
their female lawyers

106
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,260
had the greatest challenges.

107
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,950
And they found that when they
got their graduate lawyers,

108
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,270
there were about 60% that were
female and, as time progressed,

109
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,219
that reduced down to 50%.

110
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,530
And it was even less
at a partner level,

111
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,049
sort of a more senior level.

112
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,770
And they implemented a
whole range of initiatives

113
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,310
to try and attract that
market and keep that talent.

114
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,980
And essentially that talent
may have looked elsewhere

115
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,280
and may have gone to another
law firm just looking

116
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,489
for that flexibility
and that ability

117
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,140
to manage both the work
pressures and the life

118
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:45,990
pressures.

119
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,440
And in the next topic, we'll
be looking at flexible working

120
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,360
arrangements, which is really
the key example of the tool we

121
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,900
can use to deliver
work-life balance.

122
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,885
