00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,220
Hi, and welcome to module
two about recruitment

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,570
in the digital age.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,530
So in our last module,
we looked at some

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,470
of the changes that have
occurred throughout history

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,299
that has impact on HR.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,590
So in this module,
we take one of those

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,120
and we really look at the
process from start to finish.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,850
In this topic, we'll get a
brief overview of each step

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,960
in the process,
from when we first

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,060
discover there's a need to
recruit an employee, all

12
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,710
the way through
interviewing, screening,

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,960
and all the way until we get
into actually making them

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,840
an offer and them
commencing work with us.

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,690
Sometimes when we think
about recruitment,

16
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,660
we think it's as simple
as, we have a vacancy,

17
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,419
let's put some advertising
on a job seeker website,

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,240
let's have a look at some
of the resumes that come in.

19
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,890
Yep, there's a couple that look
good, come in for an interview,

20
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,880
have a couple of interviews,
yep, they seem nice.

21
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,330
I quite like him.

22
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,950
Their skills and
qualifications seem

23
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,840
to match what we're looking for.

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,400
Here's a job offer.

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,430
And in some cases, it may
work as smoothly and as simply

26
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,150
as that.

27
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,860
But most of the time, it's
really not that simple.

28
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,240
And recruitment is
quite a complex process.

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,280
And there really are so many
different stages in between.

30
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,150
And with each one
of these stages,

31
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,780
we improve our chance of
finding the right person

32
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,670
for the right job.

33
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,810
Let's start off by having
a look at the definition

34
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,250
of recruitment.

35
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,250
Recruitment is often defined
as the procedures which really

36
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,520
begin with the
pre-employment screening

37
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,660
of a potential employee
and usually finish

38
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,630
when a new employee
actually commences work

39
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,390
with an organization.

40
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,240
And we often think,
well, what are

41
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,270
some of the tasks that are
involved in that recruitment

42
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,160
process?

43
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,149
And in some cases, it
starts off with things

44
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,270
like a job analysis.

45
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,259
So we'll look at
that particular role,

46
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,550
and we'll look at
the needs of the role

47
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,490
and how we can better understand
who the right candidate is

48
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,190
to fill that particular role.

49
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:11,880
And it may also look at, well,
how many people do we need?

50
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,120
Do we need them in a
full time or part time

51
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,040
capacity, and all these sort
of details that will really

52
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,120
give us a good idea when
we see the right candidate

53
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,080
that they are in fact,
the right candidate

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,070
for that particular job.

55
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,799
It's a well known
fact that recruitment

56
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,170
can be a very costly
task in itself.

57
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,420
Recruitment costs, really
depending on the type of role

58
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,489
and the type of
organization, can really

59
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,110
become a significant
part of any budget.

60
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,630
And so when we consider how
expensive the recruitment

61
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,280
process can be, it is
definitely worthwhile

62
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,410
considering some
alternatives to recruitment.

63
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,840
If we have a look here,
in some cases, the job

64
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,260
itself can be redesigned.

65
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,179
And in that way, we may
almost eliminate the need

66
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,910
to recruit externally.

67
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,230
And that is a valid
alternative to recruitment.

68
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,890
And in some cases,
changes in technology

69
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,829
can really improve the
way that a job is done

70
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,070
or the efficiency of how
the job is undertaken

71
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,320
and therefore also
become a good alternative

72
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,829
to recruiting another employee.

73
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,820
In some cases as
well, it's really

74
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,500
having a look at who our
existing employees are.

75
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,210
And can we upskill
them or can we

76
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,700
train them to be able
to do multiple tasks

77
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,720
or variations of multiple
tasks, and in that way, again,

78
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,150
eliminate the need to
recruit externally?

79
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,270
So often, why we need
to consider recruitment

80
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,760
is because either there's
movement internally

81
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,739
within the organization--
so it's changes

82
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,560
in the structure and the
changes in the departments

83
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,610
or so on-- but it's
also just a gap.

84
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,510
It's filling a vacancy
because someone

85
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,799
has left for whatever reason.

86
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,790
And so when we start
looking at, well,

87
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,760
where does HR's role fit exactly
in the recruitment process,

88
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,090
some of you may think,
well, isn't that HR's job?

89
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,250
It's their job to
recruit people.

90
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,530
But you'll find in many large
organizations they've really

91
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,660
taken an approach
where HR are almost

92
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,440
consultants to line
managers, that they're there

93
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,470
to support them and
give them a framework,

94
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,220
give them check lists,
give them support documents

95
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,779
and so on to enable the line
manager to actually undertake

96
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,990
the recruitment process
for people in their team.

97
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,830
And in many cases,
you might ask, well,

98
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,409
why would we get
the line manager

99
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,240
to recruit for their team?

100
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,190
When you think about
it, they may often

101
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,219
have been in that
particular role

102
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,730
that they're recruiting
for beforehand.

103
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,700
That may be where
they've come from.

104
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,349
They'll have a better
understanding of the skills,

105
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,960
especially if it's a specialized
area, the skills and knowledge

106
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,030
required to undertake that job.

107
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,520
They'll also know who
the rest of the team

108
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,039
and whether this potential
job candidate will

109
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,080
fit in with the
rest of the team.

110
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,930
So they often are a good judge
of a potential candidate.

111
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,840
But they in many
cases, don't actually

112
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,429
have the skills to
effectively recruit completely

113
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,190
on their own.

114
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,230
And in that case,
that's why HR is really

115
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:14,090
the guide or supporting
mechanism for line managers,

116
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,770
enabling them to undertake the
recruitment process in the most

117
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,780
effective way and be
able to get the best

118
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,679
candidate for their team.

119
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,020
So in the next topic,
we'll be looking

120
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,109
at some strategies
or some ways that we

121
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,830
can attract the right
candidate to us.

122
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,380
We'll see you then.

123
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,510
