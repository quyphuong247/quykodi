00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:09,500
Hi.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,930
Welcome to topic
six on interviewing.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,040
Interviewing is
really a critical step

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,850
in the recruitment process.

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,660
And we find that it's really
one of the most popular tools

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,870
to help organizations
select the right candidate.

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,920
We find although it's the
most popular one, it's often

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,870
the one that has the
most room for error,

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,030
because we're really trying
to rely on error in judgement

11
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,540
as interviewers and really
assess whether this person is

12
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,500
right for the job, or not.

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,060
Interviewing can be
a really great tool,

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,110
being able to pick up some
things that you really

15
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,850
can't pick up on a resume.

16
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,360
Remember, as we mentioned
in a previous topic, often

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,470
30% of resumes have some
misrepresentations in them.

18
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,660
So interviewing is
really a critical task

19
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,699
in being able to assess, I guess
the validity or the true nature

20
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,410
of that particular
job candidate.

21
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:03,180
We want to make sure they really
are what they say they are

22
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,570
and they really do have
the skills that they

23
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,139
claim to possess.

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,080
And often, we try and
judge other factors

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,960
that you can't discover
in a written document,

26
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,020
so things like
their communication

27
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,600
skills, their
interpersonal skills.

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,039
And we often look at
things like personality.

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,900
It's quite important to know
that this person, once they

30
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,000
come into this role,
will really have

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,420
a fit with the rest of the team.

32
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,530
And that is definitely
an important factor.

33
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,840
Now, let's look at what the
key purpose of an interview is.

34
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,260
And there really
are essentially two.

35
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,650
One is, we're trying
to get information

36
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:39,970
about the job candidate.

37
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,070
So we want to gather
information about their skills,

38
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,820
their experience, what they've
done in the past, and so on.

39
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,860
So in one aspect,
there is an exchange

40
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,390
of information towards
the organization.

41
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,530
But there's also an
exchange of information

42
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,790
towards the candidate.

43
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,750
And that's why we also
want to provide candidates

44
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,450
with information about the job.

45
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,090
We need to equip them with
the correct information

46
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,210
and the correct knowledge
about what exactly this job is.

47
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,448
There's nothing worse than
being interviewed for a job,

48
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,440
taking the job,
and then realizing

49
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,090
it's completely different
to what you expected

50
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,540
and it's completely different
to how it was described

51
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,370
to you in the job interview.

52
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,130
That's quite a disappointing,
I guess, point.

53
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,087
But more importantly, it
really is a matter of cost.

54
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:26,920
In that instance, you're
more likely to have

55
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,716
that person leave that role.

56
00:02:28,717 --> 00:02:30,800
And you have to start from
scratch the recruitment

57
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,490
process all over again.

58
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,380
Really try and avoid
that as much as possible.

59
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,120
So as I mentioned a little
earlier, although interviews

60
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,330
are the most widely utilized
tool in the recruitment

61
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,930
process, they're often
the most faulty tools,

62
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,810
in that we're really relying
on the interviewer's skill

63
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,360
to be able to get the
information that we need.

64
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,280
And so we'll be just looking at
a couple of the critical issues

65
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,800
that tend to go wrong
with interviews.

66
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,270
For example, we
really look at things

67
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:03,020
like a faulty processing
of interview data.

68
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,466
And what we mean
by that is the data

69
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:07,340
the information to the
candidate is giving us

70
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,700
as an organization.

71
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,269
And it may not be accurate
or may not be correct.

72
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,330
And it's also
about our judgement

73
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:18,650
as the interviewer in being
able to say, this person seems

74
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,560
to have the skills
for the job, no, they

75
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,810
don't seem to have the skills.

76
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,570
And it's really relying
on our own judgement.

77
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,109
We also have the
problem in terms

78
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:33,040
of how we phrase questions
or how we deliver questions

79
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,160
to the candidate.

80
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,530
And many times, poorly written
questions or poorly developed

81
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,210
interview questions can
really do not favors

82
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,420
for the candidate and no
favors for the organization,

83
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,545
because you're not really
gathering the information

84
00:03:45,545 --> 00:03:48,380
that you're looking
for in an interview.

85
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,810
And thirdly, we look at poorly
developed interviewing skills.

86
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,590
And this is very, very common.

87
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,150
In many cases, you'll have
someone interviewing you

88
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,460
if you're a job seeker.

89
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,500
And you can really see that
they haven't done this before

90
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,260
or they've had very little
experience doing it just simply

91
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,230
by the type of questions that
they're asking you or the fact

92
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,320
that they seem very
poorly organized

93
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,239
or they're not really
quite clear on what

94
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,050
it is that they want from you.

95
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,500
So as great as
interviews are as a tool

96
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,019
to gather all this interpersonal
information and data

97
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,250
that you can't really
capture in a resume,

98
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,980
they really do
have a lot of scope

99
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,350
for error, because they're
relying on our judgement.

100
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,310
Now, I want to have a look
at a particular technique

101
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,650
that you can use in interviews
that really increases

102
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,054
the chance of getting
the right information out

103
00:04:36,055 --> 00:04:37,300
of that job candidate.

104
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,830
And that's using behavioral
style interviewing questions.

105
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,260
And what that
really means is, we

106
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,870
phrase the questions
in a way where

107
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,690
we're allowing the candidate
to really describe situations

108
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,660
where they can demonstrate
particular skills that we think

109
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,230
are relevant to this job.

110
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,500
So for example, questions
will often start with,

111
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,220
&quot;describe a situation
where you xyz.&quot;

112
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,700
And then it just
continues to lead on.

113
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,405
So the candidate may describe
this particular project

114
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,549
they were managing
and what they need.

115
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,860
And the next step would
be, so how did you

116
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,350
manage that challenge?

117
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,280
How did you fix that problem?

118
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,969
What were the outcomes
from your problem

119
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,460
or from your solutions
to that problem?

120
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,729
And so you're really getting,
I guess, more so an insight

121
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,030
into their level of skill
and the way that they think,

122
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,270
possibly the way that
they solve problems.

123
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,229
And this is really
a critical tool

124
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,290
that can help you get the
most accurate information out

125
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,096
of that job candidate.

126
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:35,720
And in the next topic,
we'll be looking

127
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,260
at how we process
our job applications.

128
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,690
So once we've gathered all
this data from interviews,

129
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,174
from resumes, from screening,
we then look at, well,

130
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:45,090
what do we do with it?

131
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,750
And how do we best try and
look at this information

132
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,200
to make the correct selection
choice for this person?

133
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,315
