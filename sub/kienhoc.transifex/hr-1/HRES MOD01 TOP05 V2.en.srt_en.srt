00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,120
Hi, and welcome to Topic
5 on Workplace Stress.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,410
Now we've all looked
like this at some point.

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,560
We've all felt a little bit
stressed out and thought,

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,380
I can't take anymore at work.

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,919
So in this topic we'll
look at just what are some

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,690
of those signs are that
indicate that there is stress.

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,880
And they're not just
personal signs as in I feel

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,759
stressed and I'm
anxious or whatever,

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,400
but we also look
at outward signs

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,660
that other people
can see in you that

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,209
indicate a level of stress.

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,990
We'll also look at signs that
the organization as a whole

14
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,130
is suffering from
some kind of stressor.

15
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,510
And we'll look at some
strategies and ways

16
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,420
that we can try and minimize
the impact of stress

17
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,340
on our workplace.

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,690
One recent survey
actually showed

19
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,760
that healthy staff
were three times more

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,920
productive than unhealthy staff.

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,870
So that's quite a
significant number.

22
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,170
So we can see already a
really strong correlation

23
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,290
between stress and productivity.

24
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,020
So we really do want
to try and minimize

25
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,839
it and minimize that impact.

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,160
In fact, the same
study also showed

27
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,780
that unhealthy staff took
nine times more sick leave

28
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,420
than healthy staff, So there
are direct costs associated

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,080
with trying to really
minimize that risk of stress

30
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,380
in the workplace, because there
will be a cost eventually.

31
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,910
So what is stress?

32
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,649
Essentially and really
simply, it's a recognition

33
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,960
that we're unable to
cope with work demands.

34
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,080
And it really can be
as simple as that.

35
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,840
And there's a whole
variety of causes

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,231
that would make
us feel this way,

37
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:48,729
and there's a whole
variety of signs

38
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:53,040
that help us to see that we may
potentially be under stress.

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,650
So some of the
sources of stress--

40
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,080
and there are many
more, but these

41
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,429
are some of the key ones--
is really around either

42
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,580
an excessive amount of work or
an insufficient amount of work.

43
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:08,449
So not having enough to do can
also be a big source of stress.

44
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:11,340
We've also got
long working hours.

45
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,840
So look, we've all
done that at some point

46
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,540
and worked those extra hours.

47
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,320
And in short periods of time
and for temporary projects

48
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,970
or whatever, it's fine.

49
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,859
But if that's a
long-term pattern,

50
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,340
that can really be an issue.

51
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,840
We also have lack of support
from managers or coworkers.

52
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,840
No one really ever feels
like they're at work

53
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,150
and they're just doing
it alone, and the burden

54
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,780
of most of the responsibility
of the workload

55
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,090
is really just on them.

56
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,260
So that's a big cause
of stress as well.

57
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,109
We've also got
bullying and violence

58
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,810
in the workplace, or
even victimization.

59
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,740
And we'll look at bullying in
more detail in the next topic,

60
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:55,570
but that really can be really
a very traumatic experience

61
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,500
for many people.

62
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,140
And when we talk
about that, it's

63
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,390
really a whole other
level of stress

64
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,730
that it can cause
in the workplace.

65
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,769
So there are several
signs that would

66
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,650
indicate that someone
is under stress.

67
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,250
So if we look at some
of these personal signs,

68
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,540
so these are things
that you would feel,

69
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,880
we can think of
some obvious ones

70
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,560
like feelings of
anxiety, sleeplessness.

71
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,980
For many people it's
an increased dependency

72
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,209
on alcohol or on cigarettes.

73
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,180
They're really things
that are quite common,

74
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,100
and I'm sure most of
us would recognize

75
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,019
those personal signs of stress.

76
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,770
Then we can also consider
outward signs of stress.

77
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,240
So these are ones that
other people can see in us.

78
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,150
And that would be
a deterioration

79
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,940
in a working relationship
with a colleague or a manager.

80
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,650
Absenteeism is really
such a critical sign

81
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,740
that stress may be
present in the workplace.

82
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,320
And that's one
that quite often is

83
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,880
easy to pick up because the
person's just not there.

84
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,070
And then we also have
organizational signs of stress.

85
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,810
This is really more so an
indication that something

86
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,950
is not quite right
in the organization

87
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,980
and it's affecting a
large number of employees.

88
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,320
That's why these signs are
present across the board.

89
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,920
Again, absenteeism is
really a very critical sign

90
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,430
that something is
not quite right

91
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,930
and there may be higher levels
of stress in the organization.

92
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,005
You also have obvious indicators
like high staff turnover.

93
00:04:28,005 --> 00:04:30,260
If we're stressed in
a workplace and it's

94
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,310
consistent and for a
long period of time,

95
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,380
we're very unlikely to
stay in that workplace

96
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,110
and we're more likely to
move on somewhere else.

97
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,420
So as we can see,
there are really

98
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,030
a lot of factors that
can help us recognize

99
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,429
when stress exists
in a workplace.

100
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,630
In Australia it's
been recognized

101
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:51,550
that stress is actually a
valid ground for a worker's

102
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,510
compensation claim.

103
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,120
So we see stress
almost as you would

104
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,790
see an injury in a
workplace, so if you

105
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:05,770
fall over a faulty staircase
or whatever and the injury

106
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,990
and the compensation claim
that would come from that,

107
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,340
it's much the same for stress.

108
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,500
It's well recognized
in Australia to be,

109
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,250
in fact, the responsibility
of the employer

110
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,580
to ensure that their environment
or their working environment

111
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,550
is free from excessive
causes of stress.

112
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,260
Now what do we do when we
have stress in the workplace?

113
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,940
It's really simple.

114
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,490
It's a two-phased approach.

115
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,450
So Phase 1, we need really
to analyze and assess

116
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,659
what the current
situation is and then

117
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,160
develop some kind of
stress management strategy

118
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,440
to tackle that.

119
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,990
And that may be
really as simple as,

120
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,740
in the initial stages, really
sitting down and finding out

121
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,320
well, what are the causes of
stress in our organization.

122
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,659
Is it because there's
insufficient support

123
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,850
for managers?

124
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,140
Are the workloads just simply
too high and we actually

125
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,900
need to recruit more staff?

126
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,090
So it can be a whole
variety of reasons.

127
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,840
So we can't really
tackle those reasons

128
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,299
unless we find
out what they are.

129
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,800
So once we've identified
what the causes are--

130
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,200
and that may be through
something like a stress

131
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,469
assessment in the
workplace, so formally

132
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,020
going through and assessing
all those risk factors.

133
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,680
And then once we've
got to that point,

134
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,720
we want to develop a coherent
and a solid stress management

135
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,790
policy and a procedure for
how we would report issues

136
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,580
if we were feeling we're
suffering from stress

137
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,830
or we're feeling that someone
else in the organization

138
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,219
was suffering from stress.

139
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,360
And that's really our Phase 1.

140
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,400
Then we have Phase
2, which is really

141
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,120
about implementing our
policy and procedure.

142
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,000
And that will often mean we
need to train staff and ensure

143
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,290
they understand it.

144
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,110
And it will also mean
we need to monitor

145
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,470
the effectiveness of our
policy and procedure,

146
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:50,230
and that may be through
something like auditing

147
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,930
on a yearly basis, for example.

148
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,280
So in our next topic we'll take
that step further and really

149
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,739
look at bullying,
which is really

150
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,970
a critical cause of
stress in many workplaces.

151
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,600
