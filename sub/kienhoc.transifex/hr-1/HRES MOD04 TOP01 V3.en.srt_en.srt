00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,079
Hi, Welcome to topic
one of module four

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,870
on performance management.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,956
So if you remember, in module
two, we looked at recruitment.

5
00:00:15,957 --> 00:00:17,790
And we looked at
recruiting the right person

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,202
in your organization.

7
00:00:19,202 --> 00:00:20,660
And then in module
three, we looked

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,870
at how we train and
develop these employees.

9
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,440
Now, in this
module, we're really

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,550
looking at that
next step, which is

11
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,290
managing the way
that they perform.

12
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,330
If each individual performs
in an organization,

13
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,559
the performance of the
organization as a whole

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,740
is also improved.

15
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,610
So we really need to
take that final step,

16
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,610
and that's what we'll be
looking at in this module.

17
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,746
So if you've ever been part of
a performance appraisal process,

18
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:45,120
this is a really
good module that

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,699
helps give you an
overview of how

20
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,000
that whole structural
performance appraisal

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,480
system should work.

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,569
We'll also look at
some emerging issues,

23
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,180
such as the impact of
Generation X and Y on the way

24
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,769
that we manage those
particular generations.

25
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,670
And we'll also look at
social media and some

26
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,030
of the implications
that that's created

27
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,030
in managing performance,
because it's

28
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,040
created a whole another
level of problems

29
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,780
that we didn't have in the past
before social media emerged.

30
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,240
So in this topic, we'll
be briefly looking

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,660
at some of the benefits of
performance management systems,

32
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,110
and we'll also be looking at
some of the common pitfalls

33
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,410
that organizations
encounter whilst trying

34
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,908
to manage the performance
of their employees.

35
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:26,950
And at the end of the day,
performance management

36
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,890
is just really about
trying to monitor

37
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,000
the performance of
employees and then

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,160
be able to find any gaps
or areas for improvement

39
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,170
and develop some kind of
program to help improve

40
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,130
the productivity
of that employee.

41
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,729
At the end of the day, it's
each individual's performance

42
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,340
that has an impact
on the performance

43
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,620
of the organization as a whole.

44
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,970
So we're trying to make
those individual changes

45
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,270
in performance so that
ultimately the organization is

46
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,830
as successful as it can be.

47
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,950
And it's really only a
matter of the employees

48
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,840
within that organization.

49
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,450
So let's have a look at some
of the benefits of managing

50
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,330
performance, particularly in
a structured way, like using

51
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,020
performance appraisal systems.

52
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,600
Essentially it makes the
organization more competitive,

53
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,170
because you have
employees really running

54
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,559
at their optimum levels, at
the best levels possible.

55
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,380
So performance is
always enhanced.

56
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,840
And that's a competitive
factor in a very competitive

57
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,450
environment.

58
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,149
It also creates a more
harmonious working environment,

59
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,860
because if the individual
objectives of each employee

60
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,710
are aligned to the objectives
of the organization as a whole,

61
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,380
we're more likely to have that
harmonious smooth movement

62
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,740
with the organization
and the employee

63
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,610
moving in the same direction.

64
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,910
It also is a really
important tool

65
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,910
in trying to determine an
accurate reflection of what

66
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,430
someone's salary or
benefits package should be.

67
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,020
And often the performance
appraisal process

68
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,520
will have some impact on
the salary or an increase

69
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,330
in salary for that
particular employee.

70
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,790
So let's have a look at
some of the common pitfalls

71
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,070
or common problems that
organizations encounter.

72
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,750
Sometimes when we're going
through performance management

73
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,090
processes, people
involved are quite scared

74
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,910
that if they have
to give feedback,

75
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,680
that all of a sudden, all
these negative outcomes

76
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,092
and these negative emotions
will just be unleashed.

77
00:03:19,092 --> 00:03:20,800
And there's always a
common fear of that.

78
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,820
And it's really about
ensuring that you

79
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,989
have a very structured
process for managing people's

80
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:29,070
performance, and you're less
likely to have this problem.

81
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,299
Sometimes it's not as
successful as it can be,

82
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,110
because there isn't
enough contact

83
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,750
between a manager
and their employees.

84
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,560
That contact needs to be regular
and throughout the working

85
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,550
relationship.

86
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,550
So we can't just have
a manager sitting here

87
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,020
and the employee sitting there.

88
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,566
And once a year,
they communicate

89
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:46,940
about the employee's
performance.

90
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,090
It needs to be ongoing.

91
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,970
People providing feedback
in performance appraisals

92
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,560
haven't been adequately trained.

93
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,810
So in many cases,
the feedback provided

94
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,720
is really of a poor
quality and doesn't

95
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,720
provide a constructive
criticism that employee

96
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,730
can take away and improve
their performance.

97
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,780
There's also this sense
sometimes with the appraisers

98
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,800
that they can't defend
why they've given someone

99
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,150
a particular rating in
a performance appraisal.

100
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,650
If it was a poor rating, they
feel difficult to justify it.

101
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,170
So they often write everyone
somewhere down the middle,

102
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,329
which really doesn't
give us any accurate

103
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,300
information on,
really, the performance

104
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,520
of that particular employee.

105
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,620
It's really just a middle line.

106
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,680
There are a whole
variety of other issues,

107
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,950
but the most important thing
with managing performance

108
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,630
is really to take a human
approach to always really

109
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,840
consider what are
the positives first.

110
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,869
That's always the best step and
the best way to give feedback.

111
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,990
Focus on the positives, and
then move in a constructive way

112
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,280
on what could be
improved in the future.

113
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,190
And that's often the best way
to encourage people to perform.

114
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,800
So in our next topic,
we'll be looking

115
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,470
at what some of the
goals are that we

116
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,272
need to develop in the
performance management process.

117
00:04:57,272 --> 00:04:58,730
This is a great
opportunity for you

118
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,320
to go into the discussion forum
and maybe identify or give

119
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,270
some explanation of what you
think performance management is

120
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,330
at this stage.

121
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,830
And then we'll go
back and revise it

122
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,080
at the end of the
module and see what's

123
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,729
changed in your perspective
or your understanding of what

124
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,860
performance management
actually is.

125
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,610
And in our next topic,
we'll be looking

126
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,340
at goals and performance
management, how we develop them

127
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,109
and why they're so important
in those initial stages

128
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,680
of the performance
management process.

129
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,843
