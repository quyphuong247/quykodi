Hi.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,500
Welcome to topic 10, our
last topic of this module.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,910
In this topic, we'll be looking
at how we evaluate training

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,980
and development in
an organization.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,050
And we've been through
the training process,

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,600
and we've looked
at the beginnings

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,600
where we're trying to
identify performance gaps

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,010
and really plan how
we do the training.

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,110
And we looked at different
forms of training,

11
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,009
and, in particular,
online training,

12
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,060
and this is really the
end of that process.

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,775
And the evaluation of
any training program

14
00:00:37,775 --> 00:00:40,560
or any training
initiative is so critical,

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,870
but it seems to be one of those
areas that's often neglected

16
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,440
because it's just so hard to
draw the link between training

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,339
and what the outcomes
of that training are,

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,270
and to really be
able to prove, yes,

19
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,650
it's because of this training
that these employees are now

20
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,790
more productive or
better at their job

21
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,339
or whatever the outcome
was of the training.

22
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,020
And that's such a
difficult thing to do.

23
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,670
We started off here at
identifying our training needs,

24
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,700
and now we're really
here at evaluation.

25
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,520
And yes, it is
hard, but it's not

26
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,369
impossible to evaluate
and show the benefit

27
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,025
or show the outcomes
from a training program.

28
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:20,400
And often we're really looking
at a few different things.

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,400
We're looking at the
learning outcomes

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,830
both of the training
initiative, and then we're

31
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,072
trying to assess whether
they've been achieved or met.

32
00:01:28,072 --> 00:01:30,030
We'd also be looking at
the individual reaction

33
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,500
of learners, and often this is
done by post-training surveys

34
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,900
and getting feedback
from the learners

35
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,424
on what aspects of
the training went well

36
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:40,840
and what didn't
and what they felt

37
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,990
they achieved from the training.

38
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,850
And then it starts
looking at, well,

39
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,039
can we see any change or
improvement in job performance,

40
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,340
and any direct links between
the training and the way

41
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,140
that these people are
doing their job now.

42
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,050
And then we look more broadly
at the organization's reaction

43
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,200
to the training.

44
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,260
And we'll talk about
this in a moment,

45
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:03,332
and often there's not always a
positive reaction to training.

46
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,039
As much as we like to
think that training

47
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,252
is a positive and a good
thing, in some cases,

48
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,460
it becomes a political issue.

49
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,410
And we'll get to
that in a moment,

50
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,510
but, really, the
evaluation can often then

51
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,700
lead into-- as we mentioned in
the beginning of this module--

52
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,010
it can often lead back into
the training needs assessment.

53
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,140
And it's through
that we identify

54
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,980
the continuous
improvement process,

55
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,380
and we're able to find out what
worked and what didn't work,

56
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,230
and that gives us a
better chance of being

57
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,609
able to push through
training in the future.

58
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,880
Often, evaluation will also mean
that we can justify a training

59
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,950
budget, and we can try
and push for that training

60
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,070
budget in the next
financial year.

61
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,829
Without the evaluation, it's
really difficult in many cases

62
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,470
to try and establish
the value of training.

63
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,770
And, at the moment, it's
still not where it should be.

64
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,070
Organizations are
definitely increasing

65
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,920
in the amount of
time that they're

66
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,399
spending on evaluations.

67
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,240
So a recent survey showed
that over a five-year period,

68
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,940
only 16% of organizations
were conducting evaluations

69
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,160
of training, which
that pushed up to 29%

70
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,670
at the end of that
five-year period, which

71
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,450
is an improvement.

72
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,075
So it looks like
we're moving that way,

73
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:16,030
but as it currently
stands, it's only 57%

74
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,140
of organizations actually
undertake a formal evaluation

75
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,970
process of their training,
which is still really not

76
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,950
enough to get the full
value of training.

77
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,980
So as I mentioned
just a moment ago,

78
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,209
there are some political
issues that can really

79
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,880
impact how we evaluate training,
and whether that evaluation

80
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,820
actually provides the benefits
that we're looking for.

81
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,930
And, unfortunately,
in every organization,

82
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,350
they'll always be political
issues and political pressures.

83
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,350
And when we mean politics
in an organization,

84
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,650
we mean factors that affect
decisions and judgments that

85
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,265
are not really related
to the job or the project

86
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:52,529
or the outcome.

87
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,340
There's a whole
variety of them, and

88
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,250
with these political
pressures there

89
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,030
may be ways where the evaluation
process is questioned.

90
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,370
So for example, sometimes
the evaluation data that's

91
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,400
gathered from a
training program,

92
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,370
depending on who's
gathered that data,

93
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,990
it can be easily manipulated
to say, oh, well look,

94
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,060
the data shows that the
training was unsuccessful

95
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,190
because we couldn't see any
improvement in job performance

96
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,550
or whatever.

97
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,820
So it can be
manipulated at times,

98
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,870
and often that's due to some
kind of political reason

99
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,390
behind why someone doesn't
want this particular initiative

100
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,610
to go ahead or someone does
want a particular initiative

101
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,470
to go ahead.

102
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,680
And that can really
be a challenge

103
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,340
in trying to get
accurate information

104
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,299
about the effectiveness
of training.

105
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,550
Also, sometimes the
initial goals set

106
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,860
were politically charged.

107
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,980
So the goal of the training was
to meet some kind of outcome

108
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,950
that really had a political--
had some irrelevant political

109
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,490
reason rather than a reason
that was directly related

110
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,470
to improving productivity
in an organization.

111
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,000
Sometimes the
quantitative results,

112
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,140
or the results in
terms of numbers,

113
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,652
cannot give us an accurate
reflection of what really were

114
00:05:01,652 --> 00:05:04,110
the benefits of that training
so we have to be careful with

115
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,480
those as well.

116
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,100
And then we look at-- I mean,
really the last two points

117
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,630
are, essentially, linked.

118
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,745
What was the motivation
behind conducting

119
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:14,010
the evaluation and
the purpose for it?

120
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:18,224
So was it to prove a point
that this particular trainer is

121
00:05:18,224 --> 00:05:20,640
a terrible trainer and they
shouldn't be training anymore,

122
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,460
that's why all the evaluation
data is very negative.

123
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,349
Or is it about
saying, yes, we want

124
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,690
to see whether this program
was actually effective.

125
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,800
So we really need to consider
these issues when setting up

126
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,890
an evaluation so we can
make sure it works right

127
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,190
from the onset.

128
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,560
So the key thing
to remember here

129
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,490
is if you don't measure
it, you can't manage it.

130
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,250
So the key point
is we really need

131
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,010
to ensure that we create
some kind of mechanism

132
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,969
to measure the effectiveness
of this training.

133
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,120
As challenging and
difficult as it is,

134
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,180
it really is a critical step.

135
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,910
So we've now reached
the end of module three.

136
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,509
We've been through the initial
stages of training and setting

137
00:05:57,509 --> 00:05:59,800
up a training needs analysis,
and we pushed all the way

138
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,380
through to evaluating and
looked at everything in between.

139
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,469
So now I'd like you to think
about the first discussion

140
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,620
question that I posed to
you in our first topic,

141
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,530
and what you thought
training and development was.

142
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,359
And now actually undertaking
some training yourself

143
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,420
in this module, I'd
like to see what's

144
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,250
changed in your
perception of what

145
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,680
training and
development is to you.

146
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,780
So in our next
module, module four,

147
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,510
we'll be looking at
managing performance

148
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,843
of employees in an organization.

149
00:06:26,843 --> 00:06:29,351
