00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,239
Hi, and welcome to HR
in the digital age.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,590
I really hope you enjoyed
coming through this subject

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,660
and looking at a very
traditional field of study

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,270
in the modern perspective.

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,120
HR has charged,
and our environment

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,170
has changed so rapidly.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,850
So I hope you do enjoy it.

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,250
I'm Christina
Dahdal, and I'll be

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,259
your presenter for this course.

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,250
I've worked in a variety of
roles in HR over the years,

12
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,340
ranging from training and
development, compliance,

13
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,690
to change management.

14
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,230
And I've thoroughly enjoyed it.

15
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,220
HR is so diverse, and
that's the beauty of it.

16
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,750
I started off as a lawyer.

17
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,810
So having a legal
background has definitely

18
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,090
supported the framework in
which I apply HR principles

19
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,360
in the organizations
that I've worked for.

20
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,470
I'm also a lecturer,
specializing in employment law.

21
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,480
I hope you enjoy this journey
through HR in the digital age.

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,769
In this subject,
we'll be looking at HR

23
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,510
from a modern perspective.

24
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,259
In an era of rapid change
and constant technological

25
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,990
advancements, we'll
be really looking

26
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,759
at how all this change affects
the way that we manage people,

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,230
in particular the way that
we recruit and select staff.

28
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,910
We'll also look at
learning and development

29
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,780
and how we develop our staff
into what we need them to be.

30
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,130
And we'll also be looking
at performance management--

31
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,250
so getting the most and
the best out of our staff.

32
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,130
In this module, we'll be
looking at a variety of areas.

33
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,539
In particular, we'll
have a brief overview

34
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,450
of the evolution
of HR and how it's

35
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,680
reached the stage that
it's at right now.

36
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,340
We'll also be looking
at some emerging issues,

37
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,590
like bullying in
the workplace, we'll

38
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,650
look at stress in the
workplace and the impact that

39
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,870
has on us and the organization.

40
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,880
We'll be looking at a really,
I guess, a very fundamental

41
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,350
initiator of change
in HR, which is IT.

42
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,780
So we'll be looking
at how IT has affected

43
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,910
the way that the HR function
works-- so in particular,

44
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:06,630
things like the development
of virtual work teams,

45
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,418
the impact of things
like social media, email,

46
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:14,470
and really how technology has
impacted the way that we manage

47
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,740
people in a good way
and in a bad way.

48
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,110
We'll also be
looking at, I guess,

49
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,900
some of things that
have changed over time

50
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,850
that affect the
way that we work.

51
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,260
So we'll be looking at
flexible working arrangements

52
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,079
and the impacts that they have
on the way that businesses

53
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,040
function and the way
that our perspective has

54
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,019
changed over time.

55
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,240
So now we'll also be
looking at, I guess,

56
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,440
how some of these
factors affect the way

57
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,190
that we function
in an organization.

58
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,660
And I'll be giving you a brief
introduction into the topic.

59
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,890
Let's have a look at the
three basic functions of HR.

60
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,480
And really, everything else
in this course in some way

61
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,989
relates to them.

62
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,560
So if we look at the first
one, we're really looking at,

63
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,300
how do we obtain suitable
people for the roles

64
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,400
in the organization?

65
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,770
Where do we get them from?

66
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,840
Internally?

67
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,940
Externally?

68
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,680
How do we develop people to
get them into these roles?

69
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,470
So that's really looking
at the recruitment function

70
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,540
in general.

71
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,792
We also go to
developing and learning.

72
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:17,250
What are some of
the things we need

73
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,770
to do to identify
skills gaps in our staff

74
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,920
to improve and
develop their skills

75
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,809
and therefore enable them to
more effectively do their job?

76
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,020
The third area is
looking at maintaining

77
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,210
effective performance.

78
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,760
So this is really all about
performance management.

79
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,820
How do we get the best
out of our people?

80
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,480
How do we make sure that they're
meeting all their expectations,

81
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,640
they're meeting their
employer's expectations,

82
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,559
and really progressing through
their job as they should,

83
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,340
and supporting them
in whatever way

84
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,630
that the organization can
to get the best outcome?

85
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,040
And this is often where
the organization is really

86
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,090
looking for productivity.

87
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,400
If you look at HR
personnel, generally they're

88
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,200
almost in a consultant
role to the line managers.

89
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,950
And that's really where
we're at right now

90
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,859
in the current HR environment.

91
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,950
We look at these HR personnel.

92
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,339
They have responsibilities
for developing policies,

93
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,130
procedures, they act as a
framework and a guide for line

94
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,940
managers and, in effect,
for everyone else

95
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,089
in being able to say, OK,
this is what we need to do,

96
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:25,420
and this is how we must
do it and the reasons why.

97
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,940
So you'll also see there
in that definition,

98
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,820
they are responsible for HR
initiatives and programs.

99
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,700
And that can be a
whole range of things.

100
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,010
Like was mentioned earlier,
that can include training,

101
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:42,750
development, staff improvement
programs, and so on.

102
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,000
The critical point here is
that an employee's performance

103
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,840
is really a joint effort, not
just with someone from HR,

104
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,479
but with their line manager.

105
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,140
We don't just go, hey, I have
a problem with my employee, HR.

106
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,724
Someone from HR will fix it.

107
00:04:58,725 --> 00:05:01,490
It really is, I guess,
the direction that we're

108
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,900
heading towards that
HR personnel are,

109
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,340
in effect, consultants
to the line managers,

110
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,179
supporting them and enabling
them to get the best out

111
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,540
of their team.

112
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,250
So in summary, the HR
practitioner's role

113
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,660
is really about providing
a framework and a structure

114
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,460
to enable other managers
and the rest of the team

115
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,349
to really get their job
done in the right way.

116
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,220
Now, I encourage you to
go and introduce yourself

117
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,540
in our discussion forum.

118
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,830
The discussion forum is a
great opportunity for you

119
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,990
to meet others in the course.

120
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,330
And let's face it.

121
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,330
You've all worked at some point,
at some stage you've worked.

122
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,520
So you'll find that so
many of your experiences

123
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,500
are valuable to others.

124
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,530
In some instances,
you may have gone

125
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,400
through some particular
problem in the workplace

126
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,799
that you worked for in the past.

127
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,330
And someone else may have
the solution for you.

128
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,070
Or your solution may
enable someone else

129
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,610
to find a solution
to their problem.

130
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,360
So please take the time
to introduce yourself

131
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,100
and to meet your
peers in the course

132
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,870
and really use this tools.

133
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,280
So now we've reached
the end of topic one.

134
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,270
We're moving on to
our second topic.

135
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,810
And in this topic,
we'll be looking

136
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,770
at really the evolution of
HR and how it's changed-- so

137
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,849
where we were and
where we're going.

138
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,713
