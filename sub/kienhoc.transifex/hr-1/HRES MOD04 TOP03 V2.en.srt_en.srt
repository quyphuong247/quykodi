00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,170
Hi.

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,800
Welcome to topic three.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,720
In this topic we'll be
taking a closer look

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,460
at performance appraisals.

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,510
Performance appraisals are
really the central component

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,470
of any performance
management system.

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,410
They're really the
foundation, and the best way

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,350
to monitor and evaluate
the performance of teams

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,570
or individuals.

11
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,490
And so we'll be
looking in more detail

12
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,459
at the process of a
performance appraisal.

13
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,740
And we'll be looking
at some of the issues

14
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,420
that you might
have along the way.

15
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,280
So the first step of the
performance appraisal process

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,804
is always establishing
performance standards.

17
00:00:40,804 --> 00:00:43,220
Because what we're really doing
in a performance appraisal

18
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,920
process is saying,
this is the standard

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,130
that this particular job
or this particular team

20
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,590
needs to perform to.

21
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,370
And then we're comparing it to
how they've actually performed.

22
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,989
So without correct, accurate,
achievable standards

23
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,780
right from the beginning
of the process,

24
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,970
it's really hard to
make a comparison.

25
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,379
And that's really what
performance appraisal is about.

26
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,450
You're making a judgement
on whether an individual,

27
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,780
or a team has actually
met that standard.

28
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,117
And then being able to go
well, what can we do next?

29
00:01:12,117 --> 00:01:13,575
Is this some place
for improvement,

30
00:01:13,575 --> 00:01:15,300
and how can we improve it?

31
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,399
So that-- setting
the correct standards

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,540
is so critical right
from the beginning.

33
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,970
Otherwise you're really not
comparing to anything of value.

34
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,640
So let's have a look at some
of the aspects of performance

35
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,890
standards that we need
to make sure we in-- that

36
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,840
we include when we're
thinking of what

37
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,770
we need to develop
in these standards.

38
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,479
And these are some
really simple ways

39
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,146
to ensure that the
standards are correct

40
00:01:35,146 --> 00:01:36,500
right from the beginning.

41
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,980
The standard needs
to actually have

42
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,530
some impact on the
success of that role.

43
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,730
Well let's just look at it
from an employee perspective.

44
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,610
It needs to have an impact on
the way that they do their job.

45
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,660
If it's just a standard
around being friendly,

46
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,869
you know, and this particular
role his data entry.

47
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,110
Is being friendly really
an important performance

48
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,610
factor for entering
data into a computer?

49
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,700
Probably not.

50
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,540
So we need to actually
have that relevance.

51
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,240
And it has to have an
impact on their success.

52
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,280
And they need to be clear
enough to differentiate

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,990
between good performance
and poor performance.

54
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,370
In the same way, if we
use the same example.

55
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,750
Is being friendly, when
all you do is enter data,

56
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,840
does that help us identify that
employee A is doing a better

57
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,510
job because they're
actually entering

58
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,230
twice as much data
than employee B?

59
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,470
It doesn't really give
us any information

60
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,340
on who's performing better.

61
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,960
It needs to be
something actually

62
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,420
in the control of the employee.

63
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,519
Obviously, things like
the whether are not really

64
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,970
in our control as employees.

65
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,820
And if you have a job,
for example that where

66
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,209
the weather has some impact
on how you do your job.

67
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:44,710
OK?

68
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,380
You teach golf, for example.

69
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,040
We can't really
include something

70
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,750
in a performance
standard that's really

71
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,440
outside of the control of
that individual employee.

72
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,820
And it can also need to
be based on observations.

73
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,100
So we need to observe what
it is that people actually

74
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,019
do in those roles.

75
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,370
And their work behaviors.

76
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,130
And that's a really
good starting point

77
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,060
for developing a standard
that's realistic and actually

78
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,600
achievable.

79
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,870
So we've talked about
performance standards

80
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,040
as the starting point in the
performance appraisal process.

81
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,329
Let's have a quick overview
of the process as a whole.

82
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,540
So we've already put some
performance standards together.

83
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,450
And often the next
step may be observing

84
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,839
the employee's behavior.

85
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,930
So observing some of
the tasks or activities

86
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,590
that they may do,
that you can observe,

87
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,570
that will show you or
give you some indication

88
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,140
of their performance.

89
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,170
Or their success at
doing those tasks.

90
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,690
We'll also need to look
at actual job performance.

91
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,170
And how do we assess
their job performance?

92
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,130
Again, one of the biggest
tools, or the primary tool,

93
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,750
is really an interview process.

94
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,540
So it's the performance
appraisal or performance review

95
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,504
interview where we actually
speak with the employee,

96
00:03:51,504 --> 00:03:53,170
and we gather that
information and we're

97
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,000
able to assess their performance
from the flow of communication

98
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,020
between the appraiser
and the employee.

99
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,940
We also need to provide a stage
where we're giving feedback

100
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,140
and we're collecting
feedback too.

101
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,760
Yes, we want to
tell the employee,

102
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,899
you've done a great
job on X, Y, Z,

103
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,400
because of this, this, and this.

104
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,501
Or whatever reasons
it was the factor.

105
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:16,500
And we also want to tell
them where they may not

106
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,730
have performed so well.

107
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,019
And maybe why they
haven't perform so well.

108
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,790
And let's look at
some reasons or ways

109
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,180
that we can try to
improve the performance.

110
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,820
But it's also an
opportunity for the employee

111
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,430
to give the appraiser
feedback too.

112
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,270
Often the employees hold
valuable information

113
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,630
to the organization.

114
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,460
And unless someone elicits
that information from them,

115
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,979
we can't really get improvements
or changes in the way

116
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,780
that we do things
in an organization.

117
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,469
An always, the last step is to
actually act on those results.

118
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,320
And this can be a range
of different things.

119
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,480
So it may be that this
person has performed so well,

120
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,280
we think that they should be
promoted to a more senior job.

121
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,080
Or a team leader
position, or whatever.

122
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,520
But in other cases, it may be
that they've underperformed

123
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,780
so severely that
acting on the results

124
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,887
is actually
terminating their job.

125
00:05:05,887 --> 00:05:08,220
And there could be a whole
variety of things in between.

126
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,530
Like we mentioned
earlier, often training

127
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,440
is an option for people who
may not be performing so well.

128
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,440
So it's about creating
actionable items

129
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,050
at the end of that process.

130
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,750
We've mentioned that
interviews are the primary way

131
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,870
to get this information in a
performance appraisal process.

132
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,460
Some really simple
techniques to ensure

133
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,500
you get the best out
of those interviews

134
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,430
is to always allow
adequate time.

135
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,787
If it's rushed, too
short, too long,

136
00:05:32,787 --> 00:05:34,620
you won't get the
information that you want.

137
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,960
Or you often get people
tired at the end of it,

138
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,330
and not really giving
accurate information.

139
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,510
You need to be
prepared in that you've

140
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,599
given be the employee
advanced warning.

141
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,240
And often that will
actually involve

142
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,600
them completing
a self-assessment

143
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,360
of their performance.

144
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,420
So it needs to be
planned out ahead.

145
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,240
And in terms of
being prepared, you

146
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,730
need to have had a look
at their self-appraisal,

147
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,920
and then thought
OK, why have they

148
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,670
given these particular
ratings to themselves.

149
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,110
And have some feedback that
you can give back to them.

150
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,920
You need to plan the interview.

151
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,800
And my advice, the easiest
way to plan that interview

152
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,490
is to follow the structure
of your performance appraisal

153
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,190
form.

154
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,010
If it flows in the same way, you
know you've covered everything.

155
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,718
You haven't missed
everything, and you've

156
00:06:18,718 --> 00:06:22,780
given the feedback in the
most accurate way possible.

157
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,630
You may also look
at work samples.

158
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,900
Again, this is
very role specific.

159
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,179
But it can be included in
the interview process also.

160
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,260
So in our next topic
we'll be continuing on

161
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,490
with performance appraisals.

162
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,950
And we'll be looking at
who some of the key players

163
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,760
are in the performance
appraisal process.

164
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,543
