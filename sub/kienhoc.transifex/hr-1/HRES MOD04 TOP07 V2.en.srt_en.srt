00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,380
Hi.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,920
Welcome to topic
seven where we're

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,210
looking at the emerging issue of
social media in organizations.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,120
Now, we know that there's been a
huge explosion of social media,

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,940
and we did discuss
it in module one.

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,180
And it's really created so many
challenges for HR officials

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,930
and organizations as a
whole because it's still

9
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,750
quite early days,
and we haven't really

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,840
established all the
legal implications

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,550
and all the ethical
implications of social media

12
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,699
use in organizations.

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,630
One primary example of one of
the challenges that it creates

14
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,770
is what we can
call cyberslacking.

15
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,060
So it's people
using social media

16
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,110
during work time--
Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn.

17
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,980
And you can also add in there
doing other online activities

18
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,989
as well, paying bills
and researching whatever

19
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,690
the next car they're
going to buy.

20
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,789
And that fact alone
costs organizations

21
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,080
billions of dollars
each year, especially

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,070
in lost productivity
because of that time

23
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,000
that's being spent on social
media sites and other sites

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,940
on the internet.

25
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,570
So it really is
a critical issue,

26
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,470
and many organizations
are still not

27
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,320
entirely sure on how to deal
with it so in this topic

28
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,690
we'll look at some of
the techniques or ways

29
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:30,710
that we can try and minimize the
negative impact of social media

30
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,750
on organizations
because there definitely

31
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,090
is a positive impact.

32
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,900
It is another way that
organizations can communicate

33
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,400
with their staff so we want to
maintain the positive aspects

34
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,600
and try and minimize
the negative aspects.

35
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,850
One of the biggest
myths with social media

36
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,509
use in organizations is
that many employees think,

37
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,370
if I'm using social media
outside of work hours then

38
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,350
there's no problem.

39
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,649
What's the problem?

40
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,560
And it can actually create
lots and lots of challenges

41
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,200
because when you make
statements on social media sites

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,200
that in any way are
linked to your employer,

43
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,590
they do have an impact
on the organization.

44
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,360
And we need to try
and minimize that,

45
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,878
and the best way is to
really communicating to staff

46
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:12,170
so that they're aware of what
they should and shouldn't

47
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,730
be placing on social
networking sites.

48
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,730
So there are really three
issues worth considering

49
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,420
when trying to determine whether
an out-of-work social media

50
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:25,559
activity is really incompatible
with an organization or not.

51
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,460
So we look and we may ask the
question, is that statement

52
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,460
or comment, can that
damage the relationship

53
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,240
I have with the employer,
with customers, suppliers,

54
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,690
with the public in general,
and, in some cases,

55
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,079
it's not that clean cut so
I'll give you an example.

56
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,930
In one employer
that I worked for,

57
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:49,300
a particular employee had
made a very negative comment

58
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,830
about a disabled
child on Facebook,

59
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,900
and other people had
obviously seen it

60
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,270
and they looked at this
employee's profile,

61
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,510
and they noticed the
name of our organization

62
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,630
there on his profile.

63
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:03,710
All it said was XYZ
worked for this company.

64
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:07,220
We actually got numbers of
phone calls to the organization,

65
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:12,060
and we had the media contacting
the organization because of how

66
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,890
negative those comments
were, and how, obviously, it

67
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,969
was quite traumatic for people
to hear those kind of words

68
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:20,760
being spoken about, or
being written about,

69
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,500
a disabled child.

70
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,240
That was a very simple example
of an out-of-work behavior that

71
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,220
really did have an impact
on the organization.

72
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,790
In some cases, you really
want to also ask the question,

73
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,980
does it damage the employer's
interests in any way.

74
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,820
Are you giving away
confidential information

75
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,851
that you shouldn't be.

76
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,600
And, again, I can give
you another example

77
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,739
from a former employee, who
had then moved on and worked

78
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,320
for one of the competitors
of my organization.

79
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,070
And I happen to be friends
with her on Facebook,

80
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:52,150
and she posted a
Facebook posting saying,

81
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,130
I had a killer day today.

82
00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:00,870
I made $500,000 worth of sales
with a $250,000 profit margin

83
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,850
as a Facebook post.

84
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,230
And I work for her competitor.

85
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,079
So obviously that
kind of information

86
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,770
will likely lead to
some kind of damage

87
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,630
to that employer's
interests, and you really

88
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,740
want to avoid that.

89
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,830
And in many cases--
she was a lovely girl,

90
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,820
and it was just really a lack
of knowledge or understanding

91
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,310
of what she should and
shouldn't be saying.

92
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,095
Often, it may be a
question of asking

93
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:25,440
of whether those kind of
comments or what you're saying

94
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,860
is incompatible with the
interests of the employer.

95
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,610
We want to make sure that
the employees are maintaining

96
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,080
their responsibilities
to the employer.

97
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,300
We may sometimes ask
ourselves in trying

98
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,760
to determine what's reasonable
social media behavior where

99
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,849
was the site accessed.

100
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,720
Was it accessed at home,
in the office, when?

101
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,210
We may also ask, are
other employees affected.

102
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,561
So this is the case
where an employer has

103
00:04:49,562 --> 00:04:51,020
made negative
comments on something

104
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,940
like Facebook about
another employee,

105
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,160
and that, obviously, leads
to many other problems.

106
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,250
Are the comments,
are they targeted

107
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,970
to a general group or
one particular person,

108
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,670
and the nature of
those comments?

109
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,960
And does it, again, lead
to some kind of damage

110
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,180
to the employer's reputation,
anything along those lines.

111
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,940
And that helps us determine
whether the behavior was

112
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,650
reasonable or not.

113
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,099
So the best way to try and
determine what's reasonable

114
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,340
use because you're
really trying to balance

115
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,705
the rights of employees
to express themselves,

116
00:05:19,706 --> 00:05:21,080
but you're also
trying to balance

117
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,630
the rights of the organization
in that it may face liability

118
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,510
for the actions of
their employees.

119
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,810
And the best tool for
this is to implement

120
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,630
a policy or a social media
policy and a procedure

121
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,130
for managing any
breaches of that policy.

122
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,530
And, really, your policy
should provide clear guidelines

123
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,650
on what you can do
and what you can't do.

124
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,289
No policy will ever cover
every possible outcome,

125
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,580
but it at least provides
some kind of guidance.

126
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,990
It should be designed to
protect the organization

127
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,490
from legal liability, as well
as any other ethical problems.

128
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,470
It should also
explain at what point

129
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,170
an investigation
will be commenced

130
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,680
when we commence
an investigation

131
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,150
for some kind of
breach of the policy.

132
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,150
It should also
specify to employees

133
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,890
that, as their employer,
you have a right

134
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,150
to monitor what
they're doing online,

135
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,929
and that that's quite clear.

136
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,830
And you also need
to show that there's

137
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,900
a procedure that will be
in place once a breach has

138
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,880
been identified.

139
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,080
Well, what's the procedure?

140
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,940
What happens next?

141
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,356
So you need to
give them some kind

142
00:06:20,356 --> 00:06:23,150
of warning as to the process
and the disciplinary action that

143
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,500
could occur because of
a breach of this policy.

144
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,610
So in our next topic, we'll
be looking at another emerging

145
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,840
issue, which is
really how to manage

146
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,219
Generation X and Y, and the
differences between them.

147
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,804
