00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,100
Hi.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,070
So in our last topic, we
just touched on the basic HR

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,630
functions-- what those
core functions are.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,410
And in this topic,
we'll be briefly looking

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,020
through the history of
how that function has

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,100
changed over the last century.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,350
And the best way to
really explain that,

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,810
to go through that, is to
look at the four stages

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,110
that HR has developed
over the last century.

11
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,089
And you'll notice
there's a common theme,

12
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,730
and you'll see the direction
of where we're moving.

13
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,750
So really the first three stages
were quite the dominant stages

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,360
and these really what
were shaped and developed

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,920
the way that HR has
grown over time.

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,890
We'll also look
at the last stage,

17
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,760
which is more of
an emerging area.

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,040
Really hasn't
settled quite in yet.

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,660
But this is really where HR
is moving to in the future.

20
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,290
And as we go through
each stage, you'll

21
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,690
also find the
really common theme

22
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,810
there, it's really interesting,
is that we started off

23
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,920
with our first stage,
which is really concerned

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,980
about the needs of
the organization.

25
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,360
And as we move
through and progressed

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,950
to the fourth and
current stage, we

27
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,230
find that now the focus is more
on the needs of the people.

28
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,020
So over time,
research has really

29
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,240
shown us that if we consider
the needs of employees

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,539
and we meet those needs,
they'll in turn meet

31
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,910
the needs of the
organization, and that

32
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,250
will have the ultimate
impact on the organization's

33
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,870
productivity.

34
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,580
Let's look at the first stage.

35
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:39,686
So the first stage was really
took us up to the 1940s.

36
00:01:39,686 --> 00:01:42,410
It was more so concerned
with just the welfare

37
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,000
and administration of staff.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,100
So it was really at
a time in Australia

39
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,339
where it was mainly primary
production and manufacturing

40
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,050
in those days.

41
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,700
Owners of these factories were
really like father figures.

42
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,250
They were the ones responsible
for the hiring and firing

43
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,250
of staff.

44
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,570
And that was really the
type of relationship

45
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,570
that existed at that time.

46
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,209
And really, if you
get into stage one,

47
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,850
you'll find that
there weren't really

48
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,310
many people at that
time that took,

49
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,930
or many organizations that took,
a structured approach to HR.

50
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,370
It was really just
filling in a needs

51
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,520
and maintaining that
workforce to do whatever

52
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,600
the core businesses
of that organization.

53
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,140
As we progress to
stage two, we started

54
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,279
to see that shift
to the slightly more

55
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,750
strategic approach
to administering HR.

56
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,200
and this took us up
to the mid-1970s.

57
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,260
And you'll find that really
in this period of time

58
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,489
organizations were starting
to appoint personnel managers,

59
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,030
to deal with the day to
day needs of employees.

60
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,000
They started to appoint
industrial relations

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,500
personnel managers to deal with
issues that they were having

62
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,720
at the time with
unions and so on.

63
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,480
And you started to see that
a little bit more structure,

64
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,720
or more structured
approach, to HR.

65
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,580
There wasn't really
many organizations

66
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,010
at that point that had reached
the stage where they actually

67
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,399
had formal policies and
procedures and so on.

68
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,860
But leading the way at the
time, the David Jones department

69
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,570
store was one of the
first to really start

70
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,930
establishing formal employee
policies and procedures.

71
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,310
So they were quite
innovative at that time.

72
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,170
And if we think about
the type of industries

73
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,970
and how HR has impacted the
way that we manage people,

74
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,870
again you'll start
to see that pattern,

75
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,550
that pattern that the
needs of the employees

76
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,380
are the needs that we are
pushing closer towards,

77
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,630
and we're realizing have a
direct link on productivity.

78
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,420
Let's have a look
at the third stage.

79
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,959
So this is taking us up to
the 2000s, the early 2000s.

80
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,420
And here we really start
seeing a more concrete,

81
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,519
scientific approach
in application

82
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,560
of HR in organizations.

83
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,010
This is where we started
looking at strategy.

84
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,040
So we started looking at,
how do we plan for it?

85
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,609
How do we plan for the
organization's future

86
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,140
through our staff?

87
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,430
We look at things like
workforce planning,

88
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:24,060
and we started to look at things
like organizational change

89
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,680
and managing that change.

90
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,590
And again it was focused
on the employees,

91
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,729
more structured,
more formalized.

92
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,410
And that's where we get this
concept of strategic HRM.

93
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,800
And if we look at the
fourth stage, which

94
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,560
is really where we're at now.

95
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,220
This is the emerging stage.

96
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,200
We are really thinking about
sustainable HR management.

97
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,110
And what does that really mean?

98
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,260
What's sustainable HR?

99
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,409
It's really looking
at an approach

100
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,360
to HR that's concerned with the
future and future generations,

101
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,220
and how we can try and
effectively minimize

102
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,540
the negative impacts
that organizations

103
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,010
may have on their staff.

104
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,930
Also, we might look at
the negative impacts

105
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,950
that they may have on the
environment, on the communities

106
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,300
in which those
organizations exist amongst,

107
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,380
and really, how we can improve
and create a positive future

108
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,250
by minimizing the
negative impacts of HR

109
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,430
and maximizing the
potential to really build

110
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,860
on that human capital.

111
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,495
And we can see that if we
take care of our staff,

112
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,540
our productivity improves.

113
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,520
And we'll look a
little bit further

114
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,659
in the next topic about HR
practitioners and what they do.

115
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,130
And then we can see their role,
and how their role has also

116
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,383
changed through those
four stages over time.

117
00:05:46,383 --> 00:05:46,882
