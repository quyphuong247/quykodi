00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:08,980
Hi.

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,396
Welcome to topic
eight where we're

4
00:00:10,396 --> 00:00:12,640
looking at another
emerging issue, which

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,730
is how we manage
Generation X and Y.

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,880
And it's really important
to consider some

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,419
of the differences between
these two generations.

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,430
A lot of the aspects of work
that were important to the baby

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,400
boomers are no longer
important to Gen Y or X.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,599
And there's a whole
range of other factors

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,690
that have come into play,
particularly, because

12
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,780
of the emergence of
technology and how

13
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,630
attitudes and social
demographics have changed.

14
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,280
And this does have
an impact on the way

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,580
that we manage these
two generations.

16
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,400
So in this topic, we'll look
at some of the most important

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,269
factors to Gen Y and X,
and what they would really

18
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,220
like to see from a
job, and in a way that

19
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,296
helps us manage their
performance because it has

20
00:00:51,296 --> 00:00:55,060
an impact on what's important
to them and, therefore, being

21
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,260
able to retain them and keep
them for as long as possible.

22
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,710
So often when we're trying to
categorize Generation X and Y,

23
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,629
we're really just
making a generalization.

24
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,750
There are no specific
locked-in time periods.

25
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,874
So when we refer
to Generation X,

26
00:01:09,874 --> 00:01:11,289
we're normally
referring to people

27
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:16,860
who were born around
1965 on to about 1979.

28
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,790
And when we refer
to Generation Y,

29
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,410
we're normally
thinking of people

30
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:25,410
who are born post 1980s
and up to about '95.

31
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,600
And in those generations they
do have some similarities, which

32
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,761
are quite different
to the baby boomers,

33
00:01:30,761 --> 00:01:32,259
and that's what
we'll be looking at.

34
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,560
They've grown up in
different periods of time,

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,260
and some of the differences
include the fact

36
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,930
that they've pretty
much grown up

37
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,760
in a turbulent
environment where there's

38
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,980
been economic
downturns, there's been

39
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,870
changes in the economy,
changes in social structures

40
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,640
so they're quite
used to or adapted

41
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,770
to turbulence and
constant change.

42
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,729
They often display lower levels
of loyalty to an employer.

43
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,250


44
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,660
They'll normally
commit to the job

45
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,720
and they'll perform
and give everything

46
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,560
that they can to an employer,
but as soon as they're not

47
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,120
receiving the aspects of the
job that really challenge

48
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,550
them and make them feel
rewarded and recognized,

49
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,480
they'll often just move
on to the next job.

50
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,950
So the loyalty levels are much
lower than our baby boomers.

51
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,609
They really don't prefer
the structured careers

52
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,380
that our baby boomers really
were quite adapted to.

53
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,940
These generations
will want change,

54
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,190
they'll want constant change,
and they'll want variety

55
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,540
in their roles,
and their careers

56
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,400
may take completely
different tangents.

57
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,320
I, myself, have
been through that.

58
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,930
I've been in the legal
industry, I've been in HR,

59
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,590
I've been in training
and teaching,

60
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,620
and so it's quite a diverse
range of areas in one career.

61
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,780
They're often really pushing
for flexible work practices

62
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,940
because there's a stronger
emphasis on work-life balance.

63
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,190
In the past, you worked,
you did your hours

64
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,609
to make your money to
take care of your family,

65
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,060
and that was the way that
we took care of our family.

66
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,920
Now, we're really considering
ways to balance life

67
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,280
and the social aspects of
life, as well as our work,

68
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,120
and that's quite important
to these generations.

69
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,110
They do have lower
levels of commitment,

70
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,490
but don't get me wrong, not
lower levels of commitment

71
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,100
to their job or their career,
they may excel at their job

72
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,790
and in their career, but they
have lower levels of commitment

73
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:30,120
to one organization so you
really need to try and develop

74
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,430
strategies to keep them
engaged in your organization.

75
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,440
So we'll often find that
with these generations

76
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,900
we need to come
up with some tools

77
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,900
or with some strategies
that will keep them engaged

78
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,570
and keep them wanting to
stay within the organization.

79
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,910
Again, this is the ultimate
outcome at any stage

80
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,827
because we go through
the recruitment process,

81
00:03:49,827 --> 00:03:51,243
but at the end of
the day, we want

82
00:03:51,243 --> 00:03:52,950
to retain staff for
as long as possible

83
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,250
because recruitment is
an expensive activity.

84
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,869
So we'll just have a look at a
couple of different strategies

85
00:03:57,869 --> 00:03:59,410
or a couple of
different factors that

86
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,332
are important to
these generations.

87
00:04:01,332 --> 00:04:02,790
And they are almost
needs for them,

88
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,581
and we're going to try
and meet those needs

89
00:04:04,581 --> 00:04:07,000
to keep them in
your organization.

90
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,850
So consider flexible
working arrangements.

91
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,040
This is quite attractive
to these generations,

92
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,359
and so if you allow that
flexibility to keep give them

93
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,350
that work-life balance, you're
more likely to retain them.

94
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,550
Often, these generations
really crave a challenging work

95
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,330
environment.

96
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,380
They crave challenges.

97
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,120
They crave new ways of
doing things, new ideas,

98
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,750
and have that
variety in their role

99
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,460
where there is constant change.

100
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,169
And so they're well
suited to project work.

101
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,714
They also thrive in a
fun working environment,

102
00:04:36,714 --> 00:04:38,380
and it may sound like
something trivial,

103
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,100
but everyone goes to work and
you want to be happy at work,

104
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,690
and they thrive in
that environment

105
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,300
where everyone is
supportive, where

106
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,000
there may be social activities
that are linked to work,

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and that's quite a simple,
easy way to engage them.

108
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Again, avoid the structured
approach to jobs.

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,040
So the more flexible
their job is

110
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,510
in terms of being able to
engage in different projects,

111
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,700
in different departments
within the organization,

112
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,870
the more likely you are
to keep them for longer.

113
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,660
To keep that
commitment to the job,

114
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,312
it's really about trying
to engage them in the work

115
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,770
that they're doing,
and you're more

116
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,219
likely to have them committed
to that particular role.

117
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,930
There's a focus on
lifelong learning

118
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,155
so that really-- the concepts
of development and learning

119
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,159
are really important
to these generations

120
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,170
so it's critical to
allow implementation

121
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:30,070
of those types of initiatives.

122
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,620
They really respect people
who demonstrate knowledge.

123
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,510
It's not about a
hierarchy, it's more about

124
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,371
who obtains the most
knowledge that's

125
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:38,745
able to benefit
the organization.

126
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:41,450


127
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,810
Excessive work
hours are really not

128
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,600
an option for these generations.

129
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,767
It's not like how it was
with the baby boomers.

130
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:50,100
There are so many other options.

131
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,220
So if an employer is asking
for more than what's required,

132
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,370
they'll move on.

133
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,230
They also thrive with
regular feedback,

134
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,440
and that's part of
any communication

135
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,240
process in the organization.

136
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,590
So really keeping
these things in mind

137
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,460
will mean that you
have a better chance

138
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,359
of retaining these
type of employees.

139
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,820
And in our next topic, we'll
be looking in more detail

140
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,480
at the performance
appraisal interview,

141
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,980
and what you can
do in that process.

142
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,721
