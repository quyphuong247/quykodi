00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,860
Hi, welcome to topic 10 on
flexible working arrangements.

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,629
Our final topic of module one.

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,750
I'd like to start this
topic with an example of one

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,030
Australian bank that's
implemented a leading edge

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,670
initiative in inflexible
working arrangements.

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:31,160
This particular bank
had introduced, in 2007,

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,300
the concept of
grandparents leave.

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,959
Now they had-- a large
portion of their workforce

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,902
were over 55.

11
00:00:38,902 --> 00:00:40,360
And so they introduced
grandparents

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,320
leave as a way to try
and keep and retain

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,550
their valuable and
talented employees

14
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,279
in that particular age group.

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,100
So grandparents
leaves essentially

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,260
meant that they could take
unpaid leave to spend time

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,449
with their family, and their
grandchildren, and so on.

18
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,330
And they we're given
a variety of options.

19
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:03,269
They could take it as one
period of time for six months,

20
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,030
or it could be one
day per week where

21
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,279
they were on grandparents leave.

22
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:09,570
And so they gave them the
flexibility, and the options,

23
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,652
and they were encouraged
to go home and discuss it

24
00:01:11,653 --> 00:01:12,940
with their family.

25
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,539
So this particular
bank was quite

26
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,830
innovative in their approach to
flexible working arrangements.

27
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,510
And we'll go through
a few different types

28
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,040
of flexible working
arrangements,

29
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,210
but it really can vary.

30
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,839
And it can be almost anything.

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,820
It really is a
solution that works,

32
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,580
not just for the organization,
but for the employee also.

33
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,929
The key benefit behind
flexible working arrangements

34
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,690
is really founded in research.

35
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,890
And all the research
suggests that when

36
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,970
were offered flexible
working arrangements

37
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,100
we have increased
levels of commitment,

38
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,050
and increased levels of
loyalty to our employer.

39
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,990
And we did cover
this in topic nine.

40
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,419
And we find that employees who
are offered flexible working

41
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,920
arrangements tend
to actually work

42
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,160
harder and longer
for their employers.

43
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,460
Because they value that
opportunity, and they

44
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,000
appreciate the fact that
they've been supported

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,190
to manage their competing needs.

46
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,300
So if we look at some
of these different types

47
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,039
of flexible working
arrangements--

48
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,790
there's quite a
few-- but we'll just

49
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,450
be looking at a couple, for now.

50
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,109
Let's have a look at the
concept of job-sharing.

51
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,320
Job-sharing is essentially where
you have one full time role,

52
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,380
and it's actually
broken up-- or the tasks

53
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,900
are broken up
amongst two people.

54
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,570
So it's the same one role.

55
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,757
And you may have one person
coming for two days a week,

56
00:02:32,757 --> 00:02:34,840
and the other person coming
for three days a week.

57
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,714
And they are essentially
doing the same role,

58
00:02:36,714 --> 00:02:38,660
but it's just shared
between two people.

59
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,350
And in that way they're
able to be offered

60
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:45,049
the flexibility of
essentially working part time.

61
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:48,350
We also have the concept
of term-time working.

62
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,230
And this is really quite new.

63
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,140
Some organizations have
offered working mothers

64
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,500
the option of only working
during the school terms.

65
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,490
So when there are
school holidays,

66
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,030
they're able to
take unpaid leave

67
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,590
to stay at home
with their children.

68
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,110
We also have the
option of working

69
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,000
from home, which is really
becoming extremely popular now.

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,830
And there's so many benefits.

71
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,630
And we did touch on that in our
topic on virtual work teams.

72
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,210
And it's becoming really
popular because it really

73
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:23,030
allows the flexibility to meet
the needs of your employer,

74
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,400
but to also meet the
needs of your family.

75
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,930
And it doesn't
necessarily have to be

76
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,480
a full-time working
from home role.

77
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,190
It can be a combination
of several days a week

78
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,310
based in an office,
and several days a week

79
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,680
are based from home.

80
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,370
And it really can vary.

81
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,250
And, again, it's all
about negotiating

82
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,950
with the employer for what
really works for both.

83
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,940
We also have the concept of
the compressed working week.

84
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,000
And that's also
become quite popular,

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,980
where an employee may work
several longer days, in order

86
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,850
to meet their weekly hours.

87
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,180
So, if their regular weekly
hours are 40 hours a week,

88
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,240
they may do four
days of 10 hours,

89
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,820
or so on, in order to give
them that additional time

90
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,350
to be able to manage their
competing interests outside

91
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,720
of work.

92
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,070
A recent survey actually showed
that 84% of the respondents

93
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,300
would be happier to
accept a lower salary

94
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,500
in order to have access to
flexible working arrangements.

95
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,790
And that's really showing us
the value, from the employee's

96
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,990
perspective, of having the
opportunity to be offered

97
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,210
that flexibility
in order to meet

98
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:38,340
the needs of elderly parents,
the needs of children,

99
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,560
and really be able to
balance the two together.

100
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,800
So that brings us to
the end of this topic,

101
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,840
and to the end of module one.

102
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,820
During this module we looked
at what some of the changes,

103
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,360
and the emerging
areas in HR work.

104
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,060
We looked at the
evolution of HR over time.

105
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,560
We looked at some
critical issues

106
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,680
like, stress in the
workplace, bullying

107
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,190
in the workplace,
and the huge impact

108
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,160
that IT has had on the
way that we manage people.

109
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,990
Now, in module two,
we'll be looking

110
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,400
at the entire recruitment
process, from start to finish.

111
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,080
So from the initial
planning stages,

112
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,669
through to
interviewing, screening,

113
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,770
and then to actually
making a decision

114
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,520
in selecting the
right candidate.

115
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,940
And throughout the
module we'll be

116
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,240
looking at lots of
changes in technology,

117
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,430
things like social
media, and how they've

118
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,360
impacted the
recruitment process.

119
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,640
So it's really recruitment,
from a modern perspective.

120
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,202
