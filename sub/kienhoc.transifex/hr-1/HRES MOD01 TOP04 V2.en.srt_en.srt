00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,010
Hi.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,600
Welcome to topic four.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,120
In this topic, we'll be
looking at email and internet

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,520
usage in an
organization, and what

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,730
the HR implications are of that.

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:23,720
Really since the mid-'90s,
there's been a huge impact

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,020
on the way we manage people
because of things like

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,090
the internet.

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,090
Internet and email are
obviously a critical part

11
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:35,150
of most organizations
and most job roles.

12
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,759
So we'll be looking at really
how the internet and how email

13
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:41,300
and how having access
to the internet

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,070
has really created a whole
set of new challenges

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,620
and new problems
for organizations.

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,640
It's great to have access
to all this information,

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,420
but the challenges
that come with that

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,840
also need to be managed.

19
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,850
And that's why, further
on in this topic,

20
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,630
we'll be looking at why and
how we need to make sure

21
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,910
that we have policies and
procedures in place to monitor

22
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,270
and maintain a good relationship
with the internet [INAUDIBLE]

23
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,310
for our staff.

24
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,380
Some of the key
legal issues we need

25
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,580
to consider when dealing with
the internet and email usage

26
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,850
really align to three
different points

27
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,750
or three different areas.

28
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,720
One, it's about our
IT infrastructure

29
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,929
and how we protect it.

30
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:27,040
So this is things like ensuring
that our systems are secure

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,630
and we don't have viruses being
contracted through emails,

32
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,300
or whatever.

33
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,500
The second area is
confidentiality.

34
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,680
So really we need to
consider the legal risks

35
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,810
of valuable
corporate information

36
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,680
and how that may be distributed
so easily through things

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,740
like email or even
through social networks.

38
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,990
And that's a really
critical legal aspect,

39
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,589
because we need to
ensure the security

40
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,950
of that kind of
valuable information.

41
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,690
The third area is
really about monitoring

42
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,980
staff's usage of the
internet and other aspects,

43
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,180
such as email and social media.

44
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,810
The reality is, although
they may have access

45
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:13,070
to a huge number of resources
that may better enable them

46
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,579
to do their job,
they also have access

47
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,039
to a lot of things that
are really time wasters.

48
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,579
And we'll be looking
at some of those

49
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,600
in more detail
throughout this topic.

50
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,180
So one of the
challenges that we have

51
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,320
with trying to monitor
internet usage in organizations

52
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:34,590
is people's access to things
like Facebook, shopping

53
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,070
websites, social
networking sites,

54
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,820
and even things like YouTube.

55
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,940
Although many organizations
have blocked it,

56
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,710
it's still often available.

57
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:49,250
And really how do we manage and
monitor that type of activity

58
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,610
and stop it from
affecting productivity.

59
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,920
Some of the other issues
are also around email.

60
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,309
And, in fact, email seems
to have greater challenges,

61
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,660
even more so than
internet usage,

62
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,740
because it has such an impact
in the way that we communicate.

63
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,600
So we can look at
some of the ways

64
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,410
that email can really
also be a big time waster.

65
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,190
And a recent survey showed
that 10% of all of our emails

66
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,970
that we receive at work are
completely unsolicited, so

67
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,430
essentially spam.

68
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,480
And just even those
minor challenges on a day

69
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,570
are really ways that
minimize our productivity

70
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,760
in the workplace.

71
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,940
But essentially, email can
become a real challenge,

72
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,200
because it's become a
primary way of communicating

73
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,010
between each other
in an organization.

74
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,540
So I may have someone sitting
one meter away from me.

75
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,359
I don't get up or I don't call
them, I send them an email.

76
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,650
And the potential
for misunderstanding

77
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,120
in that platform
of communication

78
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,240
or that form of communication
is just so high.

79
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,620
I'll give you an example.

80
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,790
In one organization
that I worked for,

81
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,440
there was an email
trail that went on

82
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,020
for approximately 25 emails.

83
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,410
And it was essentially over an
expense claim for biscuits--

84
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,200
for biscuits for
the office kitchen,

85
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,679
because they had guests.

86
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,370
The CEO of the
organization at the time

87
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,590
was actually included
in these emails.

88
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,610
So you can imagine
how many people

89
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:20,709
were involved in this back and
forth of emails about biscuits,

90
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:24,050
including the CEO, and how
much time that would've

91
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,870
wasted for all involved with
no real outcome and no impact

92
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,410
on productivity.

93
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,840
So we can see the
potential for email

94
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,560
to really be a big time waster.

95
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,180
The other issue with email
is it's not really as secure

96
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,530
as many of us think it is.

97
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,859
Email can be bugged.

98
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,330
Email can be tracked.

99
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,880
Email's very much
easily traceable,

100
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,880
as is a lot of your activity on
the internet, in the same way.

101
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:55,719
So this assumption that what
we say in an email is secure

102
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,270
is really incorrect.

103
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,680
The other problem with
email is, in many cases,

104
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,360
things we may not actually
say to someone face-to-face,

105
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,190
we find very
comfortable in an email.

106
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,719
And this is where, often, again,
other interpersonal problems

107
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,010
can be created in the
organization because

108
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,460
of the use of email.

109
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,479
This may potentially be a
good discussion point for you

110
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,550
in the discussion forum.

111
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,710
Think of circumstances
or times when

112
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,349
you may have emailed
someone about something

113
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,000
that you probably wouldn't have
said to them to their face.

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,260
And maybe just discuss
your experience

115
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,820
and what the challenges were
with that and potentially

116
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,290
how you may have overcome them.

117
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,860
So in looking at some of
the challenges and issues

118
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,780
with email and internet
use in organizations,

119
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,020
it really brings
home why we need

120
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,820
to have policies and procedures
to really manage these things.

121
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,620
And the two key
issues we're looking

122
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,110
at in any organizational policy
relating to internet usage

123
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,940
is really how we
protect the organization

124
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,700
from the business
and legal risks

125
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,140
that we discussed
earlier and also how

126
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,060
we limit the spread of
time wasting emails.

127
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,090
And they're really
the two key areas

128
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:15,419
we need to ensure are included
in an internet usage policy.

129
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,250
In our next topic, we'll be
looking at an emerging area--

130
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,730
workplace stress.

131
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,110
In many cases,
time wasting emails

132
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,440
could've been the source
of the workplace stress.

133
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,100
But we'll look at that shortly.

134
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,304
