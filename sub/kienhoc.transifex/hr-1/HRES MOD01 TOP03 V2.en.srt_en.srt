00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,740
Hi, Welcome back.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,780
In our last topic, we
looked at a brief overview

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,340
of the four stages
of development of HR.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,100
And in the same way HR
personnel or HR roles

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,560
have also evolved in
a similar fashion.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,680
So we'll look at what
is it that HR people do.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,259
And the role is quite
varied and there are so

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,420
many different things you
can do if you work in HR.

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,610
So we'll be looking at really
what that role involves.

11
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,420
We'll be looking at
some of the reasons

12
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:45,220
why people decide to
start a career in HR.

13
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,420
We'll also be looking at
different options that

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,640
may be available to you if
you're interested in entering

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,320
a career in HR and
really what avenues

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,330
are available to you
to educate yourself.

17
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,910
And as we mentioned
in previous topics,

18
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:05,039
HR is really a rapidly
changing and evolving area.

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,470
And more so than in
many other industries

20
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,720
it's so important
and so critical

21
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,289
that you're always really
on top of what's changing.

22
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,120
And so we'll also look at
professional development

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,150
as really a tool to help any
HR professional to maintain

24
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,730
current knowledge in an
industry of constant change.

25
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,800
And before we really
get into that we'll

26
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:33,240
have a look at some broad areas
of what the HR role can involve

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,059
and can include.

28
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,070
If we look at, firstly,
the HR function.

29
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,679
So there are various
roles that are just

30
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,200
about administering
the HR function.

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,550
And what we mean
by that is people

32
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,380
who are involved in recruitment.

33
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,100
People who are involved in pay.

34
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,809
People who are
involved in maintaining

35
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,360
work health and
safety compliance.

36
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,670
So these are generic
HR functions.

37
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,600
So there's a whole
variety of roles.

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,619
Just around those
specific functions.

39
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,270
Health and safety in
particular in Australia,

40
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,320
as with many other
countries, has

41
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,130
become quite a specialized
area in itself.

42
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,210
And there are now many
specialized HR roles

43
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,940
that are really just focused
on ensuring the health

44
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,030
and safety of
employees and ensuring

45
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,950
that the organization is
maintaining compliance

46
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,420
with the legislation.

47
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,399
We'll also look at
workforce planning.

48
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,310
So There's so many roles
just focused around

49
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:36,100
how we try and make sure that
our organization is prepared

50
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,510
from a human perspective or from
human resources perspective,

51
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,090
that we're prepared
for the next stage.

52
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,370
So as some of our
senior managers

53
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,060
move on and retire and so
on, do we have someone ready?

54
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,630
Do we have someone else
ready who's been trained

55
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,650
who is ready to jump
into that next stage.

56
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,100
And that's part of what
work force planning is about

57
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,910
and there are a whole
variety of roles

58
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,590
that are just focused on that.

59
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,380
And it really does
link up with what

60
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,160
we were saying in the
previous topic about how

61
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,970
we're more in a
stage of strategy

62
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,650
and HR really is about strategy.

63
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,250
And that's why there's
so many HR planning

64
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,450
roles at the moment.

65
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,399
We also have training
and development.

66
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,410
So again that's also
in line with the shift

67
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,090
and the change in
attitudes to HR.

68
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,320
Many organizations
really invest heavily

69
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,310
in training their staff,
in developing their staff.

70
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:36,920
And to ensure that they're
not just able to do their job,

71
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,450
because they've been
given adequate training,

72
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,700
but also to develop them
as people and their skills

73
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,929
and to help them develop
their own careers.

74
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,780
And it really
always comes back to

75
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,590
if we take care of our staff,
They'll take care of us

76
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,310
and that always
affects the bottom line

77
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,770
and improves our productivity.

78
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,440
So there's some
of the broad areas

79
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,270
of where you may find
different types of HR roles.

80
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,510
But again it's become
such a specialized area.

81
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,440
And it's constantly
changing and there's

82
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,359
a whole variety of
different things

83
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,316
you can do that fit
within this area.

84
00:04:11,316 --> 00:04:13,550
The very interesting
thing is, is

85
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,590
when you look at
some of the research

86
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,990
to why people enter
a career into HR,

87
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,290
it's quite surprising
that the key reason why

88
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,900
they enter into that career
is really a humanistic reason.

89
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,409
So in a recent survey
of HR practitioners,

90
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,800
they found that 77% actually
entered into the field

91
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,030
simply to help other
people grow and develop.

92
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,059
And so it's a great and
rewarding career in that sense

93
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,390
because you can really have
an impact on other people's

94
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,780
lives and their development.

95
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,880
So at this point, you
might be thinking, yeah,

96
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,400
I might be interested
in a career in HR.

97
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,530
So what are some of
your options if you

98
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,159
want to start looking at
training or an education in HR.

99
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,860
There are really two pathways.

100
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,370
So you can either go down
the vocational education

101
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,670
and training pathway.

102
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,210
Or you go down the
higher education pathway,

103
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,000
which is universities.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,320
Although there's really quite
a bit of a difference in both.

105
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,640
If you're looking
at qualifications

106
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,789
such as a certificate for
human resource management

107
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,360
or a diploma in human
resource management,

108
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,160
and to that
vocational education,

109
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,620
and training pathway,
it's really about skills.

110
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,610
So these qualifications
designed to really give you

111
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:36,690
the skills to do tasks within
various job roles in HR.

112
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,750
So for example, a
certificate four

113
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,960
will allow you or
provide you the skills

114
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,469
to undertake tasks that a
HR officer would undertake

115
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,670
or that a recruitment
officer would undertake.

116
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,730
And so it's really about skills.

117
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:53,080
Whereas when we go to
university or higher education,

118
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,909
it's more so about why
do we do these things.

119
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,780
VET tells us how to
do them, higher ed

120
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,729
tells us why we do them.

121
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:06,750
And so if you go into a
bachelor of business in HR

122
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,250
you really look at the strategy
behind why we do these things.

123
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,310
If you take that
step further and you

124
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,120
go into postgraduate
qualification in HR

125
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,680
you're really looking at,
well how can we change the way

126
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,260
we do these things.

127
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,740
And so you really have
quite a few options.

128
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,900
In module three
will also be looking

129
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,080
at training and
development in more detail.

130
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,260
So if you're interested, you'll
get a better understanding

131
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,480
in module three of why
we do these things.

132
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,520
So in our next topic, we'll be
looking at the HR implications

133
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,479
around email and internet
use in organization.

134
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,190
So stay tuned.

135
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,442
