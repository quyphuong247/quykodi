00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,270
Hi.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,890
Welcome to topic
two, where we're

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,640
looking at goals and
performance management.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,610
Now performance management,
or the whole performance

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,919
management system, is made up
of several different components.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,570
But why we have this is
because it's not just

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,160
about managing the individual
employee's performance.

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,800
But it's also about managing
a team's performance,

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,620
or managing a department's
performance to therefore manage

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,970
the performance of the
organization as a whole.

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,677
So it really does include
lots of different factors

13
00:00:35,677 --> 00:00:38,010
when we're trying to develop
this performance management

14
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,260
system.

15
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,460
And you can have
informal systems,

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,230
you can have formal
systems, there's a variety.

17
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,220
There's a lot of degree
between informal and formal,

18
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,060
and variation.

19
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,360
So every organization
is different.

20
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,540
But obviously, having some kind
of structure to your system

21
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,300
is quite important to
ensure the effectiveness,

22
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,510
and the fairness in managing
people's performance.

23
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,519
So let's have a look at some
of the components of most

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,940
performance management systems.

25
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,850
And these are all quite generic.

26
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,130
So at some stage, you'll
have organizational goals

27
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:09,960
in the system.

28
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,070
Because at the end
of the day, that's

29
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,690
really the top of what
you're trying to reach.

30
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,910
And that-- the organizational
goals are really only met

31
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,780
through several other layers
of individual and team goals.

32
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,710
You'll also have
job specifications.

33
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,869
Because you need to know how the
job should be done, and what's

34
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,850
expected in that particular
job at an individual level.

35
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,820
If we don't tell people
what we expect of them,

36
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,600
we can't expect them to do it.

37
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,470
It may often include
a reward structure.

38
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,490
So for example, and this
really is the simplest example.

39
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,490
With sales teams.

40
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,679
So if you're in a
sales type of role,

41
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,960
often there will be a target.

42
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,374
So an amount, a dollar amount of
sales that you need to achieve.

43
00:01:51,374 --> 00:01:52,789
And if you meet
that target you're

44
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,070
rewarded by an
incentive payment.

45
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,110
Some kind of extra
commission for meeting

46
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,710
that particular target.

47
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,890
And that's a very
simple example.

48
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,710
It's also in relation to
the selection of employees.

49
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,539
So it's not just when we
go to recruit someone new,

50
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,430
and we want to be able to
have some kind of benchmark

51
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,270
to assess the performance
down the track.

52
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,450
But it's also for recruiting
employees internally.

53
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,170
Again we need something
to be able to compare to,

54
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,040
their performance.

55
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,230
It often can include
induction and training.

56
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,590
And if you remember
in our last module,

57
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,810
that was often a reason why
training needed to occur.

58
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,630
Because there was
a performance gap.

59
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,630
So often that will be part of a
performance management system.

60
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,600
It also includes, as we
expect it to include,

61
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,710
the appraisal system.

62
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:41,510
And we'll look at performance
appraisals in the next topic.

63
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,899
And it also come down
to, and at the very end,

64
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,080
the individual goals
of each employee.

65
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,490
So it can really encompass
so many different components

66
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,720
that will make up your
performance management system.

67
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,060
So as I just mentioned, these
performance management systems

68
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,350
are really made up
of layers of goals.

69
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,019
And if we have a look
right at the top here,

70
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,810
it's about the organization's
missions and values.

71
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,370
And this is really our
overarching, general goal.

72
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,090
The goal of the organization.

73
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,390
And then we start moving to more
specific organizational goals.

74
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,765
And there may be
things like, you

75
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:16,239
know wanting to be the
leader of technology

76
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,600
in a particular
field, or whatever.

77
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,250
And there's a whole variety
of organizational goals.

78
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,120
But this is again,
really right at the top.

79
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,090
Then you might have
a business unit goal.

80
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,480
And business unit
goals will be based

81
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,840
around potentially departments.

82
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,206
So there may be goals to
have been set for this sales

83
00:03:33,206 --> 00:03:34,579
department, or
there may be goals

84
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,710
that have been set for
the marketing department.

85
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,090
And so on.

86
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,500
And then we have our
individual team goal.

87
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,260
So there may be a
team who's working

88
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,859
on sales of one particular
type of product.

89
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,477
And we want to
see that-- we want

90
00:03:48,477 --> 00:03:50,060
to see what their
goals are as a team,

91
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,380
so we can then also monitor
the team's performance.

92
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,280
Not just each individual
within that team.

93
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,630
And then right at the very end,
we have our individual goals.

94
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,990
And these are the goals for
each individual employee

95
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,350
that are based on their job.

96
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,130
So we can often
call them job goals.

97
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,299
And with job goals, they
will vary quite significantly

98
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,090
depending on the type of job
that we're talking about.

99
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,840
So if we're talking
about senior managers,

100
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,720
often the job goals are more
so around some kind of target.

101
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,790
Achieving a particular target.

102
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,170
And when we're talking
about middle managers,

103
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,720
it's often about being
able to show that they've

104
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,380
met a goal around
up of performing

105
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,530
a particular capability.

106
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,405
So some kind of competency.

107
00:04:34,405 --> 00:04:35,780
And then when
we're talking about

108
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,479
lower skilled employees,
or lower skilled roles,

109
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,300
it's often about--
or goals that are

110
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,260
about achieving a
particular task.

111
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,940
Or a specific
activity that needs

112
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,500
to be achieved in their role.

113
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,350
So the individual job
goals will vary obviously,

114
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,870
depending on the type of
role that we are assessing.

115
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,600
So goals are also
not a static thing

116
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,695
in performance management.

117
00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:58,050
They'll often change.

118
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,930
And there's a whole variety of
reasons why they may change.

119
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,720
And it's important that
organizations are quickly

120
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,940
able to identify
that there needs

121
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,120
to be a change in the goal.

122
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,410
So people are not working
towards something,

123
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:13,010
or performing towards a
particular point that really

124
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,860
is not valid and won't
achieve anything in the end.

125
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,300
And that's again, not
fair from an organization

126
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,210
perspective to put a goal
towards an employee that's

127
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,840
no longer required, and they've
spent all this effort and time

128
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,630
working towards that goal.

129
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,290
So let's take a look at
some of the reasons why,

130
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:34,130
or how we can really revise
goals to ensure their validity

131
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,250
in the performance
management system.

132
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,560
So we can look at the
current team goals.

133
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,040
Team goals should align to each
individual employee's goals

134
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,450
as well.

135
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,690
We can also obtain feedback
from the employees themselves.

136
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,905
Or those those
particular individuals

137
00:05:48,905 --> 00:05:50,530
to get an understanding
of whether they

138
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:55,010
feel these goals are actually
achievable and can be reached.

139
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,730
Benchmarking is a
fantastic tool as well

140
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,250
to help get insight into whether
these goals need to be changed.

141
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,400
When we benchmark
them against goals

142
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,270
from other business
units, or other teams,

143
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,210
or other individuals.

144
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,729
So it can be two individuals
in the same team,

145
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,190
and we're comparing their
level of performance.

146
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,719
And whether those goals
are really realistic.

147
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,050
And lastly, it's looking
at previous goals.

148
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,770
So let's look at last year's
financial goals for example.

149
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,960
And then that can give
us some kind of insight

150
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,520
into how the goals may
need to be changed.

151
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,490
So essentially, at
the end of the day,

152
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,360
the goals are really
the starting point

153
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,330
of any performance
management system.

154
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,430
And in our next topic, we'll
be looking more at-- more

155
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,200
in depth at the actual
performance appraisal process

156
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,050
and how to conduct a
performance appraisal.

157
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,517
