00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,200
Hi.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,379
So you've now reached
topic 10, which

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,510
is our final topic
of this module.

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,580
And we'll be looking
at retention.

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,460
And although
traditionally, retention

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,950
may not be one aspect
that we would include

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,530
in the recruitment
process, it really

9
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,370
is linked to the
recruitment process.

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,150
Why?

11
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,959
Because at the end of
the day, if we're not

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,200
able to retain the
employees that we hire,

13
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,589
we come back full circle
right at the beginning,

14
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,870
where there's then a need
to recruit new staff.

15
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,769
So if we can retain
our staff, we're

16
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,270
less likely to have to go
through the full recruitment

17
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,710
process again.

18
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,050
And this is why
it's so important.

19
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,849
In this topic, we'll
have to look really

20
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,950
about the main reasons why
people want to come to work

21
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,800
and then the main
reasons they really

22
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,339
don't want to come to work.

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,570
And that's really the key
point for every organization.

24
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,130
You want to know why
people want to come to work

25
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,600
and why they don't, and
then develop strategies

26
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,330
around that to ensure that
you're motivating people

27
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,450
to stay in your organization.

28
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,945
So let's start by looking
at some of these factors

29
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:14,470
or reasons why people
want to come to work.

30
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,410
Often it's about the
nature of the work

31
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,670
that they're undertaking.

32
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,760
So that might be related to the
type of job or the type of work

33
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,210
that they do on a
day to day basis.

34
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,509
And it is kind of linked
with our second point,

35
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,340
which is job satisfaction.

36
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,090
At the end of the
day, if employees

37
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,410
enjoy what they're doing
and the type of work

38
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,800
that they're doing, they're
more likely to stay,

39
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,720
and they're more likely to
want to come to work every day.

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,780
And that may involve having
a variety in their job role.

41
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,750
It may involve thing being
recognized and rewarded

42
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,390
for achievements
within their job role.

43
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,020
And there's a whole variety
of reasons why people feel,

44
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,320
yes, I like this job, and I do
want to come to work every day.

45
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,389
And it's really about
each organization

46
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,740
needing to identify
what those reasons are

47
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,530
and ensuring that they're
consistently providing them.

48
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,800
Job security is also something
that can't be underestimated.

49
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,220
Yes, we live in some
troubled economic times.

50
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,940
And job security is not really
something that we all have.

51
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,380
But it is really
valuable to employees.

52
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,230
So if you can provide a culture
and an organization of support

53
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,220
and really make
employees feel that they

54
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,180
do have some sense
of job security

55
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,450
and that you will support
them however plans work out,

56
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,429
I think there's a
real value in that.

57
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,300
I know a recent
example of an employee

58
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,780
with my previous employer.

59
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,810
They actually decided to make
the whole customer service team

60
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,950
reapply for their jobs because
they had too many staff

61
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,670
for the work that was available.

62
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,799
And one particular employee
actually got the job,

63
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,440
or she got her own job.

64
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,460
And then after that, she
felt this sense of-- I

65
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,454
guess-- lack of job security.

66
00:02:57,454 --> 00:02:59,870
And ultimately, even though
she was offered the job again,

67
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,180
she decided to move on
to another employer.

68
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,010
So it's quite a valuable thing.

69
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,679
Location is often cited as
a really important factor.

70
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,260
People do tend to enjoy
working close to home.

71
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,929
And it's that proximity--
and I guess and no one really

72
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,930
wants to spend two hours
a day on a train or public

73
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,780
transport going
to and from work.

74
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,070
So that's a factor.

75
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,000
Organizations can't
always help that.

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,310
But it's worth noting.

77
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,310
Now, pay and benefits-- it
really does go without saying,

78
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,790
everyone wants to feel that
they're being paid fairly

79
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,060
for the work that they do.

80
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,680
I feel I work really
hard, and I think

81
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,820
I deserve to be rewarded
for my hard work.

82
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,820
And that's fair enough.

83
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,290
It's about setting
fair pay structures

84
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,870
and having transparency in
that system of pay reviews

85
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,720
and so on.

86
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,609
And that will really
make people feel

87
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:55,030
that they are valued
in the organization.

88
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,140
And also career advancement,
and that's a critical one.

89
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,920
No one ever wants
to stay in a job

90
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,989
where they feel like
they're going nowhere.

91
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,000
And really creating
opportunities

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,030
for employees in
the organization

93
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,180
to progress through
is extremely valuable,

94
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,230
because if we feel
like we have a chance

95
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,899
to progress in our
career, we're more

96
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,925
likely to want to stay
in that particular job.

97
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:17,800
Now, let's have a look
at some of the reasons

98
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:23,170
why employees don't really want
to stay in their current job.

99
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,260
And some of these factors
may vary from one person

100
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,289
to another or one
organization to another,

101
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,980
but they're worth noting.

102
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,120
Poor relationships with managers
is the number one reason

103
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,220
many, many employees will
leave their current role.

104
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,650
And really, the best solution
to that for any organization

105
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,130
is to ensure that their managers
have sufficient training on how

106
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,440
to manage people.

107
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,210
And that's a critical skill
that not everyone has.

108
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,430
And often, it's just
a lack of training.

109
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,040
Sometimes it's a poor
organizational structure,

110
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,500
where the employee's unclear
on who they report to

111
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,120
or where their department fits.

112
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,930
And that lack of
clarity can really

113
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,850
cause frustrations
and confusion.

114
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,770
There may be poor
organizational practices

115
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,789
in terms of communication.

116
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,990
The organization is not
clear on what they want

117
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,150
or where they're heading.

118
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,429
And the employee doesn't
know where they fit.

119
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,410
Poor job satisfaction,
as we mentioned earlier,

120
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:25,180
really is a very common and is
also quite high on the list.

121
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,700
Inappropriate pay
and benefits-- again,

122
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,950
we link that to the reasons
why people want to stay.

123
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,755
If someone feels that
their pay or their salary

124
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:35,820
is not competitive with the
market for their job role,

125
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,409
they're unlikely to
stay, because they

126
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,280
know they can get paid
somewhere else more.

127
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,409
An ineffective rewards
system-- recognition and reward

128
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,850
is really critical
in any organization.

129
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,110
Everyone wants to feel
that they are valued

130
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,040
and that their work
is appreciated.

131
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,320
And having some kind of a reward
or recognition system in place

132
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,190
is critical.

133
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,490
And when we talk about a lack
of effective recognition,

134
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,230
we may not just-- here's
a bonus in your pay packet

135
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,420
because you did a great job.

136
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,070
But recognition is about
really understanding

137
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,610
that some employees have
gone beyond the expectations

138
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,510
of their job and really exceled.

139
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:20,490
And that may be through a public
recognition as in a meeting,

140
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,870
recognizing that John Smith
did very exceptionally

141
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,570
well in this particular project.

142
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,500
And that really touches
on the human component.

143
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,970
And we really need to ensure
that people feel that value.

144
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,370
So now that we've had a look
at some of these motivators,

145
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,680
I want you to get on
to the discussion forum

146
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,560
and share with us
your experiences.

147
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,650
What factors have led you
to leave a particular job,

148
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,940
and what factors
have kept you there?

149
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,660
And now this leads us to
the end of this module.

150
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,000
And I really hope that you
feel like you have a better

151
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,650
understanding of the
whole recruitment process,

152
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,539
right from identifying a need to
filling a vacancy, all the way

153
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,820
through screening
and interviewing

154
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,580
up to making a decision and
then working on some strategies

155
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,659
to retain all your
hard work in finding

156
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,920
these great employees
in the long term.

157
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,802
