00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:08,899
Hi.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,975
Welcome to module three,
learning and development

4
00:00:10,975 --> 00:00:12,610
in context.

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,139
In our last module, we looked
at the recruitment process

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,990
and how to really
attract great employees.

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,369
This module really ties
in because, once we

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,430
have these great employees,
we need to give them the tools

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,005
to enable them to do their
job the best that they can.

10
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:28,380
And that's really what training
and development is about.

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,930
So it's about enabling
the employees to have

12
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,260
the knowledge, the
competencies, the skills that

13
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,430
allow them to do their job
and to keep them happy.

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,490
So in this module,
we'll cover not only

15
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,340
the basics of learning
and development,

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,640
but we'll also look
at some of the changes

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,605
in this particular
function in HR.

18
00:00:49,605 --> 00:00:51,730
So we'll look at some of
the traditional approaches

19
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,919
to learning and development
that have historically

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,950
been used in this
area, and we'll really

21
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,370
look at where it's
heading, which

22
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:58,995
is really that
online environment.

23
00:00:58,996 --> 00:01:01,370
And we'll look at some of
these new technologies and ways

24
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,560
that we now are able to engage
and train and develop employees

25
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,370
in an organization.

26
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,250
We'll also look at the
concept of development,

27
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,650
because it is slightly
different to training,

28
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,420
and we're really
looking at how we

29
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,410
foster the growth
of our employees.

30
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,320
And we'll look at a few
different strategies and ways

31
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,059
to do that, as well as
areas like mentoring,

32
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,360
for example, which is a great
tool in developing staff,

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,950
for example.

34
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,667
We'll also look at how
we evaluate the learning

35
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:33,750
and development function
and be able to really get

36
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,150
buy-in from senior
management to make sure

37
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,060
that we have the budget and
the funds that enable us

38
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,490
to do these kind of initiatives.

39
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,770
In this topic in
particular, we'll

40
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,750
be looking at how training,
development, and learning are

41
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,390
three really different concepts.

42
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,390
And we'll look at the
differences between them,

43
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,750
and really why
training is becoming

44
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,910
so important and so critical.

45
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,229
When we think about it--
and this is often the case,

46
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,120
and it's been the case
in many organizations

47
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,600
I've worked in-- when
it's time to cut costs,

48
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
training is usually
the first place

49
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,570
that senior managers will look.

50
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,269
But it really is
a false economy,

51
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,440
because people need knowledge
to enable them to do their job.

52
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,720
And the reality is we are
in a working environment

53
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,000
where change is constant
and change is rapid.

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,800
And, with every change,
there is new knowledge

55
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,470
that's required to enable those
employees to do their job.

56
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,700
And that's really the key goal
or the key focus in training

57
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,230
or in learning-- it's enabling
people to do their job.

58
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,149
So when we think of training,
development, learning,

59
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,270
we really need to break up
what these concepts mean

60
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,960
to understand the different
activities and tasks involved.

61
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,110
Learning is really the
overarching outcome

62
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,080
of training and development.

63
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,990
Learning is what happens
because someone has undertaken

64
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,050
training or someone
has undertaken

65
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,829
some kind of
development activities.

66
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:59,120
And that's really what you
want at the end of the day--

67
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,010
you want them to have
learned something.

68
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,220
And, breaking it down
to a level of training,

69
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:09,260
training is really the
gathering of those skills,

70
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,250
knowledge, changes in
attitude, changes in behavior

71
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,220
through instruction,
through independent study,

72
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,710
through experience, and so on.

73
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:23,600
So you're building a change
within that person because

74
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,910
of this external activity,
which is what we call training.

75
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,260
And it's really looking not just
at changing people's ability

76
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,160
to do their job or
to have a competency.

77
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,420
So, for example, I'm customer
service in a call center,

78
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,780
I'm a customer service operator.

79
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,870
I need to have some particular
competencies in providing

80
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,690
good customer service
over the phone.

81
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,090
So it's beyond just, this
is the skill that you need.

82
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,380
It's also looking at
changes in behavior

83
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,079
and the way that we do
things, and the attitude

84
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,570
that we might have
to our job or how

85
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,950
to do components of our job.

86
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:01,450
So training really is a lot
broader than most people think.

87
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,980
And when we look at development
as the other end of that,

88
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,899
development is more so
a long-term activity

89
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,070
or a long-term process because,
with development, you're

90
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:14,220
trying to really foster
the growth of the employee

91
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,250
on a personal level, on a
level as their whole career

92
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,240
progresses.

93
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,290
So development is
really about growth

94
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,710
and trying to
encourage an employee

95
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,520
to improve, in a more holistic
way, their levels of knowledge

96
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,590
and skills and
attitude and so on.

97
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,400
So it's training, but on a
more, I guess, broad level,

98
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,359
and more long-term.

99
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,690
And there are a whole variety
of development activities

100
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,420
that can be undertaken
in organizations,

101
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,340
and we will look at
that in another topic.

102
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,888
But really, it's about
growth at the end of the day.

103
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:48,680
And training is really
about an acquisition

104
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,250
of some kind of
skill or knowledge.

105
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,160
And that's really
the key difference.

106
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,950
And both lead us to learning.

107
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,659
And that's the ultimate
outcome, obviously.

108
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,960
So in the next
topic, we're really

109
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,650
going to look at how training
has become so critical

110
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:08,390
and how we almost need to
sell it and be able to say,

111
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,039
well this is the value of
training, to senior managers

112
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,310
in order to get buy-in
and to get their support.

113
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,490
Like we said, it's
usually the first place

114
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,520
that people look to cut
costs, and we really

115
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,130
want to try and avoid that
and show the value in training

116
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,409
to an organization.

117
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,960
And so we'll look at
that in the next topic.

118
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,609
So I'd like you to go
to the discussion forum

119
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,510
and maybe to share
some of your ideas

120
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,420
or your experiences
on what you think

121
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,120
training and development is
or learning and development is

122
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,940
right now.

123
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,090
And then maybe we can
compare that by the time

124
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:42,729
we finish the module on what
has changed in your attitude

125
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,900
and what you think learning
and development is.

126
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,770
And this is really part
of the learning process.

127
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,272
