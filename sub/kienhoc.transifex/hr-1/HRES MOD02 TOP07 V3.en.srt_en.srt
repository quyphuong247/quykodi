00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,040
Hi.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,620
Welcome to Topic 7.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,919
In this topic we'll be looking
at processing applications.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,420
So we've placed a
job advertisement.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,020
We've done an interview.

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,070
We've gone through
the screening process.

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,990
And now we're really
trying to have a look

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,990
and establish the
data that we've

10
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,009
received from all
these different sources

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,350
and really building
a picture to help

12
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,020
us get to the next
stage, which is Topic 8

13
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,180
and actually making a decision.

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,020
So before we get
started, let's look

15
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,550
at a couple of different methods
of how candidates can respond

16
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,870
to an organization's
job advertisement.

17
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,160
So this may be now
relatively uncommon,

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,559
but one possible way is
responding in person.

19
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,720
So responding in
person is really more

20
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,220
so a tool for
organizations where

21
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,449
they need a large
number of applicants

22
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,100
to fill in quite
a number of rolls.

23
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,510
It's usually quite common in
more unskilled occupations,

24
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,670
trades, in things like--
or industries like mining

25
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,230
and so on.

26
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,220
So that's one way.

27
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,160
A very common method as well,
which again is more so utilized

28
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,479
in these unskilled mass
recruitment processes, which

29
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,690
is by telephone, again
just gaining some more

30
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,259
information about the applicant
and trying to establish

31
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,590
some level of suitability
for the position.

32
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,820
And then we have email,
which is really now

33
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,520
the most common form
or method of responding

34
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,130
to job advertisements.

35
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,570
So with email you may
send through your resume,

36
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,309
you may send through a
covering letter explaining

37
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,440
why you're suitable for
that particular job.

38
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,030
So these are really some
of the ways or avenues

39
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,750
that we get the
information we need

40
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,920
to start looking at
processing an application

41
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,780
to help us build towards
making a decision.

42
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,900
So when we look at
some of the-- I guess

43
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,580
some of the features of
a resume, which is really

44
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,210
our key tool in processing
the application essentially

45
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,229
in almost any
recruitment process,

46
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,097
we'd want to see a
resume at some stage.

47
00:02:05,097 --> 00:02:06,679
So let's have a look,
I guess, at some

48
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,160
of the key pieces of
information that we'd

49
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,100
expect to find in a resume.

50
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,840
If we look over
here, we've got some

51
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,620
of the expectations
of recruiters

52
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,010
in terms of a resume.

53
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,200
We usually want
at least some kind

54
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,000
of overview of that
candidate's employment history,

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,070
so what have they
done in the past

56
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,780
and how long they've been
in those various roles.

57
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,640
We'd also be looking at
some major achievements,

58
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,170
so more high level roles.

59
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,489
It may be things
like accomplishing

60
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,300
a particular project or
anything that really shows

61
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,830
a level of
accomplishment that may

62
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:43,520
be outside the standard skills
required for a particular job.

63
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,080
We'll also look at details
of any work-related training,

64
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,470
so whether they've
done any degrees

65
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,630
or vocational
qualifications or any sort

66
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,200
of professional activities,
for that matter, as well.

67
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,410
And we want to kind of
get an idea of where

68
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,109
their experience lies and the
qualifications that they've

69
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,370
gained to support
that experience.

70
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,460
We'll also want to
look for resumes

71
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,470
that are prepared by the
applicant themselves.

72
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,170
In some cases in the past
we've seen candidates

73
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,049
that have had their
resumes prepared

74
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,590
by a professional writer.

75
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,950
And really we try and
avoid that situation,

76
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,690
because we want a resume
to be a reflection of who

77
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,520
the candidate is.

78
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,820
We also sort of try
and stick to a maximum

79
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,230
of two A4 pages for a resume.

80
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,690
This is the ideal
length for any resume.

81
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,380
We really don't want to
know absolutely everything

82
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,519
about this job applicant.

83
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,720
We just want to get a nice
snapshot of where they've been

84
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,529
and where they would
like to be heading.

85
00:03:38,529 --> 00:03:40,570
And these are really the
key elements of a resume

86
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,000
that we're looking for to
help process that application

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,440
and support us in making
the right decision.

88
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,030
It's worth noting
that with resumes it's

89
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,940
really the candidate
volunteering

90
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,380
information for you.

91
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,150
So it's really
important to understand

92
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,210
that if at some point down the
track there's any kind of claim

93
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,650
that during the
selection process

94
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,050
they may not have
been chosen based

95
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,970
on some kind of
discriminatory grounds

96
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,710
because they added their
gender onto their resume

97
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,050
or their marital
status or whatever,

98
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,110
they've actually volunteered
that information.

99
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,880
You haven't requested it from
them in an application form,

100
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,029
for example.

101
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:21,980
So in that sense you're covered
from a legal perspective.

102
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,042
So one of the key
challenges with resumes,

103
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:26,500
and we have mentioned
this earlier,

104
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,310
is that there's quite a large
number of misrepresentations

105
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,960
or misleading
information that's often

106
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,390
included in a
candidate's resume.

107
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,900
A recent American study
actually showed that one-third

108
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,900
of candidates actually had
some serious misrepresentations

109
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:47,630
in their resume and another 8%
flat out lied in some aspects

110
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,570
of their resume .

111
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,300
So because there
is this aspect, we

112
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,720
need to be quite
careful in how we manage

113
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,960
and how we read the information
provided in the resume.

114
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,489
And the key behind
really ensuring accuracy

115
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,820
is to follow up with
some other processes

116
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,670
to try and verify the
accuracy of the information

117
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,010
in the resume.

118
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,650
So we'll just discuss
some little strategies

119
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,280
that organizations can
use to try and check

120
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,130
for the accuracy of a resume.

121
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,040
And that can be as
simple as checking

122
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,789
for conflicting details.

123
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:19,580
So they may have said
they've been employed

124
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,550
at one particular
organization, and then

125
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,060
another point, for the
same period of time,

126
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,070
mention that they've
been employed

127
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,630
at a different organization.

128
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,580
So really looking at overlapping
dates and any discrepancies

129
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,620
in dates, that's
usually an indicator

130
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,100
that something might
not be quite right.

131
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,490
We'll also look for the
order of the resume content.

132
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,400
Often candidates will
place the information

133
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,419
that they're quite proud
of or that they really

134
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,209
are confident talking about
at the beginning of a resume,

135
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:50,000
and often leave the
things that they're not

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,930
so comfortable with
towards the end.

137
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,957
And it's really looking at
those pieces of information

138
00:05:54,957 --> 00:05:57,290
and really pushing for a
little further explanation that

139
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:01,080
can help us really identify
any sort of inaccuracies

140
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,210
in the resume.

141
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:07,349
And lastly, and this is probably
one of the simplest and easiest

142
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,970
way to really verify the
accuracy of a resume,

143
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,570
is checking references.

144
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:14,659
So whether that's just a phone
call to a previous employer

145
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,790
and getting some more accurate
information that verifies

146
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,200
yes, indeed, this
particular candidate

147
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,370
had this job at this
organization at this time

148
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,560
and they did such and
such tasks, or whatever

149
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,490
it is that was their
skill set at the time,

150
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,930
and also ensuring that that
organization actually exists.

151
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,180
In many cases,
candidates have created

152
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,580
fictitious organizations just
to build up some experience

153
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,780
into their resume.

154
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,909
We'll also look at a
way that we can try

155
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,080
and, I guess, gather
some more verification

156
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,789
during an interview
to help support

157
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,130
the accuracy of the resume.

158
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,930
And that may be asking for
copies of qualifications,

159
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,700
so if they say, I have
a bachelor of business,

160
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,400
requesting copies or certified
copies of their degree.

161
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,479
And it may also be
looking at asking them

162
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,140
questions about why they've
left their previous job.

163
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,440
That can give us
some more insight.

164
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,969
And also looking at the
small details in their resume

165
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,860
and really questioning
them on those.

166
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,220
They're often the ones where
there's the greatest inaccuracy

167
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,630
So in next topic we'll be
looking at how we actually

168
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,430
make that decision, and it
will really build to the point

169
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,400
where we now know yes, we
have the right candidate

170
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,919
and we may want to
offer them a job.

171
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,636
