00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:37,100
Hi everybody. My name is Justin Stoney. I'm the founder of New York Vocal Coaching here in New York City.

4
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:40,809
Welcome to Episode 9 of Voice Lessons to the World. The show we want to help you

5
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:43,899
guys as singers by answering your
questions from all over the world.

6
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:47,199
I'll give you a chance to ask questions
later, but first we've got our question for

7
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:53,350
the week from Amanda B. in Houston, Texas.
And Amanda says, "Dear Justin,

8
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,589
I'd love to sing but I've always been
told I'm tone deaf.

9
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,570
Is there any hope for me?" Well Amanda,

10
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:06,369
thank you for that question. I'm glad you
asked that question and I think probably

11
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:09,610
a lot of people out there would love to
know the answer to this question.

12
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:15,729
There's so much mythology surrounding
tone deafness and so many people think

13
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:20,229
that their tone deaf and it's preventing
a lot of potential singers and people

14
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:25,200
that love to sing, just like yourself,
from singing because they think they're tone deaf.

15
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,340
So the first thing I'll talk about is, is
tone deafness real?

16
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,990
And the answer to that is, yes. Tone
deafness is actually real.

17
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,970
There is a condition, it's called, "amusia," which means not musical.

18
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:47,200
It's a cognitive disorder, though. It's 
caused by brain damage sometimes it can be genetic.

19
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:53,710
But sometimes it can be caused by a
brain injury. But this is so rare and the

20
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,110
amount of people that say, "oh I'm tone
deaf...

21
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,619
oh I can't sing... oh no don't ask me to
sing I'm tone deaf..."

22
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:04,180
the amount of people that say that, is
very high. But the amount of people who

23
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:11,170
are actually tone-deaf, is very low. So in
my experience - I've worked with

24
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:16,300
thousands of singers, and I've been in
voice land all my life.

25
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,920
I have literally never met a
person who is actually tone deaf.

26
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,489
I've had plenty of singers come to me
thinking that they were tone-deaf, but

27
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:26,290
I've never ever seen it.

28
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,819
So why are all these singers and
probably yourself included, I can't

29
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:34,060
guarantee it but i imagine that you're
actually one of these singers who is

30
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,989
quote/unquote tone deaf and not actually
tone deaf,

31
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:41,480
why? Why are all these singers thinking
that they're tone deaf?

32
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,659
My thoughts on this is that it's
actually due to something in the mind,

33
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:50,299
and then something in the mechanics

34
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:56,090
oftentimes when people are young, they
have a joy for singing and they just

35
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:01,010
sing very naturally. But so many people
report at some point being told,

36
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,040
"Well you can't sing. You're off pitch.

37
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,980
Oh you should stop singing. Uh why don't
you quiet that down..." And they start to

38
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,819
develop a fear. And singing is a very
vulnerable thing anyway.

39
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,800
So if you've been told that you're off
pitch, you've been told that you sound bad,

40
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:20,569
then you start to have fear and
hesitation built into the voice.

41
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:28,200
This fear and this hesitation causes you to under do the sound, and that often causes you to be flat.

42
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:34,489
So then, your experience with singing, is
trying really hard and being flat, and

43
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:37,519
then being told you're wrong, and then
trying really hard being flat being told

44
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,280
you wrong - and a vicious cycle starts,
where the mechanics start to respond to

45
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,000
the mind, and the hesitation and the fear
and the mechanics all get wrapped up into one.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,109
So your voice starts to behave
as though its tone deaf.

47
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:56,900
It starts to behave where it can't
actually stay on pitch. But it's not that you can't hear it.

48
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,319
Most people can hear just fine.

49
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,340
They have a great ear for music, they
would stay on pitch, but they're just too

50
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,500
afraid, they're too hesitant from
something in the past, to actually stay on pitch.

51
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,750
Amanda, I'm thinking that that's probably
you, because that's most people.

52
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:21,139
So now what do we do to fix it? If we
know that it's due to the mind, the very

53
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:27,000
first thing we need to tell ourselves is,
"This is in my mind. This is not an actual problem.

54
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,940
I don't have an ear problem. But I might
have a vocal problem."

55
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:37,500
what that problem is, is probably hesitation. So the very first thing I'd have you do,

56
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:43,039
is just at home, when nobody's around - don't
let anybody judge you - go ahead and just

57
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:49,820
sing out, but sing bold. Don't sing
hesitatingly, sing bold. And sing any song

58
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,580
that you love to sing.

59
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:58,090
And I tell you what, if you can sing,
"three blind mice," just that, I pretty much

60
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,840
guarantee you you're not tone-deaf.
Somebody that's tone-deaf, that truly

61
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,180
with tone deafness would try to sing,

62
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:09,939
"three blind mice" and it would come out,
"three blind mice" and you say, "no no no,

63
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:16,900
three blind mice," and you get "three blind
mice," and they don't actually distinguish pitch.

64
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,300
If you can delineate different
pitches just singing any of your favorite songs,

65
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,700
probably are not tone deaf. So that's
step one to just determine whether you are.

66
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,969
Then the next thing, if you can, get
with a great voice teacher, because from

67
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:37,100
the under singing you might not have
developed your head voice, which is this sound.

68
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,449
Or you might not have developed
your chest voice, which is this sound.

69
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:45,900
We'll talk about that in later videos.
And there might be a registration problem.

70
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,719
So get with an instructor that
can help you to use the mechanics better,

71
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:56,600
so that you can stay on pitch, after you
know how to be a little bit bold with your singing.

72
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,990
Then another step would be,
if you can't get with a voice teacher,

73
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,900
is if you can just find a piano, or
something online that has a piano feature,

74
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,879
and just give yourself any note
on the piano, you can pick a "C."

75
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,740
And just try on a "me me me," try finding this note.

76
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,490
"me me me"

77
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:25,770
Now maybe if you've had problems you
might try it and you have, "me me me

78
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:29,340
me me me" or "me me me me me me."

79
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,449
But you're alone. You're at home. Nobody
cares. Mess with it.

80
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:37,680
Do you hear it, "me me me me me me me,"

81
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:43,830
and you get it to match up with the pitch.
Practice that and you'll very quickly

82
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:50,190
train your voice to match your ear again,
because again it's probably not your ear,

83
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:56,000
it's your brain and your mechanics
functioning together in a way that we don't want.

84
00:06:56,009 --> 00:07:03,090
So Amanda, and all I just want you to
know the tone deafness is so rare.

85
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,229
Probably you don't have this, so if you
can get that out of your head and just

86
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:11,250
be inspired to try to sing, know that the
voice can be trained.

87
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,729
That's why voice teachers have jobs
we're not running a racket here

88
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:18,800
you really actually can learn how to
sing and you can break through tone deafness.

89
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,020
Unless it's that medical condition that
I say is extremely rare.

90
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:27,180
So I hope that inspires you to try
singing and to try to break through the

91
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,800
tone deafness that you probably don't
have. So I hope that's been helpful for you guys today.

92
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,100
If you have questions that you'd like to
see us answer on the show you can send an email to:

93
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,210
questions@voicelessonstotheworld.com.

94
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:45,400
So like I say, I hope that that inspires you
guys to just not lose the joy, not lose the passion,

95
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:49,000
don't let people tell you you're tone
deaf, don't let them tell you you can't sing,

96
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,380
because as we know that leads to
that vicious cycle and

97
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,940
you know that it's not true. So hoping to
get with a great voice teacher in your area.
