00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,290
Welcome to the very first episode of
Voice Lessons to

5
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,640
the World. This is a show where we want to help you as singers

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,700

you have the most information possible

00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,460
about vocal technique and how you can
improve. Whether you're a beginner

8
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,500
or professional singer, whether you're
preparing for auditions

9
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,870
or for a performance, We want you to have the best information.

10
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,140
I'll give you a chance later to send us
some questions, but we

11
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,009
want to help you to improve your vocal
technique and accomplish your goals as

12
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:06,670
singers.

13
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,880
So our very first episode is called "Four
Breathing Types".

14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,410
Today I'm going to talk to you about four
breathing types that you see in life

15
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,050
and you also see in singers. So the
very first one

16
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:22,229
is a high breath or a clavicular breath. So go ahead and take a deep

17
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:23,160
breath for me,

18
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,410
and exhale.

19
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:30,280
Now with a high breath you're gonna see
the clavicle

20
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,479
and the upper body lift - on the inhale and then 
exhale -

21
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,950
it comes down, try that one more time
inhale -

22
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,860
and exhale. Now you see this breath a lot

23
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,930
in life and sometimes in singers, but
it's actually not a breath that I would

24
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,729
recommend

25
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:50,820
because its going to really expel the air

26
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,770
fast and hard what comes up (inhales) must come
down (exhales)

27
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,710
and you don't have a lot of control and then
the larynx has to deal with all that

28
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,080
excessive airflow.

29
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,750
So there's another breath:  the abdominal
or belly breath

30
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,640
that you can use. Try this, hand on belly -
inhale -

31
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,869
you feel an expansion - exhale -

32
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:14,150
it comes in. Try it again. Inhale -

33
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,079
expand and exhale - it comes in.

34
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:22,829
And one more time (don't lift the chest) -
inhale - and exhale

35
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:26,950
it comes in. Now this is a breath that I
recommend

36
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,579
because the depth of that breath is going to 
allow the diaphragm to contract

37
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:35,620
more. And it's also going to give you
greater control over your exhale.

38
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,739
Another breath that I recommend is the
rib or intercostal breath.

39
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:44,150
So put your hands on your rib cage right
here and try and inhale -

40
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:49,019
you'll feel an expansion - exhale - it comes
in.

41
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:53,459
Try that again inhale expand - exhale it
comes in -

42
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,060
and we'll do it one more time. Try not to lift the chest.

43
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,769
And inhale - exhale it comes in.

44
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:05,590
So this is another breath that gives you a lot
of control from the lower body for your

45
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,209
singing.

46
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,090
What I actually recommend though is a
combination of both your rib breath

47
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,120
and your low breath. So go ahead, one hand on your ribs

48
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,669
one hand on belly - let's see if you can
open both of these.

49
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:22,769
Inhale expand them - and then on your
exhale just your lower abs will come in.

50
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:27,430
Make sure that your upper abs don't
squeeze when you sing.

51
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,540
Inhale - and exhale just your lower abs
come

52
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,100
in. That's going to give you the optimal
situation for breath support

53
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,100
and the best efficiency for yourself as
a singer. There are singers

54
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,120
for sure that breath up here and really
good ones too,

55
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,079
but the most efficient breath is going
to be a lower breath

56
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:49,100
that comes from the low abs especially.

57
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,549
I'm going to throw one more thing in there for
ya. This is a back

58
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:56,910
breath. Go ahead and put your hands on
your low back and inhale.

59
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,470
You'll feel an expansion back there - and exhale -

60
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,970
you might feel a contraction. This one's
smaller

61
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,060
but you're gonna feel it. Inhale back - 
and

62
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,709
exhale. This is another good way of bringing
the air

63
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:16,019
in a deeper sensation in the body, okay.

64
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,600
So those are for breathing systems that
you see. I recommend the lower breaths.

65
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,080
And I hope that this is helpful for you guys as singers. So
