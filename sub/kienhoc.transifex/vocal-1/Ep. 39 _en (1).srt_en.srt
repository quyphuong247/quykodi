1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
yeah

2
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,600
yeah

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,710
Hi everybody! My name is Justin Stoney and
I'm the founder of New York Vocal

4
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,240
Coaching here in New York City.

5
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,959
Welcome to episode 39 of Voice Lessons
to the World, the show we want to help

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,080
you guys as singers by answering your
questions from all over and I'll give

7
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:32,409
you a chance to ask questions later but
a question for this week comes from

8
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:39,759
Donna H. in Atlanta, Georgia and Donna
writes "Dear Justin, I go to a performing

9
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:44,649
arts high school and my voice teacher
says I don't have what it takes to be a

10
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:46,329
good singer.

11
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:49,689
I'm so discouraged I feel like giving up

12
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:53,439
I always thought I had a good voice but
I guess I'm wrong

13
00:00:53,948 --> 00:00:57,128
Wow

14
00:00:57,128 --> 00:01:04,658
Well Donna here's what I have to say. I'm
sorry. I'm sorry your voice teacher said

15
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:15,790
that and to anybody out there who had an
abusive voice teacher. Person who was

16
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:16,690
negative,

17
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:20,019
doesn't matter if it was a friend, family
member,

18
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:23,349
somebody told you you can't sing,
somebody that told you you shouldn't

19
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:24,188
sing,

20
00:01:24,188 --> 00:01:28,059
somebody said it's not a good idea for
you to sing, that you just don't have

21
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,700
what it takes but you're just not good
enough.

22
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:39,939
I'm sorry. The voice is something that is
inside you.

23
00:01:39,938 --> 00:01:43,209
I'm sure, Donna, you know this, you have to
say,

24
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:48,368
you must sing. And so, for somebody to
tell you that you're never going to be

25
00:01:48,368 --> 00:01:49,509
any good at it,

26
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:54,159
I can just tell you it's flat out wrong.
Not only is it incorrectly wrong but it's

27
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,560
also wrong to stifle somebody's gift
like that and so let me tell you, Donna

28
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:05,228
you can sing and you must sing and you
will be a good singer.

29
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:11,830
The voice needs a positive environment
to grow. This is whether you're in your

30
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,120
own practice space,

31
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,450
it's got to feel positive. Whether it's
in your own home,

32
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:19,750
it's gotta feel positive but definitely
definitely definitely

33
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,810
if you're in the voice studio

34
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,170
with a voice teacher and it's not
positive,

35
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:29,189
you know you're in the wrong place. You
need people that are behind you,

36
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:33,840
people that are going to value you and
your singing and the biggest reason why

37
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:41,969
is the voice is not just your muscular
instrument but it's also you.

38
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,098
You go and learn how to play the piano
and a negative environment that would be

39
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:50,488
the best but you could do it, you could
have somebody saying "No, that's not,

40
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:53,430
that's not good, that's wrong" and you
could still learn how to play the piano

41
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,290
but the voice is you.

42
00:02:55,289 --> 00:03:00,239
The voice is not just an instrument, is
not just your muscle but it's also your

43
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,280
mind and your spirit.

44
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,539
So if you're crushed down in your mind,
Donna and all, you're crushed down in your

45
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:07,439
spirit,

46
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,159
there's no way your voice can really
show up. It's always going to be tight.

47
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,009
It's always going to be hesitant. It's
always going to become, it's always going

48
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:17,909
to come out and be judged. And so we
can't have that, we can't have a negative

49
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:21,539
environment and any good voice teacher
knows that.

50
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:25,139
So if your voice teacher said that to
you, honestly I'd encourage you to find a

51
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:28,828
different situation because you need
people that are behind you one hundred

52
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:33,959
percent. So I'm behind you one hundred
percent, Donna. I encourage it on that.

53
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,530
Now let's talk about why you're going to
be a good singer.

54
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,530
The voice is muscular coordination.

55
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,639
If I wanted to be a great athlete,

56
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:50,310
then I would start going to the gym. I
would work out every day and I would

57
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,670
train the muscles that I need to train. I
would eat the right diet.

58
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:57,328
I would get enough sleep and I would hit
the gym a certain amount of times and I

59
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:59,849
would listen to my personal trainer and
I would do it right

60
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:03,509
so I get strong. The voice is no
different than that. It''s a series of

61
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:08,068
muscle coordination on the inside of the
larynx as well as the breathing.

62
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:11,219
If I want to get my voice in great shape,

63
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:16,500
I absolutely can. Anybody can train these
muscles if they're willing and if they're

64
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,478
disciplined. Anybody can do that.

65
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,810
So Donna you can do that and everybody,

66
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:27,509
you can do that. Now I will admit this.
There's a thing about talent vs

67
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:28,769
discipline.

68
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:32,609
There are really some singers who are
just sort of naturally great athletes,

69
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,060
the kind of people who

70
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,389
if you were just walking down the street
and you saw somebody they look in great

71
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:39,819
shape and you say "Hey you must work out,
right."

72
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:45,219
The person says "No, I never work out at
all." That's just a natural athlete. That

73
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,850
person hit the gym, they get super strong
but just in life

74
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,629
they're pretty athletic. There are some
singers who are just pretty athletic.

75
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:53,860
Right,

76
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,580
didn't even take a lot of voice lessons,
nothing like that, they just pretty good

77
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:58,870
singers naturally.

78
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,340
That's a lot of talent. There's other
singers and other athletes who maybe

79
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:05,168
weren't so natural

80
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:08,889
but they wanted to work for it really
hard. They wanted to train their muscles

81
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:12,430
and they wanted to do everything that
they could do to be the best that they

82
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:19,360
can be. This kind of person has the
potential to be as good and as a

83
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,259
athletic vocally as just about anyone.

84
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:26,860
So you don't want to have any natural
limitations standing in your way.

85
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,389
Actually I want that to inspire you to go
even further with your discipline and you're

86
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:34,000
really work on it. Now again you're not
gonna be able to do that in a negative

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,439
environment but you get into positive
environment and you work really hard on

88
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,629
your vocal muscles,

89
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:43,899
you will in time get to be a very good
singer.

90
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:49,389
Now I also want to mention, I mentioned
this in the past that not every singer

91
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:55,149
needs to sound perfectly pristine in
order to be a great singer right. There

92
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:58,089
are a lot of voices that we admire so so
much

93
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:03,668
when the singer has some uniqueness,
has some character to their voice.

94
00:06:03,668 --> 00:06:07,538
What we really care about is an
instrument that's coming from the heart

95
00:06:07,538 --> 00:06:12,069
and soul that is expressing something
that's unique about the person. You're

96
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:14,800
getting crushed down because people are
telling you that you're not good,

97
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,850
you can't sing, you shouldn't sing, you'd
better quit then there's no way that

98
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,439
uniqueness can come out.

99
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:25,089
So whether or not the actual voice is
pristine, we need to have, you know, we

100
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:29,259
need your voice to come out even if it's
got some flaws right now.

101
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:33,250
That doesn't matter, that's not what we
really love. At the end of the day, we

102
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,509
love you.

103
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:39,788
Now I will finally mention, Donna and all
that

104
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,720
you must sing.

105
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:50,010
All right, there's no lukewarm reactions
to singing. You ask somebody,

106
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,550
"Well do you sing? are you a singer? do you
like to sing?"

107
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,329
You're either going to get this reaction
"Oh yeah, sure, I'm gonna sing around, I

108
00:06:57,329 --> 00:07:01,199
take voice lessons and I love it and you
know I love, I enjoy singing" or "Oh no,

109
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,849
please no, don't make me sing.

110
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:08,189
I can't sing." The reason why that is is
because singing is just so native to who

111
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:09,060
we are.

112
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,670
Everybody somewhere deep inside wants to
sing but maybe they were told that they

113
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:18,240
can't, maybe they were told that they
shouldn't but they're wanting to sing

114
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,490
somewhere even if they're terrified.

115
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,480
So we can't stifle this gift that's been
given. We can't block this down even if

116
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,860
other people try to do it.

117
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:32,069
We can't block it down, we can't use a
negative language against our own gift.

118
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:36,599
So since it's so personal, since it's so
from the soul,

119
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,040
you know, when somebody's trying to
discourage you but that's just not right.

120
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,890
So,Donna and all, you do have what it
takes to be a good singer and I know

121
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:50,430
this isn't such a technical lesson but I
think it's a really important thing to

122
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:57,990
say because I can't tell you how many
people lost their chance because they

123
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,819
listen to somebody else.

124
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:04,319
They lost their chance to give the world
or just give the people in their life

125
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,129
their gift of singing because of what
somebody else has said that. So many

126
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:12,029
people come through the studio with an
abusive voice teacher, a negative voice

127
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:13,589
teacher with friends, family,

128
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:17,129
somebody telling them they can't,
somebody telling me that they shouldn't.

129
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,519
And how many times have I seen them turn
that voice around and come up with

130
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,439
something absolutely stunning.

131
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:28,439
I can't even count it. So, Donna and all, I
want you guys to be one of those people

132
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,279
who does not listen
to the negative messages, pushes right

133
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,879
through that, does the work and ends up
being the singer that they wanted to be.

134
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:39,029
So I hope that's been helpful for you guys
today as singers.

135

138
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:52,309
passion. Get with a great voice teacher
who's going to

139
00:08:52,309 --> 00:08:56,059
stand behind you, who's going to believe
in you, not somebody who's gonna knock

140

you down and tell you that you can't do
it. You guys in the New York city area,
