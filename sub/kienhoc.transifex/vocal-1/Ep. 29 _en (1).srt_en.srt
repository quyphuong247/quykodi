1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
yeah

2
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:15,419
yeah

3
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:20,160
Hi everybody My name is Justin Stoney and
I'm the founder of New York Vocal

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,629
Coaching here in New York City

5
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:25,528
Welcome to episode 29 of Voice Lessons to the
World, the show where we want to help you

6
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:28,500
guys as singers by answering your
questions from all over. I'll give you a

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,939
chance to ask questions later

8
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:36,270
but a question for this week comes from
Samantha T. in Dayton, Ohio and Samantha

9
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,949
writes "Dear Justin,

10
00:00:37,948 --> 00:00:43,320
how long should I practice? It's a simple
and awesome question, Samantha and I

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,710
think actually a lot of people want to
know the answer to that because

12
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,370
everybody wants to be a great singer and
hopefully everybody wants to practice

13
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:54,448
but sometimes we just don't know as
singers

14
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:58,259
how much is a good amount to practice so
we're going to talk about that today.

15
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:02,939
We're going to give you some ideas but
first I'd like to start with quantity

16
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:06,478
because that's really what you're asking
is how much.

17
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:14,728
And first of all I want to compare
singing to working out at the gym.

18
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:18,719
It's a little bit different than 
practicing the piano.

19
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,950
I could sit down as a pianist and
practice for eight hours a day.

20
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:27,899
I probably be getting very advanced very
quickly if I did that but that's

21
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:31,739
absolutely appropriate and a lot of
professional pianist will put in that

22
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:38,699
kind of time but professional singers
absolutely cannot. You cannot ask your

23
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:46,439
voice to do very very long bouts of
singing. Opera singers can sometimes sing

24
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:51,059
for, you know, three or four hours but
then they take a few days off after a

25
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,859
performance like that.

26
00:01:52,858 --> 00:02:00,478
Broadway singers are amazing at singing
eight shows a week, maybe an hour too. Very

27
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:08,610
very athletic singers that can do that
much even some rock tours.

28
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,210
They are singing night in and night out but
in general the voice cannot withstand

29
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:17,310
long durations of usage day in day out.

30
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:22,349
So if you're practicing for three
hours a day.

31
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:25,949
That's not going to work out. You will
tire your voice. It doesn't matter how

32
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:26,969
good your technique

33
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:30,840
is. If you're practicing for really long
durations all the time,

34
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,259
you will hurt your voice even
with the best of technique.

35
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:38,219
It's a myth that good technique can just
serve you all the time.

36
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:42,389
Perfect technique,you will get tired
just like if i go to the gym and I work

37
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:47,429
out for a half an hour, an hour maybe, I'm
getting pretty tired. If I just push it

38
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,870
for three hours that it's actually
probably going to overtrain my muscles

39
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,509
and they'll actually deteriorate from
over-training. The voice muscle,

40
00:02:57,509 --> 00:03:03,090
it really is physical training for the
larynx, the larynx muscles and muscles of

41
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,430
the body as well. So just like you can over
train, you can over practice so we need to

42
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,800
know that about our voice work
is. When we're practicing, it's a physical

43
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,939
event.

44
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:21,030
You can't just do really long practices
and not intelligent practices either. We

45
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,939
would have a really good strategy for
our vocal practice.

46
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:28,079
Now as far as the length and the amount.

47
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,350
First of all this is going to depend on
your skill level.

48
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,810
How long you've been singing and it also
depends on the person.

49
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,430
Some people just have different vocal
builds so the amount of practicing that

50
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,890
you do will vary from person to person,

51
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:49,919
maybe style to style but certainly level
to level. So you want to be aware of your

52
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,458
own instruments you can make smart
choices about your practicing.

53
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,349
Let me just give you some practical
examples about what I would think would

54
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:03,030
be an appropriate amount of practicing
to do. If I have a week

55
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:08,729
I would say the average person who's
trying to really work hard at their

56
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:09,449
voice,

57
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:15,329
if you could practice anywhere from a
half hour to an hour and a half,

58
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,410
about four to six days per week that
would be excellent.

59
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,990
So maybe for you that looks
like a four hours and a half practices

60
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,889
per week

61
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:31,800
or maybe six half hours practices or 6 and 
45 minute practices or maybe you want to

62
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,110
do an hour here an hour and a half there,
30 minutes there but that's very similar

63
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,819
to how I work out. I go to the gym for
about those amounts of time.

64
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:44,819
That's going to help my muscles to grow.
I need to make sure I'm taking a day off.

65
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:49,680
I need to make sure that I'm doing
different things and I just need to make

66
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,990
sure that I'm not going too long just
enough to make sure that you used your

67
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:00,150
voice in whatever way you're working on
and you develop those skills and then

68
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:00,989
you're done.

69
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,228
You don't want to push it to the point
where you're horse, you are losing your

70
00:05:04,228 --> 00:05:08,278
voice, when you feel very airy, when you
feel like you're straining something or

71
00:05:08,278 --> 00:05:11,610
hurting something. If you feel like
you're getting tired you are

72
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,990
if it sounds like you're getting tired
you are. So don't just keep pushing,

73
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,908
thinking that that's going to build
vocal muscles or build your strength

74
00:05:20,908 --> 00:05:24,120
over time. You will find the time when you've
gone too far.

75
00:05:24,778 --> 00:05:29,788
It's ok to stop and again you want to
have quantities that makes sense.

76
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:33,538
Like I say somewhere between a half hour
and probably an hour and a half.

77
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:38,158
Now if there's a day that you practice
for two hours, two and a half hours, three

78
00:05:38,158 --> 00:05:39,060
hours.

79
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,528
That's a lot, that's okay it's not wrong
but just make sure you're not doing that

80
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:48,000
every day, day in day out. That's going to
be too much practicing, you're going to

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,709
wear out your voice doing that.

82
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:55,799
So be real smart with your length of
practice and kind of keep it in those

83
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,408
reasonable areas. If you stay consistent,

84
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:01,528
that is what is going to make the
difference over time.

85
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,528
Now the other thing is quality.

86
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:10,259
Samantha and all, I want your quality of
practice to be much more important than

87
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:15,750
your quantity because so many singers
work really hard at their voice but

88
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,129
they're not getting anywhere

89
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:20,490
not because of the amount, not because of
the length but because of the quality of

90
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,509
the practice.

91
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:25,468
They are either not sure what to
practice or they're not being really

92
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,139
responsible with what they're practicing.

93
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,500
Okay I'll give you some examples of that.

94
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,000
First of all, you know, like I say a lot,
people want high notes and they just

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,350
sit around all day

96
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,800
blasting out high notes, hoping that
they'll happen. That's not a smart way to

97
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,689
practice. The other thing is it's really
really fun to sing songs and so some

98
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:48,649
people say "I don't want to do my vocal
exercises. That's, you know, that's kind of

99
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:53,629
boring." and maybe it is sometimes but if
you're just singing songs all day, every

100
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:54,230
day,

101
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:59,300
yeah you'll get better but you're not
going to really refine your instrument.

102
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,530
You need the right vocal exercises in
order to pinpoint specifics of your

103
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:06,949
technique that a song may or may not hit.

104
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:12,680
So when you're practicing doesn't have
to be every day but you want to make

105
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,329
sure that some days you're doing vocal
exercises, working on specifics of your

106
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:21,949
vocal technique, other days you're
working on songs, other days you're

107
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:26,750
working on both and trying to apply the
technique that you're working on with

108
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:32,120
your exercises to songs and just keeping
it really varied. Just like at the gym

109
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,439
you wouldn't just lift the same muscle
group all the time. You might want to run

110
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,279
one day, you might want to lift weights
the next day, you might want to swim the

111
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,000
next day.

112
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,370
Keep it varied. Give yourself a lot of
variety. Now vocal variety is important

113
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,220
too when you practice if you're open to
it.

114
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,300
I recommend doing a lot of styles. If
you're a rock singer, be open to doing

115
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:59,418
some classical songs, some Broadway songs
and vice versa. If you are a more

116
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:03,978
traditional singer, try some pop songs,
try some R&B songs, it really will give

117
00:08:03,978 --> 00:08:06,228
your instrument a lot more variety.

118
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:09,829
Also make sure that you're trying
different artists. You might have some

119
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:12,228
favorites but break out of your comfort
zone.

120
00:08:12,228 --> 00:08:16,819
The more artists you try, the more sounds
and styles that you're going to become

121
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:20,540
confident with. Also you want to make
sure that you're singing in the right

122
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,050
key.

123
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,759
We've talked about this in the past.
Don't be afraid to move the key to suit

124
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,259
what it is you're working on.

125
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:31,399
It's too high for you or too low for you
and you just keep practicing that every

126
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,120
day.

127
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:38,690
Of course, that will cause limitations to
your voice over time and then make sure

128
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,159
that you're finding a

129
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:46,068
great space to practice. A lot of times
people are worried about their neighbors.

130
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:49,519
They are worried about what their parents
think or what,

131
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,929
you know, what their family thinks and so
they practice you know really soft and

132
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:55,818
sort of off the voice.

133
00:08:55,818 --> 00:09:00,378
You need to get in a place where you can
really let the instrument be what it is,

134
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:02,389
a place where you're not shy,

135
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:07,879
a place where you can just sing freely
and without inhibitions to make sure

136
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:13,278
you've got a great practice space. Then,
my ultimate recommendation for a quality

137
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,568
practice even if you're not a pianist or
an instrumentalist is to have an

138
00:09:17,568 --> 00:09:18,409
instrument.

139
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:22,789
You could just play one note on the
piano and then move the notes up and

140
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:26,629
down to practice your vocal exercises.
That's the way I would recommend

141
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:31,370
practicing so that you can be in real
time. You can say I got this one right.

142
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,419
I'm moving on ... oh, I didn't get this one,
let me stay here for a second.

143
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:40,278
It's great if you can practice with a
live instrument your exercises. Again

144
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:44,509
even if you don't play, if you do play
the instrument, great but I would

145
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:47,810
recommend even non-pianist get a little
keyboard,

146
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:51,289
maybe a little app for your phone or
something like that they can give you

147
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:54,438
the notes so you can practice in real
time.

148
00:09:54,438 --> 00:09:58,338
Another good thing is to get with a
great voice teacher and make sure that

149
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:03,980
you record the lessons from that teacher,
record at the exercises that they gave

150
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,550
you.

151
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:08,000
If you want to sing along to the
exercises that's a really start smart

152
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,500
strategy or maybe you can remember what
exercises they gave you and then

153
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,759
practice at the piano also a really good
strategy and then finally you can

154
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:20,568
practice along with these videos if you
remember some of these exercises that

155
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:21,528
I've given you.

156
00:10:21,528 --> 00:10:26,360
You can practice along with me or any
other exercises from teachers that you

157
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,220
like that help you.

158
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,620
You can practice along with those but
again I recommend doing it yourself with

159
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,289
an instrument if that's at all possible.

160
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:41,058
So those are some tips for making your
practice really quality. Again you could

161
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,948
practice shorter length,

162
00:10:42,948 --> 00:10:49,549
you could really only go honestly 20 or
30 minutes a day, six days a week and if

163
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:51,198
you're doing quality practice,

164
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:51,528
you're going to

165
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:56,480
get better really fast. You could
practice an hour and a half a day and be

166
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,589
slamming stuff and be singing every song
in the book and really actually setting

167
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:04,819
yourself back. So just make sure that
your practicing is really smart and

168
00:11:04,818 --> 00:11:08,808
you know what it is you're focusing on
and work on that.

169
00:11:08,808 --> 00:11:14,929
And finally I want you guys to not
practice haphazardly. That's another

170
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:19,278
tendency that I see of singers is, you
know,

171
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:24,019
"Well, I feel like singing now so I'm just
going to sing for, you know, an hour and

172
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:26,959
I'm in the shower now I'm going to sing,
I'm in my car now I'm going to sing" and

173
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:27,888
that's all fine.

174
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:32,389
It doesn't really harm you to do that
but if you can get on a real practice

175
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:35,329
plan that's going to be much better for.
you

176
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:40,308
You want to schedule it, put it down in
your planner, say "every day at five

177
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:44,179
o'clock, that's my practice time". If you
can be consistent and make it a

178
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:48,979
discipline to practice and not just
sporadic, you're also going to really

179
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,438
help yourself because going to stay
consistent,

180
00:11:51,438 --> 00:11:54,469
you're going to train those muscles. It's
like going to the gym, like I said, if you

181
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:58,009
go every single morning, you're going to
see those results. If you kind of just

182
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:01,970
play a sport when your friends are
playing or run up and down the downstairs

183
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,990
sometimes you might be in
decent shape but you're not going to be

184
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:10,730
in pinpoint top shape that you need to
be. The same thing with the voice.

185
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,180
You need to keep your practice
consistent so make yourself a plan, make

186
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:15,708
yourself a schedule.

187
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:19,849
There are things that can help you stay
consistent, like I say, a teacher can help

188
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,620
you develop a practice plan,

189
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,879
tell you what exercises you need to be
doing to work on your voice and give you

190
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,490
that routine to constantly be doing.

191
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:32,750
You could also practice with a friend.
Get a friend and say "we're

192
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:37,698
going to practice every day" and keep
each other sort of accountable and check

193
00:12:37,698 --> 00:12:40,789
in with each other, set some vocal goals
for yourself.

194
00:12:40,789 --> 00:12:44,778
That's another good strategy for making
sure you stay consistent then finally a

195
00:12:44,778 --> 00:12:47,778
really important one would be keeping a
journal.

196
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:54,170
If you either record you like a
recording journal or written journal

197
00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:58,759
that talks about each day when you
practice, what exercises did I do, what

198
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,120
songs did I working on,

199
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,980
what feels right, what doesn't feel right,
what did I accomplish, what do I want to

200
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,879
accomplish.

201
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:09,960
You're really really intentional about
your practicing. You're going to see huge

202
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,100
results.

203
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,360
So to recap, make your practicing on
purpose.

204
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:19,799
Make sure you're practicing is really
quality.

205
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:24,990
You're focused on exact things that
you need to be growing with your voice.

206
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,778
Get with a teacher if you don't know
what those things are

207
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:32,939
and then make sure the quantity is in
line with what your body can handle so

208
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:38,880
that you're not pushing things but you
also have a good routine for growth. So

209
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,778
Samantha and all I hope that gives you
some more strategies on how you can

210
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:46,588
really focus your practice and make it
really really excellent for your vocal

211
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:47,580
growth.

212
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,639
I hope that's been helpful for you guys
