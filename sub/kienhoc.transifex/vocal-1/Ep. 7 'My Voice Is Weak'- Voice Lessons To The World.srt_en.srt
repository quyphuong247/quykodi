Hi everybody.

4
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,559
My name is Justin Stoney and I'm the
founder of New York Vocal Coaching here

5
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:38,480
in New York City.

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,680
Welcome to Episode 7 of  Voice Lessons
to the World. A show where we wanna help you guys

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,329
as singers by answering your questions
from all over the world.

8
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:48,780
We're going to give you a chance to ask questions
later, but our question from the week

9
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,070
comes from Mary S. in Galway, Ireland.

10
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,230
And Mary says, "Dear Justin, I'm

11
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,739
a new singer. I'm a beginner. And my voice
is very weak.

12
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:03,920
What can I do to strengthen it?" Well
Mary, first of all,

13
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,409
welcome to singing. It's great to hear
that your new singer and a beginner. But

14
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:11,500
we know that you're going to strengthen your voice and work really hard at it.

15
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,700
And encourage you just to keep going. But one of
the things that I find with brand new singers,

16
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,220
one of tendencies is this sort of
weakness that you're talking about.

17
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,070
And I can do a lot of videos in the
future about different ways to

18
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,130
strengthen the voice cuz there's
actually a lot.

19
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,570
But one of the very first things that people
start off with is breathiness.

20
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,860
And I betcha', Mary, that that's what's
going on in your voice. I bet that it's a

21
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,080
little bit breathy.

22
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,300
And for those of you that don't know
what a breathy sound is,

23
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,700
it's sort of this leaky sound where
there's air passing through my vocal chords.

24
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,930
They're kind of slack. They're kind of apart.
They're not coming together cleanly

25
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:51,360
and making it clear sound, but they're
breathy. So if I tried it sing a phrase

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,050
and I try a "mum,"

27
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,280
I get:  "mum mum mum mum mum."

28
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,850
I don't have any, "mum mum mum mum mum," any clarity and strength in my voice.

29
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,570
Most beginning singers struggle with that,
Mary, and we can fix that

30
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,000
as long as we know how and why.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,100
So one thing before we start with that, that I want you to know, is breathiness is not a bad thing.

32
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,310
A lot of people think it is.
But actually we're gonna want that later

33
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,780
for stylistic effect.

34
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,600
And it can actually be a really good
thing. But we want to be under control with it.

35
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,269
And at first, it just sort of happens. And so
one of the very first things to fix

36
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:31,300
as a new in getting singer is that
breathiness. So let me give you a few reasons

37
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,610
why the breath thing as might be
happening. The very first

38
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:39,260
is too much breath. A lot of beginning
singers, they take these high breaths that

39
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,400
we talked about, these - (inhales)

40
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,109
up (exhales) and down breaths - which expels the air
really fast across the cords.

41
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:50,300
One of the cords defense mechanisms is just
to get the heck outta the way and that air.

42
00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:53,480
So they go slack because there's too
much (exhales)

43
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,159
exhale coming at them. And so you get a - "huh" - breathy sound.

44
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,299
So you get this up and down - (inhales) "mum mum mum" (inhales)

45
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:07,300
"mum mum mum" - breathiness that's coming from that too fast air.

46
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,939
So you gonna want to work
on your support, Mary, you're gonna want to

47
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,769
make sure that you bring the air down
here (inhales).

48
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:16,109
And that you don't blast on your exhale.
That's one thing that will help you

49
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:16,999
correct your breathiness.

50
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:21,329
The second thing, is a lot of times
it's psychological.

51
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:25,040
A lot of times people that are new to
singing think, "Well, you know, what do I have

52
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,180
to do this sound good.

53
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,100
And singing, it's so beautiful, it's so
pretty, I need to make my voice sound pretty."

54
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,349
That's a big mistake. You wanna - you don't
wanna make your voice sound pretty.

55
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:39,200
You want to make your voice sound like
to you. So if you go in thinking that

56
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,239
singing is a "pretty" thing then, you're
probably going to manipulate your voice

57
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,100
and instead of singing clearly "mum mum mum mum mum,"

58
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:51,579
you're going to think, "Well, I gotta be
pretty.

59
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:56,100
mum mum mum..." and then we get this sort of airy, breathy tone.

60
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,669
So change up the
thinking. Pretty sounds will happen later.

61
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:02,760
But don't try to be pretty. Let your
voice be strong,

62
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,669
let it be clear even if it doesn't sound
good to you, it probably sounds a lot

63
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:07,760
better than you think,

64
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,029
if you just go clearly into the sound and don't try to be pretty.

65
00:04:12,029 --> 00:04:15,299
Point number three is,

66
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:20,190
a lot of times people aren't aware how much
they're speaking voice carries over into

67
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,949
their singing voice at first.

68
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:25,110
And we really are going to need to use
your speaking voice, Mary,

69
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,330
if we're going to get those strong
sounds into the voice.

70
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,780
So if I walked up to somebody and I said,

71
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,470
"hey there!", I would just say, "hey there."

72
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:40,400
I wouldn't go, "hey there." If I did I
might get arrested or something like that.

73
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:43,919
If I said, "hey there," and I let my cords
go apart.

74
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,690
I'd just say, "hey there." So I have no problem my
speaking voice.

75
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,550
I don't just all of a sudden randomly 
become breathy.

76
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,440
Alright so you don't want to randomly
become breathy in your singing voice.

77
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,409
So if I can just close my cords and be
clear in my speaking voice,

78
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:03,110
I can close my cords and be clear in my
singing voice, too.

79
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,150
So I don't go, "hey there."

80
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:13,000
I speak into the sound, "hey there." And I
use my speaking voice on pitch.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Now I'm gonna do that with you
right now. We're gonna try this.

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,169
But first, before we do, let's practice
that. So just try speaking clearly.

83
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:24,770
Just say, "hey there." Go ahead.

84
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:29,030
Good. Now I hope you didn't go, "hey there." Alright. So you can speak clearly.

85
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,479
"hey there." K great.

86
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,800
So now if you can speak clearly, you're gonna take
your speaking voice and put that to pitches.

87
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:41,120
Guys are gonna be down here, and you're gonna do,
"hey there."

88
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,460
Ladies up here, "hey there."

89
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,289
And you're gonna speak right in. Don't let it go breathy. Don't let it be pretty.

90
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:52,680
Don't blast the breath, just speak on
pitch. Here we go.

91
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,580
"Hey there."

92
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:04,510
Great.

93
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,110
"Hey there."

94
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,289
"Hey there." Good.

95
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:28,480
"Hey there." Speak.

96
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,680
"Hey there."

97
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,900
Last one.

98
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,380
"Hey there." So already you can see

99
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,810
that just by speaking into your sound - 
not letting it be too pretty,

100
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,949
not letting it be too airy, you already
have more strength to your voice.

101
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:50,930
So that's a really simple way to start
developing strength. Like I say there's a

102
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,389
lot of other components to vocal
strength.

103
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:56,300
But when you're starting off, that's the
first thing you wanna fix.

104
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,509
Don't let those cords go slack.

105
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:01,389
Don't be pretty. Don't be afraid to use a
more speaky tone

106
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:04,550
into your sound and you're gonna get a
lot more strength, Mary,

107
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,110
and everybody out there who is new to
singing or may struggle with

108
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:12,800
breathiness that they didn't intend.
So I hope that's been helpful for you guys today.

109
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,310
