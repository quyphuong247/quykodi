00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,000
Hi everybody.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,130
My name is Justin Stoney and the founder
of New York Vocal Coaching here in New York City.

3
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,970
Welcome to Episode 12 Voice Lessons to
the World the show we want to help you

4
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,000
guys by answering your questions on
singing from

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,100
all over the world. I'll give you a chance to
ask questions later. But our question for the week

6
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,400
comes from Tory G. in Utah.

7
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,700
And Tori writes, "Dear Justin, Do you have
any advice on preventing cracking?"

8
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,050
That's a great question, Tori. And I think
that a lot of people are going to want to know about

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,300
cracking, and the first thing I want to
tell you before I tell you some ways to

10
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,600
not to crack.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,300
I wanna first tell you that cracking is
actually a great thing.

12
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,000
Now obviously we don't want our voices
to crack

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,400
in the middle of the performance or
something like that. But let me tell you why

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,100
cracking is actually a great thing. The
first reason is

15
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,400
that you voice needs to crack. If it
didn't crack you would actually hurt it.

16
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,800
Because we're trying to balance the
force on the vocal cords, the compression,

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,990
on the vocal cords...

18
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,500
(I'll get to that in a minute.) But if you
were not able to relieve that pressure -

19
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,700
to crack - your voice would actually get
hurt many more times

20
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,370
than it does because it can let go and
crack. So that's one thing is to protect your voice.

21
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,500
The second thing is for developing your
mix I want you guys -

22
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,000
singers out there - that are practicing a
lot, working on your voices

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
to know that if you're not cracking a
lotta times in your technique

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,200
you're probably not working on the mix
correctly -

25
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,000
because you've got to be able to crack
as you're working. You need to get to the

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
place where the voice wants to crack,

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and work through that territory if
you're going to develop a great mix.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,100
So cracking is a necessary part to your
vocal progress. You got it be in the area

29
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,600
where it wants to crack and crack and crack a bunch of times

30
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,800
if you wanna see progress. So cracking is
also a big part of your technical development.

31
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,800
So now we don't want to really crack all
the time.

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,000
So how are we going to prevent it? Let's talk about compression.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,500
Compression is the means by which you're going to find the ability to not crack.

34
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,200
If your chords come together really really hard like

35
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,500
this this is a lot of compression

36
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,000
its too much force.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But then - this is the opposite of compression. I have

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,100
I have air leakage through my vocal chords. But if I come together clean

39
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,200
and solid a little bit of compression

40
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,200
it sounds like a clear sound.

41
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,000
Now as I go higher, my cords are getting tighter they're lengthening out

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,300
but they also have a tendency to
come apart and to

43
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,200
relieve the compression. And it becomes

44
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,800
a balance of how much compression we're  going to use as we go higher.

45
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,800
If you use none - your voice will go -

46
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,300
into complete had voice way earlier than
you want. If you use too much

47
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,600
you're going to be straining and
gripping the cords. So as we go higher,

48
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,600
what we need, Tory, and all singers, is to

49
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,000
develop the ability to find gradations
of compression.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,100
Not to much, not too little, but just right,

51
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,500
and to fine-tune that as we go through our range.

52
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,500
So that's something that you're gonna get. And again,

53
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,000
if you don't crack a little bit, you're
not gonna find the

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,200
head voice side of things, and if you

55
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,700
don't ever strain actually you're not
going to find the balanced compression.

56
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,000
We don't want strain we don't want
cracking. But we've got a have both of them

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,900
to find that middle. So I'm gonna give you
a compression exercise.

58
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,600
Your goal is not to squeeze it,

59
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,600
and your goal is not to crack. Your goal
is to find something right in between.

60
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,600
But I'm gonna give you a pretty hard
consonant as we talked about before,

61
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,200
to give you a little bit of that
compression. Try this sound for me just say,

62
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,600
"Gig gig gig gig gig." Try that out. Now that's good.

63
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,450
Now compare that feeling to this feeling,
just say,

64
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,450
"who-hoo-hoo."

65
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:32,599
It's good. Now you feel that the "gig gig
gig" versus the "who hoo hoo," "gig gig gig gig" gives you

66
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:36,650
a little bit of a sort of tighter
feeling on the cords. Not a strain.

67
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,360
I's a big difference, a more compressed
feeling. One more time with, "who hoo hoo."

68
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,580
And now give me a, "gig gig gig."

69
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:54,020
It's good. So you can feel that that's a
little bit of a more compressed sound,

70
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,400
the "gig."

71
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,669
Now we're going to put this on pitches.
This exercise you probably be able to

72
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:03,560
take higher without cracking than
something like a" who" or something else.

73
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,200
So this is giving you a chance to balance
your compression and reduce the amount of cracking.

74
00:05:08,219 --> 00:05:11,800
So, guys are going to be down here.

75
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:15,599
"Gig gig gig gig." And ladies up here,

76
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:20,550
"gig gig gig gig." And again, we're going to
go all the way up.

77
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,580
You're not going to strain it, gonna try
to not crack,

78
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,580
you're gonna let the "gig gig" take care of
your work for you. So here we go.

79
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:30,330
Gig gig gig gig.

80
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,330
Great.

81
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,050
Nice job.

82
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,340
Gig gig gig gig. Good.

83
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,930
Good.

84
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,830
Gig gig gig gig.

85
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:08,529
Gig gig gig gig. Nice.

86
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,770
Two more.

87
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,330
Gig gig gig gig. Nice job.

88
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,410
So something you might be able to go
even higher than that and some of you

89
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,820
might have been cracking already. But
that hard consonant and that sense of

90
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:36,040
light compression, a light feeling of the
vocal cords coming together not being

91
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,400
two separate, not being too gripped,
that's going to help you to find a

92
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,280
balance and not crack as you go higher.

93
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:47,770
That is actually one way of accessing
the mix. So that's compression for you

94
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,830
I just want to throw one more thing in
there about cracking.

95
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,700
You also want to make sure that your
breath support is intact. We talked about

96
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,840
that in the past.

97
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,860
Okay, so you want to make sure you're
breathing is down here - and not up here -

98
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,640
because if you slam the air -

99
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,550
the cords are going to say, "You know what
I just can't deal with all this air that

100
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,090
you're throwing at me. I'm gonna have to
get out of the way of all that air."

101
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,820
So if you're over breathing, if you're
pushing the volume, if you're getting

102
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,650
louder as you go higher,

103
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,010
the cords aren't going to like that. They
might strain up and keep you from

104
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:21,370
cracking for awhile. But eventually the
compression is going to be too much, the

105
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,490
air is going to be too much, they're
going to get out of the way. So you need

106
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:30,800
to get the air deep in the body and you
need to make sure you have a steady kind of breath.

107
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,480
Don't slam that air or else you're
probably going to crack more.

108
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,370
So think about compression, do some
compression exercises to get the light

109
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:45,010
closure and the balance closure. Know
that breathing is a factor as you work

110
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:48,850
on this. And then finally, like I say,
cracking is a good thing. It protects

111
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:53,440
your voice. It's just your cords going to
a headier recipe then you wanted them to.

112
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,670
You need to have it for protection and
you need to have it a bunch of times

113
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,730
when you're working out your voice if
you're not cracking and you're only

114
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,670
straining you're only working one side
of things.

115
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,550
Don't be afraid to crack when you're
practicing. When you're in front of your

116
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,380
voice teacher, when you're at home...

117
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,680
The only place we don't want you
cracking is out on stage. So do a lot of

118
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,490
cracking before you get there. So I hope
that's been helpful for you guys today.

119
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,220
If you have questions you want to see
us answer on the show you can send an

email to: Questions@VoiceLessonsToTheWorld.com.

121
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,520
And we just encourage you guys to just keep

122
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,910
practicing even if you're cracking a lot
go right on through there.

123
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,500
Don't lose the joy. Don't lose the
passion. Don't let people tell you can't sing,

124
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,940
because we all know that's just not
true.
