00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:18,379
Hi everybody!

2
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:21,469
My name is Justin Stoney and I'm the
founder of New York Vocal Coaching here

3
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:22,439
in New York city.

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,359
Welcome to episode 38 of Voice
Lessons to the World,

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,219
the show that we want to help you guys as
singers by answering your questions from

6
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:29,150
all over the world.

7
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:32,449
I'll give you a chance to ask questions
later but our question for this week

8
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,390
comes from

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,250
Nora F. in Saint Petersburg, Russia

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,909
and Nora writes "Dear Justin,

11
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:42,389
I'd like to sing the song "Someone like
you" by Adele

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,210
but every time I get to the cords,
I feel sense of strain,

13
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,960
what do you think is going on

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,750
and can you help?

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,978
Well, thank you, Nora for that great
question

16
00:00:51,978 --> 00:00:52,740
man alive

17
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,550
I've heard that Adele's songs are more times
normal than almost any song

18
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:59,469
in voice lessons. Everybody loves to sing
that song.

19
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:01,710
And so i think it's good that we talk
about that today

20
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,789
because it's so common.

21
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:03,539
But

22
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,239
I do have an idea here, Nora,

23
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,130
about why

24
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:07,549
that might be so tough

25
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:10,859
and it's the deadly "I"

26
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:12,310
The "I" vowel

27
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,760
in singing

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,150
is one of the hardest vowels.

29
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,549
It's a culprit for so many vocal
problems. In a lot of times, when whatever

30
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,050
song you feel like you have
those notes and no one can sing that note.

31
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,909
So why is this song so tough? A lot of
times, it's the "I" vowel,

32
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,259
it's really kind of mean vowel explained
why it's also difficult to sing

33
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,140
but unfortunately it's not

34
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,478
only difficult but it's also very common
because every time I've had a song about

35
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:42,159
myself,

36
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,649
I'm gonna have to sing on "I" vowel.

37
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:49,780
We're going to talk about why the "I" is so deadly.

38
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,950
The first reason

39
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,049
is it's a mouth vowel.

40
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:58,060
And as we're moving up to
high notes, the sound can be in the

41
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,240
mouth or out the mouth.

42
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,399
The sound has to get more in.

43
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,040
Our chest voice and our little notes can
go out the mouth directionally with the

44
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,960
airflow.

45
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:12,759
As you move higher you must 
move that air in into the back

46
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:15,118
and also perhaps up

47
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:18,019
and into the nasal resonators. It's
essential

48
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:22,799
for the instrument to function well. So
you got the vowel like an "I" vowel,

49
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:27,769
that "I" is making the sound go more
out of the mouth. So, you want a high note,

50
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:30,180
"I" was not a really great thing.

51
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,109
Here the thing is

52
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:36,819
a spreading vowel. We talked about
spreading before

53
00:02:36,818 --> 00:02:37,438
and

54
00:02:37,438 --> 00:02:39,709
the spread of the lip corner of the

55
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:40,479
"I"

56
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,308
when we speak

57
00:02:41,308 --> 00:02:42,120
"I"

58
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,189
is another problem that's going to be
guiding the air out of the mouth.

59
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:47,068
So we naturally do

60
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:49,689
the spead usually when we speak an "I" vowel.

61
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:51,978
You can't have that when we say.

62
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:55,059
The last thing is the bright vowel.

63
00:02:55,058 --> 00:02:57,948
The bright vowel is like an"I" 
or an "a"

64
00:02:57,949 --> 00:02:59,229
or maybe even an "e"

65
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:02,300
while a dark vowel would be something
like an "o" or an "u"

66
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,439
or an "u:"

67
00:03:04,438 --> 00:03:08,049
Now a bright vowel tends to raise the larynx
a little bit more

68
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:09,280
and

69
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,640
you know also, we're talking about before,
spreading so we don't want those

70
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,788
the bright vowel to be moving up

71
00:03:14,788 --> 00:03:15,909
and tight

72
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:18,870
and that's another problem with that
"I" vowel.

73
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,679
All right, so

74
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:22,308
we need to learn how to fix

75
00:03:22,308 --> 00:03:25,109
the tendencies of the deadly "I"

76
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:29,489
I'm going to show you what would happen
in "Someone like you" if I get it

77
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:30,849
with the spread

78
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:34,919
and with the deadly "I" vowel and then
sort of without. So here's what

79
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,539
probably is happening to many many
singers in "Someone like you".

80
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:40,098
hmm

81
00:03:40,098 --> 00:03:43,048
"Never mind, I'll find

82
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:45,558
someone like you."

83
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:49,799
You see all that spread in a little bit
of the larynx high in brightness too high.

84
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,409
Now what if I slammed it down,

85
00:03:52,408 --> 00:03:54,709
"Never mind, I'll find

86
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:59,959
someone like you."
It becomes so much easier.

87
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:03,509
So now, what am I doing to fix it?

88
00:04:03,508 --> 00:04:05,958
Again, I am making sure that the lip corners

89
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:06,859
are staying

90
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:09,359
more neutral and not letting them go.

91
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:10,759
I'm keeping them more in.

92
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:14,068
So the vowel doesn't get out of the mouth
this much

93
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:15,538
It may be a little darker

94
00:04:15,538 --> 00:04:18,798
but we don't want to worry about that
right now. Just think about the smallness

95
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,578
of the lips.

96
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,499
"I", so let's try that together.

97
00:04:23,499 --> 00:04:29,120
Do a spreading "I" vowel for me. Just do
"I"

98
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,530
Now do you

99
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:32,668
"I"

100
00:04:32,668 --> 00:04:39,668
Nice. Go ahead and spread again, "I".

101
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:45,680
so that's going to help you fix the
mouthiness of that "I" vowel

102
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,740
but also this is a harder one.

103
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,319
We need to make sure that it actually
gets up into the nasal resonators

104
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,879
and that's not so easy.

105
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,658
Try this crazy sound for me, say

106
00:04:55,658 --> 00:04:58,238
"I"

107
00:04:58,238 --> 00:04:59,868
Right, pretty good.

108
00:04:59,869 --> 00:05:02,479
Try it this way down here.

109
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:05,389
"I"

110
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:06,550
Now move it up here.

111
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,680
"I"

112
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,009
Good. Better.

113
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:15,149
"I". Right.

114
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:18,848
So you 're going to have it a little bit more
up in the head then we would usually

115
00:05:18,848 --> 00:05:21,428
speak it. You're going to feel super weird

116
00:05:21,428 --> 00:05:25,918
that "I" vowel that we sing on high
note is the least like itself when we

117
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:27,848
speak of any vowel.

118
00:05:27,848 --> 00:05:31,599
So in another words, it is far away from its
natural state

119
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,580
at any vowel.

120
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:34,579
So we can't sing "I"

121
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:35,490
on a high note

122
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,720
We're going to have to sing

123
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,530
"I"

124
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:38,638
on that high note.

125
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,668
S,o again

126
00:05:40,668 --> 00:05:43,250
"Never mind I'll find..."

127
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,499
much different than

128
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:47,220
"Never mind, I'll find..."

129
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,099
which gets out too much.

130
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,620
I want to give you guys an exercise to
fix the "I" vowel in general.

131
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,709
We're going to point on an "m"

132
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:57,918
which is going to give you a
nasal resonance.

133
00:05:57,918 --> 00:05:59,430
and a "w"

134
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,439
which is going to give you a slim lip

135
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:02,959
in front of your "I" vowel.

136
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,718
Creating this exercise "MWI".

137
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:06,908
Say that for me.

138
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,769
"MWI"

139
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:16,769
Try this "m", "w".

140
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,180
So if we put an "m" and an "w" in front
of "I" vowel, you going to have that "I" vowel

141
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,699
not to get out of the mouth so much. So here
we go with an exercise together. Guys

142
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:26,038
down here.

143
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:31,728
"mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi" and ladies
up here "mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi"

144
00:06:31,728 --> 00:06:36,889
You're going to have that "m" and "w" helping you
keep the "I"... in the head. Here we go.

145
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:41,509
"mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi". Nice.

146
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:43,610
That's it.

147
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,429
Good.

148
00:06:46,428 --> 00:06:53,428
Nice.

149
00:06:54,629 --> 00:07:01,629
"mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi"

150
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,689
and

151
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:08,949
"mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi"

152
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:13,259
Awesome.

153
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,729
Great.

154
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,209
and

155
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:21,588
"mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi"

156
00:07:21,588 --> 00:07:27,009
and

157
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:34,009
"mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi". Right.

158
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:38,158
For you.

159
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:41,288
And.

160
00:07:41,288 --> 00:07:48,288
"mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi"

161
00:07:48,848 --> 00:07:51,348
Yep.

162
00:07:51,348 --> 00:07:53,709
Keep it up.

163
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:57,959
And

164
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:04,959
"mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi"

165
00:08:06,408 --> 00:08:07,699
Nice.

166
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:13,020
"mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi"

167
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:15,339
Two more.

168
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:17,008
here

169
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:23,120
"mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi"

170
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,009
falling it

171
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:25,449
Awesome job.

172
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:30,538
So we keep in that "m" and that "w" to make it
slim and to bring this sound up here for

173
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:32,139
that deadly "I".

174
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:35,939
Go ahead and put that in your song work.
You could do something like

175
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,509
"mwi mwi mwi mwi mwi

176
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:39,539
mwi mwi mwi mwi"

177
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,240
to feel that and then go to the words "Never mind,
I'll find

178
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,509
someone like you." So we got that sound more contained.

179
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:49,590
So you guys just need to listen for me for one second.

180
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,209
I'll talk about one other deadly
"I"

181
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:55,429
that singers face and that's the "I"

182
00:08:55,429 --> 00:08:58,189
of the ego that we get when we sing.

183
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,000
Either we're thinking our sound just so
awesome and everybody ought to listen to

184
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,320
me me me

185
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,510
or we think oh I'm just not good enough

186
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:06,299
or I just,

187
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:09,859
I'm never going to make it or nobody
ever thinks I sound any good and the

188
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,680
focus is on "I"

189
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,439
and we focus on "I"

190
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,460
as a singer

191
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,060
we're in some really bad territory

192
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,818
I want to courage you guys

193
00:09:19,818 --> 00:09:23,189
to make your singing about somebody else.

194
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,610
if you've got going on

195
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,110
and then you just really feel
great about your singing are all the

196
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,269
time at the time to give.

197
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,429
Singing the gift

198
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:33,289
so we want to be able to give it away.

199
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:38,610
So dedicate yourself to somebody, sing
for your audience sing for

200
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,999
somebody when you sing

201
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:42,928
or if you just uh... you know beginner starting off, you just kind of

202
00:09:42,928 --> 00:09:44,879
doing it just for you but you don't

203
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:49,080
you know feel good about yourself.
Dedicate your sound to make your

204
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,139
grandma that always believe that
you should sing, maybe it's a friend or

205
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:54,000
somebody.

206
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,529
Dedicate your singing and your
practicing and your work to somebody else. Getting

207
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:00,179
the focus off of the deadly "I"

208
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:02,408
will really help you guys to expand

209
00:10:02,408 --> 00:10:05,869
as singers who gets on you. Things start
to create fast

210
00:10:05,869 --> 00:10:08,490
but if you give the gift of singing

211
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,259
that is going to get back to you in some
awesome way. So I hope that's been

212
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:13,340
helpful for you guys as singers.
