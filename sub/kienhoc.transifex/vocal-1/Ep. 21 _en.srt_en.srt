1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
yeah

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:22,800
Hi everybody my name is Justin Stoney and
I'm the founder of New York Vocal

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,330
Coaching here in New York City.

4
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:27,929
Welcome to episode 21 of Voice Lessons to
the World the show we want to help you

5
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:30,929
guys as singers by answering your
questions from all over the world. I'll give you a

6
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,948
chance to ask questions later but our
question for this week comes from Nathan

7
00:00:34,948 --> 00:00:41,729
L. in St. George, Utah and Nathan writes
"Dear Justin, I'm a carol singer and I

8
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:46,018
enjoy singing and I've looked all over
the web for the answer that I can never

9
00:00:46,018 --> 00:00:52,948
find. What's the difference between
falsetto and head voice in a male? Now

10
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:56,579
Nathan that's a great question because I
know so many people want to know the

11
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,189
answer too and it's it's not
understood,

12
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:02,158
it's a big debate out there but i would
love to answer this question for you

13
00:01:02,158 --> 00:01:02,698
guys

14
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:08,789
once and for all. So a male falsetto
versus a male head voice

15
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,979
they sound very similar and people
mistake the two for each other all the

16
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:14,640
time.

17
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,549
The first thing I'm going to do is
little sound making just in my speaking

18
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:18,180
voice.

19
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,990
I just want to show you the difference
in my speech what the what the sound of

20
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:26,429
falsetto and the sound of head voice is.
So if I mean this voice right here this

21
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,470
is my falsetto. You can hear that it's
very weak, very leaky, very breathy and a

22
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:36,959
very strange sound for me to be making
so there's your falsetto sound. Next to

23
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,250
my head voice so now if I move into my
head voice, it's still kind of a strange

24
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,120
sound for me to be making. It's kind of
sound similar to falsetto but it's not

25
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,140
quite the same.

26
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,890
You can hear the best falsetto voice,
this is a little bit lighter and weaker

27
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,390
than this head voice which is not too
manly itself but it's different from

28
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:02,099
this sound. You hear the difference. Falsetto, head
voice very similar but not quite the

29
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:02,759
same.

30
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,450
So now we'll talk about what. What is
falsetto.

31
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:15,209
Falsetto is when the vocal cords stretch
out and lengthen and tilt the air to

32
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:16,439
the back.

33
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:20,789
So you've got long flexible vocal cords
that shoot the air to the back. That's

34
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:25,049
how the voice makes high notes is we've
got muscles that stretch the vocal cords.

35
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,910
So when you do falsetto,

36
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:31,829
you're stretching the cords, long cords,
air shooting to the back so it's this

37
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,219
sound but it's breathy. There isn't

38
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:42,060
there's not much compression. It's kind
of leaky and breathy. Now head voice, this

39
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,740
is why it's so similar.

40
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,790
you have long cords being
stretched out, the air being shot to

41
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:53,939
the back but this time you have not just
this but a little bit of this, a little

42
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:59,219
bit of compression on the voice too - so
it's long cords, air to the back but not

43
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:06,210
breathy, a little bit compressed. Now head
voice is a form of a mix because it

44
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,760
mixes some blend of coordination

45
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,539
There is no coordination at al. It's just
air to the back.

46
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:16,530
This is there to the back plus a little
bit of something else. Head voice has a

47
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,900
little bit of something else in. That
thing is something we've talked about

48
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,270
before which is compression.

49
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,330
That's why they're so similar. That's why
people get them confused all the time is

50
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,950
because both of them are to the back,

51
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:29,609
both of them are long cords but the X factor
is the thing that's misunderstood,

52
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,500
compression. So Nathan or anybody ever
wondering what the difference is.

53
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,080
That's it. It's just a little bit more
put together on the vocal cord level.

54
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,360
Falsetto, not put together, head voice, some
degree of put together ness.

55
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,900
Ok so next we're going to just talk
about a few song examples where you see

56
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,490
you hear falsetto

57
00:03:53,490 --> 00:04:01,709
Ok the Beatles are famous for doing
their "Whoo" at the high notes so that would

58
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,659
be an example of when you hear

59
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,709
falsetto you know in a male in a song.
There's tons of them but that's a really

60
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:09,450
classic one where the Beatles do their

61
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:16,319
"Whoo". Ok a style of music that uses head
voice a lot of times almost exclusively

62
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,988
would be like an Irish folk song.

63
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:25,019
So  you hear in Irish is tender kind of doing
something like "Toora...

64
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:34,529
toora loora" and that's not quite my
falsetto "Hiii Hoo.." I put my vocal cords

65
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:39,599
together in a subtle fashion and I get
something from "Hiiii"

66
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,430
and I come into my head voice so you
know

67
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:51,509
"Oh Danny Boy the pipes the pipes are
calling" that kind of sound is a very

68
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:56,789
very light head voice but it's not falsetto
and then you got your songs that

69
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,480
come in and out of falsetto a lot and
will actually talk about this really

70
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:09,030
soon but you have "Apologize" by Timberland
"It's too late to apologize" right

71
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:12,119
"It's too late to apologize"

72
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,030
see falsetto and then to mix "it's too late
to apologize"

73
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:24,779
coming in and out of that falsetto
coordination into your mix. That's a song

74
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:30,750
example of both and some song examples
that use one of the other exclusively at

75
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,220
different moments.

76
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,150
So then what you want to work on. If you
want to get a good falsetto or good head

77
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:37,799
voice or both,

78
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,829
basically what I encourage you guys to
do is just not stop working on your

79
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:46,109
falsetto. Falsetto is neglected so much
in vocal exercise and training.

80
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,069
It's your flexibility function. You need
to keep on stretching that falsetto all

81
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:53,250
the time. It's not going to hurt you.
There's no absolutely nothing wrong with

82
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:59,009
doing a falsetto. In fact it's very very
good for you and then make sure you're

83
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:05,490
guiding your air up and back for high
notes. Head voice is a stronger

84
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,870
coordination than falsetto but the problem
with how males often sing is they're

85
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,850
using so much of a thick
coordination such a chesty sound and so

86
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,080
much power in the voice all the time
that they never send the air up and back

87
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,250
in a light way.

88
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,569
So if you work on your falsetto and you
continue to have your notes moving this

89
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:28,829
way and not straight out that way you're
going to develop a good head voice over

90
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:32,819
time as well but hopefully knowing the
difference between falsetto and head

91
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,980
voice can get you a little bit of a
start

92
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,189
So Nathan and everybody I hope that
settles the debate once and for all

93
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:42,120
about the difference between the two and
gives you a few tips for working on.

94
