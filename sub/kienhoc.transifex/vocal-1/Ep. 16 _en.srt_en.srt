1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
yeah

2
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:20,919
Hi everybody my name is Justin Stoney and
I'm the founder of New York Vocal

3
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:22,509
Coaching here in New York City.

4
00:00:22,509 --> 00:00:26,199
Welcome to episode 16 of Voice Lessons
to the World the show we want to answer

5
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,989
your questions about singing from all
over the world and I'll give you a

6
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:32,230
chance to ask questions later but our
question for this week comes from

7
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:37,479
Charles B. in Ontario, Canada and Charles
writes, "Dear Justin

8
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:42,640
everybody says my voice is great. My
voice teachers my friends my family they

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,869
all love my voice.

10
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:46,869
However I think I sound bad

11
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:50,169
I can't stop judging my voice. Do you
have any tips?"

12
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:55,179
now Charles that's an awesome thing to
bring up and I think that so many of us

13
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:59,979
judge our voices and this judgment can
cause a limitation for us we know what

14
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:04,808
causes frustration and lack of growth
but a lot of us still we always want to

15
00:01:04,808 --> 00:01:09,368
make good sounds we were afraid to make
bad sounds and we judge our voices all

16
00:01:09,368 --> 00:01:11,170
the time we think we sound bad

17
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,100
so I hope I can help you sift through
some of this today. The first thing I

18
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:18,129
want to bring up is that you can't hear
yourself properly.

19
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:23,560
That's right. You can't hear yourself
right. Now

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,810
part of the reason that I'm employed is
because that's true. If that was not true

21
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:34,269
I would be out on the street. Because if
you could just sit at home and sing and

22
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:38,259
say oh well that sounded good, I'm going
to do more of that and all that didn't

23
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:40,149
sound so good Ii'm never going to do that
again.

24
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:44,379
Then everybody would be able to just sit
at home and get good at singing but part

25
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:45,968
of the reason why you can't

26
00:01:45,968 --> 00:01:49,358
and usually why you need instruction is
because you can't hear yourself

27
00:01:49,358 --> 00:01:54,848
accurately. So why we know this is if you
hear yourself on an answering machine or

28
00:01:54,849 --> 00:02:00,069
something and you hear at playback, you
say "Oh my god I sound like that," you

29
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:04,149
expect this deep rich voice but what you
hear back is some tiny whiny sound.

30
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:10,270
Now why is that true? We have resonators
when we speak and when we sing and some

31
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,439
of those primary resonators are the
nasopharynx and the nasal cavity.

32
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:17,049
These are two areas that are actually
behind

33
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,730
the ears and so you can't hear
those resonators very well but those are

34
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:26,049
some of the best resonators that we use
for our sound making. So the sound that

35
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,770
comes out to all of us is different than
what we hear in our heads.

36
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:35,590
So Charles I hope that alone is helpful
for you that what you're hearing is not

37
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,420
actually what we're hearing.

38
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:41,229
So if you're judging that you're
actually not able to judge it with a

39
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:43,060
hundred percent accuracy.

40
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,009
The second thing I want to talk about is
what this judgment that we all do causes.

41
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:53,679
We live in a culture with the reality TV
shows that have people going in front of

42
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,050
millions and having their voices judged
and if you do well you move on to the

43
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,790
next round and maybe you become you know
the greatest of stars and if you don't

44
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:06,159
do so well you might become a laughing
stock

45
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,189
and so we have this environment and a
culture of judging singing and that's

46
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:16,900
not actually necessarily so healthy
because you don't want to go on stage

47
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,959
you don't even want to be in the voice
studio or in your practice room with a

48
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:30,400
judgmental mindset. Judging the voice too
much causes physical tension and a hold

49
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,539
of the breath.

50
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:35,049
Just think about if you were going to
listen and really scrutinize something

51
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,080
think about the tension that just
listening causes.

52
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,860
Actually let's go ahead and try it, just
take a listen to the sounds in your own

53
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,790
room, just take a pause and just really
listen hard for a second

54
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:56,490
and you notice when you go and just
listen typically the body freezes and

55
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:02,370
the breath freezes. So just the act of
listening and scrutinizing causes us to

56
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,569
hold on

57
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:07,199
in a way that we don't want. We know that
the best performers go out there

58
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:12,269
judgment-free. They've got an ease about
them. They're not trying to make it right.

59
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:18,329
They're just letting it go. That's one
thing, another thing is that if you are

60
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,529
trusting your sound if you're constantly
judging it all the time you're going to

61
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,319
want to hear it better so that you can
judge it.

62
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:29,879
So you may just push it out into the
room for that to happen so that you can

63
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,779
hear it better.

64
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:35,189
You'll take it out of our friendly
resonators and you push it out here.

65
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:39,959
Now the problem with that is that you're
going to hear it better but we're not

66
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:43,680
going to hear it as well and it's going
to sound better to you but not as good

67
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,850
to us.

68
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,960
Interestingly when you rely on the
resonators that we want

69
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:54,149
mostly for singing you won't hear it as
well and it won't sound good to you

70
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:57,779
but to us will hear it better and it
will sound better.

71
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,790
So there's a little bit of trust in like
a leap of faith that goes on when you

72
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,169
make sound to not push it out there
where you can hear it but to rely on the

73
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:11,009
mechanics that you know are going to
make you sound good.

74
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,319
Then the next thing I've talked a
little bit about this before is that we

75
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,519
need the bad sounds. We absolutely have
to have the bad sounds. If you want to

76
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:25,349
make the good sounds you have to have
the bad sounds. In technique

77
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,410
you have to have the bad sounds. One
thing that we've mentioned before is

78
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,370
cracking

79
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,660
I want to have a great sound, I've got to
be okay with cracking. If I have

80
00:05:34,528 --> 00:05:39,959
"some where over the rainbow" and go too
far

81
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:43,619
"somewhere over the rainbow"

82
00:05:44,278 --> 00:06:00,598
or I don't go far enough so "somewhereover the rainbow" or I go
both and I crack "somewhere..."  I'm back and forth

83
00:06:00,598 --> 00:06:05,908
between too much and too little too much
and too little but being able to go back

84
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:10,379
and forth, being able to find something
in between there being okay with

85
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:17,729
cracking somewhere I find that middle had
too little too much

86
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:23,128
we're right in between I have to be okay
with cracking if I'm going to find that

87
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:24,209
in between.

88
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:29,728
That's on a technical level a bad sound
cracking which leads to good sound mix

89
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:32,308
but on a stylistic level.

90
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:36,989
I just want to mention to you, Charles
and everybody let's just think about

91
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:39,388
think about some of your favorite
singers

92
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:45,509
I know that they've got great voices
but can you think of some nuances to

93
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:49,259
your favorite singers that are actually
not the prettiest sounds?

94
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,360
Some of them might have a little gravel,
might have a little breathiness, might

95
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,028
have a little vocal fry. They might have
a vibrato that's unique or uneven. They

96
00:07:00,028 --> 00:07:03,988
might push their voice a little too hard
sometimes. They might not have some

97
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:09,328
strengths in some areas but those uniquenesses 
are actually what is making that

98
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:12,509
singer remarkable and special

99
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:16,739
Interestingly the bad sounds quote/
unquote are the things that are making

100
00:07:16,738 --> 00:07:21,748
that singer stand out so i'm not saying
don't work on your voice. I'm not saying

101
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:26,519
don't aim for perfection but just know
that a lot of times the sounds that are

102
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:32,309
not necessarily the best are apart of
the singers' whole package that makes

103
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:33,449
them unique.

104
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:37,739
So if we sit and say well I'm not going
to go out there if I make bad sounds I'm

105
00:07:37,738 --> 00:07:40,018
not going to go out there until it's
perfect

106
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:43,918
then truly were missing out on a special
singer because there's nobody that's

107
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:46,680
going to go out there and make perfect
pristine sounds all the time.

108
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,900
It's just not realistic so we want to
allow less than perfect sounds to be a

109
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:57,508
part of our style actually as we're
growing and maybe just because it sounds

110
00:07:57,509 --> 00:07:59,729
great to leave it alone.

111
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:03,839
So then what do we do with judgment.

112
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:09,600
how do we how do we get through this. One
thing is have people that you trust.

113
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,250
You said that you have a voice teacher,
family and friends that support you.

114
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,029
That's great. I'd encourage you, Charles
and anybody with a great situation like

115
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:22,469
that to listen to them. If you're the
only person that listens to your voice

116
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,690
and says "well this is terrible"

117
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:28,800
then probably you're wrong because
everybody else loves it.

118
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,399
So you need to find a way to love it too
and that's the second thing you need to

119
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,288
be in a positive environment whether
that's in your vocal studio or in your

120
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:38,250
practice room

121
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,028
the environment that you make for
yourself needs to be a positive one.

122
00:08:42,028 --> 00:08:45,389
If you're constantly giving yourself
negative messages all the time when you

123
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:47,730
sing and saying "well this sounds bad"

124
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,240
with voice and singing that something is
really going to stand in your way.

125
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,439
You need to fake it till you make it. You
need to tell yourself that it sounds

126
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,520
pretty good

127
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,699
even before it does or maybe it already
does.

128
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,900
You still need to constantly reinforce a
good message to your singing. It's going to

129
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:08,250
pay off big time so that you don't have
those holds and those limitations that

130
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,019
the negative thoughts cause then finally
I just want you to experiment.

131
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:18,660
Go ahead and be okay with the cracking,
be okay with the experimentation and the

132
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:22,019
making of bad sounds when you're in the
voice studio when you're practicing

133
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:26,879
because it's the only way that you're
going to have a good solid technique and

134
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:32,159
a wide spectrum, a variety of sounds that
you can make in your performances.

135
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:38,879
So Charles and all, I hope that you can
work through that judgment and get to a

136
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,480
better place so that your singing can be
even freer and hope that's been helpful

137
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,800
for you guys today,

138
