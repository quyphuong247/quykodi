Hi everybody! My name is Justin Stoney and I'm the founder of New York Vocal

2
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,190
Coaching here in New York City

3
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,510
and welcome to our second episode of
Voice Lessons to the World!

4
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,110
This is a show where we want to help you as singers to have the best information

5
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:49,570
and to improve your voices. Today I'm
really excited because we actually have

6
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,730
our very first question ever! This comes
from Kristen S.

7
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,809
in Charlotte, North Carolina. And
Kristen writes,

8
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:03,100
she says, "My voice sounds very nasal. People tell me that my singing and my speaking

9
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,969
voice sound

10
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:08,470
nasal. What can I do to fix this?" Now
Kristen that's a fantastic question,

11
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,350
and something that a lot a singer
struggle with. And a lot of times it's

12
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,180
just due to a confusion about what it
actually means to even be nasal.

13
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,610
See we have two things, we've got nasal
resonance

14
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,649
and we've got nasality. And most
singers will fall on

15
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:28,130
one of the extremes of either too nasal or
not nasal enough.

16
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:32,550
Let's first talk about what these two
things are. So nasal resonance

17
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,090
tends to be a very good thing and nasality tends to be

18
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,850
not so good of a thing. Nasal resonance, if you hear me speaking to you like this,

19
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:45,790
and I say, "Hello my name is Justin." I've
got nasal resonance in my voice.

20
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,450
If I take the sound out of my nose, suddenly I start to sound kind of muddy.

21
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,119
And I sound just like Sylvester Stalone in Rocky. "Yo Adrian"

22
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,500
but it kind of sounds kind of strange. But if I put the sound back in my nose,

23
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,680
and then I sound like myself. So we know
that

24
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,149
it sounds normal to have a little nasal
resonance in the voice.

25
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,420
So how this applies to singing, I just
take a little exercise here

26
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,790
And I have it in my nasal resonators

27
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,110
I sing: *mah mah mah mah mah*

28
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:22,070
If I take it out of my nose,  Sings *bah bah bah bah bah*

29
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,340
It starts to sound a little bit muddy. So
again, with resonance

30
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,560
Sings *Mah Mah Mah Mah Mah Mah*

31
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,270
and without, sings *mah mah mah mah mah*

32
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,460
So when we sing, we actually do wanna
feel nasal resonance, a little bit of

33
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,510
a vibration

34
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,730
right up here. So then what's the bad

35
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,870
nasal? That has actually more to do with
the larynx than it does with the nose.

36
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,200
If I speak to you and I say, "Hello my name is Justin."

37
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,560
My larynx is staying pretty put. If I drop my larynx down,

38
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,830
I get a kind of muddy sound. "Hello my name is Justin."

39
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,250
But then if I squeeze my larynx up and I say,

40
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,260
"Hello my name is Justin." Then I start to get

41
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,890
a bad nasal sound. Now what's really
interesting

42
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,970
If I squeeze my larynx up here and I cut off my nasal cavity

43
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,460
I can actually make a really nasal sound

44
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,110
without any nasal resonance at all. So a really

45
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,520
nasal sound doesn't actually even need
to have

46
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,540
nose in it. So,

47
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,620
When you're singing, Kristen, or anybody
out there,

48
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,250
You want to make sure that it's not your
larynx squeezing up,

49
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,910
that's going to cause nasality.
You also don't want to jam your larynx down.

50
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:38,770
But you do want to feel a little bit of nasal
resonance, a vibration right in through here.

51
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,030
So that's nasal resonance, that's good. And squeezing your larynx up

52
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,230
with neck muscles or with your upper
body, that's going to be bad and cause

53
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,380
the nasal sound,

54
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,060
the nasality sound that you don't want. So,

55
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,160
I hope that's been helpful for you guys
today. If you have questions that you want to

don't lose the passion, work really hard at your voice,

60
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,750
find a voice teacher that you love in your area. And never let anyone tell you that you can't sing

61
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,620
Because we know, that's just not true.
