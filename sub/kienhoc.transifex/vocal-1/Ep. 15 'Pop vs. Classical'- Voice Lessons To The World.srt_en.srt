00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,610
Hi everybody. My name is Justin Stoney and
I'm the founder of New York Vocal

3
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,170
Coaching here in New York City.

4
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,650
Welcome to Episode 15 of Voice Lessons
to the World, the show where we want to

5
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,169
answer your questions about singing from
all over the world.

6
00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:30,990
I'll give you a chance to ask questions
later. But our question for the week

7
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:37,350
comes from Bulacan, Philippines and Coach Fatrick Sta. Ana

8
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,230
(He's the founder of "Popstage" and he
asked me to give the website, so it's

9
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,070
right here.

10
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,280
Popstage - it looks like these guys are
doing some great things.) But Coach

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,770
Fatrick asks, "Dear Justin,

12
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,899
What is the difference between pop
singing and classical singing?" That's an

13
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,339
awesome question Fatrick and I know
that lots of you want to do multiple

14
00:00:56,339 --> 00:00:59,940
styles and i really encourage that. I
really encourage you to not just get

15
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,629
locked into one, but give your vocal
cords variety. Do a lot of different

16
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:06,960
things. So today we're going to talk
about the differences between pop and

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,710
classical. The very first one is simply
volume. Classical singing is just louder

18
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,180
than pop singing. And now that doesn't
mean to be loud. But when you're singing

19
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,860
classically you don't use a microphone
and when you sing with pop you do use a

20
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,420
microphone. And so you want to know that
as, as you're developing your voice, that

21
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,260
when you're going to sing with the
elements of classical, part of the

22
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,310
purpose is to project the voice and be
able to sing without a mic and to be

23
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,490
able to sing over an orchestra and in a
large hall. With pop singing we

24
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,900
purposefully do not want the voice to be
so big because the mic's going to be

25
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,390
very close. If you sing too big,

26
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,120
you're probably not going to have the
agility and the dexterity and the

27
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,010
lightness that we need. So classical
singers be sure that you're singing as

28
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:00,150
they say, "on the body," with a lot of
connection to the body, with a lot of

29
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,320
great breath support, a lot of physical
energy and a voice that can carry.

30
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,209
We never want to push, we never want to
be loud, but we want to set up mechanics

31
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,739
that will cause good healthy projection.
We'll talk about one of those in a second.

32
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,370
Pop singers purposefully do not make
your voice so loud.

33
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,769
If you're singing pop loudly like I say,
you're probably going to prevent the

34
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:25,580
growth that we want as far as agility
and lightness and

35
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,800
dexterity that we need for pop singing.
So that's the first difference. Now one

36
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,910
of those mechanical differences with
vocal technique, is the larynx. And we've

37
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,640
talked about this in the past. But we'll
do it again.

38
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,600
Classical singers sing with a lower
larynx. Pop singers sing with a higher larynx.

39
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:48,440
There's gradations of laryngeal
coordination that you can do. But I'd

40
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,190
like to take a song here that could be
in a pop setting or a classical setting,

41
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,380
America the Beautiful, and just show you
what these larynxes sound like.

42
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,150
So if I have...

43
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:09,800
a little bit of a lower larynx, I have, "Oh
beautiful for spacious skies, for amber

44
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,720
waves of grain..." And if I lift up my
larynx and get a little bit of a lighter

45
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,670
place with it,

46
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:24,629
"Oh beautiful for spacious skies, for
amber waves of grain..."

47
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,630
And I get a little bit more into a
pop sound. So part of the thing that

48
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:34,340
allows for more projection is that lower
larynx. With a lower deeper sound, I can

49
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:41,600
make a bigger sound, than with the higher,
lighter sound that I have with a high larynx.

50
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,500
So part of what causes the projection
and the volume difference, is your

51
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,880
laryngeal position. Again we want to feel
a sense of a little drop in a little

52
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:56,450
openness in the throat for your low larynx,
and a little bit of a lighter higher (not

53
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:03,200
squeezed), but higher laryngeal position
for pop. So then the next thing is sort

54
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,160
of similar to that. It's the
conversationalness of contemporary

55
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:13,550
sounds. Classical singers do not put on
the pedestal as much the "conversationalness"

56
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,200
of their sound.

57
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,700
So in other words, if i want to have tone
quality be my,

58
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,950
my number one focus, I might pronounce
the words, "Oh beautiful for spacious

59
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:30,290
skies, for amber waves of grain..." And then
I get of course,

60
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,160
"Oh beautiful for spacious skies,

61
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:43,920
for amber waves of grain..." But if I speak it
very conversationally, "for purple

62
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:53,950
mountains majesty, above the fruited
plain." "...for purple mountains majesty

63
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,370
above the fruited plain..."

64
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:03,280
It sounds more like me, and it sounds
more with the emphasis being on the

65
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,580
lyrics and on the communication. So pop
and contemporary we hear the words more

66
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:15,250
clearly often, because the focus is on
the conversationalness of the tone, versus

67
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,600
the richness and fullness and the depth
of the tone that you get in classical.

68
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,150
Now a fourth thing is going to be
stylistic elements. Classical singers do

69
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:32,380
at least two very distinct things: lots
of vibrato and lots of legato. Legato

70
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,330
means smoothness.

71
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:45,190
So if I have a lot of vibrato and legato,
it's this, "America, America, God shed

72
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:51,850
His grace on Thee..." You can see that I'm
being very smooth through there and I

73
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:59,470
also have, "Thee..." That shimmer of vibrato. Now
a pop singer might not have as much

74
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,350
of that. They might have,

75
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:09,280
"America, America, God shed His grace on Thee..."

76
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,260
It might not be - that's straight tone -
might not be any vibrato at all, and it

77
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:19,540
might not be so smooth and legato.
I'm being a little bit more choppy there. Now

78
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,920
again, both styles can use legato,
staccato, vibrato...

79
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:31,690
if they want. But they tend more toward
vibrato and legato in classical, and

80
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:37,690
toward choppy, staccato, and straight tone
in pop. Now another thing that I can do

81
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:42,730
is throw in riffs. A pop singer would do
that more than a classical singer,

82
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:47,600
although classical singers do have
cadenzas, which is sort of a classical riffing.

83
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:56,140
But if I have this again it's, "America,
America, God shed His grace on Thee..."

84
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:01,600
I'm throwing in just a little bit of riffs
there to kind of bring it into a pop

85
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,130
style. So riffs are another thing that a
pop singer might do that a classical

86
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,930
singer might not.

87
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:14,830
And then finally breathiness and vocal
fry tend to sound very good in pop, but

88
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:19,450
not so much in classical. Breathiness is
this sound, and a vocal fry is this sound.

89
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:23,380
So if i go back into my pop, "America,

90
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:28,639
America, God shed His grace on Thee."

91
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:37,610
I have "ha" and "huh" in my sound, and it
brings me into a pop style because I'm

92
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,180
not loud because I'm not forcing a lot
of air or volume,

93
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,379
that's not bad for my vocal cords. So
again the purity of the classical sound,

94
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:55,400
"America, America, God shed His grace on Thee..." I don't have any of those elements,

95
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:02,360
but I have a lot of other great elements
alongside. So I hope that's some good

96
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,830
clear differences for you guys as you're
working to get both a classical sound

97
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:13,009
and a pop sound together. Again we've got
the volume issue, we've got our laryngeal

98
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:14,180
coordination,

99
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:19,189
where are we going to feel the depth or
the raise or the neutrality of our larynx,

100
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:25,939
we've got the conversational style of
pop vs the focus on tone quality and

101
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:30,529
richness of the musical line in
classical. And then we got those

102
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:35,449
stylistic elements that we talked about:
vibrato, legato, staccato, vocal riffs,

103
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:37,849
fries, breathiness...

104
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:41,500
there's a lot of stuff that you can play.
So Fatrick, that was a great question.

105
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,839
Once again that website for you
for PopStage. Looks like these guys are

106
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:48,320
doing some great stuff out there in the
Philippines, so we wish you the best in

107
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,459
helping singers. That's totally awesome.
And if you guys have questions for us to

108
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:59,700
answer on the show, you can send an email
to: Questions@VoiceLessonsToTheWorld.com

109
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,890
So we just encourage you to study a lot
of different styles of singing, from pop

110
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,500
to classical, and as you do don't lose
the joy,

111
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,010
don't lose the passion, don't let people
tell you you can't sing because we know

112
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,459
that that's not true. Get with a great
voice teacher like Fatrick out there

113
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:17,149
in the Philippines and PopStage. If you
guys are in New York City you can check
