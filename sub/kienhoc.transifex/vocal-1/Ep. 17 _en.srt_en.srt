1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
yeah

2
00:00:08,449 --> 00:00:11,449
yeah

3
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:21,460
Hi everybody my name is Justin Stoney and
I'm the founder of New York Vocal

4
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,359
Coaching here in New York City. Welcome
to episode 17 of Voice Lessons to the

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,750
World the show we want to help you guys
as singers by answering your questions

6
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,609
about singing from all over the world.

7
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:33,460
Ii'll give you a chance to ask questions
later but our question for the week

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,719
comes from

9
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:41,859
Annie L. in Taiwan and Annie says "Dear
Justin I love your videos about the

10
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:45,429
larynx, can you tell me how I can lower
my larynx?

11
00:00:46,689 --> 00:00:50,948
Well that's an awesome question and
thanks for the compliment, Annie. Let's

12
00:00:50,948 --> 00:00:57,369
talk about that today because we have
discussed the larynx a little bit and we

13
00:00:57,369 --> 00:01:04,599
do need the ability to lower the larynx
so we're going to talk about how. For

14
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:09,819
those of you that have never experienced
a low larynx, we'll start with that. The

15
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:14,319
best easiest way to first feel low
larynx is to experiment with some

16
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:20,468
character sounds. So if I'm speaking to
you like this this is speaking with a

17
00:01:20,468 --> 00:01:25,868
relaxed neutral larynx but if I start to
drop my larynx then it starts to get a

18
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:31,599
little bit dopey or maybe a little bit
sort of domer sounding and it's kind of

19
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,489
a goofy voice it's kind of a character
voice so you know if I said "Hello my

20
00:01:36,489 --> 00:01:41,078
name is Justin" and then I made it a
little bit dopey, it would be "Hello my name

21
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:45,069
is Justin so go ahead and say that
first at home

22
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:52,658
"Hello my name is Annie". Let's try that
and then go ahead and make it a dumb

23
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:59,170
character sound "Hello my name is Annie."
Good.

24
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:04,599
This is the first way that you can start
to feel what a low larynx sounds like a

25
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:09,579
couple of characters that might use a low
larynx would be like "eeyore" from Winnie

26
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,469
the Pooh "Oh No

27
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:17,500
absorb depressed". Right, another might be
Barney, remember that kid show we have,

28
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,560
"I love you, you love me

29
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:27,189
we're..." whatever so that's a low larynx
character voice and it just gets you the

30
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:32,919
sense of what that even feels like but I
should mention that our final product is

31
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:37,989
not going to be this low larynx sound. We
need the ability to know how to lower

32
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,530
the larynx but we're not just going to
be jamming it down all the time even

33
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,099
though as I've said classical singers
sing with a lower larynx than pop

34
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:49,269
singers. Classical singers don't jam
their larynx all the way down

35
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,920
It's just a little bit of a deeper
coordination laryngeal in speaking than

36
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:59,019
in a contemporary sound so we don't want
to be all the way down. This's being said

37
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,310
it's not a bad thing to exercise your
voice with a little bit of a deeper

38
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:09,670
larynx. Now hear's some other things 
that are important for keeping a low larynx.

39
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:17,018
We need physical relaxation. Physical
relaxation of the breath's getting

40
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:21,670
the breath deep in the body as we've
talked about allowing the air to

41
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:28,599
come down and to expand the abdomen. If
you're up here you're probably going to

42
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:34,449
have a much higher, much harder time
relaxing your larynx. The other thing is

43
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:39,609
your posture. If there's a lot of tension
in the upper body and you're feeling a

44
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,340
sense of lift up here just from your
posture.

45
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,729
That's another thing to drop down. You
also want to feel the feet into the

46
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:50,949
earth, the hips dropping down shoulders
dropping down and next you want the jaw

47
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:56,439
to drop down as well. If you have a
really tight intense jaw, that's going to

48
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:00,579
make it also hard to find the low larynx.
You want to have a root feeling of

49
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:05,290
release and looseness in the jaw and
then also the face.

50
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:11,260
Some people really are singing like this
and that actually does tend to cause a

51
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:16,509
larynx lift as well. We want to looseness
of face, a looseness of jaw, a looseness

52
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:21,759
and depth of posture and of breath and
those things will contribute to your

53
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,839
ability and

54
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:30,069
to lower your larynx. Now the next thing
is what vowel we sing with. If you want

55
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:34,240
to get a lower larynx if you're noticing
that you're singing with too high of a

56
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,699
larynx all the time and it's getting a
little bit tight certain vowels that you

57
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:43,930
exercise your voice with are going to
work better than others. Some of the best

58
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:55,990
vowels for lowering your larynx are /oʊ/,
/ʊ/, /ɘ/,/o/ and /ʊ̈/ so again that's /oʊ/

59
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:06,579
/ʊ/, /ɘ/,/o/ and /ʊ̈/ so you can kind of
see that my lips on most of these vowels

60
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:11,709
move this way and that's another thing
that can help you to lower your larynx

61
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:15,819
if you need is having lips and cheeks
moving in and down.

62
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:23,709
Ok so we're going to do an exercise now
that helps you with a low larynx. We're

63
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:31,359
going to do a "B-U-B bub bub bub bub bub" and now this
setup a "bub bub bub" is a really good exercise

64
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,110
for getting the larynx down in case any
or anybody else you haven't really

65
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:40,750
felt this before. So now what we want to
do this is this is the pattern will do

66
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:50,889
"Bub bub bub bub bub" and what we want to avoid is the
"bub bub bub bub bub" where my

67
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:54,939
sound gets kind of nerdy and bratty.
We're looking in this exercise

68
00:05:54,939 --> 00:06:03,038
purposefully for depth so we want 
"bub bub bub bub bub" 
"bub bub bub bub"

69
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:08,649
I've got the deep sound but open larynx
so that's the point. I'm gonna give you a

70
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:10,959
chance to do it. Guys are gonna be down
here

71
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,859
"bub bub bub bub bub" and ladies up
here

72
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:21,319
"bub bub bub bub bub" and concentrate
on all those things: relaxation here,

73
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:28,040
depth, loose jaw, narrowness and make sure
you don't squeeze the larynx, keep a

74
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,760
little bit of that character sound in
the sound if you have trouble. Here we go.

75
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:35,899
"Bub bub bub bub bub". Nice

76
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,750
Good

77
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:50,459
"Bub bub bub bub bub". Well done.

78
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:56,508
yeah

79
00:06:57,339 --> 00:07:01,269
Great. "Bub bub bub bub bub". Nice.

80
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,019
"Bub bub bub bub bub"

81
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:19,019
"Bub bub bub bub bub"

82
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:22,019
Good

83
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:28,579
mmm

84
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:32,269
"bub bub bub bub bub"

85
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,490
Nice job

86
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:49,050
"bub bub bub bub bub" last one. "Bub bub bub bub bub"
great work

87
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:56,430
So again it's not our final product to
sing with a very deep larynx but

88
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:01,920
depending on what style you sing you
might want a lower larynx and all

89
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,640
singers even if you're singing a more
contemporary sound will need the ability

90
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:12,419
to drop your larynx as a technical skill
so I do encourage you to work on that.

91
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,920
Start off with the character sounds that's
new to you and then think about

92
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,360
some of those physical relaxation
elements that I gave you and then you

93
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,750
don't have to do it on Bub you can do it
on some of those other vowels but work

94
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,829
with some deeper vowels to help find
that roundness and that richness in the

95
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:33,539
sound is going to open up a huge realm
of possibilities for you no matter what

96
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:37,409
style you sing. So any and everybody I
hope that's been helpful for you guys
