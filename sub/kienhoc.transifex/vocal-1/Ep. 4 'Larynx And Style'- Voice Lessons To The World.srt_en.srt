00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,250
Hi everybody. My name is Justin Stoney I'm 
the founder New York Vocal Coaching here

4
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,100
in New York City.

5
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,110
Welcome to the fourth episode of Voice
Lessons to the World.

6
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,260
The show where we want to answer your
questions from all around the world, and help

7
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,530
you guys as singers to have a great vocal
technique.

8
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,160
Today's question comes from Paul K.

9
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,210
in Phoenix Arizona, and Paul says, "Dear
Justin,

10
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,949
I was told I need to keep my larynx down
at all times when I sing.

11
00:00:56,949 --> 00:01:00,850
Is this true?" Paul, I gotta tell ya, the
question

12
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,440
couldn't be better. They don't get
better than that one. And this is a very

13
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,950
controversial topic.

14
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:09,160
So today's episode is gonna be called
"Larynx

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,800
And Style." Now sense this is so
controversial,

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,220
I want everybody to keep a really open
mind. Because people feel very very

17
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,710
strongly about

18
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,119
their vocal method or their vocal
technique. And that's totally fine.

19
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,050
But if we can keep an open mind, people on both
sides of the coin

20
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,350
are going to have a better experience
whether you come from a traditional

21
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,880
background, classical, or

22
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,500
whether you are into more contemporary
sounds. Everybody keep a little bit of an

23
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,200
open mind on this topic because I know
it's a controversial one. But we can get some

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,270
new ideas here.

25
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:42,080
So Paul it's true that we don't want to

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,610
raise the larynx as we go higher. We
don't wanna

27
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:50,240
squeeze the larynx up to get high notes.
We also don't wanna jam it down

28
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,479
to give ourselves a darker fuller richer
sound.

29
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:58,400
However if you only sing with one larynx -
if you only sing with a high larynx, if you only

30
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,070
sing with

31
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,350
a low larynx, or a any kind of larynx,
really - you're not going to

32
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:08,880
be able to sing a multitude of styles.
And let me show you why that's true,

33
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,000
that position of your larynx is going to
facilitate

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,840
you being able to sing lots a different
styles. How I'm gonna do it is I'm going to take

35
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,910
two songs.

36
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,430
One of them more of a traditional or
classical kind of sounding

37
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,350
song, and one of them more of a rock sound. I'm
gonna

38
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,610
start with my larynx all the way down
and then move it all the way

39
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,769
up, so that you can hear the difference of what different laryngeal

40
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:34,510
positions

41
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,600
sounds like. So the first song I'm going to do is a
little clip from,

42
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,190
"If I Loved You," from Carousel. And I'm going to start
with the

43
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,250
lowest possible larynx that I can do.

44
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,060


45
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,770
"If I loved you

46
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,390
Time and again I would long
to say."

47
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:02,210
K, that's pretty low. Let me raise it a touch.

48
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,350
"If I loved you

49
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,470
time and again I would long to

50
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,710
say - " now that might be about right.

51
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,400
Let me raise it up a touch.

52
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,640
"If I loved you

53
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,540
time and again I would long to say - "

54
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:29,100
Not too bad either. I'll raise it up a touch.

55
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,440
"If I loved you

56
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,060
time and again

57
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,050
I would long to say - " Not really appropriate for the song.

58
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:43,030
I'll raise it all all the way up.

59
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,060
"If I loved you

60
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,819
time and again I would long to say - "

61
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:52,819
Now that sounds insane.

62
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:57,280
So that's the classical or traditional
example.

63
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,409
Now I'm gonna do more for rock song. We'll
try,

64
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:05,060
"When September Ends," by Greenday. I want
to start with the lowest of

65
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,930
larynxes again.

66
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,659
"Summer has come and passed.

67
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:17,810
The innocent can never last.

68
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,199
Wake me up, when September

69
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,940
ends."Now that sounds ridiculous.

70
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,889
Now let me raise it up a touch.

71
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:34,469
"Summer has come and passed.

72
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:38,369
The innocent can never last.

73
00:04:38,369 --> 00:04:43,639
Wake me up, when September ends."

74
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:50,639
It still sounds a little bit weird. I'm gonna 
raise it up.

75
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:53,659
"Summer has come and passed.

76
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:58,469
The innocent can never last.

77
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:00,030
Wake me up,

78
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,270
when September ends."

79
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,220


80
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,979
Startin to sound a little better.

81
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:10,430
Let me raise it up.

82
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,220
"Summer has come and passed.

83
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,500
The innocent can never last.

84
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,520
Wake me up,

85
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,200
When September ends."

86
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,420


87
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,050
Now we're gettin into the zone for rock.

88
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,700
I'll raise it all the way up.

89
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,420
"Summer has come and passed.

90
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,000
The innocent can never last.

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,100
Wake me up, when September ends."

92
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,640
And depending on how much grit and

93
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,650
edge you want in the sound, maybe that would
be appropriate.

94
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,860
So as you can see, when I do the more
traditional sounds

95
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,800
the lower larynxes are gonna sound
better. The higher larynxes sound insane.

96
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,180
When I do rock sound,

97
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,100
the lower larynxes sound just crazy, but
the higher larynxes sound about right.

98
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,140
Now here's the thing. I'm not really
squeezing,

99
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm not really pinching or straining I
don't feel any damaging kinda feelings.

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,800
There's a lot of singers that sing any
of these styles. But the point is, you can sing them all.

101
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,260
But if you're limited by one larynx or
one thinking, you're not going to be able to do that.

102
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:25,760


103
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,750
And maybe you don't want to. But I do
encourage classical singers

104
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,410
to sing a few pop songs. And then if
you're a pop or rock singer,

105
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,660
R&B, maybe sing some classical songs.
It's not going to hurt you.

106
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,090
It's going to give you more possibilities
and especially if you keep your mind

107
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,170
open to the fact larynx can do more than
one thing.

108
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,630
You're gonna coordinations and sounds and
colors

109
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:52,600
and ideas that you've never had before.
So like I say keep the mind open on that one.

110
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,700
But Paul, that's the answer to your question. Do you
have to keep

111
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,150
your larynx down the whole time? I would
say, no.

112
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:03,770
But again, for all people don't squeeze
your larynx to get the high note,

113
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,690
and don't depress your larynx down to
try to have good technique or to try to sound

114
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:13,220
you know big and robust. So I hope that's been
helpful for you guys today as singers.

115
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,640
If you have questions that you'd like to
see as answer on the show, you can send

116
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,500
an email to: Questions@VoiceLessonsToTheWorld.com

117
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,820
We encourage you to keep that open mind and
also to never lose

118
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,190
the joy and the passion. Never let anybody tell you you

119
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,130
can't sing because as you know - that is not true.
