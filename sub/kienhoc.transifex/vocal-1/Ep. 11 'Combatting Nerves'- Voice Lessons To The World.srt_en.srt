00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:19,240
Hi everybody.

2
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,400
My name is Justin Stoney and I'm the founder of New York Vocal Coaching here in New York City.

3
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,259
Welcome to Episode 11 of Voice Lessons to the World. The show we want to help you

4
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:30,239
guys as singers by answering a question
from all around the world.

5
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,500
I'll give you a chance to ask questions
later, but for now our question for the week

6
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,989
comes from Peter E., in Appleton Wisconsin.

7
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:42,090
And Peter says, "Dear Justin, I've got a
pretty good voice,

8
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,199
but I'm always so nervous to sing in
public.

9
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:49,770
Do you have any advice." Well Peter thank
you so much for bringing that up cuz I

10
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,880
know a lot of people

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,700
are wondering about this. What can we do
as singers

12
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,100
to reduce our nerves and increase our
confidence when we're on stage?

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,649
I'm going to give you some tips today.

14
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,100
The first couple might sound a little
obvious, but I think they go overlooked a lot,

15
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:11,100
and so I think it be good to talk about
these. The first them, is technique.

16
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,229
Your vocal technique.

17
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,950
A lot of people neglect their technique, and

18
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,509
then when they get out on stage they
don't have something reliable.

19
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:23,990
If you're doing your vocal technique
exercises

20
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,999
pretty much every day  - if you're working
with a voice teacher that can help you

21
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:27,819
to do that -

22
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:30,990
or if you're working on your own - it
doesn't matter - you need to have a

23
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,619
a routine to train your vocal muscles,

24
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,319
so that they know what to do when you get out out on stage.

25
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:43,200
If you sound pretty good most of the
time and then you get in and nervous situation,

26
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,800
you may not be able to rely on those
muscles. But if you've been doing your technique,

27
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:52,900
and you have something that you can count on, that right there is going to decrease the nerves big time,

28
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,310
because your voice and those muscles are very reliable.

29
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,000
The second one also obvious but good to
talk about: preparation.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,649
Lot of people say, "oh yeah, it's,
it's pretty good.

31
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:08,200
I've got my performance down pretty well," and then they go out on stage and then they really don't.

32
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,060
You need to make sure that
what song you're singing,

33
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,500
you know the notes inside and out.
There's no chance you're gonna miss a note.

34
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,530
There's no chance you're gonna
forget a word.

35
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,830
You've got that thing down. Make sure
that you've prepared so well,

36
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,970
that there's literally no chance that you could forget something.

37
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,100
That also is gonna calm you down so you
don't have to be thinking,

38
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,420
"well what's coming next," when you're on stage.

39
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,500
The third one's a little less obvious.
Breathing.

40
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,830
Now, we all know to breathe. But,

41
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,870
how do we breathe to calm ourselves down?

42
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,550
Everybody would think, "Well, if I need to
breathe, I'm going to,

43
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,020
take some deep breaths before I go out
on stage," so we do -

44
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,660
and we're sort of huffing and puffing

45
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,830
backstage to try did make sure that we 
reduce our nerves.

46
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,850
But one of the great secrets about
breathing,

47
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:06,590
is that the exhalation is the body's
relaxation function.

48
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:15,800
So I need to do a long exhale.

49
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,200
That - will call me down.

50
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,420
Not this - that those deep breaths that we think,

51
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:28,100
"Oh well I gotta do that to reduce my nerves," those are actually going to increase our anxiety.

52
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:33,990
You need to do a long, slow exhale if you're going to calm yourself down before you sing.

53
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:39,800
Now the cool thing is singing itself is
done on a long exhalation.

54
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:46,300
So singing is done on the body's relaxation function. So if you want to reduce your nerves,

55
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,100
make sure that you do you're practicing
what you're about to do,

56
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,740
before you go out on stage, not what you're not about to do,

57
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,800
which is this: (exhales hard).

58
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:03,210
So, the next thing, is acting while you sing. Doesn't matter if you're a musical theatre singer,

59
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,640
or an opera singer, pop, rock -

60
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,760
every style of music - you need to be
somewhat of an actor when you sing.

61
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,810
Every style needs to communicate a
message,

62
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,400
to communicate the lyric, and if you can
focus on that you're going to be a lot less nervous.

63
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,930
If you focus on your sound, you're
constantly judging,

64
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,120
you're constantly trying to make it
sound right, you're constantly hoping

65
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,250
for your best possible sounds and your
ear is too active.

66
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,539
When you perform you want to be
communicating

67
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:37,100
the message, you wanna be conveying
perhaps an emotion depending on the situation.

68
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:43,000
But you want to focus on communicating
the lyric, and not thinking about how you sound.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,900
So become an actor when you sing, if you want to reduce the nerves,

70
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,080
and not be focused on your
voice so much.

71
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,889
And then one more thing about changing
your mindset.

72
00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:01,300
Don't go to impress. Nobody in the
audience wants you to try to impress them.

73
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,889
When you go to see a show you don't sit in the audience thinking,

74
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:09,500
"well boy I really hope somebody really
impresses me," you're there to have a good time.

75
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:13,120
If you see a concert same thing, you don't
say, "Well I want them to impress."

76
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,120
You say, "Well I wanna see my favorite band, I wanna see my favorite singer.

77
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,610
I wanna see them up there having a good
time and I want to have a good time too."

78
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,800
There's rarely an instance where everybody's there too see whether you're going to impress them or not.

79
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,029
Yet when we go out on stage usually we
think,

80
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:33,279
"Oh...everybody's wanting me to impress them." So we've got the whole wrong mindset.

81
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,000
We're trying to be good enough for our
audience,

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,610
when the audience themselves is not really thinking that way.

83
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,419
So if you can think, "My audience wants me to have a good time.

84
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:45,800
I wanna show my audience a good time."

85
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,600
Then, you've got the right mindset. You're not going in there with a judgmental thinking.

86
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:57,000
You're going in there with an entertainment mindset, which is going to be much more helpful,

87
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,900
in reducing your nerves. So you wanna
work out your technique.

88
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,139
You wanna' have something solid that you can rely on.

89
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:06,150
You wanna' make sure your music, your
words, your melody,

90
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,779
everything you're gonna do, has been
totally prepared.

91
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:13,189
You wanna' make sure that before the
performance you can get in touch with

92
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:15,200
your long, slow exhale.

93
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,199
Let it be long.

94
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,879
Let it be easy. Don't huff and puff.

95
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:25,059
Then, you wanna make sure you communicate
those lyrics,

96
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:28,789
you wanna' make sure that you're an actor, and then don't impress anybody.

97
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:32,529
Get the focus off of that, I betcha Peter, and everybody else,

98
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:35,779
if you can follow those things, you're
being way less nervous when you have to

99
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:37,279
perform in public.

100
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,879
So I hope that's been helpful for you
guys today as singers. If you've got questions that

101
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,200
you wanna see as answer on the show, you can send an email to:

questions@voicelessonstotheworld.com.

103
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,770
So we just encourage you guys not to lose the joy,

104
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:55,100
don't lose the passion. Never let anybody
tell you you can't sing, cause' you know that's not true.

105
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,800
And if you're nervous, just go ahead and push through those nerves any way

106
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,200
because it's the only way. You gotta' just  out there and don't let those nerves stop you.

107
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,200
We encourage you to get with a great voice teacher in your area.
