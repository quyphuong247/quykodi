1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
yeah

2
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,010
yeah

3
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:20,690
Hi everybody my name is Justin Stoney and
I'm the founder of New York Vocal

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,280
Coaching here in New York City.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,760
Welcome to episode 28 of Voice Lessons
to the World, the show where we want to

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,820
help you guys as singers by answering
your questions from all over and I'll

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,500
give you a chance to ask questions later

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,390
but a question for this week comes from
Nadia T. in St. Petersburg, Russia and

9
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,159
Nadia writes "Dear Justin, I've been told
that it's bad for me to sing breathily.

10
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,759
Is it really unhealthy for my voice

11
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:48,649
if I sing breathy? Now that's a great
question Nadia and I really appreciate

12
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:53,628
that question and a lot of people think
that breathiness is bad so we're going

13
00:00:53,628 --> 00:00:56,000
to talk about that today about whether
or not

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,960
breathiness can hurt your voice. So is it
bad to be breathy. First of all, let's

15
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,560
make sure we know what breathiness is.
This voice that I'm using right here

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,299
this is not a breathy voice but if I let
some air pass through my voice

17
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:16,010
this then becomes a breathy voice. Ok so
you can hear that difference in my

18
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,150
speaking voice.

19
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:22,640
Now let me just flat out, tell you the
answer to your question now.

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,109
No, it's not bad to be breathy.

21
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:33,439
It's a common thinking about the
voice that breathiness is bad or

22
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,899
dangerous or harmful and I just I don't
want you guys to be afraid of it.

23
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:44,510
It's definitely not something that you
want to do all the time but it certainly

24
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,350
isn't something to be afraid of. I think
a lot of people because they've heard

25
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:52,280
what you've heard are actually afraid of
breathiness.

26
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,049
Now there's a lot of things that the
voice can do that people think are

27
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:03,920
unhealthy: belting, vocal fry, breathiness,
even a high larynx and these are things

28
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,618
that of course if one were to do all the
time could be unhealthy and breathiness

29
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:13,400
is one of those things that could be
unhealthy for you but there's nothing

30
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,620
inherently unhealthy about it.

31
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,599
It's a natural part of your vocal
function so anything done in moderation

32
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:25,998
or for specific reason and done in
control can be just fine for your voice

33
00:02:25,998 --> 00:02:27,210
including breathiness.

34
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:33,270
Now we've done in the past, we talked
about this. A lot of beginners, a lot of

35
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,780
people that are starting off their
voices are just breathy because they

36
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:43,319
haven't learned how to be salad, how to
make strong clean closed sounds.

37
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,939
If you're a beginner and you're starting
off I do want you to not go breathy all

38
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:52,169
the time because it's really limit what
you're doing but if you're more advanced

39
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:54,899
and you need breathiness as a part of
your style,

40
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,960
you shouldn't be afraid of it hurting
your voice, ruining your technique

41
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,469
especially if you do it healthily and
you do it within moderation.

42
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:08,219
So one more thing is just that you
can know more about what breathiness is

43
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:12,840
and why it's not necessarily unhealthy.
You have two vocal cords, I will talk

44
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,740
more about this in the future and
they're controlled in the back by the

45
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,320
arytenoid cartilages

46
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,709
and those bring the cords together.

47
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,640
This muscles that bring the backs of the
cords together. When my cords are

48
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,019
separate,

49
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,409
there's less distance between those
cartilages. When it's clean,

50
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,759
there's even less and then when I go

51
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,149
compressed like this, there's even a
tighter seal.

52
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,560
So we're talking about how much we're
going to be sealing the vocal cords when

53
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,319
we're talking about breathiness. So
that's all it is.

54
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,239
When you go for a breathy sound, you're
basically relieving some of the pressure,

55
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,189
the compression on the backs of your
vocal chords, on the cartilages in the

56
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:56,939
back.

57
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:02,609
So that's what it is. Now it's really a
an important thing you know, it's

58
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,630
style.

59
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:06,719
If I take a song like "Name" by the Goo
Goo Dolls.

60
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:10,109
This is a song, it's just really not
going to sound quite right without

61
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,110
breathy - so I have this song

62
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,539
yeah

63
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:18,649
yeah

64
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:21,649
"even though the moment passed me by.
I still

65
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,780
can't turn away."

66
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:30,149
It's a breathy production. If i did a
clean production of a rock song like

67
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:35,729
that "Even though the moment passed me by" I really doesn't sound right

68
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:41,669
at all or with a vibrato in within a clean
sound and "even though

69
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:45,689
the moment passed me by" would sound even
weirder

70
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:50,009
So being able to make my voice breathy
is actually going to be really important,

71
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:53,009
"Even though the moment passed me by. I

72
00:04:54,670 --> 00:05:02,379
still can't turn away." and I get into my
rock sound. So that's just an example of

73
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:07,449
where in a rock sound and you can hear
this in pop, maybe even in Broadway, where

74
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:11,379
a breathy tone is going to be necessary
to make the song sound like what it is.

75
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:18,129
Now it's not just style though. There's
other benefits to being breathiness. There is

76
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:26,230
of course head voice we know is a kind
of lighter and maybe airier sound than

77
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:30,819
chest voice. It's not as full of a sound.
When your voice goes to head voice, the

78
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:35,560
cords do tend to get a little bit more
separate. So by having the skill of

79
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,790
separation,

80
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,260
you can actually invite head voice into
more of your middle range.

81
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:46,420
This is why breathiness can actually
benefit the voice. Also like I say it's

82
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,949
reducing that compression so this is
going to give you a greater control over

83
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:56,319
your compression. Right if I know how to
make my voice really tight or a little

84
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,449
bit tight or tight at all that I have
control over my compression.

85
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:05,079
That's going to be a really really handy
skill and then finally for those voices

86
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:09,639
that have tended towards too much
squeeze and too much grip. If I have that

87
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,259
ability to be breathy to relieve the
compression then that's also going to

88
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:16,569
help me be less tight with my singing.

89
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:21,040
There's a lot of technical benefits as
well as stylistic benefits to being

90
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:27,490
breathy so again Nadia and all I don't
want you to just run haywire with breathiness.

91
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:33,129
Again anything done in extremes
could be harmful to the voice.

92
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:36,009
There's even operatic sounds, there are opera

93
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:37,659
singers who hurt their voices.

94
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:43,300
You can't overdo anything, breathiness
included. Beginners like I say might want

95
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,790
to stay away from breathiness,you want
to get your voice

96
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:49,840
clean and solid first but I just don't
want people to have this myth that they

97
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,829
just cannot be breathy because it's
going to injure their voices. It's a

98
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:59,709
totally appropriate function of both
style and of technique. So not again just

99
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:02,229
don't be afraid to experiment with it.

100
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,530
Get with a great voice teacher in your
area that can show you how to do it well

101
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:06,219
and

102
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,210
helpfully and just one more thing just
make sure that you don't equate breathiness

103
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:12,069
penis with breath.

104
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:15,639
If you've shove lots of air through a
breathy situation

105
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:19,180
that's probably going to be pretty
uncomfortable. So I hope that's been

106
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,949
helpful for you guys today as singers.

107

Don't stop working hard on your voice
and trying some new things. Don't be

111
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:39,580
afraid to try new ideas and new concepts
and might just find some discoveries in

112
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:40,240
your voice

113
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,780
like your breathiness. Get with a great
