Hi everybody! My name is Justin Stoney and
I'm the founder of New York Vocal

2
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:22,109
Coaching here in New York City.

3
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,500
Welcome to episode 40 of Voice Lessons
to the World, the show where we want to

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,649
help you guys as singers by answering
your questions from all over and I'll

5
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:32,039
give you a chance to ask questions later
but our question for this week comes

6
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:38,039
from Adriana T. in Haslett, Michigan and
Adriana writes "Dear Justin,

7
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:45,179
what is the mix voice and how do I do it?"
Now Adriana, that's the question I think

8
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:47,009
we've all been waiting for.

9
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:50,308
I get so many questions from singers
about what is the mix.

10
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:53,399
How do I mix? Is this singer doing a mix?

11
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,109
Everybody wants to know how to do the
mixed voice and you should. It's totally

12
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:01,019
awesome and we're going to figure it out
together today.

13
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:05,489
The first thing that we need to know
though is what is a vocal register

14
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,480
because the mix is a kind of vocal
registers. We have to know what that even

15
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,760
means a vocal register.

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,060
When I'm talking to you like this, I'm
talking to you in a vocal register

17
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,900
called chest voice but if I talk to you
like this,

18
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,219
I'm talking to you in another vocal
register which is called falsetto.

19
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,349
So I want you guys to try some of these
vocal registers with me. First, in your

20
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:33,390
chest voice, guys and girls just say,
"Hello, my name is Justin." Of course you use

21
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,829
your own name though. Here we go.

22
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:42,480
That was great. Now in your falsetto or
women head voice say, "Hello, my name is

23
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,380
Justin."

24
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:49,589
That's great. Good. So you see that
difference between a chest voice

25
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,939
register and a head voice or falsetto
register. Now there's some other

26
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,189
registers that people sometimes talk
about.

27
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,209
There's a whistle voice that's way way
up there. I'm going to talk about that another time.

28
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,829
There's the fry, the vocal fry which is
this sound right here.

29
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:10,769
We should actually try that one together,
just say "Hello my name is Justin." Try

30
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:11,670
that out.

31
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:15,030
That's good. Great job.

32
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:20,848
So those are all vocal registers. And now
the mix is a kind of vocal register.

33
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:24,419
It's actually more than one thing which
is why people get confused about. It's

34
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:31,048
not just one mix but it's some blend
between the chest register and the

35
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:35,640
falsetto or head voice register that you
guys already felt. So what I'm gonna do

36
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:39,688
for you right now is to you in my
speaking voice, a really smooth

37
00:02:39,688 --> 00:02:45,239
transition from my highest falsetto down
through a bunch of mixes and then into

38
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,599
my chest voice. So you guys really can
get in your ear

39
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:51,988
what a mixed sound like just in my
speaking voice.

40
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:58,408
So here I go. I go "Way up here in my falsetto
I'm talking to way up here in my

41
00:02:58,408 --> 00:03:02,128
falsetto and then I come down a
little bit, it starts to add a little bit of

42
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:05,578
mix to my voice. I get something like
that but if i bring it down a little bit

43
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:09,209
further, I get a little bit more vocal
cords and I get a little bit thicker mix

44
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:12,628
right here and then if I bring it down
more and add a little bit more mix I get

45
00:03:12,628 --> 00:03:15,929
a sound like this and then if I bring it
down a little further I get a sound like

46
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,170
this and then if I bring it down a
little further than vocal cords, I get the

47
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:22,858
sound like this and I'm back to my chest
voice. All right.

48
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:26,489
That's a nice smooth transition from
falsetto down to chest.

49
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:29,400
Now that's just for fun. You guys don't
have to do that at home but if you want

50
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,438
to mess with that, that would be pretty
cool, right.

51
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:36,358
A smooth transition just in your own
speaking voice from chest to falsetto

52
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:37,739
or back and forth,

53
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,938
that's a really awesome thing if you
have that kind of coordination.

54
00:03:41,938 --> 00:03:47,400
That's what we want to get. So now how
does this apply to a song? So many

55
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,959
artists have this great mix sound. We're
going up to high notes but it doesn't

56
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,799
seem very difficult for them. They don't
seem to be pushing or straining very

57
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:56,278
much.

58
00:03:56,278 --> 00:04:00,718
They're probably using a mix. I'm going
to show you a couple things in a song

59
00:04:00,718 --> 00:04:05,009
called "Talking to the moon" by Bruno
Mars and see if you can hear some of

60
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:08,429
these things as they are applied to a
song. So we try a little bit.

61
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:14,000
"I know you're somewhere out there.
Somewhere far away

62
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,449
I want you back.

63
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:24,089
I want you back." I'm not using a little bit of a mix
but now what if I did what most singers

64
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:27,929
would do when I go up to that higher
note which is flip to falsetto. That's one

65
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,269
thing that might happen. This is what it
might happen.

66
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:34,109
"I know you're somewhere out there."

67
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,540
So instead of

68
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:41,990
"I know you're somewhere out there" I get "I know you're
somewhere out there." and I flip to

69
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,949
falsetto.

70
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:47,629
That's not bad to do but that's not what
the artist is doing. That's not a mix.

71
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:50,750
Now the other tendency that people have
is instead of finding that mix, they

72
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:56,600
put a chest voice too much mouthiness,
too much air, too much spread up into

73
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,528
that note and then you get

74
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:03,428
"I know you somewhere out there." and I'm
shouting.

75
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:07,808
So "I know you somewhere out there." more to mix.

76
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:13,539
"I know you somewhere out there." That's
pushing my chest voice up too high so

77
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:17,048
singers will fall on either side of
those. They're going too light into head

78
00:05:17,048 --> 00:05:18,519
voice or falsetto.

79
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:22,959
Or they're going too heavy, too thick into
chest voice and they're not finding that

80
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,298
middle ground. So then,

81
00:05:25,298 --> 00:05:30,459
how do we find that middle ground? We
need to know what the mix is. How am I

82
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:34,718
getting a smooth transition between
those? What's the X Factor? What's the

83
00:05:34,718 --> 00:05:38,139
missing ingredient to make that mix
work?

84
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:41,408
Here's the thing that nobody will tell
you. It is really the truth.

85
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:49,118
the mix is two things. It's a vocal cord
event and it's a resonance event but the

86
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:52,689
vocal cord event is the biggest thing
that people always miss in the world of

87
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:53,949
voice.

88
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:59,559
We need to have compression control not
just compression but compression control.

89
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:03,579
Let's see if we can discover what that
is together. So again using your own name.

90
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:08,649
Let's just have you say, "Hello my name is
Justin." It's nice.

91
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:15,879
Now say it like this, "Hello my name is
Justin." Great.

92
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:20,829
That was a breathy or decompressed voice.
Now try this one.

93
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:28,389
"Hello my name is Justin." Awesome. Now
that's more of a compressed voice. As

94
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,559
we're going up,

95
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:35,259
we don't want to change much of anything
else but often just our compression.

96
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:40,778
Sometimes a little bit more, sometimes a
little bit less, sometimes right in

97
00:06:40,778 --> 00:06:45,129
between. We need to have gradations of
compression and that's what will make

98
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:50,619
the registration with the mix
more smooth. Now the other thing is it's

99
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,839
a resonance event, not just vocal cords.

100
00:06:52,838 --> 00:06:56,319
It's also resonance like I showed you
with the example. If I'm pushing out my

101
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,218
mouth,

102
00:06:57,218 --> 00:07:02,528
I'm going to encourage more chest voice,
too much chest, right? I'm going to be

103
00:07:02,528 --> 00:07:06,668
spreading the sound. I'm going to be
use more air so I want to keep the air

104
00:07:06,668 --> 00:07:10,599
the same. As I move up to that mix i'm
not going to change the air. I'm not going

105
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,340
to change the volume. I'm just going to
keep it the same. Then I'm going to make

106
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:18,669
the air stay in the head like it was
falsetto

107
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:25,420
but let the vocal cords be in a state of
compression. So I'm doing a head air flow

108
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,900
and a chest compression.

109
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:33,399
I hope that makes sense to you guys.
That's the X factor on how to make the

110
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,079
mix work but now

111
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,519
together we're going to try. I got an
exercise here for you. Now

112
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,649
what is going to be is the following.
We're going to do on "B-U-B ... Bub" but

113
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:48,699
this pattern "Bub bub bub bub"

114
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:55,240
So usually what I'll say is guys down
here ladies up here but the mix is the

115
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,170
thing that makes the lady sound real
real strong in their head voice and the

116
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:03,310
guys sound real high and light. It blends
the two together actually. So today I'm

117
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,610
not going to separate. Today, guys and
girls are going to be on the exact same

118
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,030
pitch but to do this I'm going to tell
ladies when to come in.

119
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:13,029
We're gonna start down with the guys and
I'm gonna tell the ladies when to come

120
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:16,029
in with this exercise. Here is your goal.

121
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:22,059
We're going up in pitch. You're not going
to push breath and spread out and you're

122
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,959
not going to flip to falsetto or head
voice. You're going to keep it in a light

123
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:29,589
compressed easy mix. If you have to flip,

124
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:34,509
it's totally fine. It takes time to build
this but we're trying to not go to

125
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:35,288
falsetto.

126
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:39,610
That's the goal right now. So here we
go. This starts with guys only, with guys.

127
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:43,809
"Bub bub bub bub"

128
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,809
Awesome.

129
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:53,059
Great. "Bub bub bub bub"

130
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:54,379
Good.

131
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:57,208
hmm

132
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:01,229
"Bub bub bub bub" Now ladies, join in

133
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,100
right here with us. "Bub bub bub bub" Great.

134
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:13,690
For you.

135
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,690
"Bub bub bub bub" Great.

136
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:23,958
For you.

137
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:28,578
Awesome. Now, some guys are going to have to
flip here, it's totally fine. Do what you

138
00:09:28,578 --> 00:09:29,448
gotta do.

139
00:09:29,448 --> 00:09:35,179
Keep working. "Bub bub bub bub"

140
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,458
That's it.

141
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:42,458
"Bub bub bub bub" Awesome.

142
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,639
"Bub bub bub bub"

143
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,870
Ladies, that was great. One more time up
there, "Bub bub bub bub"

144
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,149
Awesome.

145
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:56,230
hmm

146
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,230
"Bub bub bub bub"

147
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:08,050
Now if anybody's going to falsetto or
head voice you can always come back into

148
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:16,159
your mix any time when we're coming down.
Here we go "Bub bub bub bub"

149
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,799
hmm

150
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:20,799
"Bub bub bub bub"

151
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:28,139
Nice.

152
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:30,449
Ladies might have to drop out.

153
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,450
"Bub bub bub bub"

154
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:40,019
Two more for guys.
"Bub bub bub bub"

155
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,250
Fantastic.

156
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,149
So now I have a lot of info on the mix
that we need it.

157
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:57,750
It's such an important vocal concept, one
of the very very most. So Adriana and all,

158
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,519
I hope that gives you some insights such as
what this mix voice is and it can help

159
