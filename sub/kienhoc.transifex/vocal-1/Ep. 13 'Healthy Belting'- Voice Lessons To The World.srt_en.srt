00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:20,830
Hi everybody. My name is Justin Stoney and I'm the founder of New York Vocal

3
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,390
Coaching here in New York City.

4
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,930
Welcome to Episode 13 of Voice Lessons
To The World. The show where we want to

5
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,050
answer your questions about singing from
all over the world. And I'll give you a chance

6
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:34,000
to ask questions later, but our question
for this week comes from Nicole D in

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,480
Newcastle Australia. And Nicole writes,
"Dear Justin, I'm classically trained and

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,949
I've always been told that belting is
not healthy and that I shouldn't do it

9
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:48,400
or else I'll damage my voice. Is this
true?"

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,900
Well Nichole, that's a hot topic and thank
you for asking that. It's a great question.

11
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:01,700
Let me just tell you simply. No!
No you don't have to be afraid of belting.

12
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,229
It's not necessarily going to hurt your
voice. There's nothing about belting

13
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:10,120
that's necessarily damaging and is
going to cause you to hurt your voice.

14
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,120
That's kind of a myth that's been
floating around for a long time.

15
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,409
Let's talk first about why people say
this.

16
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:24,670
So the first reason, is that it's a
thicker, more athletic coordination.

17
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:30,189
This is true. It is a heavier mechanism
there's more vocal cords coming together

18
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:32,680
in a thicker stronger way.

19
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,490
That's what gives it that powerful sound,
that's what gives it that sometimes "yelly"

20
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:41,680
sound although we don't really want that.
But we have a more of a belt quality

21
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,000
when more of our vocal cords come
together in that thick coordination.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,990
So it's kind of like strength training.

23
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,280
if i'm going to go workout I could lift
weights at the gym and somebody might

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,800
tell me, "Op well you don't want to lift
weights, Justin, because that's going to hurt you.

25
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,710
You could really hurt yourself lifting
weights." And yes you could, but you don't

26
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:07,060
have to, if you know how to do it
healthfully. Same thing with belting.

27
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:13,090
Similarly though, I could work on my
flexibility, vocally or athletically, and

28
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:18,370
I could hurt myself doing that, too. I could
stretch too much. I could overdo my

29
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,280
flexibility to the point where I hurt
myself.

30
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,100
So there's nothing inherently bad or

31
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,450
good about a stronger coordination or a
more flexible coordination.

32
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:34,020
They're just different kinds of physical
usages. So belting is a little bit more

33
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,220
of a strong one.

34
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,540
But it's not necessarily a damaging or
harmful one. But that's one reason why

35
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,600
people say that it's unhealthy. Because
it's a little bit more athletic. But we want to do it well.

36
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,050
Another reason people say this is
because of a stylistic misunderstanding.

37
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,470
Some people say, "Well classical singing,
that's the healthy kind of singing, and

38
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,790
then contemporary music, that's not so
healthy - that's just - people are just, you

39
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,400
know, yelling it out there." And that's not
true either.

40
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,450
There's an equal amount of people that
get hurt singing classical music as do

41
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:08,070
singing pop rock music and you can
really develop a healthy technique for

42
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:13,290
singing classically or singing any other
style. So we don't want to say that, you

43
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:18,150
know, belting is unhealthy because it's
not a traditional style. That - that would

44
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,560
be a big mistake.

45
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,640
And then finally, there's a
misunderstanding about what belting is.

46
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:30,900
You could push your full chest voice
up and be in a belt all the time.

47
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,260
But most really great
belters are not just using chest voice

48
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,460
all the time.

49
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,800
They're not just carrying weight up
there all that all day. That would be like yelling.

50
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:45,780
So a great Belter knows how to switch
gears into a mix and that's our next .

51
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:53,070
So as we move up registrationly, we
start with chest voice but then

52
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:58,560
hopefully we go to a chest dominant mix, and
then to a mix, and then to a head

53
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,870
dominant mix, and then the head voice.

54
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,640
If we know how to switch gears with the
voice, then we're not just belting all

55
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,380
the time, even though we we can make belty
qualities. And what I want to do is show

56
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,500
you kind of what i mean by the
difference between a full chest voice

57
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,140
and then a mixed chest voice. Something
that sounds belty, but is not belty, to

58
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,550
show you a healthier way to do a belty
sound. So if I take,

59
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,510
"Hey Jude" by the Beatles,

60
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:30,740
and I have, "Hey Jude - don't make it bad.

61
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,540
Take a sad song and make it better."

62
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:44,240
Now I used some head resonance in my
chest voice there. "Take a sad song - sad

63
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,789
song and make it better."

64
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:52,789
Now if i do it without, "Hey Jude don't
make it bad.

65
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,950
Take a sad song and make it better."

66
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:07,110
That was more chest voice, "sad song" that's
chest. "Sad song," I added some head

67
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:13,110
resonance, "sad song - sad song - sad song - sad song"

68
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,760
There's different ways that I can make a
strong sound up top. And if i have the

69
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,480
option, if I have developed different
mixes with my voice,

70
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,320
I can sometimes choose the stronger one
if I want that for effect.

71
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:30,750
Or I could do the one that has some head
resonance blended in and that's going to

72
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,500
give my voice a little bit more
flexibility and protection.

73
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,130
So great belters don't just push their chest
voices up there all the time.

74
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,340
If they did maybe that would be
unhealthy but that's not actually how

75
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,600
it's done when it's done well. So then
let's talk about some things to watch out for

76
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,810
so that you can develop a healthy chest
voice that doesn't hurt you and a

77
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,610
healthy belt that doesn't hurt you.

78
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:59,370
The first one is that, that I just said.
Develop a mix. Work to get head resonance

79
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,830
into your middle voice and in to your
chest voice so that you can switch gears

80
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:09,000
if you need to. Next is, you want to make
sure that you don't go louder.

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,400
So many belters that are not so successful and
may be hurting their voices are getting

82
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,340
louder and louder and louder as they go
higher.

83
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,210
That's not great belting. You want to
make sure that you can keep it even.

84
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:25,440
And similarly you want to make sure that
you can keep an even breath.

85
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,400
You don't want to push more air to go
higher and higher because then the cords

86
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,870
are going to have to get tighter to hold
that back and then that tension along

87
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,040
with the thickness is probably going to
cause you some wear and tear and then

88
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,580
that is a place where belting can become
unhealthy for you.

89
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,580
And then finally, don't belt all the time.

90
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,490
Make sure that most of the time you do
switch gears into that mix and pick the

91
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:55,320
full belt as a sort of spice in the
seasoning of what you're doing.

92
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,590
Don't just be belting all the time
because then you're going to give

93
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,850
belting a bad name and make people think
that it is unhealthy, which Nicole, and

94
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,740
everyone, is really not true.

95
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,390
You can find a way to have a healthy
belt and a

96
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:14,400
mixed coordination for your belting. So I
hope that's been helpful for you guys as singers.

97

We just encourage you to keep practicing.

100
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,810
Don't let people tell you that you can't
sing or that you can't belt because

101
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,370
you're going to hurt yourself.

102
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,400
Make sure that you're working on the
right stuff, the right technique. Don't lose the joy,
