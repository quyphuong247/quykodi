[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:09,922 --> 00:00:13,290
In this topic, I want to look
at the issue of nonverbal

3
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:14,414
communication.

4
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:21,070
By that I mean, what is the
message that we are conveying

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:27,460
to our counterparty by our
facial expressions, our dress,

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,859
our gestures, the position
of our body, and so on?

7
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,509
I'm not really trying to be
prescriptive and talk about

8
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:39,070
body language per se, but more
to talk about the issue of how

9
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,579
we communicate without
using any words.

10
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:45,949
And when we talk about nonverbal
communication, we're

11
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:51,740
usually referring to, at a
minimum, these key issues.

12
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,390
The first is our expressions.

13
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,820
That is our facial expression
and what that says to the

14
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,659
counterparty, our eye contact.

15
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:07,319
Our gestures, how we use our
hands and how we use our arms.

16
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:12,729
We're referring to touch,
person-to-person touch, how we

17
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,930
shake hands, whether we
touch the person.

18
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,410
The proximity, that is
how close we are

19
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:19,739
standing to the person.

20
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,089
And also the position, where we
sit, whether we're talking

21
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,120
across a table, or whether we're
talking side by side.

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,320
All of those issues will have
a significant impact on the

23
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:34,389
message that's actually received
by the other person,

24
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,159
not necessarily the message that
we meant to send, but a

25
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:39,500
message that they receive.

26
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,370
And that's what we want to
become conscious of when we

27
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,344
start to think about our
nonverbal communication.

28
00:01:43,344 --> 00:01:46,719
The first two topics I want
to focus on in nonverbal

29
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,129
communication are thinking about
the facial expressions

30
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:51,929
and also your gestures.

31
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,920
Our facial expressions say a lot
about what we're thinking.

32
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,640
They say about what we're
thinking about the other side,

33
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,859
about the hidden side of
our communication.

34
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:08,860
So we want to just be conscious
of the message that

35
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,630
we're sending with our face.

36
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:12,780
You don't want to be looking
sarcastic, or you don't want

37
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,116
to be looking like you think
what the other side's saying

38
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:19,000
is exaggeration or untrue.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,750
You want to try and keep
as neutral a facial

40
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,520
expression as you can.

41
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,980
And this is particularly true
of the frowning and what you

42
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,149
do with your mouth.

43
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,700
I've run lots of training
courses over the years, and

44
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:33,009
it's amazing to me sometimes how
unconscious people are, or

45
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:35,870
unaware people are of
the message that

46
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,360
their face is sending.

47
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,540
The second point I want to talk
about is your gestures.

48
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:43,500
If you're in the business of
influencing people when you

49
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,449
negotiate, you want to be
expressive with your hands, so

50
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:53,754
whether that means emphasizing
a point, whether it can be

51
00:02:53,754 --> 00:02:56,479
being precise and being
descriptive in the way you

52
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,759
talk about something.

53
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,679
You're looking to be excited
and add a bit of variety in

54
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,590
the way that you communicate.

55
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,479
So there are two first things
that we want to think about in

56
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:08,159
terms of our nonverbal
communication.

57
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,549
Next point that I'd like to
talk about is the issue

58
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,469
human-to-human touch.

59
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:17,400
And this is obviously important
in negotiation.

60
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,740
We're thinking about when it
might be appropriate for two

61
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,439
people to touch.

62
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,159
Obviously, there
is the symbolic

63
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,180
issue of shaking hands.

64
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,200
And most people in business
will shake hands at the

65
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,459
beginning of a meeting
and at the end.

66
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,060
Now, I think, this is quite
polite to do, obviously.

67
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,259
And it's also a sign that you
come in peace and that you're

68
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,579
agreeing to things.

69
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,070
So shaking hands
is an important

70
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:41,739
cultural element here.

71
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,560
What we do when we shake hands
has a strong cultural

72
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,250
significance.

73
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,180
So some cultures, for example,
it's appropriate to make

74
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,240
strong eye contact when
you shake hands.

75
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,200
In other cultures, eye contact
can be seen as being a bit

76
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:57,649
confronting, so people
don't necessarily--

77
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,719
aren't expected to make
strong eye contact

78
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,069
when they shake hands.

79
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:04,780
A touch can sometimes be
appropriate in a negotiation,

80
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,289
just to reassure a person.

81
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:08,269
But obviously, there's a
cultural element here, too,

82
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,820
where we want to be a
little bit careful

83
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:12,049
about when we do that.

84
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,219
Next point I want to make is
the issue of eye contact.

85
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:18,750
And eye contact in, again,
this scenario and this

86
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,120
situation will be important
to think about.

87
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,189
So we want to think about how
strong an eye contact do I

88
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:27,930
make and at what point
I make eye contact.

89
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,900
Eye contact, at least in Western
culture, tends to

90
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:35,969
convey a degree of conviction,
that you feel conviction about

91
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,750
the point, or that you believe
in it, or you're

92
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,259
committed to an idea--

93
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,019
making strong eye contact
at a key point.

94
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:45,689
So for example, when you're
quoting your price, for

95
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:48,779
example, is a good time to
make strong eye contact.

96
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:51,819
Or when you're managing an
objection in a sales process,

97
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:54,540
you want to make strong
eye contact.

98
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,310
Obviously, there's a
cultural element.

99
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,930
In some cultures, making strong
eye contact can be a

100
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,160
sign that you're being
confronting or that you're

101
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,470
being quite rude.

102
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,820
And so don't always read a
person who is not making eye

103
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:10,329
contact as being untrustworthy
or shifty in some way.

104
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:12,969
It might just be a cultural
element at play.

105
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,560
Here's a little exercise that
you can try to get a sense of

106
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,339
the impact of eye contact.

107
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:21,369
Grab a partner, and
ask one person to

108
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,350
tell the other a story.

109
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,620
It might be about a hobby or
something they've done in the

110
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,060
last few days, maybe
on the weekend.

111
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,709
And at a certain point in the
middle of their story, break

112
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:31,709
eye contact with your partner.

113
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:35,159
See what the impact is of
breaking eye contact on the

114
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,750
enthusiasm with which they're
telling you the story.

115
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,399
My guess is that it'll
diminish somewhat.

116
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,810
People lose interest when they
feel the other side isn't

117
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,589
interested in what
they're saying.

118
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:46,869
And eye contact conveys
interest.

119
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,540
So if you really want a person
to continue to tell you a

120
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,660
story and to keep revealing
issues about that conflict,

121
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,280
then you want to make eye
contact with them and make

122
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,539
them feel as though the story
is being listened to.

123
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,740
Equally, if you want to shut
them down, maybe you want to

124
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,139
break eye contact.

125
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:04,689
You might want to try this
in the discussion room.

126
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:08,300
Have a go at it, and zip into
the discussion room, and make

127
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:08,870
some comments.

128
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,850
And maybe you might give one
another some feedback there.

129
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,350
Next two things to think about
are the position of your body

130
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,855
and the proximity, that
is how close you are

131
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,129
to the other person.

132
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,689
Normally, if you get too
close, it's indicating

133
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:22,829
aggressiveness.

134
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:24,500
And so you want to make sure
that you're a comfortable

135
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,420
distance away from the person
when you're negotiating.

136
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,490
You also want to think
a little bit about

137
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,100
where you're sitting.

138
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,000
So I know a lot of business
people who have a little side

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,980
table in their office, where
they can move from behind the

140
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,200
desk and go and have meetings,
add a little more comfortable

141
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,990
table where the parties
are more side to side.

142
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,960
Usually, a desk conveys some
degree of a barrier between

143
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,329
people when they're talking
and can be very formal.

144
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:51,990
Of course, sometimes
you may want that.

145
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,970
But if you want to try and
create a more relaxed

146
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,050
atmosphere, normally, you want
to try and be side by side.

147
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,750
So just think a little
bit about those

148
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,319
two issues as well--

149
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,349
proximity and the
body position.

150
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,480
