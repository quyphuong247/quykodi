1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,086


2
00:00:09,086 --> 00:00:11,099
Just going to give you
a little bit of example

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,809
of two different styles of
negotiation we can witness.

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,879
Let's draw a
distinction between what

5
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,439
we call distributive
negotiations and integrative

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,160
negotiations.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,160
I'm going to do a little
bit of a demonstration

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,820
here on the board.

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,899
So if we take the idea of
a distributive negotiation,

10
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:35,049
we can think of it as a
finite amount of resources

11
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:39,609
that the parties are going to
distribute amongst themselves.

12
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:43,859
So a good example of this might
be an annual budget and a bunch

13
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:47,049
of managers trying to
carve up that budget.

14
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:49,369
The IT manager wants
some new software,

15
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:52,280
and HR manager wants to
run a new training courses,

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,310
so it's either the software
or the training course.

17
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,230
We can't have both.

18
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:59,089
The distributive
negotiations usually

19
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,475
involve this idea
of distributing

20
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:03,840
a given amount of resource.

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,950
And if I get, let's say
for the sake of argument,

22
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,560
if I get 60% of that
resource-- this is all mine--

23
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:18,180
then you're going to perceive
that 10% as an amount

24
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,280
that you've given
up, that you've lost.

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,469
And so distribute
negotiations often

26
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:25,409
have a win-lose flavor to them.

27
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,280
Let's contrast that
with what we call

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,530
an integrative negotiation.

29
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,909
In an integrative
negotiation, we

30
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:33,609
don't think of it
as a fixed pie.

31
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:36,620
And often, it isn't a fixed pie
that we're trying to negotiate.

32
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,770
It might be a
complex relationship

33
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:41,839
that we're trying to sort out.

34
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,299
So in this, we can conceptualize
an integrative negotiation

35
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:49,019
as being two sets of interests.

36
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:51,329
And what we're looking
to try and identify

37
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:53,409
is the common ground.

38
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:56,619
And what we try and do in
integrative negotiations

39
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,730
is what's called expand the pie.

40
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,109
We try to work out,
well, what other value is

41
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:05,289
there here for us to try and
re-conceptualize our problem

42
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,590
and think of it as
being a larger issue

43
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,139
that we're trying to solve.

44
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,350
So if we think about Ann
and Joe here for a moment,

45
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:15,799
they are really in a
collaborative situation

46
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,480
where they really
need to negotiate

47
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:21,199
this using this
integrative style.

48
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,609
If they were to approach
their negotiation using

49
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,080
a distributive model, what
they would probably end up

50
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,160
with would be an
agreement that says,

51
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:30,060
all right, you get
50% of the time,

52
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,000
and I get 50% of the time.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,330
And we'll keep a
time sheet, and we'll

54
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,700
sort the problem out that
way, and you get no more

55
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,089
of the researchers' time.

56
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,770
But that would be a
ludicrous agreement,

57
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,750
because sometimes
one person's going

58
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,680
to need more of
the person's time.

59
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,430
So they really need to approach
this negotiation integratively,

60
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,240
sort out how they use the
time of the researchers,

61
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,580
and also sort out
their relationship.

62
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,080
Let's delve a little
bit further now

63
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,320
into distributive negotiations.

64
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,840
Distributive negotiations,
as I've mentioned,

65
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,840
are about distributing a
fixed amount of resource,

66
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,229
a fixed-- the price of
something, or a fixed budget.

67
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:12,679
Sometimes people use the
metaphor of a fixed pie,

68
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,800
we're negotiating
around a fixed pie.

69
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,380
We can only cut so many pieces
of the pie and share it out.

70
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:19,960
We can't magically
create a new pie.

71
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,460
So the idea of a distributive
negotiation is about,

72
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,500
how do we allocate
this fixed resource?

73
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,449
In game theory, we use the
expression, zero sum game.

74
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:34,869
There's only so much, and what
I win, you perceive as a loss.

75
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,920
So in distributive negotiations,
usually the parties

76
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:42,129
don't perceive that they
have an ongoing relationship.

77
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:43,969
They see it as a one-off.

78
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:47,539
So a classic example is buying
a car, or buying a house,

79
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:52,099
and people are solely focused
on the main game, which

80
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,389
is the price.

81
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:54,979
And so, distributive
negotiations

82
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:57,340
are often single-issue
negotiations.

83
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,580
We're really only
focused on one main issue

84
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,990
that we're both
contending around,

85
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,620
this issue of the price
of a good, or a product,

86
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,750
or a large asset like a house.

87
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,699
So the parties behave as though
they're adversaries often

88
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:14,409
in distributive negotiation.

89
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:17,819
They use tactics, they use
coercion, they use power.

90
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:21,778
They're trying to get their win,
and the other side will lose.

91
00:04:21,778 --> 00:04:24,529
So it's a win-lose
scenario often.

92
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:26,989
We do find ourselves in
distributive negotiations

93
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,490
where we're claiming
value, they're

94
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,610
claiming the value that exists.

95
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,290
And we do this by
bargaining effectively,

96
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,970
by challenging the
other side's position,

97
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,120
by influencing the other
side through persuasion.

98
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,250
And sometimes, we
use inducements,

99
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,000
promises, sometimes
we use threats.

100
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,370
But negotiation in
distributive situations

101
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,300
is a very particular
skill, and you really

102
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,759
need to be awake
to a scenario where

103
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,800
it's a distributive situation.

104
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,699
Let's contrast that with
an integrative scenario.

105
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:01,389
An integrative scenario is
one where the parties perceive

106
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:04,509
that it's more of a win-win
situation, where there's

107
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:08,230
potential for them to
integrate their interests

108
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,650
and find common ground, and find
a mutually-beneficial outcome

109
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:14,179
that's going to work
for both parties.

110
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,259
And this is typical
workplace scenarios,

111
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,360
like the Ann and Joe
scenario is a good example

112
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,280
of an integrative situation.

113
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,699
There's enough potential
there for the parties

114
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:24,800
to have to find a
workable agreement that's

115
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,670
going to work for both sides.

116
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,110
So we're not splitting
a fixed asset here.

117
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,170
We're trying to
problem-solve and work out,

118
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,819
are there other issues that
we can bring to the table.

119
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:37,719
So we don't usually
center on one issue

120
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,460
in an integrative negotiation.

121
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:41,419
We bring multiple
issues to the table

122
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,900
that we can trade
concessions around,

123
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:45,829
and that we can
forge an agreement.

124
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:49,050
And this is a good example of
an integrative negotiation,

125
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,175
is this old myth
about the orange.

126
00:05:52,175 --> 00:05:54,410
And two kids are fighting
over their orange.

127
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,160
So they go to their mom
and they say, hey, mom,

128
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,460
we can't split this orange.

129
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:02,379
And the mom says, well,
why do you want the orange?

130
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:04,930
And can you accept
it being cut in half?

131
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,550
And the kids say, no, we
can't have it in half.

132
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,550
Why do you want the
orange, she says.

133
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,134
And one kid says, well, I
want to make orange marmalade.

134
00:06:12,134 --> 00:06:14,550
And the other kid says, well,
I want to make orange juice.

135
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,949
And the mom says, well look,
you can both have what you want.

136
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:18,099
That's sort of the essence.

137
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,020
It's a slightly simple
example, but it's

138
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:22,500
the essence of an
integrative negotiation.

139
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,120
If you haven't really understood
why you want something,

140
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,759
you can't come up with
a workable agreement.

141
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,659
So integrative
negotiation really

142
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,040
involves problem-solving,
and understanding

143
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,720
what the underlying interests
are for both parties.

144
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,798
