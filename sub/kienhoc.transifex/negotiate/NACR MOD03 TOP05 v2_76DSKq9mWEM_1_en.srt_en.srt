2
00:00:09,823 --> 00:00:14,500
In this topic, we're going
to look at the theory of

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,800
constructive versus destructive
conflict.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,120
And this comes from the American
sociologists Lewis

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,380
Coser and, probably more
specifically, Morton Deutsch.

6
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:27,679
And essentially, these ideas
say that there is some

7
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,800
conflict in society that has a
very positive effect on the

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,609
social order and the functioning
of the society.

9
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:39,700
Now, Lewis Coser talked about
this in his book The Function

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,850
of Social Conflict, social
conflict being group conflict.

11
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,310
And he gives a very good example
of how conflict can

12
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,844
have a constructive effect
on the society.

13
00:00:48,844 --> 00:00:54,200
The example he gives is the role
of the Vietnam War and

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,929
the social unrest, and the
demonstration that occurred

15
00:00:56,929 --> 00:01:00,149
around America's involvement in
the Vietnam War as actually

16
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,000
having a positive effect on the
development of a political

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,900
culture in the United States and
politicizing a generation

18
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,950
that hitherto had been fairly
into it politically.

19
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,680
And he said that this group
of young Americans became

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,480
politicized because of the
Vietnam War, and that led to

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,250
future leaders in the society.

22
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,980
So it's basically saying social
conflict has a positive

23
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,030
role on the development
of the society.

24
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,299
And Deutsch's idea in
the same tradition.

25
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,479
He talks about this idea of
constructive conflict and

26
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,340
destructive conflict.

27
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,230
And for Deutsch, conflict
has the potential to be

28
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:44,049
constructive, much like the
Coser idea, but constructive

29
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:47,879
conflict has particular
features--

30
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:52,199
it's resolved using
collaborative methods, it has

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,530
a social learning function,
people develop and develop

32
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,140
insights and reflection from
being in conflict, and the

33
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:05,810
conflict is contained, it's
corralled or contained to the

34
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,574
major issues, that is the issues
don't proliferate.

35
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:11,510
He contrasts that with
destructive conflict.

36
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:17,629
And destructive conflict is
damaging to the society,

37
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:23,099
damaging to the individuals, it
carries on when the initial

38
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:27,400
conflagration, or catalyst, is
resolved, the conflict carries

39
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,000
on, parties use power, they
mount their forces so they

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,919
might start to build

41
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,409
coalitions around the conflict.

42
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:38,930
And the conflict ultimately has
a damaging effect to the

43
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,870
group or to the social context
where it's taking place.

44
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,810
And this has become a very
powerful idea is the notion

45
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,990
that conflict can
be constructive.

46
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:54,210
And it's almost axiomatic now
when we think about the role

47
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:59,010
of conflict, that it has the
potential to be constructive.

48
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:01,669
Now, I guess that the main
practical takeout of this is

49
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:03,829
that not all conflict is bad.

50
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,385
Conflict can actually have a
constructive affect, it can

51
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:10,500
strengthen relationships, if
it's resolved effectively.

52
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,659
We understand one another
more effectively

53
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,219
by having some conflict.

54
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:18,219
Conflict in an organization
that's allowed to be expressed

55
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:21,109
or become manifest in a
constructive way can lead to

56
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,140
more creative solutions.

57
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:26,969
It can lead to resolving
problems that have remained

58
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:31,120
inert or unaddressed for long
periods of time, holding back

59
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,610
the organization.

60
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,390
So in the case of Gabe and
Maria, their conflicts that

61
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:39,789
around their renovation, they
might have conflict with each

62
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:41,840
other, they might have conflict
with their neighbor,

63
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,030
they might have conflict with
the people who are working for

64
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:48,439
them, they might conflict
with their architect.

65
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:52,370
Those conflicts could either
be constructive or

66
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,409
destructive.

67
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:55,139
It might be good for
their relationship.

68
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:58,299
It might be good for the quality
of the work to have

69
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,500
some conflict.

70
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,300
Or that could be destructive.

71
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,240
it might be damaging to their
relationship and it could

72
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,719
produce a conflict
that ends up in a

73
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:10,949
tribunal or in a court.

74
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:14,369
The Deutsch and using this idea,
the key thing is that we

75
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,620
want to channel conflict towards
constructive ways of

76
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,449
resolving and finding
a resolution.

77
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:23,490
You might want to think about
a conflict that you've had,

78
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,879
perhaps, in your life.

79
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,829
Or maybe you're involved in
a conflict at the moment.

80
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:29,379
Can you think of any ways
that this conflict is

81
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:31,699
constructive for you?

82
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:34,589
In what ways, is it maybe
being to your long-term

83
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:36,659
benefit to have been
in a conflict

84
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,120
some years ago, perhaps.

85
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,750
Maybe it's developed
you as a person.

86
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,850
Think about that next time
you're in a conflict--

87
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,990
can I channel this conflict
to a constructive way of

88
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,590
resolving it and see that there
might be some benefits

89
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:50,839
to having conflict?

90
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:54,264
