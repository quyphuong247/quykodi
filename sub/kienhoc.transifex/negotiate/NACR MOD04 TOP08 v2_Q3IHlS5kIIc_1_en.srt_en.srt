00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,782


2
00:00:09,782 --> 00:00:13,699
In this topic, we're going
to look at assertiveness.

3
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:17,219
Assertiveness essentially
means to assert

4
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:20,989
your rights, or
interests, or position

5
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:23,009
in the face of some resistance.

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,790
And we often need
to be assertive when

7
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:26,756
we're negotiating or
resolving conflict

8
00:00:26,756 --> 00:00:28,129
because, often,
people are trying

9
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:32,009
to block what we're trying to
say, or block our position.

10
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:37,909
So learning to communicate your
side of the bargain effectively

11
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:40,419
is a pretty fundamental skill.

12
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:45,109
When we're being assertive,
what we're often trying to do

13
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:51,204
is to emphasize what our
interests are in a situation.

14
00:00:51,204 --> 00:00:53,549
And that may sound like
we're being a bit selfish,

15
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:56,019
but we're not trying
to do that here.

16
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,790
What we're trying to
do is to make sure

17
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:01,240
that the other side is
clear on what we are looking

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,278
for in a situation, or
what our rights might be.

19
00:01:05,278 --> 00:01:07,489
And so, it's a pretty
important skill,

20
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:10,000
particularly when you're
dealing with somebody who's

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,459
pushing back, or blocking,
or being defensive.

22
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:16,569
Because often we fall into
either attacking or falling

23
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:18,129
back and being submissive.

24
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:21,750
What we want to do is to
keep fairly firm ground,

25
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,459
and keep to our position,
and assert ourselves,

26
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,364
even in the face
of some resistance.

27
00:01:26,364 --> 00:01:32,310
Now, let's take an example
from the Ann and Joe situation.

28
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,230
Let's imagine Ann wants to
raise this concern she's

29
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,400
got about sharing these
resources in a workplace

30
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,870
with Joe, and
Joe's blocking her.

31
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,540
How would Ann start a
conversation like that?

32
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,140
Normally what we try and do when
we teach people to be assertive

33
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,489
is to emphasize the idea
that you start with the I.

34
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:58,689
So Ann might say something like,
I'm beginning to get concerned

35
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:01,099
about this, Joe, or
I'm worried about how

36
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:03,819
we share this
resource, Joe, or I

37
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:06,709
need to talk to
about how we share

38
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,758
the time of these researchers.

39
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,239
She's starting with the
word I, which is obviously

40
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,320
far more preferable
to starting with you.

41
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,560
Joe, you need to
give me a researcher.

42
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,229
Joe, you're hogging
the researchers.

43
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:23,509
Joe, what do you think
you're doing by taking all

44
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:25,129
the researchers' time.

45
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:29,409
We want to get away from that
you, that accusatory, that very

46
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:31,699
attacking style
of communication,

47
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:35,299
and move it back to
focusing in on I.

48
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,260
I'm concerned about,
I'd like to talk to you

49
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:39,909
about, I need to raise
something with you.

50
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:43,340
And this makes it a
little bit more neutral.

51
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,400
It's more about the
problem here, and less

52
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,950
about an accusation.

53
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:50,649
So sometimes when people
are faced with conflict

54
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,930
they adopt what I would
call a very passive approach

55
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,170
to the conflict.

56
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:58,159
Some people use the
term passive-aggressive.

57
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,599
And passive conflict
approach is where

58
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,019
you try to convey
the message passively

59
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,170
to another person you're in
conflict with that they're

60
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:10,549
doing something wrong.

61
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,380
So Ann, for example,
might freeze Joe out.

62
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:16,329
She might not invite him to
a meeting that she holds.

63
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,620
She might white-ant him
with some negative comments

64
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,310
to peers about Joe.

65
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,039
She might avoid Joe.

66
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,269
And people often do that
in workplace conflict.

67
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,409
They avoid one another, rather
than actually going and talking

68
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:31,379
to the person.

69
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:35,090
So that passive approach tends
to not really get you anywhere.

70
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,500
It's sort of icing
them out, giving them

71
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,860
the silent treatment, and trying
to convey to then that there's

72
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,880
some conflict that way.

73
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,349
We can counter that,
or we can contrast

74
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:50,069
that with a active approach.

75
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,239
And an active approach is
where Ann sets an appointment

76
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,030
with Joe to talk about the
problem that they've got.

77
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,360
And she thinks about
some assertive messages,

78
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,270
and they try and
diagnose and problem

79
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,590
solve, and work collaboratively
towards sharing these resources

80
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,700
more effectively.

81
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:07,000
To do that, Ann's
got to remember

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,259
she's got to be assertive.

83
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:10,179
Because in all
likelihood, she's going

84
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,420
to get some push-back from
Joe, particularly initially.

85
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,689
What do you mean?

86
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,490
Or I don't see
what you're saying.

87
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,959
It's not a problem for me.

88
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,970
They're the instances
where Ann has really

89
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,425
going to need to stick to her
guns and use her assertiveness.

90
00:04:23,425 --> 00:04:26,245
If you're new to the
idea of being assertive,

91
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:31,990
a nice way to think about it is
really emphasize the word, I.

92
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,769
And people actually
call this way

93
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:36,359
of communicating an I message.

94
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,610
And let's give you an example
here from the Ann and Joe case.

95
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,050
And let's say Ann's
trying to confront

96
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,629
Joe about this issue of the
researchers being allocated

97
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:51,750
to his work, and
she's got no support.

98
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,345
So the way we approach an I
message, particularly when

99
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:56,470
you're starting out with,
is use a little template.

100
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,340
Now, it's a simple template,
but it's one that I recommend.

101
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:01,109
So it starts out with this.

102
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:06,350
When you, I feel,
because, and I prefer.

103
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,510
And I'm focusing
here on using I, OK?

104
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:14,719
So Ann could say, when
you allocate the resources

105
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,180
to all of your
work, I feel put out

106
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,090
because it's really
a shared resource,

107
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:23,329
and I'd really prefer it if
you contact me first and talk

108
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:26,129
about what my work schedule is.

109
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:31,560
So it's a pretty simple way of
Ann communicating that message.

110
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,850
She doesn't need to
get emotional about it.

111
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:38,560
She doesn't need to be
really pushy or aggressive.

112
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,040
She speaks in a calm
voice, focusing on the I,

113
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,480
and communicates the
message, what the issue is,

114
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,765
the impact of it, and what
she'd prefer to see happen.

115
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:51,319
And that's really the
essence of assertiveness.

116
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,029
In fact, I often
suggest to people

117
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:54,654
that you think about
your tone of voice

118
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,320
when you're being
assertive, and imagine

119
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:58,530
you're telling someone
what your phone number is.

120
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:00,949
Use that exact
same tone of voice

121
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:03,509
when you're trying
to be assertive.

122
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:06,548
