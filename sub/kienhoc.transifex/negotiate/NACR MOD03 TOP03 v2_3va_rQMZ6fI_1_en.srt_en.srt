00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,894


2
00:00:09,894 --> 00:00:13,549
In the last topic, we looked
at biological or inherent

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,850
explanations for human conflict
and aggression.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:22,490
In this topic, we're going to
look at a learning approach,

5
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,169
also known as a contingency
theory.

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,090
And that is that our conflict
behavior is contingent upon

7
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:31,300
the situation, the structure of

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,990
society, and on our learning--

9
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,030
that that propels us towards
aggressive, violent conflict.

10
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:45,049
The learning approach is most
associated with the process of

11
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:47,269
human socialization.

12
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:51,859
And this is the idea that we
learn behavior through our

13
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:56,950
rearing, through the society,
through the behaviors that are

14
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,310
reinforced or that
are punished.

15
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,129
Particularly children, as they
learn, they learn cooperative

16
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,829
ways of behavior, cooperative
ways of playing, for example,

17
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:10,980
that lead to subsequent
cooperative

18
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,790
behaviors as adults.

19
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,120
The father of socialization, as
many of you would know from

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,170
other studies, is John Watson,
who, at the beginning of the

21
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,240
20th century, argued that he
could take any child and turn

22
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,659
that child into whatever he
wished through education and

23
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,450
learning and rearing.

24
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,350
Of course, later through the
20th century, we know about

25
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:37,099
Pavlov's experiments with dogs
and looking at developing the

26
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:40,589
theory of classical
conditioning, where a dog was

27
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,620
given food upon the sound of a
ringing bell and salivated in

28
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,500
readiness for the food.

29
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,439
Subsequently, Pavlov developed
his theory by ringing the bell

30
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,179
and not delivering the food and
the dog still salivated.

31
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,460
And this developed theory of
how behavior is learned.

32
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:01,909
This theory was taken and
developed by BF Skinner.

33
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:04,920
And Skinner developed operant
conditioning, where he did

34
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,370
experiments on mice.

35
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:10,580
And what he proved was that
behavior can be reinforced--

36
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:17,170
that the mice could learn how to
earn the pellet by shifting

37
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:19,059
its behavior.

38
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,400
And this theory is very dominant
now-- the idea of

39
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,500
behavioral reinforcement, that
we can reinforce behaviors

40
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,650
through rewards.

41
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,629
You think in management terms
about something like

42
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:34,069
performance-based pay or bonuses
in the workplace.

43
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:38,629
That's essentially reinforcement
theory in action

44
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:42,719
a motivational theory, or
behavioral theory that

45
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,400
reinforces certain behaviors.

46
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,140
Another important theory in
the development of this

47
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:51,250
learning approach is
the theories of

48
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,060
Dollard, Doob, and Miller.

49
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,080
And they talked about
what they dubbed the

50
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,850
frustration-aggression
hypothesis.

51
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:03,229
They argued that violent
aggression is always the

52
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:08,949
result of frustration, and that
the pathway, therefore,

53
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:13,250
to eliminating or minimizing the
effect of conflict is to

54
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,310
identify and address the source
of the frustration.

55
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,780
And that could be social
disadvantage.

56
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,210
It could be a psychological
disorder.

57
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,890
It could be some behavioral
problem

58
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:29,439
that needs to be addressed.

59
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:35,139
So that is quite a constructive,
I guess, view of

60
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:35,929
human behavior.

61
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,080
We're looking at how can we
address the structural sources

62
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,390
of conflict.

63
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:45,649
Another important theorist
is Albert Bandura.

64
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,310
And Bandura's social learning
theory looked at three main

65
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,659
sources of violent conflict--

66
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:57,689
familial context, so the
family of origin as

67
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:03,609
predetermining or shaping the
way that a human being handles

68
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,560
conflict and its
aggressiveness.

69
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,099
He also talked about the
subcultural context.

70
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:13,650
So there's the norms of the
society, the cultural context

71
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,860
where the child has
been raised.

72
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,139
It might, for example, be
a situation of social

73
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:23,139
disadvantage where conflict
is commonplace--

74
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:26,889
conflict with police, for
example, or lots of crime.

75
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:32,769
And the third area is the
symbolic messages that the

76
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:36,459
child is exposed to-- so
particularly, for example,

77
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:41,569
very violent illustrations on
TV, for example, violent

78
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:46,689
movies, violent videos, children
being exposed to very

79
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:51,069
violent imagery as
they're raised.

80
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:54,639
And that social learning
theory argues that our

81
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,169
propensity towards violence is
largely stemming from our

82
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,770
upbringing and the messages and
the images that we've been

83
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:02,979
exposed to.

84
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,800
Bandura's also useful to think
about in terms of his later

85
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,259
theory of self-efficacy.

86
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:14,860
And Bandura argued that human
beings become more competent

87
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,980
and more confident in their
own abilities and their

88
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,620
ability to shape and influence
their situation through their

89
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,500
social learning.

90
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,180
And if they learn new
ways of behaving--

91
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,009
for example, new ways of
resolving conflict--

92
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:30,500
those skills become skills
that human things become

93
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,970
confident in and are
able to reuse.

94
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,210
And they become part
of their behavior.

95
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:39,099
And that's a very useful theory
to think about in terms

96
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,800
of how we train people
toward new ways

97
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,660
of resolving conflict.

98
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,650
So let's do a little reflection
exercise.

99
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:48,750
I would like you to think about

100
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,949
your own view of conflict.

101
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:53,620
Reflect on the two schools of
thought that we've talked

102
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,649
about over the last
two topics.

103
00:05:55,649 --> 00:06:00,449
And think about what does your
view of conflict say about

104
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:03,769
human behavior or your
view of humans?

105
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:06,539
Are you hopeful that we
can learn new ways

106
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,689
of resolving conflict?

107
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:11,209
Or do you think that violence
and warfare are always

108
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:14,310
inevitable and a part of
the human experience?

109
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,199
You might like to discuss
these issues in

110
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,829
the discussion boards.

111
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:22,329
I'd also like to recommend a
book for you here, which is

112
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:23,639
Conflict Resolved,?

113
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,659
A Critical Assessment of
Conflict Resolution by a

114
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,780
colleague of mine,
Alan Tidwell.

115
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:31,199
It gives a really good overview
of the theories I've

116
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,319
just been talking about over
the last two topics.

117
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:37,524
