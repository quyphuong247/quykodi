00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,611


2
00:00:09,611 --> 00:00:11,405
Welcome to module three.

3
00:00:11,404 --> 00:00:12,779
In this module,
we're going to be

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:15,089
looking to conflict resolution.

5
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:17,625
In the first two modules,
we've been looking more

6
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:18,375
about negotiation.

7
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:21,910
In this module, we start
looking at conflict.

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,070
And in this module,
what I want to introduce

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,789
you to are some of the main
theories of conflict resolution

10
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:31,980
and draw a distinction between
negotiating and resolving

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,490
conflict.

12
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,550
And this is, in some ways,
a subtle distinction.

13
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:39,029
In some ways, it's quite
a large distinction.

14
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,840
When we think about how we
usually use negotiation,

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,370
it's usually used
in business contexts

16
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:49,369
and to solve problems-- things
that are relatively contained

17
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:52,489
and sometimes that
are quite routine.

18
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,150
So we contrast
that with conflict.

19
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:58,239
When we are in a
conflict situation,

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,920
we need to undertake a more
prolonged and more detailed

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,890
process of resolution.

22
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,890
So we can draw a distinction
between negotiating

23
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,700
and resolving conflict.

24
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,519
When we think about
this distinction,

25
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:13,659
let's draw a distinction
between something

26
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:16,590
that's quite routine, that
occurs in everyday life.

27
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,829
Let's say I smash into
your car in the car park.

28
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:23,230
Well, we're going to
simply exchange numbers.

29
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,859
I'll probably have to give you
some money for the repairs.

30
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:28,599
And both of us will
move on with our lives

31
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:33,089
without really seeing that
event as being very disruptive

32
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,100
or in any way an extremely
emotional experience.

33
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,809
It's going to be something
that we see as quite routine.

34
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,570
And we're simply
negotiating the settlement.

35
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:46,239
In a conflict
situation, however, we

36
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,500
see that the conflict starts
to overtake our lives.

37
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,349
It engages the whole person.

38
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:56,750
We start to ruminate
over the issues.

39
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,260
We lose sleep.

40
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,980
We become emotional.

41
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,700
Maybe we start to enlist
support of others.

42
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,150
Maybe the issues
start to proliferate.

43
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,699
And therefore, we need
to draw this distinction

44
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,120
between conflicts
and negotiations.

45
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,349
And we're going to need to
invest a fair amount of time

46
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:19,239
and analysis into
resolving that conflict.

47
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,189
In this module, I want to build
on this theme of the difference

48
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:25,530
between conflict
and negotiation.

49
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,569
And I want to look
at some main theories

50
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:30,780
in the field of conflict
and conflict resolution.

51
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,240
And I also want to
start to introduce you

52
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,760
to some of the
main ways that you

53
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,129
can go about resolving conflict.

54
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:40,729
We're going to use the
example of a couple called

55
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:42,299
Gabe and Maria.

56
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,390
And they've just
moved into a house

57
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:46,686
that they plan on renovating.

58
00:02:46,687 --> 00:02:48,270
They're going to
have some negotiating

59
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,700
to do with their builder,
maybe be with the council.

60
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:55,119
They'll also probably have
maybe some interaction

61
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,289
with their neighbors as
they move their plans

62
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:01,729
towards finalization
and start building.

63
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:04,429
If they have a conflict with
their next door neighbor,

64
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:09,460
then they may need to go
into some process of conflict

65
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,530
resolution, because
obviously, they

66
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,560
have an ongoing relationship.

67
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,009
They're gonna still be
living next to these people.

68
00:03:16,008 --> 00:03:17,549
And that's one of
the critical points

69
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,450
about conflict resolution.

70
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:23,259
Often, people who are
in conflict situations

71
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:25,379
have ongoing relationships.

72
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,569
And probably, a
great example of that

73
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:32,129
would be two parents who
divorce who have children.

74
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,060
They've got an
ongoing relationship

75
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,090
through their children.

76
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,250
That is, they're going
to be both participating

77
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,219
in the parenting of those
children as they grow up,

78
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:44,180
despite the fact that
they're no longer married.

79
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,740
And it's important, therefore,
that the way that they resolve

80
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,260
their dispute-- either divorce,
their shared assets, settling

81
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:54,039
the house, and so
on-- is collaborative,

82
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:56,900
because they want to be able
to have an ongoing relationship

83
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,120
that's productive
through their children.

84
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,610
So for this reason,
when we have conflict

85
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,770
with people who have
ongoing relationships,

86
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,770
we want to try and
use an approach

87
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,650
to resolving the conflict that
allows them to fully resolve

88
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,930
the conflict, not just
settle the dispute,

89
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,040
so that they can talk about
the relationship issues as well

90
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,689
as the legal issues around
the house settlement.

91
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:21,379
So for this reason, in
conflict situations,

92
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:24,319
we've seen the emergence
of a lot of approaches

93
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,209
where a third party becomes
involved, in particular,

94
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:28,799
mediation.

95
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,930
The important point
to remember here

96
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,780
is that we need to
effectively diagnose

97
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:37,549
the situation that
we're dealing with.

98
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,879
If we have quite clearly
a dispute in front of us

99
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,439
and we need to just simply
settle and distribute

100
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,040
the assets or make some
recompense through me paying

101
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,670
for the bump in
your car, then we've

102
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:54,800
got what we would call
a bargaining approach.

103
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,069
However, if we've
got a conflict and it

104
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:02,589
requires us to transform our
relationship in some ways

105
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:08,029
and requires us to really
engage in a more comprehensive

106
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:11,789
approach, where we talk about
transforming our relationship,

107
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,830
then we need to use an
analytical approach.

108
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:18,879
And this requires us to think
more carefully about how things

109
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,110
maybe need to change in our
relationship for the conflict

110
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,680
to have a lasting resolution.

111
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,269
And a lasting
resolution's important,

112
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:28,799
because we don't
want the conflict

113
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,300
to resurface or flare up
again because we haven't

114
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,000
adopted the right approach.

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,990
If we use a bargaining approach
in a conflict situation,

116
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,150
we may settle one
part of the dispute,

117
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:42,149
but we don't actually address
the underlying conflict.

118
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:45,459
And this is where we need
to get our thinking right

119
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:48,899
and analyze the situation
correctly and then apply

120
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:51,149
the appropriate remedy.

121
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:54,358
