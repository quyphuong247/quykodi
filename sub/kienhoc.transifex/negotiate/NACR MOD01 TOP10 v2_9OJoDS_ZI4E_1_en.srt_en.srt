2
00:00:10,073 --> 00:00:14,710
What we need to do to be
effective around negotiation

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,765
is to really try and get
our thinking right.

4
00:00:16,765 --> 00:00:19,260
And that's what I want to
cover in this topic.

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,070
So we need to think, when we set
about negotiating, about

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,350
these cognitive heuristics that
we can fall victim to--

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,050
shortcuts.

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,179
We need to question
our assumptions.

9
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:33,590
We need to question the
conclusions that

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:34,620
we're coming to.

11
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:36,739
And that's where it can be
really useful to have someone

12
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,109
to bounce your ideas off.

13
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:41,950
And I often think it's a good
idea to have somebody who's

14
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,580
supporting you in a negotiation,
or somebody who

15
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,960
gives you a sense
of perspective.

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,740
One of the things that is
important to think about is

17
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,329
that human beings like
to simplify things.

18
00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:01,429
We like to organize things
into clear groups--

19
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:06,799
good/bad, friend/foe, us/them.

20
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,979
And sometimes, this type of
binary thinking gets us into

21
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,740
quite faulty conclusions about
ourselves and about our

22
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:17,589
counterparts.

23
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,170
And we tend to blow out of all
proportion their negative

24
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,960
traits, and perhaps
overemphasize our

25
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,119
own positive ones.

26
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,880
This idea of complexity in
negotiation is worth pausing

27
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:30,979
and thinking about.

28
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,840
Negotiations are complex.

29
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,170
They're rarely black
and white.

30
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,239
And there's often this grey
territory, this ambiguous

31
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:42,189
territory that we need to
somehow negotiate and manage

32
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:45,230
carefully, without leaping
to conclusions.

33
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,350
Be conscious of when you're
leaping to conclusions.

34
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:51,819
Let me give you a couple of
examples of how we do this.

35
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:55,379
One is what's called the
attribution error.

36
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:58,359
And the attribution error
often occur is in

37
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:01,719
cross-cultural negotiations,
which we'll come back to later

38
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,920
in the course.

39
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,480
But attribution error's
essentially this--

40
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,490
I blame you for your negative
behavior on the sort of person

41
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:15,080
you are, or the sort of group
you're a member of.

42
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,110
So I might say, oh, that's a
typical bean counter view of

43
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,990
the world if I'm referring
to an accountant

44
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,670
or a financial manager.

45
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:26,219
Or that's such an HR fluffy way
of looking at the world.

46
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:30,830
Or you only think that way
because of whatever group

47
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,469
you're a part of.

48
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:36,770
And at the same time, my own
negative behavior, I

49
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,096
rationalize as being caused
by the situation--

50
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:42,219
oh, I was under a
lot of stress.

51
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:44,240
Oh, I'm not normally
like that.

52
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,150
So we tend to leap to
conclusions about the other

53
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,260
side, and we draw stereotypes.

54
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:52,409
And we blame their behavior
on the group membership.

55
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:55,590
This is what's called the
ultimate attribution error.

56
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,870
We need to think beyond just
black and white stereotypes

57
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,349
about human behavior if we're
going to get our thinking

58
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,030
right and become effective
negotiators.

59
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,560
Let me give you another example
of where we can

60
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,090
oversimplify things.

61
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,219
In some negotiation situations,
known as

62
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:17,960
multiparty negotiations, we
have a range of different

63
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,300
views, different stakeholders,
as they're called, who all

64
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,610
have an interest
in the outcome.

65
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,535
Let's take a typical example.

66
00:03:27,534 --> 00:03:32,129
If we've got the issue
in the center here--

67
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,060
let's say it's a community
development.

68
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,199
It might be a new bridge.

69
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:39,030
It might be extending
the licensing laws

70
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,300
on the local pub.

71
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,060
It could be a bike
track through the

72
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,439
center of the city--

73
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,460
some sort of issue.

74
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,800
Often, development projects
are like this.

75
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:55,660
And then you have a range of
different people who all have

76
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:59,210
a stake, or an interest,
in the outcome.

77
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:03,120
And these are community groups
who have some input to the

78
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,409
issue, either blocking the
issue, or having some input,

79
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:08,479
or advocating for it, trying
to support it.

80
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,579


81
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,350
This is what's called a
multiparty negotiation.

82
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,390
What we often see happen in
these types of situations is

83
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:23,219
the formulation of
coalitions--

84
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,100
that is, groups join
together to add

85
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,800
weight to their argument.

86
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,520
And in doing so, what we often
find is that they need to make

87
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,979
compromises so that they can
find that common ground.

88
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,560
And we often have a tendency to
want to simplify a complex

89
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,730
issue into a us/them,
yes/no proposition.

90
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,480
So rather than this negotiation
being a multiparty

91
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:55,590
issue, people want to make it
a two-party negotiation, us

92
00:04:55,589 --> 00:05:04,679
and them, for or against.

93
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,139
And it's rarely as
simple as that.

94
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,099
So we really need to watch out
for this simplification,

95
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,620
because we will obscure the
key issues for individual

96
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,350
parties, and we'll often create
overly simplistic

97
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,600
solutions that may not be
effective and lasting.

98
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,560
So this module has really looked
at an introduction to

99
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,160
the field of negotiation.

100
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,350
It's really focused on how you
need to think differently to

101
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,220
be an effective negotiator.

102
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,280
We've talked about some
language issues.

103
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,519
We've also talked about some
common thinking errors, or

104
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,689
cognitive heuristics--

105
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:43,550
shortcuts that we use to try and
make quick decisions that

106
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,579
sometimes don't service us
particularly well in terms of

107
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:49,569
securing a good outcome.

108
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:52,370
So I hope this has been a useful
investment of your

109
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,850
time, and I look forward to
seeing you in the next module.

110
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,632
