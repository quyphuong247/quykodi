00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:13,800
Hi, my name's Andrew Heys, and
welcome to this subject,

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,929
Negotiation and Conflict
Resolution.

4
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:19,820
I'm a lecturer at Macquarie
Graduate School of Management

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,870
at Macquarie University
in Sydney, and I teach

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,140
negotiation in our MBA.

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,060
In this subject I'm going to
introduce you to the field of

8
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:31,459
negotiation and conflict
resolution.

9
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,020
I want to introduce you to a
little bit about this world

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,550
that I inhabit with my students
and with my clients.

11
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:43,659
I want to give you some ideas
about how you can take your

12
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:47,539
negotiation and your conflict
resolution to the next level.

13
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:50,899
The field of negotiation,
conflict resolution, is quite

14
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:53,140
fascinating and I've been lucky
enough throughout my

15
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,939
career to work as a university
lecturer, a corporate trainer,

16
00:00:57,939 --> 00:01:01,949
a consultant, and a mediator,
involved in this field both as

17
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,569
an educator and as
a practitioner.

18
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,189
So I want to bring some of that
experience to the table

19
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:09,899
in this course and give you an
idea of not only some of the

20
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,150
knowledge in this field, but
also some of the practical

21
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,570
aspects of how you can
take these skills and

22
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:17,169
put them into practice.

23
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:21,420
It's a fascinating area and my
students often talk to me

24
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,299
about how the frameworks and the
ideas and the skills that

25
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:28,450
they've learned in my courses
have been useful not only for

26
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,200
them in their business lives--

27
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,409
whether that be negotiating with
their customers or the

28
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:33,280
suppliers--

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,930
but also in their personal lives
in terms of enhancing

30
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,500
their relationships with their
families, with their partners,

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,459
in their communities.

32
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:46,109
And so it's a really practical
skill for you to develop

33
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:48,439
through this format.

34
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,959
Negotiations apply in families,
in personal

35
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,369
relationships, in communities,
in national affairs, and

36
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,070
international affairs.

37
00:01:57,069 --> 00:02:00,009
So there's a lot of great
examples we can draw upon and

38
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,920
I'll be doing that throughout
the course.

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,579
In this course we'll be looking
at four modules.

40
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:09,120
The first module is called
Thinking Like a Negotiator.

41
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,409
In this module, what I want to
do is introduce you to some of

42
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:16,949
the terminology that we use to
describe different elements

43
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:18,699
within a negotiation.

44
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:21,899
I want to introduce you to
some different styles of

45
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,300
negotiation.

46
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,610
This will help you recognize the
type of negotiation that

47
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,710
you're in and the way that you
need to respond and behave to

48
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,060
be successful within
that given context.

49
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,819
I also, in this first module,
want to look at the concept of

50
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,680
thinking like a negotiator.

51
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,890
I want to introduce you to
some thinking errors that

52
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:47,619
people commonly make when
they're negotiating.

53
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,990
These stem from some pretty
fundamental intuitive

54
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:57,760
responses we have to a context
such as negotiation.

55
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,329
In the second module, I want
to look at some different

56
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,910
phases of negotiation, and I
want to introduce you to what

57
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:08,379
we can broadly term five main
phases that we see in

58
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:10,769
negotiation, passing through.

59
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,170
I want to introduce you to some
skills that you need to

60
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:17,500
use at each stage of that
negotiation, and some things

61
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,310
to watch out for, and some
errors that people can make.

62
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,599
So we'll start to really break
down a negotiation into its

63
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,819
component parts.

64
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:29,530
The third module, we're going
to be looking at conflict

65
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,500
resolution.

66
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,620
I'm going to introduce you to
some theories of conflict and

67
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,819
some theories of conflict
resolution.

68
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:40,239
I want to give you some
insights into what

69
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,980
philosophers and various social
scientists, some very

70
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:47,810
famous names, have said about
conflict, what causes it, and

71
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,969
we'll look at some
pathways for how

72
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:53,740
conflict can be resolved.

73
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,780
In the final module, I want to
really focus and drill down on

74
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,020
communication skills.

75
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,980
We're going to focus on about
seven or eight main skills

76
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:05,919
that we'll look at, that you
can use, when you're

77
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,459
approaching a negotiation
or a conflict.

78
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,280
These skills will be put in
context by us referring to a

79
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,949
couple of case studies that I'm
going to introduce you to

80
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:18,550
throughout the course, and
that we will refer to at

81
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,088
different stages.

82
00:04:20,088 --> 00:04:22,670
We come to a question
now which is,

83
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,379
when should I negotiate?

84
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:26,509
And in fact, what
is negotiation?

85
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:29,230
Let's start with what
is negotiation.

86
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,680
Negotiation is problem solving
between people who are in an

87
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,064
interdependent relationship.

88
00:04:35,064 --> 00:04:37,589


89
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:44,689
You'll notice I didn't say
dependent, and I didn't say

90
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:47,040
independent--

91
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,810
interdependent.

92
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,399
People who are in interdependent
relationships

93
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,039
depend on one another.

94
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,890
I depend on you and
you depend on me.

95
00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:00,279
Irrespective of an instance
where, for example, you may do

96
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:03,709
nothing, you might be unwilling
to move forward, I

97
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:05,680
can't move forward because
you're doing nothing.

98
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,660
So let's say you aren't
responding to a proposal.

99
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,290
I can't move forward
with the project.

100
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,040
So I'm in an interdependent
relationship with you and we

101
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,500
have to work together.

102
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,139
That implies a style of
negotiation as well, which is

103
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,029
a collaborative style
of working together.

104
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:25,479
It's interesting why we
shouldn't negotiate.

105
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,629
Sometimes I think people
negotiate when they don't

106
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:28,870
actually need to.

107
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,100
They can make an independent
decision.

108
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,810
They've got legitimate
authority.

109
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,949
They've got the means to do
something by themselves and

110
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:37,719
yet they choose to negotiate.

111
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,900
Why shouldn't you negotiate?

112
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:43,649
Essentially the reason is this,
negotiation typically

113
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:47,279
involves what we call
concessions.

114
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,899
A concession means you're giving
something up, something

115
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:54,439
you wouldn't normally give
to the other side,

116
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:56,699
to fashion an agreement.

117
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:01,050
A concession involves usually
some material cost, some

118
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,400
financial cost, or some extra
effort on your part.

119
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,849
So we typically trade
concessions when we're

120
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,680
undertaking a negotiation.

121
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,699
I want you to also start this
course out with a degree of

122
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:17,459
confidence.

123
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:21,299
I want to give you a quote, and
that's this, "Negotiation

124
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,079
is a learned skill."
A learned skill--

125
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:27,149
there's no gene for
negotiation.

126
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:30,789
You should be able to, through
some focused effort and some

127
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,819
concentration, some deep
debriefing and some planning,

128
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:36,889
you should be able to execute
a negotiation reasonably

129
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:40,089
effectively, particularly if you
concentrate and do some of

130
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:42,329
the exercises through
the course.

131
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:43,870
And I'll suggest to you, you
maybe want to go to the

132
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,699
discussion boards and debrief a
little bit with some of the

133
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:48,479
other people taking
the course.

134
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,170
Share some of your stories and
maybe get some feedback and

135
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,660
some input from others about
how you're going.

136
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,030
There's a nice way of describing
negotiations, and

137
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:59,389
it's by an American author
called Lee Thompson.

138
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:03,419
What she talks about is the
difference between a

139
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:10,770
negotiation of opportunity and
she then contrasts that with a

140
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:13,060
negotiation of necessity.

141
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,110
Let me talk about those
for a moment.

142
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,259
A negotiation of opportunity
is where we spot an

143
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:21,759
opportunity to negotiate,
but it's not compulsory.

144
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,430
Let's say for example, you
notice that your job's getting

145
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,629
more responsibility or
a heavier workload.

146
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:31,449
That's an opportunity, surely,
for you to negotiate a higher

147
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:36,079
salary with your boss
or your employer.

148
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,669
Negotiation of opportunity
might be talking to your

149
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,730
housemate about how you
reorganize the workload for

150
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,140
the share house you live in,
or with your partner to

151
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:50,029
arrange so you can both
pursue more of you

152
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:52,209
hobbies on the weekend.

153
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:56,250
An opportunity negotiation is
one where we need to open up

154
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,860
the opportunity to negotiate.

155
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,639
We can contrast that with a
negotiation of necessity, and

156
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:04,779
this is one that we
have to undertake.

157
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:07,609
A good example of a negotiation
of necessity is an

158
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,389
enterprise bargaining agreement,
which happens every

159
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,519
three years between an employer
and a group of

160
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,359
employees, usually represented
by a union.

161
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,580
An EBA negotiation, as they're
called-- enterprise bargaining

162
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:22,609
agreement, has to take place
every three years for the

163
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:26,530
negotiation agreement to be
current, for it to reflect the

164
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:31,299
conditions of the employer, and
the cost of living, for

165
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,230
example, for employees.

166
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,178
So that's one that we have
to undertake, even though

167
00:08:36,178 --> 00:08:39,339
sometimes it might be a little
bit laborious, and it can be

168
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,860
quite acrimonious at times, we
have to renew that agreement.

169
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,440
So it's a negotiation that we
have to do by necessity.

170
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,340
So there's two quite different
types of negotiation.

171
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,860
I'd like to introduce you now
to a little case study we're

172
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,610
going to come back
to periodically

173
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,950
throughout the course.

174
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,560
It's two people I used to
work with, Anne and Joe.

175
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:01,879
We worked in a consulting
firm, we had this shared

176
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:04,350
services arrangement, where we
had some researchers who did

177
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,730
work for the consultants.

178
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:12,519
Joe was a sort of guy who used
to work reasonably, in a

179
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,169
steady sort of pace.

180
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:17,219
He used to do a lot of very
considered work and he would

181
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,389
get these researchers doing
extended projects for him.

182
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:23,039
Anne, on the other
hand, traveled a

183
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,329
lot with her clients.

184
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,410
She would come home and she
was always a little bit

185
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:29,199
frazzled and rushed.

186
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,560
She would quickly want to have
the researchers working on her

187
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,109
projects straight away.

188
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,470
So she'd kind of run in and dump
work and expect it to be

189
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,950
done the next day.

190
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,920
These two people really clashed
over their very

191
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:42,500
different work styles, and yet
they had to share this

192
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,179
resource of the researchers'
time.

193
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:47,599
So we're going to look at this
quite simple and quite

194
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,250
commonplace problem we would see
in a workplace of sharing

195
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,659
a shared resource when two
people have very different

196
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:54,959
styles of work.

197
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,519
I'll give you some examples when
we look at Anne and Joe

198
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,539
and how they interact to give
you some examples of how they

199
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:02,860
might negotiate this agreement
more effectively.

200
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,470


201
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,690
I also like to direct you to
the discussion boards.

202
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,930
And there's quite a lot of
activity that goes on in these

203
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:12,789
boards, in the Open2Study
units.

204
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:15,719
So if you head there you can
make some comments about your

205
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,360
own negotiations, give some
feedback to others about how

206
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,840
you might have approached
that.

207
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,879
You can talk about the ideas and
it's a social way of you

208
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:27,649
sharing ideas and becoming
involved with others who are

209
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:28,899
doing the course.

210
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:32,394
