00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,589


2
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:12,619
In this topic, I want to
look at the language of

3
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:14,029
negotiation.

4
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:17,679
And I want to draw some
distinctions for you in some

5
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:19,820
different elements we can
look at and focus on in

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,609
negotiation.

7
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,210
And I want to give you some
insight into how we use

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,130
language in order to
be more effective

9
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:29,640
in building an agreement.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,799
The first thing I want to
start with is to draw a

11
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,259
distinction between
what are called

12
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:37,994
positions and interests.

13
00:00:37,994 --> 00:00:40,539


14
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:45,339
Positions in a negotiation are
usually a starting point.

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,900
That is one side will say we
want this project completed by

16
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:55,129
next Monday, and that's our
absolute drop dead date.

17
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,910
It's got to be done
by this date.

18
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:02,239
Or I'll pay you $500,000 for
your apartment and I won't pay

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,920
you another penny more.

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,579
This is my final position, or
this is my bottom line.

21
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:14,510
Those are good examples of
positional language.

22
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,650
And they are a feature of
distributed negotiation.

23
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,450
People take a position, and
they stick to it, and they

24
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,390
hold on to that position
for dear life.

25
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,400
That becomes their starting
point or sometimes it's their

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,930
bottom line.

27
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,430
And positions in negotiation
are important first to

28
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,360
understand, but they're also
important for us to be able to

29
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:36,400
deal with and manage, to manage

30
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,780
that positional language.

31
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,700
We want to also contrast that
with what sometimes sits

32
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,680
behind a position which is what

33
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,250
people call our interests.

34
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,109
And interests in negotiation
are a broader suite of

35
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:54,099
concerns, the things
that are driving us

36
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:55,829
often to take a position.

37
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,750
So we can sort of articulate
these as

38
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,700
being why we want something.

39
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,620
This is the underlying
suite of interests.

40
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,630
And in integrative negotiation,
we usually like

41
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:10,590
to focus more on interests.

42
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,670
So we bargain and we solve
problems by identifying one

43
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:18,309
another's separate interests and
also try and then identify

44
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,090
what are our common interests?

45
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,930
What are the things that we both
have driving our behavior

46
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,719
or our coming to the table
in this negotiation?

47
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,620
So positions in interests.

48
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,539
Why is it useful to focus
on interests?

49
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:33,039
Interests are more malleable.

50
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,120
We can come up with different

51
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,780
solutions to make the interests.

52
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,189
Whereas a position is a firmer
statement of intent.

53
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:44,840
And it will sometimes
conflict with the

54
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,030
other side's positions.

55
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,259
So what we want to try and
do is drill down into the

56
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:52,929
interests and work out what's
driving the behavior.

57
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,560
Let's look at another sort
of contrast here.

58
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,060
Another way of thinking about
some language here.

59
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,180
Sometimes you'll hear people
in negotiation say, well, I

60
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,010
think the solution is this.

61
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:09,179
What we have to do is
we have to structure

62
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,080
the deal this way.

63
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,120
This is the solution I believe
that we need to come up with.

64
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,175
Well, that's very, dogmatic
language, very firm language.

65
00:03:20,175 --> 00:03:22,860
It may be perceived as
pushy or boorish

66
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,140
from the other side.

67
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:26,750
This is what you
have to accept.

68
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,189
We need to try and be a little
bit more inviting and

69
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:31,990
collaborative in our language.

70
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,090
So I think a better word
than solutions is

71
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,770
to talk about options.

72
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,680
Be more inviting, more
suggestive in our language.

73
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,480
Perhaps an option here, what we
could try is, let's think

74
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:48,359
about an option that we could
solve this problem with, or

75
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,770
could we try.

76
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,500
This is the sort of language
that invites the other side to

77
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,050
consider to participate in
designing the solution.

78
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,430
And then we come up with
something that we both had

79
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,760
some input into.

80
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:06,539
And so using the word options
is more preferable to using

81
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:07,810
the word solution.

82
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,490
So when we use this
more collaborative

83
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,219
language, we get by in.

84
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:15,039
We get the other side buying
into the outcome

85
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,870
and designing it.

86
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,110
So how can we apply this
knowledge that there's a

87
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,870
difference between positions
and interests?

88
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,259
Really the answer to that
question lies in what we

89
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:29,579
choose to respond to
in an negotiation.

90
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:33,269
So, for example, if another side
makes a very positional

91
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:36,649
claim or a positional statement,
we could, of

92
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:39,379
course, and maybe it's human
nature to some extent, respond

93
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,670
with our own position.

94
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,600
All right, if you're going to
say that, then we're not going

95
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,390
to accept anything less
than whatever it is.

96
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:50,959
So we can make the negotiations
start to escalate

97
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:53,729
and your position can be matched
with my position.

98
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,850
And we can get into a slaying
match, and we can be like two

99
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,730
goats on the edge of a
cliff banging heads.

100
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,259
What we want to do is we
want to be a little bit

101
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,449
smarter than that.

102
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:07,329
The other side gives us a
position, we might either

103
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:10,229
choose to ignore that position
and we might divert the

104
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,629
conversation away from that.

105
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:15,430
Or we could probe into
the interests that

106
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,100
sit behind a position.

107
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,340
And this is essentially by
asking why questions, asking

108
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:23,199
the other side why they're
taking that

109
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,189
position why they want.

110
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:26,939
You ask them to justify it.

111
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:29,100
Ask them to explain it.

112
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,680
Give us some more
information what

113
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,459
sits behind that position.

114
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:35,189
And when we do that, they're
starting to share their

115
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:38,379
interests, that is why they've
taken the position.

116
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,230
And we can now start to veer the
conversation more towards

117
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,920
our interests.

118
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,930
Of course, positions are very
common in negotiation.

119
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,550
If we take an enterprise
agreement that occurs between

120
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:56,079
employers and employees on a
cycle of usually two or three

121
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,859
years an enterprise bargaining
agreement is renewed, what

122
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,129
usually happens before that is
the union that represents the

123
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:06,969
employees or the employees
will issue what's

124
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,720
called a log of claims.

125
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,100
They'll write a letter to the
employer at the start of the

126
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,090
negotiations saying what their
claims are, what the salary

127
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:18,129
increase they want, the
conditions that they want

128
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:20,149
amended, and so on.

129
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:23,289
And the employer then responds
to that log of claims.

130
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,400
Some people call that
an ambit claim.

131
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:29,039
If it's a inflated claim that's
unrealistic, it's

132
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,560
referred to as an ambit claim.

133
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,350
Really what we're talking about
here is a position.

134
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,900
And it's very common in
group-based negotiations.

135
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:39,789
Because the groups negotiate
before they come to the table,

136
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,860
they settle on a position, and
then they come to the table

137
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,259
with that position.

138
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:46,969
And it's why enterprise
bargaining agreements are

139
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,470
often very positional.

140
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,770
They start from two quite
extreme positions and they

141
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:54,549
might end up being more
interest-based but they often

142
00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:00,360
start in quite an adversarial
manner, which is I guess

143
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,750
implicit in that domain or that
arena of negotiation.

144
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,069
We want to win, we've
got a choice.

145
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:09,730
Try to stay away from
positions if we can.

146
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,520
Because it has the potential to
make that conflict escalate

147
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,069
and the parties get very stuck
in a positional style of

148
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,879
negotiation.

149
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,500
So we've looked at this issue
of language in this topic.

150
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,790
We've drawn a distinction
between

151
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,420
positions and interests.

152
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,400
And I've made the broad comment
that as a general

153
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,989
rule, we try to negotiate
around interests, the

154
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,750
underpinning concerns.

155
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,170
We've also drawn a distinction
of giving you an example

156
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,990
between solutions and options.

157
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,180
And we need to use our language
carefully when we're

158
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,750
negotiating to create the
right mood, to create a

159
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,500
collaborative environment, and
to move the negotiation

160
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,750
towards resolution.

161
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,523
