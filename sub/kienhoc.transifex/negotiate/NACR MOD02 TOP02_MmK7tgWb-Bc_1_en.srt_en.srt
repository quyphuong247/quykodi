1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,539


2
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:11,619
When it comes to sitting
down and starting

3
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:14,559
to plan at your project
to a negotiation,

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,260
I usually think it's a good
idea to go through a checklist.

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,560
And the first thing we can
think about in that checklist

6
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:23,339
is to think about
all the items that

7
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:27,259
are going to be in what we
call the bargaining mix.

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,190
Now, I talked about that briefly
before in the previous topic.

9
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,969
So if we're buying
a house, we talk

10
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:36,988
about the price, the settlement
period, the inclusions,

11
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:39,029
and repairs, and there
might be some other things

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,149
that we talk about.

13
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:43,619
This is what we call the
bargaining mix-- all the things

14
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:48,500
that the parties are going to be
trading and bargaining around.

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,884
Some items will be of
higher priority to one side

16
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,049
than they are to the other side.

17
00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:55,070
And they'll have things
that are more important.

18
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,610
And what we're
looking for when we're

19
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,019
bargaining are items that are
of high value to me, but low

20
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,447
cost to you and low cost to
me and high value to you.

21
00:01:05,447 --> 00:01:07,030
The other thing we
want to think about

22
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,049
is the idea of a
zone of agreement,

23
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:12,250
or a bargaining zone.

24
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,170
Let me give you an
example of how that works.

25
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,730


26
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:23,390
If I'm buying a house, I'm
going to have a target price

27
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,359
and I'm going to
have a resistance

28
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,280
point, or a bottom line.

29
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,820
So I'll draw this
shape up first,

30
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:34,319
and we can talk
about it afterwards.

31
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,289
So what we usually
have in a negotiation

32
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,000
is this idea of an
overlapping zone.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,400
So let's say a buyer and a
seller are looking at a house.

34
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,670
And the person wants $1
million for their lovely house.

35
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,439
That's the listing
price for the house.

36
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:59,159
And they're falling
back to about $900,000.

37
00:01:59,159 --> 00:01:59,789
OK?

38
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,381
So that's their range.

39
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:03,129
The person who comes
along who is thinking

40
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:05,659
about buying this
house has a range

41
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:12,520
that ranges is from
$950,000 down to $850,000.

42
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,022
And that's probably the most
that the bank will lend them.

43
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:17,229
And this is the most they
want to spend on the house.

44
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:19,549
Sorry, this is the most that
the bank will lend them,

45
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,930
and this is their target price.

46
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,825
And what we have in here is
the likely settlement point.

47
00:02:26,824 --> 00:02:30,060
If these two people are
going to trade and transact

48
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,030
and this person's going
to buy this house,

49
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,900
this is where it's
going to settle.

50
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,830
So what we'll see
up here in this zone

51
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,650
is a lot of sham negotiation.

52
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,370
We'll probably see bigger jumps.

53
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,810
They might jump $10,000 here.

54
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,610
And in here, they might start
jumping $5,000 and $1,000.

55
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,350
You'll see smaller
increments once the parties

56
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:52,139
move into the bargaining zone.

57
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:54,599
Down here, we see
these higher increments

58
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,919
if they're bargaining.

59
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,119
If we don't get that
overlap-- so let's say

60
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,710
we get a negotiation where the
parties have their bargaining

61
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:05,370
ranges look like this, then we
don't have a zone of agreement

62
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,360
and we probably won't get a
transaction or a deal here.

63
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,630
So we have to have
this bargaining

64
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:16,769
zone, these overlapping
ranges, for the two parties

65
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,070
to be able to get an agreement.

66
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:19,609
And that's one of
the first things

67
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,970
we want to try and work
out when we're sitting down

68
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,653
to plan a negotiation.

69
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:25,069
There's another
important point we

70
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:27,930
want to consider when we're
planning our negotiation.

71
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,770
And that is what are
our alternatives?

72
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,010
And importantly, we
also want to think about

73
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:35,099
what are our counter
party's alternatives?

74
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,329
If we don't do a
deal here, what are

75
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,670
both sides' likely alternatives?

76
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:44,329
And there's a little bit
of negotiation jargon here

77
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,469
that's useful to know.

78
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:48,590
It comes from Fisher and
Ury's book Getting to Yes,

79
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,349
which is a famous book
written about 30 years ago

80
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:54,439
that really popularized
this field of negotiation.

81
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:58,250
And they talk about this idea
that they call the BATNA.

82
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,139
Let me take you briefly
through what that is.

83
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:05,849


84
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:17,560
Now, BATNA stands
for best alternative

85
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:38,910
to a negotiated
agreement-- BATNA.

86
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,920
And the idea of a BATNA is this.

87
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,490
It's quite a simple one, really.

88
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,939
Before you negotiate,
you need to work out

89
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:49,129
what's the best
alternative we can

90
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:52,939
hope for if this
negotiation breaks down?

91
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:57,579
So this gives you an
alternative comparison point

92
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:58,839
to the negotiation.

93
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,489
If this negotiation
doesn't work,

94
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,860
what's our walk
away alternative?

95
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,830
If you've got a
good BATNA, you're

96
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:07,060
going to appear more confident.

97
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,709
You're going to be able to
cultivate this circumspect

98
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:13,164
attitude that you really
need in negotiation.

99
00:05:13,165 --> 00:05:16,560
You don't want to look
desperate for a deal.

100
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,704
And equally, if the other
side has got a good BATNA,

101
00:05:19,704 --> 00:05:24,449
then they're going to be as
likely as you are to walk away.

102
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,779
They don't need to do business
with you, because they've

103
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:29,619
got a viable alternative.

104
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,730
If the other side doesn't
have a good BATNA,

105
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,550
then you can keep them at
the table, in all likelihood,

106
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,879
for longer.

107
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,899
And there's an
important point here

108
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:41,189
that's also useful
thinking about.

109
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:45,089
And that is you can talk
about the other side's BATNA.

110
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:47,299
If they don't have
a good alternative,

111
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,937
you can point that out
in the negotiation.

112
00:05:49,937 --> 00:05:52,270
And you can let them know,
hey, your alternative doesn't

113
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,560
look so good here.

114
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,040
Maybe we need to stay at this
table a little bit longer

115
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,650
and see if we can come up
with a good option here.

116
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:02,529
There's a nice
example of the BATNA

117
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,769
in the additional resources.

118
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:06,750
There's a good
video there, where

119
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,829
Robert Mnookin from
Harvard University

120
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:11,414
talks about this concept of
the BATNA with his students.

121
00:06:11,415 --> 00:06:12,790
Go and have a look
at that, and I

122
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,629
think you'll see the
points nicely illustrated.

123
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:17,670
Think about your alternatives
before you sit down

124
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,740
and negotiate.

125
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,400
If you've got a
good alternative,

126
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:24,859
that strength will come through
in the way that you negotiate.

127
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,847
So we've worked out
the bargaining mix.

128
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:28,430
We've worked out the
bargaining zones.

129
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,850
And we've considered out BATNA.

130
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,510
We also want to think about
some process planning as well.

131
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:37,000
So we want to think about
who needs to be there

132
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,399
when we're negotiating,
where we might

133
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,989
negotiate most effectively.

134
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,699
Is it at the other
party's office?

135
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:46,439
Or is it at our office,
our home, in their home?

136
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,810
Is it in a coffee shop, in
a more formal environment?

137
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,819
We also might want
to think a little bit

138
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:53,800
about how we're
going to negotiate.

139
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,220
In some instances, we might
want to bring a third party

140
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,630
in to help us conduct
the negotiation,

141
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,879
more like a mediation.

142
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:05,759
So we want to think
not only about what,

143
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,370
but we also want
to think about how.

144
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,269
Effective planning
takes into account

145
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:15,279
that process dimension as well.

146
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,709
So when we start pulling
all this together

147
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:21,489
to a coherent plan,
we should have

148
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,090
a reasonable idea of where
we're going to negotiate,

149
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:27,359
the items we're going
to be talking about,

150
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,460
what we might consider
as our bargaining zone,

151
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:32,060
what our alternatives are.

152
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,389
We should go to the
table-- when we sit down

153
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:36,939
with the other side, we
should feel really confident

154
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:38,110
that we're ready to go.

155
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:41,199
We know exactly what we're
going to be going for.

156
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,610
We might even have planned some
of the words we're going to use

157
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,920
or how we might
support an argument.

158
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,280
We're ready to go, and we
should feel really confident.

159
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,619
So in this topic, we've looked
at this process of planning.

160
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,259
Do one thing differently--
just one thing

161
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:01,399
to be more effective--
and it'll be plan.

162
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,919
Plan your negotiations,
plan your strategy,

163
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,141
and you'll feel more confident.

164
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:06,641
