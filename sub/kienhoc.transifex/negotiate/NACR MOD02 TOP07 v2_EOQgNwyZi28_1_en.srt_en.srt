00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,057


2
00:00:10,057 --> 00:00:14,719
In this topic, we're going
to look at bargaining.

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,990
And from the way I've organized
this module, you'll

4
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:21,599
see that bargaining is really
just a phase within a broader

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,320
process of negotiation.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,190
Most people equate bargaining
with negotiation.

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,429
That's what they see as
being negotiation.

8
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,589
My view is it's really
just a stage.

9
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:34,090
It's an important stage,
but it is just a stage.

10
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:39,109
Bargaining is essentially where
we focus in on often the

11
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:42,070
commercial terms of
a negotiation.

12
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:49,140
So we might look at price,
terms, and the other

13
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,649
commercial aspects of the
agreement, warranties and

14
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:55,049
things like that.

15
00:00:55,049 --> 00:01:00,099
And the idea of effective
bargaining is we trade

16
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,380
concessions.

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,329
And the classic concession
people always talk about when

18
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:08,450
they refer to bargaining is the
selling process that the

19
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:15,189
salesperson offers a discount
or a margin reduction in

20
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:17,469
return for increased volume.

21
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:20,150
So it's margin for volume.

22
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:25,940
And the greater volume makes
up for the lesser margin.

23
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:27,939
We want to be careful, of
course, with that kind of

24
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:30,329
thing that we've made some
guarantee that we're going to

25
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:31,239
get that volume.

26
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:34,780
Otherwise we've reduced our
price without getting the

27
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,120
increase in volume.

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,005
And that's a little two
card trick you need

29
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:39,519
to be careful of.

30
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,609
So we want to be starting to
think about what behaviors we

31
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:46,099
associate with effective
bargaining.

32
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:50,319
Because it really is a specific
set of skills we want

33
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,549
to put in practice.

34
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:55,390
And that's what I'm going to
talk about in this topic.

35
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,890
So we need to start to master
some behaviors if we're going

36
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,230
to be effective in the
bargaining stage.

37
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:08,990
And I want to zero in on three
specific skills and behaviors

38
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:13,189
that we can develop to become
effective as bargainers.

39
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:17,909
And these are knowing
your business.

40
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:20,530
You need to really know
your business well.

41
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,560
Know that if you make a
concession on a particular

42
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,469
item, where it's going to cost
you, what the ramifications

43
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:28,270
are going to be of that.

44
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,520
We also don't want to make
unilateral concessions.

45
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,600
Unilateral concessions are
concessions that we make that

46
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:37,810
without some reciprocal response
from the other side.

47
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,770
In a sense, we're giving
something away for free.

48
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,760
And the third area is to make
sure that the concessions that

49
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,989
we give are of equal value.

50
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:51,600
And often a clever salesperson
will make it look like they're

51
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,419
making some grand gesture,
making a large concession for

52
00:02:56,419 --> 00:02:58,639
the other side, and
they'll extract a

53
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,259
lot of value in return.

54
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:04,560
When in actual fact, the
concession they're making is a

55
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,949
very low concession and doesn't
cost them much at all.

56
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:11,439
Let's talk a little bit about
these three areas that we want

57
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,099
to focus on.

58
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:16,500
The first one is really about
your commercial acumen from a

59
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,879
business context, knowing what
the ramifications are going to

60
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,289
be of any concession that
you might make.

61
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:24,679
If we give them more time what
are the implications

62
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,050
going to be for us?

63
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,469
If we give them that copyright,
how is that going

64
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:32,009
to restrict our business
in the future?

65
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:35,269
We need to be really
commercially sensitive and

66
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:40,750
commercially aware of what each
commercial consideration

67
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,400
or concession that we're going
to make is going to have on us

68
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,840
in the future.

69
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,680
And there's no way that we can
absolutely magically wave a

70
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,170
wand and give people commercial
experience and

71
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:54,009
commercial acumen
and judgement.

72
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:57,359
Sometimes that really just
comes from experience.

73
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,190
But thinking about what
concessions you might make in

74
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:03,639
advance sometimes with a more
experienced person in the back

75
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:08,169
office helps you accelerate
that process of judgement.

76
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:12,649
And the second point is not to
make unilateral concessions.

77
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,939
Negotiation is driven by
reciprocity, that is I give

78
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:17,620
you something, you give
me something.

79
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,028
I tell you something about
my business, you tell me

80
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:21,620
something about yours.

81
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,120
And in this setting of
bargaining, we don't want to

82
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,800
be giving things away without
getting something in return.

83
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,569
And that's usually the process
of trading concessions or

84
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:37,930
tying one concession
to the other.

85
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,160
Sometimes people give a way a
lot without even realizing it.

86
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,310
It amazes me sometimes, for
example, in shops where people

87
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,290
say, oh my price is x but, of
course, that's negotiable.

88
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,770
To me that always looks
desperate and almost naive

89
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:55,519
that how did they know I wasn't
willing to pay the

90
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,359
price they just quoted me?

91
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,470
And the third point that's
important to think about here

92
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,870
is making sure that our trades
are of equal value.

93
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:09,019
Sometimes it's hard to discern
what the value is of a

94
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:09,939
concession.

95
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:13,069
An ideal concession is one
that's going to be of low cost

96
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:14,879
to me but high value for you.

97
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,524
I might give you some advice
about your business that might

98
00:05:17,524 --> 00:05:21,139
only cost me a couple of hours
of time, but actually saves

99
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:25,060
you millions of dollars or makes
you millions of dollars.

100
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,680
And that's going to be a great
concession for me to make and

101
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,769
a great concession for
you to receive.

102
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:31,389
It only cost me a couple
of hours and I get

103
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:33,240
something big in return.

104
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,340
So think about those three
elements when you're planning

105
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:37,469
your concessions.

106
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,910
When we try to trade concessions
in negotiation

107
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,300
there's one really important
word that you need to use.

108
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,370
And it's a really little word,
but it's a very important one.

109
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,899
And it's the word if.

110
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:54,429
And what we're trying to build
in an negotiation in the

111
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,759
bargaining process is the idea
that we're making concessions

112
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,139
that are contingent or reliant
upon the other party

113
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,509
reciprocating.

114
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:09,120
So the kind of phrase that we
would use to communicate that

115
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,319
point is this.

116
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,540
If you can, then I will.

117
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:22,090
And you'll notice that the way
that I structured that offer

118
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:25,369
is by requesting the
concession from

119
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,879
the other side first.

120
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,350
I'm tying my concession to the
concession that I'm requesting

121
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,110
from the other side.

122
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,490
And so let's take the
example of Ann and

123
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,300
Joe here for a moment.

124
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,569
Ann might say, Joe, if you give
me more flexibility to

125
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:48,300
use the researchers when I need
them, then I'll give you

126
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,210
a stronger sense of what my
calendar is so you get a

127
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:54,779
clearer sense of when I'm going
to be coming back in

128
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:58,709
town and when I'll need
the consultants or

129
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:59,519
something like that.

130
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,129
They can come up with the
trade that's going to

131
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,389
work for them both.

132
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:09,159
And they fashion that agreement
in a way that is

133
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,530
fair and that's going to
work for them both.

134
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:14,079
But they're trading that
concession because they're

135
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,859
both altering their
behavior somewhat.

136
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,889
They're both making a change to
the way that they normally

137
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:24,769
work to meet the other party's
interests and make that a

138
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:28,329
little bit more a flexible
agreement.

139
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:31,719
So what we're trying to do in
this process of bargaining is

140
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,510
know our business really well.

141
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:37,759
We're trying to trade
concessions of equal value.

142
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,649
And we're also trying to make
sure that we don't make

143
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:42,159
unilateral concessions.

144
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,750
We're trying to make concessions
that are

145
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,259
contingent upon the other
side reciprocating.

146
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,899
If we focus on those three key
skills, we should be in good

147
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:52,370
shape to do some effective
bargaining.

148
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,797
