[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:13,150
After the parties have both
shared their perspective on a

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,740
problem in a negotiational
conflict situation, usually

4
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:20,989
there's a stage where both
parties try to emphasize some

5
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:22,289
common ground.

6
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,019
We talked about this in
the second module.

7
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:28,710
How do they do about doing
that from a communication

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,390
perspective?

9
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,289
Let's talk about some ways
they can do that.

10
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:36,000
Common ground is essentially
the areas that both

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,890
parties agree on.

12
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,230
And this can be quite easy
to find sometimes--

13
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:45,329
we both agree we've got to
come to a sale price, for

14
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:46,929
example, buying a house.

15
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:48,104
Sometimes it's a
little harder.

16
00:00:48,104 --> 00:00:51,419
They don't quite see where
they've got any common ground,

17
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,859
and sometimes that can
seem quite elusive.

18
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:56,769
So we actually need to think
about how do I go about

19
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,220
finding where we agree?

20
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,549
Let's take an example
in politics.

21
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:06,259
In both sides of the parliament
in a democratic

22
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,969
system you've got two sets of
politicians, often from very

23
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:12,709
different sides of politics.

24
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:15,279
Those two groups will often
say they're very

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,379
philosophically opposed
on issues.

26
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:17,569
And

27
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:21,039
Yet if you look at those two
sets of people, they've

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,859
probably got a lot of areas
where they've got very similar

29
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:26,769
attitudes, beliefs,
world views.

30
00:01:26,769 --> 00:01:29,509
They probably all went to
the same universities.

31
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,770
They probably all believe
in public service.

32
00:01:32,769 --> 00:01:39,549
They all probably believe in the
importance of democratic

33
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:41,399
principles, and so on.

34
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,480
And when you see issues of
national importance come to

35
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,340
the fore in political issues,
those two parties will take

36
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,630
what you call a bipartisan
approach.

37
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:56,509
And that's a good example of
what we're talking to here,

38
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,670
and that's the idea that parties
in negotiations in

39
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,810
conflict situations want to
try and adopt a bipartisan

40
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,229
approach where they both see the
problem as the enemy, not

41
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,120
one another as the enemy.

42
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,030
So they're both seeking
to find the areas

43
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,219
that they agree on.

44
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,439
Of course they want to know
what they disagree on, but

45
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:21,639
they want to work out what it is
that they're both trying to

46
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,619
achieve out of this.

47
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,550
And this is emphasizing this
idea of common ground-- what

48
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,290
do we both want?

49
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:33,500
We also want to think about how
we use our language when

50
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,409
we're looking for
common ground.

51
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:39,159
And I think it's important here
that we pick the right

52
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:44,039
time to move from the individual
singular pronoun,

53
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:48,909
"I," "you," and moving to a
collective pronoun, "we,"

54
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:52,039
"us," "our." What are
we looking for here?

55
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,509
What are we trying to achieve?

56
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:59,159
Once we start using these
collective pronouns, "we,"

57
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:03,719
"us," what we're looking for,
once we start to hear that

58
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,550
sort of language,
it's a sign that

59
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,400
common ground has emerged.

60
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,360
And what I think it's really
important for people to do is

61
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,490
to emphasize the areas that
they do agree on.

62
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,170
So let's say you're coming to
the end of a first meeting, a

63
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:17,709
first negotiation.

64
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,920
We can use our summarizing
skills here and say, well, we

65
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:24,339
all agree that we want to move
forward with this project.

66
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,020
We've just got some differing
views on the different

67
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,370
priorities, or the different
key points

68
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,780
that we need to emphasize.

69
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,449
But we all agree that the
project's a good idea.

70
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:36,799
And what the person who's saying
something like that is

71
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,280
trying to do is to emphasize
that, hey, there's some things

72
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,060
we don't agree on, but there's
a lot that we do agree on.

73
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,439
And I always say to my students
when I'm doing work

74
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,590
at the university, and I'm
teaching, and they're role

75
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,860
playing and so on, I say, at
the end of every meeting,

76
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,270
emphasize what you've
agreed to.

77
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,680
This is really important,
because it puts a emphasis on

78
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,550
the meeting that you're making
progress and that you're

79
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,680
moving towards a resolution.

80
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,860
You don't want to be getting
stuck at the end of a meeting

81
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,400
in the points that
you disagree on.

82
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,689
You want to focus on
where you agree.

83
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:13,397
