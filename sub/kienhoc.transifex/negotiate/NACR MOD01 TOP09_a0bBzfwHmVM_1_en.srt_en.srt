00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,300


2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,859
In this topic, we're going to
look at the final of our

3
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:18,939
thinking errors or heuristics
in negotiation.

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,450
I'm going to get you thinking
a little bit about how this

5
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:28,350
error can lead you to get stuck
in a cycle of conflict.

6
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,939
And it's called the irrational
escalation of commitment.

7
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:37,929
And what this heuristic is about
is the notion that when

8
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:44,390
people are in negotiation they
feel a sense of commitment.

9
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,810
And sometimes that's because
of the time that they've

10
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,020
already given.

11
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,720
Sometimes it's the resources
that they've already allocated

12
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,280
to the negotiation.

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,289
Sometimes it's the loss of
face that might occur by

14
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:01,189
backing down or walking away
from a negotiation.

15
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:06,560
And those kinds of pressures or
heuristics in our mind the

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,090
way we think about our decision
tend to mean that we

17
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,930
sometimes lose our rationality,
and we don't get

18
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,730
a sense of whether the deal
that's coming is actually the

19
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,579
best deal that's available.

20
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:22,799
And so we get stuck into this
cycle of escalation.

21
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,049
If we were to think about Ann
and Joe in terms of these two

22
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:31,429
guys representing the risk of
an escalation of commitment,

23
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:35,160
you can see how that could get
out of hand that problem.

24
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:35,909
What would happen?

25
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,179
What we'd probably see happening
is Joe would start

26
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:46,390
to summon the troops and would
probably do the same talk

27
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,200
disparaging about Joe to other
colleagues and maybe the

28
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,689
issues would widen.

29
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:55,030
They might be talking about
other aspects of one another's

30
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,000
work style, it wouldn't just
be about the research as a

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,290
bunch of other things.

32
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,700
And a conflict would start
to get out of hand.

33
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,920
And they'd both lose their sense
of perspective and their

34
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,100
ability to think rationally
about the conflict.

35
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:09,829
We can think of dozens of
examples of the irrational

36
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,500
escalation of commitment.

37
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,139
A good example we might draw
would be the Vietnam War,

38
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:20,789
where the United States became
more and more embroiled in

39
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:25,574
this war, more and more soldiers
and service people

40
00:02:25,574 --> 00:02:28,189
were losing their lives
in the war.

41
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:32,280
And it was harder and harder
to de-escalate and turn to

42
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,729
exit the situation.

43
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:38,489
So this concept of the
escalation of commitment means

44
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,510
that we get stuck in a
cycle of conflict.

45
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:45,879
One of the reasons for this
escalation of commitment is

46
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:48,169
what we call sunk costs.

47
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:53,439
And a sunk cost is the time
that you've invested in a

48
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,579
negotiation, as an example.

49
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,060
So let's take the idea that
you've spent two or three work

50
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,319
weeks working on a negotiation
or working on a proposal or a

51
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,829
deal, and as those three weeks
come to an end, it starts to

52
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:16,680
look to you as though maybe
it's not such a great deal

53
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,250
after all, but you've spent
those three weeks.

54
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,400
And now, you want to get a
return on the investment of

55
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,420
those three weeks, which is what
we call the sunk cost.

56
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:27,649
And you want to get that return
on the investment by

57
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,280
doing the deal, even though you
know that it's not such a

58
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,930
great deal after all.

59
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,810
Why do we do this?

60
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,199
The idea that we want to try
and somehow overcome is the

61
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:41,560
concept that that's a
cost that's gone.

62
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,680
We need to accept that that's
a cost of doing business.

63
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,409
We can't recoup that cost
through doing a bad deal.

64
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:50,770
In fact, we're going to
go the other way.

65
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,480
So we need to be careful
and recognize a sunk

66
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,929
cost for what it is.

67
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,200
It's not a compelling reason
to stay committed to a deal

68
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:00,709
that we don't like.

69
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,560
We also need to think about
what else might drive this

70
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,620
irrational escalation
of commitment.

71
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,319
And it can be encapsulated
in one word and that's

72
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,709
competitiveness.

73
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:16,519
Our competitiveness will often
drive us to stay committed to

74
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,879
a negotiation process that we
see as falling off the rails

75
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,279
or not working.

76
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:26,369
And yet our human
competitiveness

77
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,790
makes us want to win.

78
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,080
So we also need to recognize
when our competitiveness is

79
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,159
getting in the way of an

80
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,180
effective negotiation agreement.

81
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,110
Think about that the next time
you find yourself getting

82
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,810
stuck in a cycle of escalation,
you can feel a

83
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,009
conflict or negotiation getting
out of control.

84
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:53,519
Try to recognize your own
behavior as possibly

85
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,659
reflecting this challenge of the
escalation of commitment.

86
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,970
We've already come this far.

87
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,290
We may as well go all the way.

88
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,490
That's the sort of language
you'll hear yourself saying.

89
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,300
Or we've put a lot of effort
into this, we need to get

90
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,370
something out of it.

91
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,430
That's the sort of thing that
will get you stuck in a

92
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,720
concept of a sunk cost.

93
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,353
