1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,397


2
00:00:10,397 --> 00:00:13,750
So I mentioned in the
last topic the importance

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,740
of bridging the
gap between knowing

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,559
about effective
communication skills

5
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,539
and actually using those
communication skills.

6
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:24,489
And I think it's an interesting
observation of some people's

7
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:26,663
over confidence in
their skills that they,

8
00:00:26,664 --> 00:00:28,080
when you talk about
communication,

9
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,528
they say, oh, yeah, we know
all of this sort of stuff.

10
00:00:30,528 --> 00:00:31,570
We don't need to do this.

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,771
And then when you
watch them negotiating,

12
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:35,520
there's some serious
problems with the way

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,940
that they communicate.

14
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:39,323
So you just think
about it yourself,

15
00:00:39,323 --> 00:00:40,739
the last time you
had a real doozy

16
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,410
of an argument
with your partner,

17
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,309
or a close friend,
or a family member.

18
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,440
You think about the character
or your own communication,

19
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,829
would you change anything in
the way that you communicated?

20
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:52,140
I suspect most of us would.

21
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,329
We've got some regrets about
the way that we communicated.

22
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:56,600
And what's going on here?

23
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,280
It's the pressure of
the interaction that's

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,570
causing our communication
skills to break down.

25
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,840
So we want to be
able to make sure

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,450
that, just like a sportsman
on the day of the big game,

27
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,049
that our skills show
up when we need them.

28
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:18,799
So how do we bridge this gap
between knowing and doing?

29
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,719
There's an interesting thing
about communication skills

30
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:24,519
in conflict resolution that
we need to be conscious of.

31
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:27,349
And that is the idea
that we all have

32
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:32,349
very predetermined or strong
predispositions to how

33
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:35,939
to manage conflict, what
works and what conflict means.

34
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,700
It's quite a profound event for
many of us to be in conflict.

35
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,930
And so because of this,
we have reliable scripts.

36
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,190
We have reliable
styles of negotiating.

37
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:49,590
We have things that
we fall back on.

38
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,500
And what we want to do is to be
able to be conscious of having

39
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,109
a broader range
of skills that we

40
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:57,209
can use that are
going to be effective.

41
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:00,799
In one of the earlier
units in module three,

42
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,439
I talked about Morton Deutsch.

43
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:05,349
And he's a scholar who
drew the distinction

44
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:07,869
between destructive and
constructive conflict.

45
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,689
And in a lot of
Deutsch's writings,

46
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:11,750
he really emphasizes
the importance

47
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,080
that, particularly in
conflict resolution,

48
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,980
you need to be able to not only
learn about conflict resolution

49
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:21,519
skills and methodologies, but
you also need to practice them.

50
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,380
And why is this so important?

51
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:27,349
Well, one of the fundamental
points here is many of us will,

52
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:29,939
when we try to use
conflict resolution skills,

53
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:33,759
we'll feel as though we are
in some ways being weak.

54
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,909
That when we're in
conflict we need

55
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:37,500
to really prosecute
the conflict.

56
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,449
We need to be hard.

57
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,519
We need to be firm.

58
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,140
We need to really fight.

59
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:44,019
And that can be very
counterproductive

60
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,340
if we're actually trying
to resolve the conflict.

61
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,780
We also can sometimes
be exposed to advice

62
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,430
that isn't necessarily
all that helpful.

63
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,890
Let's take, for example, we've
got a conflict going at work,

64
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:57,389
and we go home at
night, and we want

65
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:01,444
to try and debrief or
download with our partner

66
00:03:01,444 --> 00:03:03,419
or flatmate or a friend.

67
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:06,419
And often what you'll find
is that that person becomes

68
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,149
what's been called
a scriptwriter.

69
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,743
That person tells you what
you should say the next day,

70
00:03:11,743 --> 00:03:13,909
and they're very strong,
and they're very assertive.

71
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:16,599
And they tell you what
you have to go in and tell

72
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,063
that person the next day.

73
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:19,479
Well, I always say
to my students,

74
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,853
well, that's very easy with
a glass of wine in your hand.

75
00:03:21,854 --> 00:03:24,910
But you're the one who has
to go to work the next day

76
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:26,419
and face that
person and actually

77
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:27,939
put that advice into practice.

78
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:32,460
And sometimes that's not quite
as easy as it sounds at night.

79
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,520
So what we want to do is we
want to develop the ability

80
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,784
to take our knowledge
of conflict resolution

81
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,900
and negotiation
skills, and we want

82
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,450
to be able to make sure that
they turn up when we need them.

83
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:44,469
How do we do that?

84
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:48,229
So, let's consider the
example of Ann and Joe--

85
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:50,319
go back to that case
study for a moment.

86
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,949
Let's imagine Ann is having a
meeting with Joe the next day.

87
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:58,030
So the previous evening, she
and her partner do a role play,

88
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,719
and they think about
how the negotiation is

89
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,629
going to play out.

90
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:04,530
And Ann plans what
she is going to say.

91
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,099
Well, of course
there's a possibility

92
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:09,689
that it could all go a
pear-shaped the next day,

93
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:11,439
and Ann could end
up yelling at Joe,

94
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,370
and it could end up being
a big slanging match.

95
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,528
There's no definite way that Ann
can avoid that from happening.

96
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:24,129
But she can do the best that
she can do in the pre-phase

97
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:26,300
where she's planning
what she is going to say.

98
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,910
She's thinking about what
emotions she might have.

99
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,570
And she's thinking a little
bit about what his response is

100
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:34,370
going to be, what Joe's
response is going to be.

101
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,090
So she's readied herself
for the situation.

102
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:40,489
And she's thought about a few
contingencies, some what-its.

103
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:45,340
So how do we build this gap
between knowing and doing?

104
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:47,959
One of the things I think
a lot of people don't do

105
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:51,739
is that they don't debrief
after a negotiation.

106
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,790
I think what Ann could do is
then after the negotiation,

107
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,350
she says, well, how did that go?

108
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,590
What skills did I use?

109
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,299
Did I stick to my plan?

110
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,900
Did I plan effectively?

111
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:03,978
And what could I do next time?

112
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:05,519
And if you're doing
this by yourself,

113
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:08,089
you might want to even develop
a bit of a learning journal

114
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:11,319
where you make notes after
each important negotiational

115
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,439
conversation.

116
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:15,389
Work out what you tried to
do, what actually happened,

117
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:18,289
and what you might try and
do differently next time.

118
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,750
And this is a way of starting
to build self-awareness

119
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,980
and some self-discipline
about sticking to your plan

120
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,020
and also planning
more effectively

121
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:29,870
in your negotiation.

122
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,100
So think about this gap
between knowing and doing.

123
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,610
And think about putting into
practice the skills that you've

124
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,819
learned in this module
and also that you

125
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:42,920
plan to use when you go and
try and negotiate or resolve

126
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,509
a conflict.

127
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:47,625
