00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,945


2
00:00:09,945 --> 00:00:13,619
In this topic, we're going to
look at the process of setting

3
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:17,769
an agenda and defining the
issues for the negotiation.

4
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:20,109
And I want to start by thinking
about what would

5
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:22,789
happen if we didn't do that.

6
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:26,339
Let's let consider a meeting--
and many of you have probably

7
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:28,460
been in meetings like
this-- where there

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,870
isn't a clear agenda.

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,800
It's not really obvious what
we're going to be talking

10
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:35,529
about and not talking about.

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,020
And there's no real control
of the time we

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,330
spend on the issues.

13
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:43,579
Those sorts of meetings,
to me, are incredibly

14
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:44,850
frustrating.

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,109
We don't know why
we're meeting.

16
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:49,530
We don't know how we're going
to be running the meeting.

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,100
We haven't got a clear intention
of what the outcome

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,259
is going to be.

19
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:56,140
And people become frustrated
by the process itself.

20
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,969
And naturally, therefore, they
become argumentative.

21
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:01,179
So that process of setting
the agenda is

22
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:03,310
actually really important.

23
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,420
And it's a little bit more
subtle than just simply

24
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,379
sending out a list of dot points
of the things we're

25
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:09,409
going to cover.

26
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:14,129
Setting an agenda and framing
the issues in a persuasive way

27
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:16,759
actually gives you a really
solid foundation for the

28
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,520
negotiation or conflict process
to be successful.

29
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:25,079
So it sounds simple, but it's
actually a really powerful,

30
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:26,989
important part of persuasion.

31
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:28,929
So we're going to go through
that in this topic.

32
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,900
And I'm going to give you some
clues of how to be effective

33
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,400
in setting the scene.

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,480
So how do we go about setting an
agenda effectively when we

35
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,984
sit down to have a meeting?

36
00:01:36,984 --> 00:01:38,989
I think there's a number
of ways that we

37
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:40,795
can approach this.

38
00:01:40,796 --> 00:01:43,970
A conventional way of setting
agenda is that the day before,

39
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:47,579
someone sends an email to the
other side with the dot points

40
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,605
that needs to be discussed.

41
00:01:49,605 --> 00:01:51,350
And that's fine.

42
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:53,119
Some people have a preference
for that.

43
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,130
It's quite a formal way of
conducting a meeting.

44
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:59,699
But if we want to-- if it's more
informal and we haven't

45
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,980
actually set a formal agenda
beforehand, I usually sit and

46
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,160
think to myself, well, I'm
going to reasonably take

47
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,609
control of this.

48
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:09,560
The more that I have that in my
mind that I'm running the

49
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,170
meeting, the more prepared and
the more focused I am.

50
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:15,409
What I like to do is
think about four

51
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:18,840
or five main points.

52
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,550
First one I think is really
important, is the idea of

53
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,800
setting the context.

54
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:30,590


55
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,469
Another way we can think
about this is, why?

56
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:36,400
Why are we meeting?

57
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,219
Here, we can talk about the
broader background, the social

58
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:44,129
context, the economic context,
the business context, our

59
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:48,000
progress to date in this
negotiation or this business

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,439
deal or this project
we're working on.

61
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:53,930
We can give a little bit of a
summary of where we're up to.

62
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,060
This brings everybody up to
speed before we begin.

63
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,920
It also allows us to set the
context in a particular way.

64
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,879
So we might want to emphasize
some points and

65
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,439
de-emphasize others.

66
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,189
So the first part of setting
an effective agenda is

67
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:10,704
establishing a clear
and agreed context.

68
00:03:10,705 --> 00:03:13,800


69
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,890
Second thing we want to do
is to give a sense of the

70
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:18,919
coverage for the meeting.

71
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:21,449
So this is what we'll cover.

72
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:26,219


73
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:28,830
And here, what we want to do
is we want to try and get

74
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,090
agreement on that--

75
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,840


76
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,090
or a consensus.

77
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,439


78
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,870
The things that we're going to
talk about today, and the

79
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,730
things that we're not going
to talk about today.

80
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:47,379
And here, what we want to
think about is trying to

81
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:49,990
generate some enthusiasm
for these issues.

82
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,350
And possibly even talk about
maybe where the meeting is

83
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:56,430
heading-- are we going to try
and get just a sense of an

84
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,680
agreement, a broad outline of
what the agreement will be in

85
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,569
today's meeting, or
is today about

86
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:02,759
getting a final agreement?

87
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:05,709
So we want to get to a clear
sense of where we're heading.

88
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,879
And our "what" frame
gives us that.

89
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:11,909
And then the third one is we
want to try and unearth any

90
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:14,659
objections that might
be existing.

91
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:17,555
So we want to try and manage
any objections.

92
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:23,790


93
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,720
Let's say, for example, that a
particular person couldn't

94
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,090
attend on that day.

95
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:31,254
We might want to manage that
objection by saying, well, we

96
00:04:31,254 --> 00:04:34,610
will report back to him, or I've
got his authority to make

97
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,240
that decision today.

98
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,509
So our objections that come out
through some aspect of the

99
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:44,920
process are really important for
us to manage, because we

100
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,860
don't want those coming up
throughout the meeting and

101
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,750
preventing an effective
process from ensuing.

102
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,759
And the final one
is a simple one.

103
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,009
And this is the "how" frame.

104
00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:02,730


105
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,860
How we'll run the meeting.

106
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,939
If we've got an agreement around
the process and how the

107
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:11,509
meeting's going to run, then
everybody's in agreement of

108
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:12,719
the aspects.

109
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,660
They're not going to challenge
the process.

110
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,820
And we've got that
broad consensus--

111
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:18,599
OK, this is a good way
of running it.

112
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,510
Once we've set that context,
we've set that agenda, then

113
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:25,060
we're ready to dive into the
content of the meeting.

114
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:30,100
So this little framework gives
you a guide for how you can go

115
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,590
about setting an agenda
effectively.

116
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:35,509
Let's imagine that we've got
a-- we'll go back to our

117
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:37,740
friends Anne and Joe
here for a moment.

118
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,120
And they're trying to sort out
this problem they've got with

119
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,879
the researchers, and how
to share their time.

120
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:48,620
Let's imagine that Joe sets a
meeting with Anne to discuss

121
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,189
this problem, or why they
keep having this issue.

122
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:56,420
If he doesn't effectively set
the sane for Anne, she won't

123
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,410
really know what the purpose
is of the conversation, and

124
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,840
she might brush him off--
look, let's just

125
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,699
get on with it, Joe.

126
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:06,149
You've got to share the assets,
so why do we even have

127
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:06,899
to have this meeting?

128
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,514
She'd be quite confused.

129
00:06:08,514 --> 00:06:12,197
But if he more effectively sets
an agenda with her, it

130
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:13,410
should be clearer.

131
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,590
They can have a structured
meeting, and they can have a

132
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:18,810
clear sense of what the purpose
is of the meeting, the

133
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,569
background, and the problem that
they're trying to solve.

134
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:25,219
So let's go through what Joe
could say to establish a

135
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,180
clearer sense of purpose
in a meeting with Anne.

136
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,040
So the first thing he could
do is he sets the context.

137
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,930
So he could say, Anne, I
understand that we've got this

138
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,829
problem where you need to have
your resources released

139
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:42,439
quickly at short notice to
work on the projects.

140
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:45,769
And I'm more inclined to want
to keep the guys working on

141
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:47,789
some ongoing work.

142
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,920
We really need to sort this
problem out, because they are

143
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,370
set up as a shared resource
for us to both work to.

144
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,990
And we've been having this
problem for a while now, so I

145
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,530
really think it's important
that we sit down and work

146
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:04,000
through this problem, and come
up with a viable solution.

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,410
Is that OK with you?

148
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,890
So he's set the context
effectively now.

149
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:11,519
And the second thing he talks
about is he says, look, I want

150
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,779
to talk not only about the
problems we're having, but I

151
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:18,054
want to talk about our
working relationship.

152
00:07:18,055 --> 00:07:21,100
If we can sort this out, I
think we can work more

153
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,560
effectively as colleagues, and
we can make sure the guys are

154
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,480
always being productive, and
that they don't get confused

155
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,450
about who they are reporting
to and who

156
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,670
they're working for.

157
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,020
So if we can sort these things
out, I think it's going to

158
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:36,560
make life a whole lot easier
for us, less conflict, and

159
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,769
we'll have a lot more

160
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:39,879
efficient use of our resources.

161
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:44,930
Then he can say in managing the
objections, look, I know

162
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,040
this is something that neither
you or I want to talk about.

163
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,210
We're both busy people.

164
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:51,569
But this will save
us some time.

165
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:54,019
If we get this sorted out,
it's going to be a good

166
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:59,069
investment of our time to try
and sort out a way of managing

167
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:00,519
this resource.

168
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:03,310
And then the fourth thing
is he could say, look.

169
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,569
Why don't you tell me what your
perspective is on the

170
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:08,670
problem, then I can show you
how I see the issue.

171
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,085
And we can work through some
options and come up with a way

172
00:08:11,084 --> 00:08:13,109
of solving this problem.

173
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:18,290
So those simple, quite low-key
statements allows him to set a

174
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,569
clearer agenda.

175
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:21,990
And then they can have a more
structured meeting where they

176
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,050
can sort out the problem.

177
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,840
So my point in this topic
is a pretty clear one.

178
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,489
Set your agenda.

179
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,110
Get a clear sense of what you
want to talk about, what the

180
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,440
background is.

181
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,770
Manage the objections upfront
and then you'll have a clearer

182
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:38,990
head space between you, a
clearer sense of structure,

183
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,509
and a clearer purpose.

184
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:42,309
And you can have a more
effective negotiation.

185
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:54,591
