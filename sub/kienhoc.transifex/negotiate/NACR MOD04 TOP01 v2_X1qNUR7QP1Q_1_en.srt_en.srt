00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:10,269


3
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:11,480
Welcome back.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,780
This is module four.

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:16,149
We're looking in this module
at communication within the

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,410
context of negotiation and
conflict resolution.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,780
In the last module, we looked
at conflict resolution.

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,140
And I drew a distinction
between negotiation and

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,550
conflict resolution.

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,820
And we looked at some of the
theories of what causes

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,609
conflict, and some of
the theories of how

12
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:34,619
conflict gets resolved.

13
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:36,839
We also looked at the practice
of conflict resolution

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,910
briefly, and some ways that you
can go about approaching

15
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:41,759
conflict resolution.

16
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,729
In this module, what I want to
look at is communication and

17
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:50,019
how important that is for your
skills of being an effective

18
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,210
negotiator and being able to
resolve conflict effectively.

19
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,070
Now, when we think about
communication, a lot of people

20
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,219
say to me, Oh, I know all
of this sort of stuff.

21
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:00,729
I know how to talk
effectively.

22
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:01,679
And I know how to listen.

23
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:03,130
And that's fine.

24
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,439
Most of us are quite effective
communicators.

25
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,959
But when we think about
communication and conflicts in

26
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,229
the context of negotiation of
conflict resolution, what

27
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,820
we're really talking about
are some quite

28
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:16,609
finely honed skills.

29
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,709
We're talking about
communication in the context

30
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:21,379
where there's pressure, where
there's high emotion.

31
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:23,259
And we need to think carefully
about the way that we

32
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,480
structure our communication.

33
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,620
So, in this module, what I want
to introduce you to are

34
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,130
some of those skills.

35
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:32,459
And I want to break
communication down into some

36
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,299
specific skills.

37
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:36,759
I want to give you some
strategies for how you can

38
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,680
take that knowledge and
turn it into practice.

39
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,370
Because, as I said, there's
a big difference between--

40
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:43,910
I believe--

41
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:47,359
between knowing and doing in
conflict resolution, from a

42
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,829
communication perspective.

43
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:51,560
So that's what we're going to
be focusing on in this unit.

44
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,120
When we think about
communication skills, I

45
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,210
usually think it's a good idea
to break communication down

46
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:59,250
into its component parts.

47
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,060
And I'm going to do that
in this module.

48
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,710
And what I want to do is give
you a list, d a tool kit if

49
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:09,909
you like, of communication
skills which we'll

50
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:10,978
talk about in detail.

51
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,600
We'll talk about the application
of those skills.

52
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,079
And I'll also give you some
examples from the case studies

53
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,490
of how those communication
skills could be effective or

54
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,780
could be used.

55
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,360
But let's draw our list, first
of all, and think about what

56
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,980
it is we're going to cover.

57
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:27,649
I'd like to start by talking
about listening skills.

58
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,590
And listening skills, listening
effectively, is

59
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,900
really critical for
communication and conflict

60
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,789
resolution because we want to
try and get an understanding

61
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:39,310
of the other side's interests
and needs.

62
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,140
What is it that's causing
this conflict?

63
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:42,769
What are they looking
to achieve?

64
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,610
And how can we measure out,
or moderate our situation

65
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,050
slightly to best meet
those needs.

66
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,740
So listening is the first thing
we want to talk about.

67
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,710
Next area we want to
think about is

68
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,670
our questioning skills.

69
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:58,889
And questioning, asking good
questions, is pretty

70
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:01,579
fundamental in effective
conflict resolution and

71
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,910
negotiation.

72
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:05,020
And what we want to try and do
is, we want to try and match

73
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,530
the question with the type of
response we're looking for.

74
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,640
So sometimes we want to open
up the conversation.

75
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,609
Sometimes you might want
to close it down.

76
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,450
And the type of question that
we ask will help us do that.

77
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:19,439
Next thing we want
to think about is

78
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,050
effectively asserting ourselves.

79
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,020
When we want to try and get our
point across, we want to

80
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,600
do so in such a manner
that is clear cut.

81
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,199
It's going to keep the
communication flowing.

82
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,759
You won't be feeling like it's
inflaming the situation.

83
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,919
We don't want to be getting
into a screaming match.

84
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,799
So we want to be able to keep an
even tone and get our point

85
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,439
across clearly.

86
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,310
We also want to think about what
do we do in situations

87
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,080
where there's high tension.

88
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,719
And when I think one of the
skills we talked about earlier

89
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:54,419
in the course is this
idea of reframing.

90
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:57,879
And reframing is a really
useful adjunct to our

91
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,699
listening skills because
essentially what we're doing

92
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:03,669
when we're reframing is where
either deescalating the

93
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:06,629
conflict by changing the
language somewhat, or we're

94
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:09,109
changing the way that somebody
views an issue.

95
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,240
And this is really useful
when we're negotiating.

96
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,860
In the world that we live in
we're also going to be useful

97
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,920
to develop some cross-cultural
communication skills.

98
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,670
And what I want to do with this
topic is introduce you to

99
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,600
simple framework for trying
to understand how people

100
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,500
communicate when they come
from different cultural

101
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,769
reference points.

102
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,689
And I'm not going to go into
a lot of detail about

103
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:34,620
cross-cultural negotiation but
I do want to talk about the

104
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,620
communication angle,
or that aspect.

105
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,780
We also want to think about our
non-verbal communication.

106
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:44,219
Because our facial expressions,
our gestures, our

107
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,730
dress, our grooming, all the
things that we say with our

108
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,750
body are part of that
communication.

109
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,329
So I think it's quite important
that we become aware

110
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:55,659
of what we're saying
non-verbally.

111
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:01,040
I don't mean getting into very
prescriptive signs of what

112
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,230
body language might mean.

113
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,150
In fact, I really like the
term body language.

114
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:06,099
I think non-verbal communication
is the

115
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,400
appropriate one here.

116
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,859
So we're really going to focus
on thinking about how we might

117
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,150
manage our non-verbal
communication as well.

118
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:16,639
The final area I want
to talk about is

119
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,050
building common ground.

120
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,660
And this is an area that we
talked about in Module Two in

121
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,540
particular.

122
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,580
And in this particular area,
I want to talk about the

123
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:27,609
communication skills that are
associated with building

124
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,610
common ground.

125
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,430
And there are some pretty
critical skills

126
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,050
that we need to use.

127
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,329
So I'm sure you'll see that
there is a pretty

128
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:36,990
comprehensive range of skills
are going to be looking at in

129
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,829
this topic and this module.

130
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:41,269
And what I want to specifically
think about is,

131
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:43,789
how do I take those
communication skills from

132
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,950
knowing about them to putting
them into practice?

133
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:49,992
