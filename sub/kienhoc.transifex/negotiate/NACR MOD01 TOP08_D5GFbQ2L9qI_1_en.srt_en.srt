2
00:00:10,422 --> 00:00:13,640
In this topic, I want to look
at another thinking error.

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,920
And it's a thinking error
that's called anchoring.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,640
And anchoring is a very common
problem in negotiations that

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,380
you need to be really
conscious of--

6
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:27,099
not falling into the problem
of using faulty anchors.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,929
Let me explain what an anchor
is, first of all.

8
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:34,454
An anchor is a reference point,
or a comparison point.

9
00:00:34,454 --> 00:00:40,399
And people use anchors in
negotiation to make sense of

10
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,679
the proposal that's coming from
the other side, or make

11
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:46,619
sense of whether an agreement
is-- they see an agreement as

12
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:48,949
being fair, reasonable--

13
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,870
we want to make sense of our
world, so we want to compare

14
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:55,919
what is being proposed to us
to something else, some

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,410
objective standard.

16
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:59,519
And this is often called
an anchor.

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,300
So let's talk a little bit about
how anchoring can affect

18
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:04,489
our judgement.

19
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,820
Because what we want to be-- the
point I want to get to in

20
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:10,709
this topic is, be careful
what anchors you use.

21
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:12,719
Let me give you an
example here.

22
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,025
When you walk around a house--

23
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:19,230
you can tell I've bought a few
houses in the last few years

24
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,820
by the house examples
I keep giving--

25
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:24,409
when you walk in to have a look
at a house, one of the

26
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:27,869
first questions people always
ask the real estate agent is,

27
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,780
what do you think the
house will go for?

28
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,609
Now, the smart real
estate agent will

29
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:32,750
always dodge that question.

30
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,659
But what they do often say is,
well, we sold a house around

31
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,269
the corner last month for--

32
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:41,810
and then they'll tell you
how much that house was.

33
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,640
So that provides, for
you, an anchor--

34
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,974
a reference point.

35
00:01:45,974 --> 00:01:49,109
They'll say it was a comparable
property, same

36
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,450
number of rooms, and so on.

37
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,100
Now, you're going to use that
anchor point to help you work

38
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:57,962
out what the value is of the
property, because they're not

39
00:01:57,962 --> 00:02:01,089
going to tell you what the
house is going to go for.

40
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,359
But that anchor point can creep
into your judgement

41
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,390
about what this house
is actually worth.

42
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,759
And it might be completely
different.

43
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,329
It might be the case that you
haven't actually seen that

44
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,890
other house-- and most of the
times, you won't have seen

45
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:15,789
that house.

46
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:19,109
So you don't know if that's an
accurate reference point, or

47
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,830
comparison point.

48
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,780
Let me give you another
example.

49
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,590
Imagine you're at a barbecue and
you're telling your uncle

50
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,670
that you're thinking of
selling your business.

51
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:32,959
And you ask him, well, what do
you think I should sell the

52
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,230
business for?

53
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:37,469
And he says to you, well, when
I sold my business, I sold it

54
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:41,006
for six times the turnover--

55
00:02:41,006 --> 00:02:43,680
OK, so my turnover was
$1 million and I

56
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,450
sold it for $6 million.

57
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:47,234
So maybe you should
think about that.

58
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:49,910
The next day you go into the
negotiation, and you tell the

59
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:52,810
person who's wanting to buy your
business, I think I want

60
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,580
six times that EBIT.

61
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,750
And they tell you,
you're crazy.

62
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,719
We'd never pay that much
for a business.

63
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,949
And this disagreement emerges.

64
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:01,759
What have you used?

65
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,769
You used a random anchor from
something that your uncle has

66
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,409
told you about at a barbecue.

67
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:10,770
And that anchor now becomes
a reference point for you.

68
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:15,880
Now, anchors also relate
to where we start in a

69
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,030
negotiation.

70
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,719
And where we start can often
have a very big bearing on

71
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:23,370
where we finish, particularly
with respect to price.

72
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,620
Let me give you an example.

73
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,710


74
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,560
Let's say this is our
range that we're

75
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,000
going to bargain around.

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,770
And let's say I'm selling
a car to my friend.

77
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:44,460
And the car is roughly
worth $25,000.

78
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:51,219
And our range begins down here
at $20,000, and we'll put the

79
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:54,300
number $35,000 up here, OK?

80
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,870
So let's say this is a
reasonable amount of money

81
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,450
that the car is worth.

82
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:02,329
My friend has started
at $20,000--

83
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,460
well, we won't call him a
friend, actually-- we'll call

84
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,099
them just the person I'm
selling the car to.

85
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:10,810
They've started at $20,000, and
I've started at $35,000.

86
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,408
I've told them I want
$35,000 for the car.

87
00:04:15,407 --> 00:04:18,879
So they come up a little bit,
and they say, all right, I'll

88
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,969
give you $25,000.

89
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,540
And I say, all right, well, I'll
come down the same amount

90
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,660
to $30,000.

91
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,910
So we've both moved,
what, $5,000.

92
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,150
These seems, what--

93
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:34,314
reasonable, doesn't it?

94
00:04:34,314 --> 00:04:36,610
It seems fair that
we've both moved.

95
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,600
So we're stuck.

96
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,800
You're saying $25,000.

97
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,120
I'm saying $30,000.

98
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,680
Now, because I'm a fair guy--

99
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,110
I'm a nice guy--

100
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,110
I turn around and I say to
you, let's split the

101
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,420
difference.

102
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:53,699
Let's settle on $27,500
for the car.

103
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,870
And you say, well, that
sounds about right.

104
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,009
OK, who's won the negotiation?

105
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:00,180
I have, haven't I?

106
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:06,540
Because I've claimed $2,500 of
value because the real fair

107
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,080
price is $25,000.

108
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,629
But because I started here,
I started high,

109
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:16,420
and this is my anchor.

110
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,990
This is my anchor point.

111
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:22,189
I could say to you that I've
moved the same amount of

112
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,370
distance in our bargaining.

113
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,340
So the first price that you
offer in a negotiation often

114
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:33,029
becomes a very powerful what--
anchor around which the

115
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:34,989
negotiation occurs.

116
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,910
So if there's an unknown
amount that a good or a

117
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,970
service is worth, using this
theory, we would say we want

118
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,730
to try and start and give
ourselves a bit of room to

119
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,270
negotiate, because our
first price will be a

120
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:49,669
very powerful anchor.

121
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:54,790
It'll change the other side's
expectation of what the range

122
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,780
of that negotiation
will look like.

123
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:00,829
So be very careful of what
anchors you pick up on in

124
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:03,740
negotiation, and be very careful
of what anchors you

125
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,389
buy into and see
as legitimate.

126
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:10,370
Because anchoring has a big
impact on where the

127
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,660
negotiation heads.

128
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,040
Think about that next time
you're negotiating.

129
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,467
