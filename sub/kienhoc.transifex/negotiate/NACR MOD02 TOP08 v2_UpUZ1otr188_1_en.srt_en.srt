00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,246
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:10,246 --> 00:00:12,880
In the bargaining
phase, you need

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,660
to also be aware that
sometimes tactics

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,850
emerge, and the other parties
can occasionally give in

5
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,340
to the temptation to try and
use a tactic or a dirty trick

6
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:29,789
to get the upper hand in
that bargaining process.

7
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:35,079
And we want to be aware when
a tactic is emerging or being

8
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:40,619
used, to see it for what it is,
understand the psychology that

9
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:44,629
works behind the tactic,
and also have a strategy

10
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:49,840
to kind of bring the negotiation
back into an even keel,

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,270
so that we can finish the
negotiation effectively.

12
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,400
So we need to be conscious
of, first of all,

13
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:59,909
seeing what the tactic is being
used, and then we can respond.

14
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:04,319
Now, I don't think that
it's a good idea for you

15
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,629
to take these tactics
and start to use them.

16
00:01:07,629 --> 00:01:10,500
Tactics can be useful
at different stages

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,909
of the negotiation, but an
inexperienced negotiator

18
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:17,450
using a tactic like the ones
I'm going to talk to you

19
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,576
about can sometimes
look very foolish.

20
00:01:20,575 --> 00:01:21,949
So you really need
to be careful.

21
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,450
So a little bit of
a word of warning

22
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,079
around taking these
tactics, and going,

23
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,739
and starting to use them.

24
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:30,429
I really am trying to get
across to you more an awareness

25
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,060
of the tactics, rather than
trying to advocate them to you.

26
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,719
So let's take a look at
a few that we can see.

27
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,530
Let's take three
typical tactics you see.

28
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,989
A common one is the Good
Cop / Bad Cop technique.

29
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:49,119
Another one we see is the
Bogey, and the third one

30
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,109
I'm going to talk about
is the Nibble technique.

31
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:57,280
Let's start with looking
at Good Cop / Bad Cop,

32
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,570
and this is really the
oldest trick in the book.

33
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:01,250
The way Good Cop
/ Bad Cop works,

34
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,909
if you're not
familiar with, is it's

35
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:06,119
designed to provide a contrast.

36
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,620
And the name comes from the idea
of a prisoner being interviewed

37
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,520
for a crime.

38
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,830
The bad cop comes in and
roughs up the prisoner

39
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,400
and intimidates them,
and then the good cop

40
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,039
comes in, gives them a cup
of coffee, dabs their wounds,

41
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:24,269
and tries to extract
the concession.

42
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,719
And it's the contrast between
the bad cop and the good cop

43
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:32,389
that leads the prisoner
to 'fess up to the crime.

44
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:35,659
Now, the whole premise
of the Good Cop / Bad Cop

45
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:38,199
is the idea of reciprocity.

46
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,699
Let's take another example where
you see Good Cop / Bad Cop.

47
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:43,879
It's really common
in buying cars.

48
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,500
What you'll see
is, let's imagine

49
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,530
the customer wants to buy
the car, and they're stuck.

50
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,770
And they want to pay
$20,000 for the car,

51
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,200
let's say, and the
sales person wants

52
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,926
to sell it to them for $25,000.

53
00:02:57,926 --> 00:03:00,259
Now, they're stuck at this
final point in the bargaining

54
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:05,009
process, what normally happens
here is the customer says,

55
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:08,560
I won't go over $20,000,
and the sales person says,

56
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,129
I can't make that
kind of decision,

57
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:13,079
but let me go and
speak to my boss.

58
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,120
So off they go while you wait
around twiddling your thumbs.

59
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,710
And then there's this big show
of them arguing over the price.

60
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,530
And they come back and they
say, look, I really pushed him,

61
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,169
but the best he
could do was $22,500.

62
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:30,000
What do you think about that?

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,610
And you're now left
with this position where

64
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,290
you feel a little bit
indebted to the sales person.

65
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:37,349
Oh, they've stuck
their neck out for me.

66
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:39,409
They've asked the
sales manager when

67
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:41,270
they shouldn't have done that.

68
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:44,400
Oh, OK, thank you so
much for asking for me.

69
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,870
Of course I'll accept
the $22,500 deal.

70
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,243
Which is ludicrous.

71
00:03:49,243 --> 00:03:51,409
The person who's taking the
money out of your pocket

72
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:52,789
is the sales person.

73
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:54,949
Just because they're
nice and friendly to you

74
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:58,139
doesn't mean they're not
trying to get a good deal.

75
00:03:58,139 --> 00:03:59,359
That's Good Cop / Bad Cop.

76
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,390
It rests on the
idea of reciprocity.

77
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:06,500
You've given me something that
I wouldn't have normally got.

78
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,490
You've done me a favor.

79
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,040
Next one you see that I
think is an interesting one

80
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,639
is what's called the Bogie.

81
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:18,528
And the Bogie tactic relies
on the idea that I tell you

82
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:21,480
I can't agree to something,
there's some particular clause,

83
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,250
oh, I could never agree to that.

84
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,449
Oh, that's sacred,
that's sacrosanct.

85
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:26,959
We'd never agree to that.

86
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,620
And then lo and behold,
later in the negotiation,

87
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,829
it comes up that, oh, maybe I
could agree to that concession,

88
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:35,699
maybe under certain
circumstances,

89
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,759
but only if you'll make
this large concession to me.

90
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:43,439
So I set up a Bogie.

91
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,089
I set up the idea that this is
a really important concession

92
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:48,739
that I won't make.

93
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,300
And then later on, I do
make that concession.

94
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,310
All along, I was
willing to make it.

95
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,800
So the whole idea is that I
extract a larger concession

96
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,990
from you by building this
concession up that I'm

97
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,420
going to make.

98
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,379
The final one is what's
called the Nibble.

99
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:07,079
And the Nibble is
something that happens

100
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,819
right at the very death
of the negotiation, right

101
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:12,360
when a negotiation
is about to end.

102
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,980
And usually it's around
some additional clause,

103
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,970
or some additional
piece of value

104
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,140
that I'm trying to extract.

105
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:22,240
You might have bought a
suit, for example, once,

106
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,030
and just as you're
at the cash register,

107
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:26,439
the sales person says, oh,
you need a tie with that.

108
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,879
Or you might have bought
a car, and the person

109
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,769
wants you to add a rust
protection to the car.

110
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:35,699
Well, what they're doing
is they're doing a Nibble.

111
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:40,469
They're giving you some
little bit of extra incentive,

112
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,095
or they're trying to get a
little bit more value out

113
00:05:43,095 --> 00:05:46,160
of the deal by doing it
right at the very end.

114
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,730
And we want to be conscious
that this is a Nibble.

115
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:53,569
Now, how do these tactics work?

116
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:55,449
Let's talk about that.

117
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:57,089
So there's a little
bit of psychology

118
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:59,359
that sits behind these tactics.

119
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,540
And why they are
so commonly used

120
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,410
is really because
they tend to work.

121
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:10,200
So if we take something
like the Bogie,

122
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,360
the Bogie is really wrested
around the idea of the contrast

123
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,009
principle.

124
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:18,860
You know, they told us that they
wouldn't do this concession,

125
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,980
and then they did.

126
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,230
So it's this kind
of contrast that

127
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,521
falls between not being able
to get something, and then

128
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:25,896
all of a sudden,
we could get it.

129
00:06:25,896 --> 00:06:27,439
Maybe we were
brilliant negotiators

130
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,230
because we've got them
to give us something

131
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,920
that they wouldn't give.

132
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,650
We think about the Nibble.

133
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:37,870
This is all based around the
principal of the scarcity idea.

134
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,399
Like, we've got this deal,
and it's a really good deal,

135
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,889
and all they wanted was just
for us to deliver the products

136
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:45,879
for free, and then we
still had the deal.

137
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,680
And there was still
plenty of margin in it.

138
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,259
So they were going to take
the deal off the table

139
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:51,730
if we didn't agree to that.

140
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:56,300
So there's this sort
of risk resistance,

141
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:02,060
or resistance to risk that
we have, and some people are

142
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,730
very disinclined to take
on that sort of risk.

143
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,000
They won't risk losing the deal.

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,230
Now, the psychology that
sits behind these tactics

145
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,300
is what makes them work.

146
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:21,040
We also can think, then, how
do I respond to these tactics?

147
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,230
And I'm going to give you three
strategies that we can use.

148
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:29,950
First is, we can think
about the idea of naming it.

149
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:35,659
If you call a tactic for what
it is, if you pointed out

150
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,290
that you can see what tactic
it is that's being used,

151
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:43,790
then it sometimes is
the case that the person

152
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,250
will abandon it.

153
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,709
It's almost like, oh,
you've found me out, OK?

154
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:51,569
So you wouldn't probably
say, that's the worst

155
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:54,240
Bogie I've ever seen in
20 years of negotiating.

156
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,379
But you might say
something like, you're

157
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,959
bringing to the table an
issue that we haven't talked

158
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,120
about beforehand, and it's right
at the end of the negotiation.

159
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,069
I think we need to
carry on with the terms

160
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,790
that we've already agreed to.

161
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:12,670
So what we're talking about
here is showing the other side,

162
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,270
I'm onto you.

163
00:08:13,269 --> 00:08:15,189
I can see what you're doing.

164
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:17,579
The next one is
to just ignore it.

165
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:19,401
Say, look, let's not
talk about that now.

166
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:20,860
We've already got
a good agreement.

167
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,484
Let's stick to what
we've talked about,

168
00:08:22,483 --> 00:08:23,984
and let's go on
with the agreement.

169
00:08:23,985 --> 00:08:25,960
So you don't get
emotionally hooked

170
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:29,669
in to being angry, and saying
the tactic, that you see it

171
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,650
for what it is.

172
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:33,928
It's a cheap ploy, and
you just let it go.

173
00:08:33,928 --> 00:08:37,418
And the final one is
that you respond in kind.

174
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:40,460
You've got your tactic
that you can respond.

175
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:45,990
So if they say, well, could
you throw in delivery?

176
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:51,409
You say, yes, but only if
you pay a little bit more.

177
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:55,219
So the idea here is that the
negotiations open up again.

178
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,879
So my key takeaway for
this topic is this.

179
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:03,330
Don't get too upset
and flustered when

180
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,620
somebody uses a tactic with you.

181
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,710
See it for what it
is, come up with a way

182
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,680
of turning the tactic around,
or responding to the tactic,

183
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,949
and keep the negotiation
moving forward.

184
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,997
