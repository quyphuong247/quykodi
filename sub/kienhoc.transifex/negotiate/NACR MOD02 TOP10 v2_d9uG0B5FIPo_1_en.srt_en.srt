1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,397


2
00:00:10,397 --> 00:00:10,910
OK.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:11,800
And this topic--

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,620
it's our final topic
for the module.

5
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:17,800
And this is around implementing
your plan.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,945
At the end of an agreement,
we usually put in

7
00:00:21,945 --> 00:00:23,940
place an action plan.

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,330
Who's going to do what?

9
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:26,539
When's it going to start?

10
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:28,809
How do we get this
thing rolling?

11
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:31,899
I think it's a good idea to
start to be really realistic

12
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:32,750
at this stage.

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,600
So is this plan going to work?

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,609
We need to reality test before
we actually agree to it.

15
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:43,409
Once we've got that agreement in
place, we need to start to

16
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:47,259
put it in place, and we
need to stick to it.

17
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:51,289
Having said that, once we get
an agreement in place,

18
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:54,659
sometimes, we realize that
it has some weaknesses.

19
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:57,489
Sometimes, we realize that hey,
maybe we're going to need

20
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,450
to revise this a little bit.

21
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,450
So in the case of Anne and Joe,
where it's a relatively

22
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,590
informal agreement, they
probably want to do a review

23
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,950
or a check back with one another
after a few months.

24
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,810
Hey, is this working for you?

25
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,379
Because it's working
for me in this way.

26
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:14,319
This is a little thing
I'd like to change.

27
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,219
But in general terms,
it's working.

28
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:20,250
With a contract, that will be
a lot more difficult to do,

29
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,879
obviously, because we've signed
and we've committed and

30
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:25,219
we've got a legally enforceable
document that

31
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:28,079
says, hey, this is the terms
of our agreement.

32
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:30,679
That's always going to be true
if we're working in the one

33
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,410
jurisdiction.

34
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,349
But sometimes, in international
business, we

35
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:37,189
might be working across two
different jurisdictions.

36
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:40,179
And we may actually have trouble
enforcing a contract.

37
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,410
So we really need to be a little
bit more flexible in

38
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,640
some cultural contexts, where
we're willing to amend and

39
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,739
flex and shape an agreement
so that it works on

40
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:55,019
going for the parties.

41
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:56,750
Some agreements--

42
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,760
for example, in the IT industry,
we have what are

43
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,190
called service level
agreements.

44
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:07,429
And a service level agreement is
something where we agree on

45
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,800
the response time, the amount
of hour of maintenance, the

46
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,230
amount of hours of support that
we are supplying to a

47
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:18,449
customer to support that IT
infrastructure that we've put

48
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:23,169
in place or the software that
the customer has bought.

49
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:25,869
And that service level agreement
is something that

50
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,030
the parties are essentially
committing to.

51
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,640
This is what we're buying
from you, Mr. Provider.

52
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:36,159
What you don't want to have
happen is every meeting, we

53
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,439
drag out the contract or every
meeting we drag out the

54
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,099
service level agreement, and it
becomes this formal binding

55
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,599
contractually-based
discussion.

56
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,414
Obviously, this sets the
commercial terms for the

57
00:02:50,414 --> 00:02:51,310
arrangement.

58
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,099
But we want to still manage
the relationship.

59
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:56,530
We want to still nurture
the relationship.

60
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,590
And we want to build a
relationship that the contract

61
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,099
just formalizes.

62
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:04,449
So we want to, if we can,
particularly in commercial

63
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:07,319
client-based negotiations,
keep the agreement in the

64
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,310
background.

65
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,550
It's there if we need it, but
what we want to do is manage

66
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,450
the ongoing relationship
as well.

67
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:15,539
So just because you've got a
contract doesn't mean you can

68
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:18,179
forget about the relationship.

69
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,530
Implementation requires ongoing

70
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,610
commitment and ongoing trust.

71
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,680
Sometimes, we need to
do a review and

72
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,300
check that it's working.

73
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,420
But as a general rule, we
want to stick to what

74
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,179
we've agreed to.

75
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,480
So this module has looked at
the phases of negotiation.

76
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:42,119
I've broken negotiation down
into five main phases.

77
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,450
Of course, as I said at the
outset, sometimes a

78
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:48,199
negotiation isn't always as
clean and neat as stage one,

79
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,519
stage two, stage three,
et cetera.

80
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,600
Sometimes, it'll move
around a bit.

81
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:57,250
But try to recognize when you're
moving from one phase

82
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,689
to the next in a negotiation,
and recognize when

83
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:02,250
it's time to move.

84
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:02,560
OK.

85
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,020
We've talked about it--

86
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,980
enough.

87
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,879
Let's move on to bargaining.

88
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,210
OK.

89
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,450
We've got most of our
issue sorted out.

90
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,719
Let's now move to the
agreement phase.

91
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,759
We've got an agreement, now
let's implement it.

92
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,539
You need to just keep watch
of how the negotiation is

93
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,209
progressing.

94
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,389
In the next module, we're going
to look at conflict

95
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:24,680
resolution.

96
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,209
It's a little bit different to
what we've been talking about

97
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:29,180
so far with negotiation.

98
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,259
We're really going to focus in
on conflicts rather than

99
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:33,509
negotiation.

100
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:36,524
