00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,973


2
00:00:09,973 --> 00:00:12,440
So we've set the scene,
in terms of looking

3
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:16,666
at some theories of conflict,
and some different explanations

4
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:20,670
for why conflict arises and
why it becomes entrenched.

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,800
Let's talk in this topic about
some third-party interventions

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,030
to conflict.

7
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,270
It's quite common in
dealing with conflict

8
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:33,109
that we need to involve
a third party to help

9
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:35,619
the parties through
the conflict.

10
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,149
This could be a
mediator, it might

11
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:41,019
be a manager in an
office, it could end up

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,190
being at a tribunal,
or even a judge.

13
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:50,079
But sometimes, we're dealing
with much more low level

14
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,979
than it ending up at a court.

15
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:55,679
And these types
of approaches have

16
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,369
been called alternative
dispute resolution,

17
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:03,500
and the alternative is the
alternative to going to court.

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:09,129
What do parties need to have
this third-party intervention?

19
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:13,939
The simple explanation for why
a third party becomes involved

20
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:18,109
is because the relationship
has broken down to the extent

21
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:21,689
that the parties can no longer
communicate effectively.

22
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:24,989
And this is sometimes because
the conflict is prolonged,

23
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:26,780
or perhaps they've
made several attempts

24
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,230
to resolve the conflict
themselves without success,

25
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,910
or perhaps the
conflict is starting

26
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:35,979
to have a negative
fallout on others.

27
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,630
Perhaps it's starting
to cost money.

28
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:39,890
Perhaps it's starting
to affect the community.

29
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,209
Perhaps it's starting
to hold things up.

30
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:46,639
So a third party comes in
and they help the disputants,

31
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,319
or the people in the conflict
to move past this stuck state,

32
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,859
and move towards a resolution.

33
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:59,289
And the type of intervention
that ends up taking place

34
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,640
in a conflict is,
to some extent,

35
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,370
dependent upon the
type of conflict

36
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,719
that it is, how extreme
it is, whether it's

37
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,879
occurring against
a legal framework,

38
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,008
or whether it's a
community dispute.

39
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:15,793
Maybe it's occurring before
the parties go to court,

40
00:02:15,794 --> 00:02:17,460
There's a lot of
variance in determining

41
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,097
how much intervention there is.

42
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,680
There's a good way
of describing this,

43
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,030
and that is to talk about
the level of intervention

44
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,460
of a third party in the
decision making process.

45
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,159
So if we take
negotiation which we've

46
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,909
talked a fair bit in
the first two modules,

47
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:36,299
negotiation has a very low
level of external intervention.

48
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,300
Sometimes you might have
somebody assisting the parties

49
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,950
to negotiate, perhaps
even sitting in the room

50
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:45,810
and helping them, pointing them
out when they're off track.

51
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,500
But essentially,
negotiation is face-to-face,

52
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,979
and there's no
third-party intervention.

53
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:53,729
Mediation, we move
up and there's

54
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:56,269
a low level of
third-party intervention.

55
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,920
Essentially, a mediator
is supporting the parties'

56
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:02,419
communication and structuring
that communication.

57
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:06,509
Conciliation involves
a little bit more power

58
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:08,139
on the part of the third party.

59
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:15,209
So it's used, for example,
in industrial disputes where

60
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,740
the third party essentially
is problem-solving,

61
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,600
but they have a
little bit of power

62
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,120
to transform into a new model,
which would be arbitration.

63
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,180
And arbitration is where a
third party is essentially

64
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,659
receiving submissions,
and negotiating,

65
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:32,740
and then delivering
their findings.

66
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,010
Insurance disputes, for example,
are handled with arbitration,

67
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:38,139
and also, industrial relations.

68
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:40,069
You may move to
a tribunal, where

69
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:43,120
it's a quasi-judicial process.

70
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,150
Settling small
claims, for example,

71
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,170
or administrative
appeals are sometimes

72
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:50,498
handled with this
model of a tribunal.

73
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:52,039
And then we move to
the highest level

74
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,759
of third-party
intervention, which

75
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,560
is a court where a judge
is essentially handing down

76
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,699
their decision.

77
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:02,609
So third parties help
the people in conflict,

78
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,320
the parties to the conflict.

79
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,650
They help them to resolve
it by facilitating

80
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,780
their communication.

81
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,620
Most models of dispute
resolution are voluntary,

82
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,850
so it's really important
that the mediator, if that's

83
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,920
the model we're using, is
seen as being well-trained,

84
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,410
and seen as being
independent and unbiased.

85
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,390
We also need to think
about some micro-skills

86
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:34,829
that a third party can use,
and most third parties,

87
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:36,930
whether it be mediation,
or conciliation, or even

88
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,319
arbitration, will practice
these kinds of skills.

89
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:45,769
That is, they set ground
rules for the parties

90
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:48,409
to help them communicate.

91
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,350
These rules are things like
not attacking one another,

92
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:58,340
focusing in on the key issues,
and letting one another speak.

93
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,419
They structure
the communication.

94
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,189
The communication takes place
within a given structure,

95
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:10,310
and that normally involves both
parties giving some testimony

96
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,280
to what's caused the conflict,
and what the key issues are.

97
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,759
Then some summarizing
of the key issues.

98
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,029
Then some negotiation,
issue by issue,

99
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:21,669
and then coming up
with some options.

100
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:26,210
They also help the parties
to identify the key issues.

101
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:32,750
And sometimes, this requires
some expertise, sometimes

102
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,629
some academic
knowledge, sometimes

103
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:36,689
knowledge of an
industry, sometimes

104
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:39,339
some knowledge of what a
legal judgement would be.

105
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,659
And understanding
those key issues

106
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,939
allows the third parties,
as opposed to the conflict,

107
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:50,689
to have an informed third party
giving them some reflection,

108
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:54,009
or some further insight
on their conflict.

109
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:57,269
And this allows them to
help analyze the conflict

110
00:05:57,269 --> 00:05:59,839
that they're in, and start
to see it differently,

111
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,509
and come up with some
options for resolution.

112
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:05,959
So third parties are generally
very skilled communicators.

113
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:08,509
They bring to the
table that knowledge

114
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:10,810
of how to manage conflicts,
and some understanding

115
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,319
of the theory of
conflict, so they

116
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,129
bring a theoretical perspective.

117
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:17,730
They should have an
understanding of the law

118
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,210
if there's a specific
legal framework they're

119
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:21,339
working within.

120
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,899
And they should be able to
connect, and build empathy

121
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:25,870
and rapport with the parties.

122
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,680
The third parties can be
very beneficial in helping

123
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,079
resolve conflict.

124
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:33,639
There are some
drawbacks at times.

125
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,149
Most notably is the time that's
involved from a third party.

126
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:41,579
There can be costs associated
with bringing a third party in.

127
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:44,659
And sometimes, the parties
themselves to the conflict

128
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,330
can feel as though they're
giving away control

129
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:49,469
to the third party,
and they lose

130
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,800
some sense of their
independence and their ability

131
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,670
to negotiate independent
of that third party.

132
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,900
That is, they become dependent
upon the third party.

133
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:00,099
So we've got some
pros and cons that we

134
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,900
need to keep in mind when we're
going to approach and involve

135
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:06,859
a third party in a conflict.

136
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,684
