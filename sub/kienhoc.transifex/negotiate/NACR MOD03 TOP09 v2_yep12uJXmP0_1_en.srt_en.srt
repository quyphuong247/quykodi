1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,029


2
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:13,369
Once we've done some
analysis of the conflict,

3
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:17,839
we need to-- ideally, with
the parties in the room

4
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,960
if the sort of conflict
suits that-- sometimes, we

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,679
might shuffle between the
parties and negotiate that way.

6
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:27,839
Sometimes, it's written.

7
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,120
Sometimes, it's email.

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,140
In fact, there's thousands
of disputes resolved

9
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,039
every year-- eBay
solves something

10
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,030
like tens of thousands
of disputes every year.

11
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,390
We think about the method
that we're going to use.

12
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,140
It may be some
variant of mediation.

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,570
It might be a tribunal.

14
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,460
It might be direct collaborative
problem-solving or negotiation.

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,480
Somewhere in that
process, the parties

16
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:58,339
are going to have to
generate some options

17
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,880
and cost those options.

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,760
And that's what
this topic's about.

19
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:05,727
Let's start by talking
about generating options.

20
00:01:05,727 --> 00:01:07,810
There's a number of different
ways for the parties

21
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,439
to generate options.

22
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,370
And normally, it's some variant
of what's called brainstorming.

23
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,050
Brainstorming is where
the parties generate

24
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:21,890
multiple options in a free
flowing communication.

25
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,939
Sometimes, it's being
recorded on the board.

26
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,819
Sometimes, it might be just a
written form of brainstorming.

27
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:30,114
Sometimes, it's a more measured
discussion of some options.

28
00:01:30,114 --> 00:01:31,739
And what we're doing
when we brainstorm

29
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:33,379
is we're trying to
get as many options

30
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:36,199
out that we can consider
and be as creative as we can

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,900
for how we can
resolve a conflict

32
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,370
and come up with some options.

33
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,520
And when we do that, it's useful
to put some rules around that.

34
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,140
You might say, for example,
whenever you give an option,

35
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,727
it's got to be an option that
meets everybody's interest.

36
00:01:48,727 --> 00:01:50,435
That makes it a little
bit more difficult

37
00:01:50,435 --> 00:01:53,310
and requires a bit more focus.

38
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,230
Once we've got some
options generated,

39
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,260
then we need to do
what's called costing.

40
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,109
And costing involves
us trying to assess

41
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:04,799
which of those
many options we're

42
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,109
going to choose by working
out the pros and cons of each

43
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,490
of the options.

44
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,750
So what we might
do is we might take

45
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,759
two or three of the
options and work out

46
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,769
the pros and cons of putting
that option in place.

47
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,670
One of the options might take
a long time, for example.

48
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:24,049
And that might be an impediment
to putting it in place.

49
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,939
One might be too costly.

50
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:27,379
And that might be an impediment.

51
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:31,379
One might rely on large
structural change,

52
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:35,189
maybe redesigning a workplace
or redesigning a remuneration

53
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:40,990
system or redesigning the
rules of a social group.

54
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,870
So our options need to
be ones that, ideally,

55
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,009
are going to be reasonably
practical for us

56
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:49,560
to put in place.

57
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,520
There's an important
point to be made here,

58
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,439
particularly if the
conflict resolution

59
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,210
process involves a third party.

60
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,860
And I've personally
experienced this myself.

61
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,110
Sometimes, the parties
to the conflict

62
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,036
will say to the mediator, well,
what do you think we should do?

63
00:03:04,036 --> 00:03:05,409
And what they're
doing is they're

64
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:09,609
ceding some power or
control of the resolution

65
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,190
to the third party.

66
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:13,060
And this is one
thing we definitely

67
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,240
do not want to have happen.

68
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,450
There's a fundamental principle
in mediation in particular,

69
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:21,530
and that is that we want
the parties themselves

70
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,699
to come up with the options.

71
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:26,500
We want them to
generate the solution.

72
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,930
And the principal is this.

73
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,170
If the parties come
up with the solutions

74
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:32,919
and the options
themselves, they then

75
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:36,349
will take more ownership
of those options

76
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,289
as they implement
them, because they're

77
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:40,840
the ones who came
up with the option.

78
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,110
If the option is being
generated by a third party--

79
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,140
so if I were to say, well, I
think you guys should do X,

80
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:49,883
then if it doesn't work,
they're going to blame me

81
00:03:49,883 --> 00:03:52,299
and they're going to say, well,
it was never our solution.

82
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,910
It was imposed by
the third party.

83
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:57,090
So what we want to
do here is remember

84
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,180
that if the parties generate
the options themselves,

85
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,900
they will take ownership of it.

86
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,450
And it will also
suit their situation.

87
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:08,489
The third party is there
to just simply help them

88
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,180
and to massage the
options somewhat,

89
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,840
get them to think about
is this is practicable?

90
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,149
Will we be able to
put this into place?

91
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,459
Is it a realistic solution?

92
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:21,449
Key point is that you're
there to facilitate

93
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:24,979
their process of reflection,
not to give them an option.

94
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,740
We can also think about
the process of costing.

95
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,389
A third party will sometimes
help people in conflict

96
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:36,459
to cost out the consequences
of their behavior.

97
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:38,699
What I mean by that is this.

98
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,699
A third party might say,
you can carry on fighting

99
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,639
and there's going to be some
pros and some cons of you

100
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,149
carrying on fighting.

101
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:48,479
What are the pros?

102
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,259
Well, it'll be stimulating.

103
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:52,649
You may end up winning.

104
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:54,769
You'll have something
to talk about.

105
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:57,839
It'll be exciting for you to
be in conflict-- maybe slightly

106
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,449
tongue in cheek there.

107
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:01,420
What are the cons?

108
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,819
Well, it'll distract
you from your real work.

109
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:06,170
It'll cost you money.

110
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,080
You may lose your reputation.

111
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,479
You may become embarrassed.

112
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,680
It might be damaging
to other relationships.

113
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,329
So the costing
process is sometimes

114
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:20,909
useful to get parties to
actually come to the table

115
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,790
and start to try and
resolve the conflict.

116
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,600
So in this topic, we've looked
at those issues-- generating

117
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,830
options-- we're going to start
to choose an option by costing

118
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:34,779
it out-- and also the process
of costing and costing

119
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:37,929
the consequences of carrying
on with the conflict

120
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,980
and the benefits
of resolving it.

121
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,584
