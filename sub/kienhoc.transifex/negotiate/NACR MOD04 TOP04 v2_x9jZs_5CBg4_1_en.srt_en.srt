[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:09,894 --> 00:00:12,179
OK, in this topic, we're
going to look at the

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,500
second set of skills.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,830
And that's the skills of asking
good questions, or have

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,179
questioning skills.

6
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:20,809
And to my way of thinking
there's two critical parts of

7
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:22,750
the skill of questioning.

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:28,100
One relates to matching the type
of question that we ask

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,840
with the sort of answer that
we're looking for.

10
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:35,280
And that is knowing what the
impact is of a particular type

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,950
of question.

12
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:42,070
The second part of it is
the tonal aspect of

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,590
how we ask a question.

14
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,700
So for example, we might have
a rising inflation or a

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,210
falling inflection.

16
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,259
And that's part of how
we use the tone.

17
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:55,149
We could use a very
direct tone--

18
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:56,500
WHY did you do that?

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,060
Or a curious tone--

20
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,710
why did you DO THAT?

21
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,990
Those differences, those subtle
differences in how we

22
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,320
ask a question will have
a big impact on the

23
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,659
other side's response.

24
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:10,549
So we want to think carefully
about not only the type of

25
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:13,929
question that we ask, but also
how we ask that question.

26
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,590
So there are two types of
questions that we can draw a

27
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,299
distinction with to begin with
discussion about different

28
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:21,670
types of questions.

29
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,600
And we can talk about the
difference between

30
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:28,229
closed-ended questions and
open-ended questions.

31
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,430
Let's talk a little bit about
those for a moment.

32
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:35,710
Open-ended questions are the
types of questions that we use

33
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:39,649
when we want the other side to
have a choice about how much

34
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,320
they tell us or where they
take the question, the

35
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,729
direction that they
take it in.

36
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,939
So open-ended questions are
usually things that begin with

37
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:50,420
one of the five w's or an h.

38
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:57,950
So it's "which", "where",
"when", "who", "why", and

39
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,400
"how." We could also add
questions like "tell me

40
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,030
about", "can you elaborate on",
"can you explain?" Those

41
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,640
kinds of questions give the
counterparty a great deal of

42
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:14,149
choice about where they
go in their quite

43
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,349
expansive style of questions.

44
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:19,669
And we can contrast those
with what I call

45
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:21,750
closed-ended questions.

46
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:27,319
Closed-ended questions,
obviously, yes/no questions,

47
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:31,859
"can you", "do you", "will you",
"how much", "how many."

48
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,430
Those kinds of questions are
a quite specific style of

49
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,270
questions and they put
the speaker in

50
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,850
a particular direction.

51
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:42,189
You're sending them in a
particular direction.

52
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:45,340
And you're asking them to give
you a very direct answer.

53
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,960
And sometimes it's
important that we

54
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,219
ask what direct questions.

55
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:53,099
"Did you do this?" "Can you do
this?" "Will you deliver by

56
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,810
this date?" "Can you deliver
by this date?"

57
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,120
"Have you got these products?"
"Have you got that

58
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,939
capability?" "Can you do this?"
These type of questions

59
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:06,629
force the other party to give
us a direct answer.

60
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:09,759
So what we want to do in
effective negotiation and

61
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,489
conflict resolution is have a
balance of opened and closed.

62
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,610
We don't want to be asking
all open-ended questions,

63
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,410
otherwise we'll be
going all day.

64
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:21,049
We'll be talking, but we won't
be going in any direction.

65
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,430
Equally, we don't to be asking
all closed-ended questions,

66
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,750
because it's going to feel
like it's an inquisition,

67
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,349
where we're pressurizing
the other side and

68
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:30,739
putting them on the spot.

69
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,469
So we want to have a combination
of those two types

70
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:38,280
of questions and be conscious in
our own mind of the impact

71
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,990
of that type of question.

72
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:44,060
Let's draw down for a moment on
one particular nuance that

73
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,770
we want to be conscious
of here.

74
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:49,350
And that is the importance of
how we ask a why question.

75
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:52,229
And why questions are quite
specific ones we need to be a

76
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:53,549
little bit careful of.

77
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,060
When we think about a why
question, you can think about

78
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,810
two quite dramatically
different

79
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,699
ways of asking a question.

80
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:01,459
WHY won't you agree to that?

81
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,070
WHY didn't you do this?

82
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:04,739
WHY can't you do that?

83
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,850
Now, I sound like a police
officer here, like it's an

84
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:08,909
inquisition.

85
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:10,870
I don't want to be doing that
when I'm negotiating.

86
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,219
I don't want to be playing the
heavy or bullying someone.

87
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:17,100
What I want to be doing is I
want to be enticing them.

88
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,879
I want to try and get them to
be agreeable, to tell me why

89
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:22,219
it is they won't agree
to this point.

90
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,520
So I want to put a curious
tone into my voice.

91
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,969
Why CAN'T you do that?

92
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,060
Why WOULDN'T we be
able to do that?

93
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,649
What's the problem with
that problem?

94
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:32,969
Why CAN'T we do this?

95
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,500
Why is that solution not
workable for you?

96
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,925
I want to put a curious
tone in my voice.

97
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:41,920
That sends the message I'm
interested, I want to know why

98
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,020
it is that we can't
do this or why you

99
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:45,399
wanted a different way.

100
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:49,409
And then I can come up with an
alternative option, or I could

101
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,020
maybe even critique your
objection, and tell you that,

102
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:56,219
hey, that's not accurate, you've
misread the situation,

103
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,640
or that's not a legitimate
concern.

104
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,240
That's the thing we
want to remember.

105
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,019
We want to think very carefully
about our why

106
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:06,310
questions and the tone of
voice, how we ask them.

107
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,170
OK, let's talk about three
different types

108
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,129
of questions now.

109
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:13,629
I want to talk about-- some that
I think are useful, and

110
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:16,019
some that I think are
not so useful now.

111
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:18,889
So let's start with just
identifying the three that I'm

112
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:19,844
going to talk about.

113
00:05:19,845 --> 00:05:23,040
I'm going to talk about
hypothetical questions,

114
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,180
double-barreled questions,
and leading questions.

115
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,129
Let's start with hypothetical
questions.

116
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:31,360
Hypothetical questions can be
quite useful in negotiation.

117
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,670
It's what we're doing,
essentially, here, we're

118
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:38,069
saying, how would it
be if we were to?

119
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:40,779
What if we were able to
do such and such?

120
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:44,239
We're saying what the other
side's reaction is going to be

121
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,290
to the suggestion.

122
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:48,300
Hypothetical questions are
a good way of doing that.

123
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,470
Next question is a
double-barreled question.

124
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,930
And with a double-barreled
question, what we're doing

125
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,069
here is we are asking two
questions at once.

126
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:02,579
So can you tell me how much and
would it be possible for

127
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:04,689
us to reduce that price?

128
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:07,589
A double-barreled question is
where we ask two questions in

129
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:08,869
rapid succession.

130
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,730
And I generally think as a
general rule, we try to avoid

131
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,200
double-barreled questions,
because they

132
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,110
could be quite confusing.

133
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,270
And the third type of question
here I what I

134
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:20,109
call leading questions.

135
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,449
And leading questions are
very tempting to ask in

136
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:27,259
negotiation, because we try to
lead a person to particular

137
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:31,019
conclusion or to accept
a particular argument.

138
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:33,719
So you often hear people saying
things like don't you

139
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,720
think that?

140
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,040
Wouldn't it be a good
idea for us to?

141
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,950
What if we were to, don't
you think that

142
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:40,519
would be a good idea?

143
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:43,539
Here, we're really not asking
a question, we are making a

144
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,430
situation, and we're
disguising our

145
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,629
opinion as a question.

146
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:51,560
So we want to be careful about
leading questions, because

147
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,500
they tend to put people
on the defensive.

148
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,769
So what you have for too many
leading questions, you can use

149
00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:00,669
hypotheticals, but be careful
about asking too many

150
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,890
double-barreled question,
because we can confuse the

151
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,599
other side by using
double-barreled questions.

152
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,079
