00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,146


2
00:00:10,146 --> 00:00:13,400
In this module, we've looked
at conflict and conflict

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,969
resolution and I've given you an
introduction to some of the

4
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:19,779
theories of conflict and we've
looked at some ways that

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,880
conflict can be resolved.

6
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:25,224
To finish off the module, I want
to look at this concept

7
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:30,350
of resolution and I want to draw
some distinctions between

8
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,450
what we could say management,
settlement, and resolution.

9
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,060
I've drawn it up on
the board here.

10
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,960
So when we talk about conflict
resolution, we draw a

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,450
distinction between conflict
management.

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,090
And conflict management implies
that we're putting in

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,820
place sort of a management
strategy, that we haven't

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,420
actually got a plan in place
to resolve that, but we're

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,109
just putting ice on
the situation.

16
00:00:57,109 --> 00:00:59,960
It might be that the parties are
too busy to really look at

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,160
the problem in detail so they
put in place a conflict

18
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,420
management strategy.

19
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,810
But really, management is
working their way through

20
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,820
problems, we manage our
way through a problem.

21
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:15,609
If we're dealing with a dispute
like, for example,

22
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:19,150
I've done some damage to your
car, we have a little crash in

23
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,160
the car park, then you tell
me I owe you $400

24
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,549
to fixed the car.

25
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:27,899
I pay the $400 and we've
settled that dispute.

26
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,670
There's no ongoing conflict.

27
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,579
If I'm dealing with a conflict,
however, I need to

28
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:37,659
engage in a longer, more
lasting, more resilient

29
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:40,189
process of conflict
resolution.

30
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:44,170
And in this context, the word
resolution means that the

31
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,320
conflict has a final resolution,
that it's a

32
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:49,399
lasting resolution.

33
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,550
If I miss-match my
process with the

34
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:55,209
scenario I'm dealing with--

35
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:58,929
so if I say conflict settlement
and the chances are

36
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,630
I might be only dealing with
a superficial or short-term

37
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:06,509
process, just maybe a short-term
outbreak of the

38
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,629
underlying conflict, the chances
are that it's going to

39
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:14,060
resurface somewhere else or at
another time because I haven't

40
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,770
dealt with the underlying
conflict.

41
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,590
I've only settled one
of the outbreaks.

42
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,719
I'm hoping that's becoming clear
to you what I mean by

43
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:23,710
resolution.

44
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,170
Let me give you a simple
example in your life to

45
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:28,280
reflect on.

46
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,210
Try to think back to a time when
you had a conflict that

47
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:39,140
was really all-pervasive and
quite just damaging to you,

48
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:43,299
that overtook your life
for a period of time.

49
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,380
I'm sorry if that's painful for
you to go back and revisit

50
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:50,340
that conflict, but think about
it here so I can make a point.

51
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,430
What I want you think about is
how you would feel if the

52
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,670
person you were in conflict came
into the room right now

53
00:02:57,669 --> 00:03:00,469
and sat down next to you.

54
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:01,789
How would you feel?

55
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:05,139
Would you still feel the same
intensity of emotion you felt

56
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:07,449
when you were in conflict
with that person, might

57
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:08,709
have been years ago?

58
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,640
Would you feel at ease?

59
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:15,689
Would you feel fairly neutral
feelings where you almost feel

60
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:18,949
almost objective about what
happened back then doesn't

61
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:22,639
have the same intensity and same
waves of emotion that it

62
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,969
did many years ago
or months ago?

63
00:03:25,969 --> 00:03:29,460
What you'll be able to say, if
that's the case, is that the

64
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,849
conflict, at least for
you, is resolved.

65
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:34,229
You let it go.

66
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:37,500
And the conflict has faded
into the past.

67
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,340
If, however, the conflict flares
up and you feel this

68
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,650
intense emotion, the chances are
you never really came to a

69
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,640
resolution of that conflict.

70
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,449
And you'll probably be reliving
it and working it

71
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:51,780
through your system for
a few years yet.

72
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,449
Sometimes conflict resolution
takes place independent of

73
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:56,509
that other person.

74
00:03:56,509 --> 00:04:00,169
So, for example, somebody may
have died who you were in a

75
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:02,119
conflict with and you didn't
get a chance to

76
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,659
resolve that conflict.

77
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,099
You may need to go through kind
of a individual process

78
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:11,319
of coming to some closure or
some resolution yourself about

79
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,859
that situation because the
person is no longer here for

80
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,088
you to talk to.

81
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:19,939
So the key point to finish
the module off--

82
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:23,610
resolution is a lasting solution
to a conflict.

83
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,900
It's not a short-term
settlement.

84
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:27,909
