00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,002


2
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:14,080
Well, welcome to the final
topic, and this one is around

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,449
thinking about how we go
about developing our

4
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:20,189
communication skills.

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,609
Because I'm not sitting in the
same room as you, it's

6
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:24,809
difficult for me to watch
any communicating.

7
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:29,949
I'm hoping that you've been
going to the discussion boards

8
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:34,219
and sharing stories and
tips with one another.

9
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:35,960
It'd be great for me to be
able to come through the

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,380
screen and watch you doing
some role play,

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,120
but I can't do that.

12
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:41,299
So you're going to have to take
ownership for your own

13
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:42,679
development.

14
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:45,289
I want to give you a sense of
how you might go about doing

15
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:48,000
that in this last topic.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,740
First thing I'd like to suggest
to you is to try and

17
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,640
get a sense of a read of where
you are now in terms of your

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,730
communication and negotiation,
conflict resolution skills

19
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:00,029
more generally.

20
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,210
How do you feel you're doing?

21
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,250
Could you give yourself
a score out of 10 on

22
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,439
this sort of skill?

23
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,319
Have you had some feedback
from others?

24
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,769
Maybe that's why you're
doing this course.

25
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:15,060
But what you want to try and do
is identify the skill gap

26
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,180
that you're trying to fill, or
trying to bridge, by doing

27
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,470
this course.

28
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:25,569
So we want to identify when
we're doing any kind of skill,

29
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:31,489
where are we now in terms of
this skill, communication,

30
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:33,619
negotiation, conflict
resolution.

31
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,609
What evidence have you got
for where you are?

32
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:37,019
Is it good evidence?

33
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:41,530
Has there been multiple data
points that tell you that this

34
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,650
is where you're at?

35
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,150
Don't just use one or two
examples, use a couple of

36
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,650
examples to give you some
evidence of what you're doing

37
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,550
at the moment.

38
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:53,390
Try to think of what the pluses
are and also what the

39
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:57,219
minuses are, what strengths and
weaknesses of your current

40
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:58,679
style, current skill.

41
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:11,569


42
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:13,090
Then give yourself a goal.

43
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,370
Where do you want to be?

44
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,860
What are your future skills
going to look like as you

45
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,930
continue to develop?

46
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,969
Maybe you've got a mentor
or somebody who you

47
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:23,150
particularly admire.

48
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,840
Maybe it's somebody in your
community, or maybe it's

49
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,530
somebody you work with, who you
think is a particularly

50
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,150
exceptional negotiator
or communicator.

51
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:37,150
And maybe some of what they do
is where you'd like to be, so

52
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,830
you can set some goals by
thinking about them as a role

53
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,630
model or as a mentor for you.

54
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:47,879
And you can actually target what
that future is going to

55
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,449
look like, and then you can
start to break it down into

56
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:55,039
the sort of skills that you need
to acquire to become more

57
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:57,810
adept at this skill set.

58
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,150
So there is some strategies
that we can use

59
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,039
along the way, as well.

60
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:04,389
One of them I'd really like to
suggest to you, and I really

61
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:06,859
hope you take this idea on
board, is to develop what I

62
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:11,470
would call a learning journal,
or a notebook, where you make

63
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:16,759
some personal commentary, some
reflective notes, on how

64
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:19,759
you're doing in terms of
implementing the skills.

65
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,530
Is there a particular context
where you're more successful

66
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,449
than others?

67
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:26,780
Are there particular styles of
people who you find it easy to

68
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,669
negotiate with, and some who
you find it harder to

69
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:31,209
negotiate with?

70
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,710
Is there a particular practice
that you can put in place that

71
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,650
leads to you being
more successful?

72
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,710
So for example, does planning
make you most successful when

73
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,500
you're negotiating?

74
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,250
How are you seeing conflict
differently, having done

75
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,250
module three?

76
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,590
Are you seeing different
elements coming out in the way

77
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,960
you witness conflict, the
way you experience it?

78
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,909
These sorts of observations and
revelations will make you

79
00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:01,409
more of a student of your own
behavior, and this is the sort

80
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:04,780
of information we need to
gather if we're going to

81
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,860
expedite this journey to
where we want to be.

82
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:14,060
I'd also like to suggest to you
that you start to really

83
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:19,519
treat negotiation and conflict
resolution as a process that

84
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,920
you can master.

85
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:27,009
So this means treat it with some
seriousness, in terms of

86
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:31,379
the time you allocate it, try
to understand what you're

87
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:33,620
trying to achieve, set yourself
some goals in a

88
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,340
negotiation, don't set your
goals low, start to set higher

89
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:40,439
goals, more aspirational
goals, and remember,

90
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:43,219
negotiation is a
learned skill.

91
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,350
These are skills that
you can develop--

92
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,590
no gene for negotiation, it's
a skill that you should be

93
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:52,959
able to master with
some practice.

94
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,329
Well, that brings this topic to
an end, and also the module

95
00:04:57,329 --> 00:04:58,829
and the course.

96
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:01,589
I hope you've enjoyed doing
the course, I hope you've

97
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:05,389
found it a useful investment
of your time, not only in

98
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:08,300
terms of your working life, but
in your private life, as

99
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,790
well-- your relationships,
your friendships, family

100
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,250
relationships.

101
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:19,029
And I really trust that some
of this learning will be

102
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:22,569
learning that will stay with you
for quite some time, and

103
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:25,159
perhaps you might even like to
come and re-attend and watch

104
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,430
some of the lectures again.

105
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,259
So thank you for joining me,
and good luck negotiating.

106
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:33,993
