[MUSIC]

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,740
This topic, I'm going
to look at the issue

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,359
of probing for interests.

4
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,719
And it's really, in some
respects, an extension of the

5
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:23,910
previous topic around the issues
and agenda stage of a

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,440
negotiation.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,390
In this stage, what we're
looking for in understanding

8
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,259
the issues is not to simply
understand what positions

9
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:37,390
people are taking, but also
understand the interests that

10
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,990
underpin those issues.

11
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,020
Because what we're looking to
build towards is a proposal

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,710
that's going to match and make
reference to these interests

13
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,859
and needs people have.

14
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:52,269
So if we start out by stating
positions, then we're really

15
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:57,900
setting up an either/or
type proposition.

16
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,560
A very binary, I want
this, you want that.

17
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,439
And we want to try and stay
away from setting up that

18
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,640
binary, us/them.

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,170
We want to try and establish a
framework which is both/and.

20
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,450
And the both/and way of thinking
about it is more in

21
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,879
line with a scenario that we
can both have our interests

22
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,849
met by coming up with a creative
set of options.

23
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:30,909
So when we think about our
interests, what we try to

24
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:35,780
drill down to is all of the
broader set of concerns that

25
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,689
underpin and feed in to the
presenting problem that we're

26
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:41,009
dealing with.

27
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,040
And I'll give you some examples
by looking at Anne

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,800
and Joe in this topic.

29
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,369
So now our focus in this
particular topic is to looking

30
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,240
at, how do I uncover
these interests?

31
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,849
How do I get people sharing
their interests?

32
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:59,479
And how do we get this scenario,
this negotiation,

33
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,980
onto a more collaborative
footing?

34
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,859
So we try to establish this
collaborative environment when

35
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:09,080
we initially start talking
about the issues.

36
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,880
If we don't do that, we're going
to have problems getting

37
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,280
buy in to the proposal
that we make.

38
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,500
Because what we want to be
able to do is to tie our

39
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,080
proposal to the interests that
the party shares with us.

40
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,590
And equally, we want the option
that we're going to

41
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,750
come up to reflect
our interests.

42
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,009
So there's a whole process here
of the parties starting

43
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:37,329
to disclose where they're coming
from with one another.

44
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,080
And then that's a reciprocal
process.

45
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,800
I tell you a little bit about
what I'm looking for, and you

46
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,020
reciprocate and tell me what
you're looking for in the

47
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,010
negotiation as well.

48
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:52,179
So if we don't so establish
this reciprocity, this

49
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,870
swapping of information, then we
can't fully cater to all of

50
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,000
the needs and all of the
interests that feed into the

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,669
problem we're trying to solve.

52
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:07,039
Now sometimes we won't even know
our interests ourselves

53
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,549
until we really start exploring
the negotiation.

54
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,370
By talking about the issues,
we make these realizations.

55
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,569
Oh, OK, it's probably not
quite as important as I

56
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:17,709
thought it was.

57
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:22,200
The other side may come to some
new realizations about

58
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,780
the issues that are other
important to them.

59
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,449
And sometimes it's by saying
what you don't want in the

60
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:31,419
negotiations that you establish
what you do want.

61
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:37,109
So don't always feel that by
saying what you disagree with

62
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,950
is a bad thing.

63
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:40,669
Sometimes saying what people
disagree with gives you an

64
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:43,599
insight into what they
actually do want.

65
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,579
So with this process of sharing
interests and of

66
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,070
opening up is a really
fundamental part of this whole

67
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:53,959
area of establishing a
clear agenda of what

68
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,740
we're trying to solve.

69
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,469
So let's look at a way that we
control this distinction

70
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:01,039
between positions
and interests.

71
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,849
I'm going to give you an example
from our case study

72
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:04,710
about Anne and Joe.

73
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,730
You'll remember that they were
trying to solve this problem

74
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:10,840
about releasing the researchers
to do the support

75
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,439
work for the two consultants.

76
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:15,300
One stays mostly in Australia
doing his work.

77
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,750
The other one is traveling
around a lot and wants support

78
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,088
at short notice.

79
00:04:20,088 --> 00:04:23,529
So let's have a look at how they
might solve this problem.

80
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:27,924
At the moment we've got this
issue where Anne and Joe have

81
00:04:27,925 --> 00:04:29,569
both taken positions.

82
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,990
Joe wants to keep the
researchers doing work on his

83
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:36,389
projects, and Anne wants Joe
to release them so that she

84
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:39,060
can get some of her work
done at short notice.

85
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,220
So this is a position.

86
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,930
They both started with a
demand, essentially.

87
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:49,110
And what they want to try and do
is drill down beneath this

88
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,319
position into their interests.

89
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,029
And what are they both
looking for?

90
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:57,489
Why are they taking
these positions?

91
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,160
And obviously she's
got deadlines.

92
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,880


93
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:15,180
She wants to be able to meet
her need for flexibility,

94
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,180
which is really what
she sees these guys

95
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,990
supporting her doing.

96
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,550
Joe, he wants respect
from Anne.

97
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,920
He doesn't want her to come
barging in and demand these

98
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,770
people work off his projects.

99
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:35,789
He wants his projects to have
some prominence, or to be seen

100
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,040
as important.

101
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,629


102
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:44,110
And they need to drill down into
why they're looking for

103
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,000
these things, why they
want these problems.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,050
Why is Joe putting these people
on these long term

105
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,910
projects while Anne's away?

106
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,480
Well, it turns out that they
start slacking off when Anne's

107
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,390
not around, and Joe
gives them work.

108
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:00,969
Maybe that's the problem.

109
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,050
Why does Anne need this?

110
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,650
Maybe Anne is not realizing that
this work is coming up

111
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:07,719
until the last minute.

112
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,930
Maybe that's the nature
of her clients.

113
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,560
So they need to come up with
some way of coming up with an

114
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:23,829
option where their common
interests become clearer.

115
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:26,159
When they share those
common interests.

116
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,850
They've both taken positions.

117
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,310
They've both got underlying
interests.

118
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,280
And they've also got some
common interests.

119
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:35,799
They probably bought want this
function to work well.

120
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,360
They both need good support.

121
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,633
They both want mutual respect.

122
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,609
But they need to start
uncovering those common

123
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,770
interests in order to come up
with effective outcomes.

124
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:48,901
