[MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,307 --> 00:00:15,649
We need to have some way of
being able to understand and

3
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,690
analyze our conflict.

4
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,929
And in this topic, we're going
to look at this process of

5
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:22,870
conflict analysis.

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:27,219
And Tillot and French, in their
book Resolving Conflict:

7
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:30,879
A Piratical Approach, talk about
a model they call the

8
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,719
five p conflict analysis
model.

9
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,310
And this is a very simple,
quite effective way of

10
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,780
analyzing a conflict.

11
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,039
What is designed to do is to
allow you to break the

12
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:47,420
conflict down into its component
parts and start to

13
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,270
see the conflict more
objectively and see also way

14
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,750
you knowledge gaps are.

15
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,439
So I've drawn up this
little graph here.

16
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:59,960
Gives us a way of starting to
understand the different

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,320
elements in a conflict.

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,700
And what you'll see I've done
here, I've started by listing

19
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,840
the five Ps at the top.

20
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,740
We've got the parties, the
pressures, the projections, or

21
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:14,579
the fears, that is what are
the fears that the parties

22
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:18,349
have about what may happen
in this conflict?

23
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:21,750
The past, the relevant past
that each of them is

24
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,569
reflecting on this as they think
about this conflict.

25
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:28,019
And also the problems they each
stakeholder, or party of

26
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:30,859
the conflict, is trying
to solve.

27
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:37,159
So if we start to think about
this now, we can populate this

28
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,379
table with information about our
conflict, and I'm going to

29
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:44,969
do that about the conflict
about Gabe and Maria with

30
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:45,859
their neighbors.

31
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:48,870
So if we look at the conflict
that could happen to Gabe and

32
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,570
Maria in their neighborhood
when they're doing their

33
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:56,389
innovation, let's think about
a conflict they could ensue

34
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,879
and how they might have
all the parties to

35
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,089
be looking at it.

36
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,859
So we've a Gabe and Maria will
be one of our parties.

37
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:10,520
We might have their next door
neighbor, they're going to be

38
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,520
affected by the renovation.

39
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,770
We might have the builder.

40
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,860


41
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,330
We could start with
those three now.

42
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,090
So let's imagine there's been
a hiccup with the building

43
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,840
process and the next
door neighbor's

44
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,379
house has been damaged.

45
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:29,289
Perhaps a truck has run
into a wall and

46
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:30,909
knocked the wall over.

47
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:34,229
Not an uncommon occurrence for
the neighbors to be damaged

48
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:36,549
through the process
of the renovation.

49
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:41,070
So we've got Gabe and Maria,
the pressure they're under.

50
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:45,129
There's going to now be a delay
because the builder is

51
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:48,799
going to have to repair the
neighbor's fence rather than

52
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,780
carrying on with the work.

53
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,640
The projections they've got.

54
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,419
Their worried about a damaged

55
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:57,265
relationship with their neighbors.

56
00:02:57,265 --> 00:03:00,750


57
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,629
The past is maybe they had
conflict when they were

58
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:06,269
planning the project.

59
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,680
So there's been conflict with
their nighters already.

60
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,974
And problems I've got is related
to additional cost.

61
00:03:15,974 --> 00:03:22,299


62
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,320
So we can elaborate on that a
little bit but that gives you

63
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,180
a sense of the idea for now.

64
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,090
The next door neighbor, the
pressure they're under.

65
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,680
There's a psychological pressure
of the noise and the

66
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:41,730
inconvenience that they've
been under.

67
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:44,569
Here's projections, maybe they
worried about future damage.

68
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:49,180


69
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,490
The past, they've also
had this conflict

70
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,510
with Gabe and Maria.

71
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:58,259
And the problems they've got,
maybe it's caused some damage

72
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:03,310
to some of their property, Maybe
it's letting in some of

73
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,689
the weather.

74
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:06,939
Weather damage, let's say.

75
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:11,800


76
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,010
The builder , well, they've
got pressure to finish.

77
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:16,959
So time's issue for them.

78
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,670
They've also going to try and
finish on budget, so there's

79
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,490
money pressure.

80
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,564
Projections, they worried
about Gabe

81
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:26,814
and Maria not paying.

82
00:04:26,814 --> 00:04:31,829


83
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:35,169
The past, old builders are used
to this sort of thing.

84
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:40,030
So this is a fairly normal
occurrence for them.

85
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:43,500
And the problems, they've got
to now find time to fix it.

86
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,939


87
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:51,089
So all of these various
problems, and pressures, and

88
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:55,319
projections, and issues of the
past will flow into this

89
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:01,180
conflict episode in the life of
Gab and Maria's renovation.

90
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,879
It's going to be an unnecessary
hiccup, an

91
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:07,019
unnecessary conflict, that could
delay the project and

92
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:08,930
could damage their
relationship.

93
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,290
So we have to look at all the
pressures that these parties

94
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:15,129
are under in trying to analyze
the conflict before we look at

95
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:18,040
a way of trying to solve the
problem, and develop some

96
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,900
options for how to resolve it.

97
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:24,102
