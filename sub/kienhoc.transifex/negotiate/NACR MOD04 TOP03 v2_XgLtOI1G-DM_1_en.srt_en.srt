1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,076


2
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:11,040
OK.

3
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,359
Let's start looking now at some
of those communication skills.

4
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:18,119
I want to start with the
process of listening.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,580
In conflict resolution
and negotiation,

6
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:22,459
we want to be able
to try and really

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,539
focus on what the other
side is saying to us.

8
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:28,000
And sometimes that can
be quite difficult,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,579
because we might be
blocking out what they say,

10
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:32,839
and we might not want to
hear what they're saying.

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,430
We might completely
disagree with what

12
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:35,470
the other side is saying.

13
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,609
We might be angry
with them, and that

14
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:39,920
makes it hard to listen as well.

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,250
But I want to draw your
attention to the process

16
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,380
that hearing is a
biological process.

17
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,340
Whereas, what we
call active listening

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,290
requires us to really focus on
communicating to the other side

19
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,250
through some
significant behaviors,

20
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,840
that we will talk
about in a moment,

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,298
that we're connecting with what
they're saying, where we're

22
00:01:02,298 --> 00:01:05,710
very active in the way that
we're listening to them.

23
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:11,069
And active listening requires
us to, at some times,

24
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:13,439
turn the volume
down in our own head

25
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,530
so we can stop
talking to ourselves,

26
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,049
and start focusing in on
what the other side is trying

27
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:19,549
to say.

28
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:22,049
And that can be difficult.

29
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,769
Robert Bolton is a
famous author who

30
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:27,089
talked about the difference
between hearing and listening,

31
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,040
and he broke active listening
down into three skill sets.

32
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,470
He talked about these
clusters of skills

33
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:36,730
that we use when we're active
listening and first of these

34
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,549
is our following skills.

35
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:43,409
And our following
skills are ensuring

36
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,149
that we're following what
the other side is saying,

37
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,131
and we're communicating to
them that we're actually

38
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:49,879
listening to them.

39
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:54,219
And this is just a fundamental
part of communicating,

40
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:56,609
particularly if you're
talking over the phone.

41
00:01:56,609 --> 00:01:58,739
And the second cluster
of skills he talks about

42
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:01,839
are our reflecting skills.

43
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,439
Reflecting skills essentially
are our paraphrasing skills.

44
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:09,300
That is, how we go
about communicating

45
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,920
to the other side what it
is we've heard them say,

46
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,909
and what we've understood
was their message.

47
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:17,819
And the final cluster of
skills Bolton talked about

48
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:21,469
is the idea of our
summarizing skills.

49
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:25,810
And summarizing skills
require us to wrap-up

50
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,000
or do a sweep of what's been
said, sometimes in a group.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,460
And effectively capture all the
things that we've agreed to,

52
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,700
maybe some areas that
we haven't agreed to,

53
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:38,579
maybe capture in some
of the emotional tenor

54
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,810
of the room, what
people are feeling.

55
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,766
And our summarizing skills
allows us to sometimes move on

56
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:45,599
from a point, and move
on to the next point.

57
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,894
And sometimes, we need to
be quite firm in the way

58
00:02:47,895 --> 00:02:49,400
that we summarize.

59
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,360
So those three
clusters of skills

60
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,170
are quite useful for
us to think about,

61
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:56,769
in terms of sort of breaking
down into some micro-skills,

62
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,590
but their the three
main ones that we

63
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,080
use when we try to
listen actively.

64
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,020
OK, so using active listening
is obviously a really good way

65
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,480
for us to build rapport
and build empathy

66
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,989
with the other side.

67
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:13,580
And this can be important
in generating trust, which

68
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,980
tends to make people more likely
to disclose information to us.

69
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:21,129
And therefore, it's really
fundamental to building

70
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:23,870
a good relationship
with the other side,

71
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,789
building a trusting
relationship.

72
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,239
However, active
listening doesn't

73
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,670
mean we're simply agreeing with
everything the other side says.

74
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:35,859
We're not just simply
passively nodding and agreeing.

75
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,550
We need to be active
in our interaction.

76
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,000
And that can mean
sometimes we're

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,189
spotting inconsistencies,
or contradictions,

78
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,300
or we may actively disagree with
something that the other side

79
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,480
is saying that we may
want to come back to.

80
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,433
So active listening also
allows us to pick up

81
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:53,849
where there's contradictions
in the other side's argument.

82
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:58,109
Now, let's take the Gabe and
Maria example for a moment.

83
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,190
Always, on building
sites, there's

84
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:02,969
always these kinds of little
disputes about who said what,

85
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:05,250
and whether it had
been told, and why

86
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,819
wasn't that communicated.

87
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:08,959
Active listening is
really critical here.

88
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,810
And let's take, for example,
Maria and Gabe are talking

89
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,069
to their builder about
the tiling in the kitchen,

90
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:16,653
and they're not happy
with the quality

91
00:04:16,653 --> 00:04:18,189
or where the tiles have gone.

92
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:24,360
And Maria says to the builder,
well, hang on a minute, John.

93
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,555
You're saying that you never
received clear instructions

94
00:04:27,555 --> 00:04:29,759
from us on where the
tiling was to go,

95
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,240
but a moment ago,
you said to us that,

96
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,910
when we were talking
about the tiling.

97
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,920
Now, clearly, there's
a contradiction here.

98
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,887
We did tell you, like
I said, we did tell you

99
00:04:38,887 --> 00:04:40,470
where the tiling
went, and you've just

100
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,070
admitted it yourself.

101
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:44,069
So sometimes what
we're doing, we're

102
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:47,029
calling the other side
on their inconsistencies

103
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:48,199
in their argument.

104
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,909
And because we've
been good listeners,

105
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,910
and because we've been tracking
the way the communication has

106
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,510
been going, we've been
tracking the information,

107
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:58,279
we're able to recognize
those inconsistencies,

108
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:00,589
and we can win that
point in the argument.

109
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:03,169
So just let me
reiterate this point.

110
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:07,740
Active listening is not about
being agreeable and being nice.

111
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,730
It's about being very active in
the way that we listen, turning

112
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:15,410
our volume up on our listening,
and turning the volume down

113
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,180
on the voice in our head,
and really focusing in

114
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,199
on what the other
side is saying.

115
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,139
OK, so let's talk about this
three clusters, these clusters

116
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:28,939
of micro-skills that we can use
when we're actively listening.

117
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:31,379
The first one that
we want to identify

118
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:33,969
is this process of
effectively following

119
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,600
what the other side's saying.

120
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,990
And sometimes people talk in
quite disorganized or scattered

121
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,829
ways, and it can be quite
difficult to actually follow

122
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:45,560
the story, the message that
they're trying to get across.

123
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,730
And what we need
to do is to start

124
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,310
to use some following skills.

125
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,430
And following
skills consist of us

126
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,639
being able to track what
the other side is saying.

127
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,185
And this requires what Bolton
called minimal encouragers.

128
00:06:01,185 --> 00:06:04,980
And minimal encouragers are
things like uh-huh, yep, OK,

129
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,939
I can understand what you mean.

130
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:08,810
So we're essentially
doing is we're not

131
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,899
getting in the way
of the other side.

132
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:13,289
We're encouraging
them to keep talking.

133
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,180
Now, sometimes, of course,
we're going to want to cut in.

134
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,670
We're going to actually
want to have our say.

135
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,100
We might want to interject.

136
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,189
We may want to disagree
with the other side.

137
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:24,860
We might want to
interject a question

138
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,580
into that conversation.

139
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:30,319
But if we don't effectively
follow what's being said,

140
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,692
then the person
can just rattle on

141
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,650
and we won't actually be
following and breaking

142
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:36,679
in appropriately.

143
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,725
This is particularly
important on the phone.

144
00:06:38,725 --> 00:06:40,350
Some of you may have
had the experience

145
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,070
of talking to
someone on the phone,

146
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,689
and they're very passive or
very silent on the other side,

147
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:46,898
and you don't even know if
they're actually listening

148
00:06:46,898 --> 00:06:48,550
or if they're still there.

149
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,792
Quite an unnerving
experience, I think.

150
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,500
So what we want to be
thinking about here

151
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,050
is making sure that
we're following

152
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,360
precisely what the
other side's saying,

153
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,370
without getting in their way.

154
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,620
Because often what we will
do when people are starting

155
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,840
to open up, that's
helpful for us,

156
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,169
because it's giving
us information.

157
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:08,040
When we break, though,
we can break in and make

158
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,350
a brief comment, break
in and make a question,

159
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:14,689
or we also can break in
and start making our pitch,

160
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:16,469
or making our point.

161
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,570
So this first part of
what we're talking about,

162
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:22,528
these three skills, is
our following skills.

163
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:24,069
The second cluster
of skills are what

164
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,540
are called our
reflecting skills.

165
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,300
And when we talk
about reflecting,

166
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,240
what we're really talking about
is this skill of paraphrasing.

167
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,670
And paraphrasing is reflecting
back to the other side

168
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:38,850
what they've said to
us, but using our words

169
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,230
to reflect the message
that we've heard

170
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,020
and that we've understood.

171
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:44,959
So usually what we'll
do is we'll say,

172
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,265
so what you're saying
is, or OK, so let

173
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:49,890
me see if I've got
this right, and then

174
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:53,469
reflecting back to the other
side their message, as clearly

175
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,400
and as succinctly as you can.

176
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:58,459
You don't rabbit back to
them, or parrot back to them

177
00:07:58,459 --> 00:07:59,899
every word that they've said.

178
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:02,859
You try and capture the
essence of the message.

179
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,870
And that lets the
other side check

180
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,795
that what they meant to tell
you is what you've understood

181
00:08:07,795 --> 00:08:10,610
and what you've received,
that the message that was sent

182
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,379
was the message
that was decoded,

183
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:15,300
or received by the other side.

184
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,389
And paraphrasing is really
useful because we can not only

185
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:21,919
capture maybe a complex
message in a fairly

186
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,810
neat little brief
paraphrase, but we can also

187
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,170
give the other side a
sense that we've also

188
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,129
captured how they're
feeling about it.

189
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:32,710
So when we're
paraphrasing, we might say,

190
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,590
so you have this
problem with the tiling,

191
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,129
and you sound like you're
really angry about that.

192
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:40,928
And so we're sending the
message to the other side that,

193
00:08:40,928 --> 00:08:42,939
not only have we heard
them and understood them,

194
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,250
but we're also
emphasizing with them.

195
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,379
We can appreciate
how they're feeling.

196
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:49,054
So that's our
paraphrasing skills.

197
00:08:49,054 --> 00:08:50,929
And we'll talk a little
bit about re-framing,

198
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:54,719
because it's a paraphrasing
skill in a short while.

199
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,432
And the final set of skills
are our summarizing skills.

200
00:08:58,432 --> 00:08:59,889
And our summarizing
skills is where

201
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:02,600
we do a sweep of all
the message that's

202
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,690
been exchanged
between the parties.

203
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,880
And this is really useful, as
we talked about earlier on,

204
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:11,679
when we're trying to emphasize
the message that there's

205
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,189
actually a lot of agreement
among the parties.

206
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,250
And so, summarizing is really
useful to drive home the point

207
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,789
that, hey, we're nearly there.

208
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:21,250
We agree on most things, but
there's a few little points

209
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,159
that we want to
clarify or clean up.

210
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:27,409
I also think summarizing is
useful, because it gives people

211
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:29,659
a sense that, OK, I've
understood what you've said.

212
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:30,980
Let's move on.

213
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,289
So sometimes we need
to effectively use

214
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:37,089
this summarizing skill
to create a punctuation

215
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:41,509
mark in the communication
that we can move on from.

216
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:43,480
It's quite important,
the language

217
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,820
that we use when we
think about summarizing.

218
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,750
And I actually think
it's important to use

219
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,500
the word, you, here.

220
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,539
So you actually say
things like, all right,

221
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:54,659
so what you're saying
is that you disagree

222
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:56,439
with the quality
of this product,

223
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,860
and you'd like a refund.

224
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,909
Is that right?

225
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:01,919
Or, what you're telling me is--

226
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,871
And when we use the word, you,
you're ascribing ownership.

227
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,329
You're telling the
person, you have

228
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,780
to take ownership of
this point, because this

229
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,889
is what I'm hearing you say.

230
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:16,009
And it can be quite clear,
we're giving this ownership

231
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:18,179
of the point, or
of the argument,

232
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:19,669
to a particular person.

233
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:22,659
If they don't like what's being
said when we use the word, you,

234
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:25,189
they're likely to
clarify it, because we're

235
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,590
making them take
ownership at this point.

236
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,639
So there are those
three points again.

237
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:32,069
We've got to get our
following skills.

238
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:35,140
We've got to get our reflecting
skills, or our paraphrasing.

239
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:37,740
And we've also going to
get our summarizing skills.

240
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,320
And each of these
skills contributes

241
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,600
to an overall message that,
well, I'm engaged with you.

242
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,879
I'm listening actively.

243
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,389
I'm not just hearing you,
but I'm listening to you.

244
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:51,504
