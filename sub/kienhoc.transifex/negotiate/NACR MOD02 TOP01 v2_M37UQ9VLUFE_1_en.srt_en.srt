00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,378


2
00:00:09,378 --> 00:00:11,650
Welcome to module two.

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,160
In the last module, we
introduced the field of

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,800
negotiation and conflict
resolution, and I introduced

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,320
you to some subtle differences
in the language of

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,510
negotiation.

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,380
We talked a little bit about the
concept of strategy in the

8
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:27,210
negotiation process.

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,320
And I talked about some
different cognitive

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,369
heuristics, and some thinking
problems that cause us to make

11
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,549
faulty decisions when we're
trying to negotiate.

12
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:41,289
In this module, we're going
to look at the negotiation

13
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:45,070
process, which is, I suspect,
why some of you are doing this

14
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,829
course in the first place.

15
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,759
Broadly speaking, there are five
stages that a negotiation

16
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,909
will move through.

17
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:54,879
So we'll look in this topic
at the structure of a

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,050
negotiation.

19
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:59,979
And those five phases
are these.

20
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:01,839
We'll look, first
of all, at the

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,359
preparation/planning stage.

22
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:08,079
And it's really important to
plan your negotiation, plan

23
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,789
your strategy, think about how
you'll negotiate, and do some

24
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,609
research and analysis before
you sit down to negotiate.

25
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:16,429
And we'll cover that.

26
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,310
Then we're going to look at
the agenda setting stage.

27
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,240
So this is when the parties come
together, when they set

28
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,259
the scene, they talk about the
context for the negotiation,

29
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,640
and also the particular
issues that they're

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,450
going to talk about.

31
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,380
And sometimes they'll also try
to steer the negotiation away

32
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:34,549
from issues they don't
want to talk about.

33
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:40,409
We'll also, then, look at stage
three, which is the

34
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,119
proposal and counter-proposal
stage.

35
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,990
And this is where parties are
making proposals to one

36
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:49,299
another that formulate
an option.

37
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:53,509
And then they move into the
all-familiar bargaining phase.

38
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:57,590
And this is where parties swap
concessions, and sometimes

39
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,520
tactics emerge in this stage.

40
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,849
And we have to be thinking very
carefully about how we

41
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:05,079
make concessions and how
we trade concessions.

42
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:08,240
And I'm going to talk about
those skills and some

43
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,259
strategies to use there.

44
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,609
And then we talk about how we
move into the final stage,

45
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,430
which is finalizing agreement.

46
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,069
And this is putting it all into
practice, coming to the

47
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:22,239
final terms that we're going to
settle on, and moving the

48
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,235
negotiation towards
an implementation.

49
00:02:24,235 --> 00:02:27,740


50
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,480
So these five phases are quite
generic, in a sense, in a

51
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,299
negotiation.

52
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,000
Not all negotiations will move
this cleanly through these

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,090
five stages as this module, or
this topic, may make it seem.

54
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,319
Sometimes negotiations move
around, and they're a little

55
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,539
bit complex and unstructured.

56
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:54,259
But I want to just introduce
this as a framework for you to

57
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:58,310
guide your negotiation, and to
allow us to talk about some

58
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,360
different stages and some
micro-skills that we'll use

59
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,880
throughout any negotiation.

60
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:07,620
When we think about the first
stage of negotiation, we think

61
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,909
about what we do before
a negotiation begins.

62
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:14,889
I like to liken that process to
what I would call the "back

63
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:16,799
office" of negotiation--

64
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,020
all the preparation we do that
allows the front office to be

65
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,719
successful.

66
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,000
So the better prepared you are
before a negotiation begins,

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,419
the more flexible, the more
responsive you can be once all

68
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:29,099
the action starts.

69
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,799
So let's think about three main
things that we can do

70
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,270
before a negotiation begins.

71
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:41,620
And those three things are
research, planning, and some

72
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,800
emotional preparation.

73
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,730
So those three points are a good
way of summarizing all

74
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,259
the things that we can do in
what we call the "back office"

75
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:52,909
of a negotiation.

76
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:57,469
Your research will entail
analyzing the market, the

77
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:58,949
context that you're in--

78
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:03,789
trying to understand people's
predisposition to what you

79
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:04,819
might be arguing.

80
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:06,639
So for example, if you're buying
a house, you want to

81
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,539
know it's a buyer's market or a
seller's market, to know how

82
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:11,079
much competition you've got.

83
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,260
And also, what the buyer's
thinking--

84
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:17,420
whether they're desperate to
sell or whether there's plenty

85
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,140
of buyers lining up.

86
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,870
So we want to understand that
context, and we want to do a

87
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,870
little bit of research about
our own position.

88
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,560
Maybe there's an objective
standard that we can quote

89
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,199
when we're negotiating.

90
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,639
The second thing we want
to think about

91
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,899
is doing some planning.

92
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:34,319
So we're going to work out
what concessions we might

93
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,019
make, what concessions the other
side might be willing to

94
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:39,549
make, what they might be looking
for, what our common

95
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,879
ground and our common interests
are, and what

96
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,689
objections the other side might
have to our proposition

97
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:46,790
and what we might
be proposing.

98
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,280
And then the third point is we
want to get ourselves ready

99
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,269
emotionally.

100
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:53,409
Negotiations can be quite
fraught in terms of the

101
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,420
emotional intensity that we'll
experience when we're in front

102
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,610
of the other person.

103
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,350
And we want to think about what
those emotions might be,

104
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,530
and get ourselves ready to
negotiate emotionally.

105
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:06,909
And if there's one thing that we
can do to make the biggest

106
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,850
difference in terms of the
outcomes that we achieve when

107
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,100
we negotiate, it's
to plan more.

108
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,540
Most people don't spend enough
time in that back office.

109
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,430
They assume that every
negotiation's generic, or they

110
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,949
assume that they've got the
skills and they'll know what

111
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:23,180
to say on the day.

112
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,680
But I really advise you to spend
a little bit more time

113
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,480
before you actually
start negotiating.

114
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,840
Let's drill down into
these three elements

115
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,479
a little bit further.

116
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,790
Let's start with research.

117
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:38,300
So if we think about researching
the situation, the

118
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,030
market beforehand, what can we
do to do that effectively?

119
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:44,399
If you're buying a house,
obviously you want to scan the

120
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,199
market, the same type
of houses that

121
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,159
you're looking for.

122
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,200
If you're going for a new job,
you might want to look for

123
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,289
what the pay or the salary and
benefits might be for a

124
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,300
comparable position.

125
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,629
You could ring your friends up
and put the word out in your

126
00:05:57,629 --> 00:05:58,550
in network--

127
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,560
does anybody work in
this industry?

128
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,280
What would I expect
to be paid?

129
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,589
What could I ask for?

130
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:06,909
That way, we've got some
objective standard that we can

131
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:11,060
use to compare a negotiation
outcome against.

132
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,990
We want to have that
objectivity, that weight to

133
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,699
support our argument.

134
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,539
So research can also entail
researching the market--

135
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,819
or our counterparty, sorry,
who we're going to be

136
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:21,870
negotiating with.

137
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,220
How do they typically
negotiate?

138
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,160
What sort of clauses
do they put in?

139
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,260
What sort of arguments do
they typically make?

140
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:30,969
We can do a lot of research
before a negotiation begins so

141
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,140
that we're really
well informed.

142
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:34,110
And information is power.

143
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,569
The second thing we want to
do is to do some planning.

144
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:39,730
So let's take, for example,
our house purchase.

145
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,600
When we think about planning
our approach to a house

146
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,879
purchase, usually people
focus solely on price.

147
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,909
That's not the only thing
that we can negotiate.

148
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,290
Let's think about what else
we can negotiate.

149
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,040
Price is obviously going
to be up there.

150
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,220


151
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,070
But we also want to think
about settlement--

152
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:02,699


153
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:07,870
that is, how long will it take
before we pay the bulk of the

154
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,970
purchase price.

155
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,265
We might think about repairs--

156
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:13,044


157
00:07:13,045 --> 00:07:15,970
are we going to ask them to do
any repairs on the house

158
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,700
before we settle?

159
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,442
We might also ask about
inclusions--

160
00:07:19,442 --> 00:07:27,740


161
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,490
so what else do we get as part
of this purchase price?

162
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,550
Are we're going to be getting
the blinds, the plants?

163
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,180
We want to think about all the
things that we can negotiate,

164
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,500
not just price.

165
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,329
So when we're planning, we want
to think about, what do

166
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:43,009
we want from this negotiation?

167
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:45,019
What's reasonable to ask?

168
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:47,029
What might there be some
flexibility on?

169
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:50,759
It might be that the other side
wants to settle quickly

170
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,319
and we've got plenty of time.

171
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,319
Well, that gives us a
bargaining point.

172
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,540
So we need to do that planning
of our own position before we

173
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,810
sit down to negotiate.

174
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,350
And the final thing we want to
accomplish in the back office

175
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,610
is around our emotions.

176
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,580
What are we likely to feel when
we're sitting in front of

177
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:14,620
the person who we're going
to be negotiating with?

178
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,579
That idea of our emotional
readiness is a complex one.

179
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:24,310
But if we want to think about a
few simple tips, we want to

180
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,867
get ready to--

181
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:31,110
to be ready for the emotions
that we're likely to feel.

182
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,370
And so we can think about the
process of sensitization, or

183
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,960
desensitization.

184
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,288
That is, we can do a role play
where we might ask somebody to

185
00:08:40,288 --> 00:08:41,830
become angry with us.

186
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:45,210
Maybe we could get them to play
the role as realistically

187
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,980
as they could so we can actually
experience some of

188
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,259
the emotions that we're likely
to feel in the moment the next

189
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:54,879
time we we're talking
to this real person.

190
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,009
We can also think about how
we're going to cope with those

191
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:02,590
strong emotions that we're
going to be experiencing.

192
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,889
So what are some ways that we're
going to deal with that?

193
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:11,439
We might think about, what
is it that gets us most

194
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,780
comfortable with that?

195
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:16,289
To give you an example, let's
say it's Sunday afternoon and

196
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,490
you're enjoying a nice lunch
with your friends.

197
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,110
Then all of a sudden, you get
this horrible, knotting

198
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,550
feeling in your stomach.

199
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:26,429
You're anxious about something
out of the blue.

200
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:28,629
It's probably not indigestion
from your lunch.

201
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:31,289
Maybe it's anxiety about what's
happening the next day

202
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:33,159
for you at work.

203
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:35,409
Well, those emotions are
telling you something.

204
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:38,309
They're telling you that you're
either not ready enough

205
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:41,279
or that you feel strongly about
it, or obviously it's a

206
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,039
strong emotion coming up like
anxiety, fear, or anger about

207
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,169
the situation.

208
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:50,589
So I think it's a good idea to
take some time after your

209
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,720
lunch is finished.

210
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,800
Write down why you're
feeling that.

211
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:56,219
Write down maybe a little
bit more preparation.

212
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,129
And steel yourself
emotionally.

213
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:00,720
So become a little bit detached
from your emotions--

214
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,629
understand, why am I feeling
so strongly about this.

215
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:04,919
Am I under-prepared?

216
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,969
Do I need to do a bit
more preparation?

217
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:12,250
Do I need to get a bit more rest
or think about how I'm

218
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,419
going to approach
the negotiation?

219
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:16,599
So don't let that emotion
just simmer.

220
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,850
Do something about it.

221
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,224
