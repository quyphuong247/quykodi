00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,740


2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,210
In this topic,
we're going to start

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,980
looking at the idea of
shifting your perspective,

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,620
and this is really
implicit in the idea

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,769
of starting to think
more like a negotiator.

6
00:00:19,768 --> 00:00:21,184
So to shift your
thinking patterns

7
00:00:21,184 --> 00:00:25,000
so that they match the scenario,
the situation that you're in.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,379
And when we shift
our perspective, what

9
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:30,489
we're trying to
do is to overcome

10
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:35,759
a natural human
tendency towards myopia.

11
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,809
And when you're
myopic in your view,

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,410
you're seeing things purely
from your perspective,

13
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:45,349
and you're seeing it from a
very narrow point of view.

14
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,969
What we want to do is we
want to develop a stronger

15
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,219
sense of empathy with the
other side's perspective,

16
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:55,210
and start to see it from
their point of view.

17
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:00,689
And so this idea of shifting
perspective is quite important,

18
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:04,219
but sometimes it's the
last thing we want to do.

19
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:07,439
And I think there's a
tendency that people

20
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,489
feel as though, hey, if I look
at it from their point of view,

21
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:13,250
I'm going to somehow
weaken my own argument.

22
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,909
Or I'm going to
somehow be giving

23
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,879
in to the other
side's perspective.

24
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,269
That's not it at all.

25
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:21,989
Seeing things from the
other side's perspective

26
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:24,039
doesn't mean you're
agreeing with them.

27
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,130
It's seeing how they
view the world-- walking

28
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,670
a mile in the other man's
shoes, someone once said.

29
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,280
And that's the
concept that I think

30
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,280
you need to start to
grapple with if you're

31
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,950
going to be effective in
negotiating and resolving

32
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:37,859
conflict.

33
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:39,530
You need to start
to see the world

34
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,980
through your
counterparty's eyes.

35
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,570
So how would Ann
see the world if she

36
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:49,059
was starting to look at
it as though she was Joe?

37
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,609
She'd probably start to see
how her own behavior was

38
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:53,810
coming across.

39
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,769
She'd say, well, I probably
look like I'm butting in.

40
00:01:56,769 --> 00:01:59,079
I probably look like
I'm disorganized.

41
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:04,239
I may look like I'm riding
roughshod over Joe's needs.

42
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,219
If she starts to almost
describe her own behavior

43
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:10,340
from Joe's prospective,
then she can

44
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,250
start to see, well, how is she
contributing to this problem--

45
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:20,180
not to see Joe as the enemy,
and Joe as being all to blame.

46
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,319
She starts to acknowledge that
both parties are contributing

47
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,370
to this problem, not that
one party's to blame.

48
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,530
But there's a
contribution that both are

49
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,569
making to this problem.

50
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,879
So what we want
to start to do is

51
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,379
we want to start to use that
shifting of our perspective

52
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:42,769
to inform a deeper
understanding of the other side.

53
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,400
It could, for example, lead
us to ask better questions.

54
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,360
It could, for example, lead us
to propose solutions or options

55
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,769
to the other side that are going
to match their interests more

56
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:57,310
closely, because
we've really thought

57
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,819
about it from their perspective.

58
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,430
So here's a little exercise.

59
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,390
Think about a conflict you're
involved with at the moment.

60
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:08,069
And what I'd like you to do
is to describe or maybe even

61
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:09,609
write it down.

62
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,530
Write that conflict
down as if you

63
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,569
were the other person
looking at yourself.

64
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,000
How would they see the conflict?

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,620
Try to get out of your
own myopic point of view

66
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,680
and see how you're
contributing to that conflict.

67
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,590
Sometimes it's a very
powerful realization

68
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,080
that you'll make about
how you're contributing

69
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,330
to this conflict, and
that might give you

70
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,430
an idea of what the
pathway is for resolution.

71
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,050
So this topic's really
been about that idea

72
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,330
of shifting your
perspective, seeing

73
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,880
the world through others' eyes.

74
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:42,430
It's not always an easy
or a nice place to go,

75
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,099
and sometimes you won't feel
that comfortable doing it.

76
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,719
But it's actually
going to be giving you

77
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,599
a lot of really
useful information,

78
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,349
and maybe inform your
strategies and your questions

79
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:55,759
so that you have a more
likelihood of gaining

80
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,132
an agreement.

81
00:03:57,132 --> 00:03:57,632
