00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,416


2
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:12,120
In this topic,
we're going to look

3
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:15,660
at this challenge of
finding common ground.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,254
And I usually talk about
this area or this stage

5
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:22,989
of the negotiation as being
kind of almost like a launching

6
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:23,750
point.

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,079
If you can establish
enough common ground,

8
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:28,959
there's enough momentum
in the negotiation

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,000
to then propel you, if you
like, into the bargaining stage.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,130
And then it becomes
almost inevitable

11
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,660
that the parties will agree.

12
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:43,009
Unless some sort of a deal
breaking clause emerges,

13
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:46,479
there's enough of a sign
there and enough momentum

14
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,679
that the negotiation is going
to end up in an agreement.

15
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,759
And this stage of common
ground requires, sometimes,

16
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,149
a little bit of wordsmanship.

17
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:59,890
We've got to actually
manage how we describe

18
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,250
the common ground that
exists between the parties.

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,769
And it also requires a little
bit of creative thinking.

20
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:10,549
Sometimes, we get bogged
down in the detail

21
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:12,980
in the issues and
the agenda stage.

22
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,320
And we want to start
to move beyond that

23
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:19,259
and start to say, OK, given
what we've said to one another

24
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,829
and given what we've talked
about in the proposal,

25
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:22,950
on what do we both agree?

26
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,670
So if we go back to that
Indonesia example for a moment,

27
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,579
those parties may not agree on
what the business structure is

28
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:33,140
going to be for
internationalizing

29
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,239
their businesses.

30
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:38,209
But they do agree that there's
a synergy between these two

31
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:41,429
businesses-- that they can
complement one another.

32
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,720
And they do agree that
there's an opportunity

33
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,429
that they want to exploit.

34
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,810
So let's look at where the
other elements of common ground

35
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,930
might sit between
these two businesses.

36
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,580
They both agree that
time is of the essence.

37
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,349
Usually, it's going to be
important that you move quickly

38
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:04,030
on an opportunity that
presents itself in the market.

39
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,890
So they need to do it
in a timely fashion.

40
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,960
They both agree that there's
mutual respect required.

41
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,040
They both agree
that the deal has

42
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,789
to be fair-- that it's going
to be one that is mutually

43
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:21,679
beneficial from a
financial perspective.

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,840
So there's a lot that
they do agree on.

45
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,950
Just deciding what the business
structure's going to be

46
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,560
is not clear at this point.

47
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,640
And that's something that
they can sort out, possibly,

48
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,579
through some more detail
and more exploration.

49
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,480
But they do agree that
this is a good opportunity.

50
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,049
They do agree that it needs to
be done in a timely fashion.

51
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,219
They do agree that
they've got to do it

52
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:47,389
in a respectful way
of the two businesses.

53
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:50,169
And they do agree that
they need to make sure

54
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:51,739
that it's a fair agreement.

55
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,439
So there's a lot
of common ground

56
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:57,340
that exists amongst
these parties.

57
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,229
Next thing they want to
work out is are we're

58
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:01,119
going to move forward
together on this?

59
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,009
Or are we going to start
looking for other partners?

60
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:07,729
If they make a really
strong commitment-- yes,

61
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,459
we're going to
move forward here--

62
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,820
then it's now ready to move
into the bargaining phase.

63
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:16,280
Sometimes in negotiations,
we can end up

64
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,669
with these quite
broad agreements.

65
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:21,149
In the banking
sector, for example,

66
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,439
sometimes an initial
discussion will end up

67
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,620
in what's called a
heads of agreement.

68
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,240
And a heads of
agreement is an outline

69
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,990
of the broad issues
that are going

70
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,580
to end up in the
final agreement.

71
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,090
What the heads of
agreement gives

72
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,270
the parties is some surety
that they're both clear

73
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,010
on where they stand
on the key issues.

74
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:43,469
Sometimes, we get what's called
an agreement in principle.

75
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:46,759
And what this means
is we broadly agree,

76
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,060
yes, we want to move forward,
but we don't actually

77
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,610
have the details as yet.

78
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,760
We haven't sorted those
out or negotiated those.

79
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,449
All those kinds of
business-specific terms

80
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:00,000
refer to the same idea.

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,009
And that is we've
got common ground

82
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,489
and we're ready to move forward.

83
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,987
