00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,244


2
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:12,029
In this topic,
we're going to look

3
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:17,049
at the stage of the negotiation
where one party makes an offer

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,320
or makes a proposal about
how to solve a problem

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,079
or exploit the opportunity that
exists for the two parties,

6
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,599
and then what would happen
if the counter party makes

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,830
a counter offer or
counters that offer

8
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:35,809
with their version or their
solution to the problem.

9
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:40,329
And this is an important stage
in the process to get right

10
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:41,975
and to time well.

11
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:45,570
If we make a proposal
too soon or prematurely

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,670
in a negotiation,
the other party

13
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,469
may not be psychologically
ready for the proposal.

14
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:53,100
It may not look like we've
fleshed out and discussed

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,730
the issues enough.

16
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:58,269
And therefore, it'll feel as
though we've rushed into it,

17
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,020
or it might be misplaced.

18
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,190
So we want to try and think
very carefully about our timing

19
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:08,379
and how we handle the proposal,
counter proposal process.

20
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:12,089
Let's think about the
timing of this issue here.

21
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,120
So once we've talked
about the issues-- we've

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,540
talked about interests,
we've discussed the problems,

23
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:25,530
we've started to flesh out where
the common ground might be,

24
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,060
we've talked about
the background--

25
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,420
then at some point or
other, one or both parties

26
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,629
is going to have to put
their cards on the table

27
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:37,030
and say, OK, given what
we've talked about,

28
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,469
here's what I
think we should do.

29
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:41,769
They come up with
an initial option

30
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,909
or an initial suggestion.

31
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:48,679
And at that point of time, the
proposal may will be accepted,

32
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,460
and then we may move straight
into the bargaining stage.

33
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:54,839
Or it might be that the
proposal's rejected outright.

34
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,689
We have to go back
to the drawing board.

35
00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:00,989
Or the offer is
adjusted somewhat

36
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:03,189
in what we call a counter offer.

37
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:06,939
And that is the other
side comes back to you

38
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:08,758
with their alternative.

39
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,609
Timing's important here.

40
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,700
Some people are really
impatient style of people.

41
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:16,599
Anne might be an
example of this,

42
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:19,819
where she wants to come
straight to the point

43
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:22,400
and have Joe say, all right,
here's how we solve it.

44
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,650
Joe might be more reflective,
a more introverted style

45
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,039
of person, who wants to
talk about the issues ad

46
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,262
nauseum or long winded,
analytical sort of way.

47
00:02:34,262 --> 00:02:35,469
She might be saying, come on.

48
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:36,469
What are we going to do?

49
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:37,310
How do we solve it?

50
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,090
So we want to think about
matching our speed a little bit

51
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,920
to the other
person's preferences.

52
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,879
Don't just jump in
and make a proposal

53
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,680
because that's right for you.

54
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,650
You've got to think
about the timing.

55
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,670
So in this process of proposals
and counter proposals, offers,

56
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:59,899
counter offers, we
generally come up

57
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,890
with a solution that's going
to work for both parties.

58
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:05,029
There's a few things
to watch out for here.

59
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,080
If the other side has spent
a lot of time generating

60
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,400
a proposal and they've been
thoughtful about a solution

61
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,390
that they want to come up with
and we reject that proposal

62
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:18,109
outright, then we're going to
look as though we haven't given

63
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,320
their interests
much consideration

64
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,789
and we're not
really trying to be

65
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:25,039
collaborative in our approach.

66
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,231
So even though you may,
in the back of your mind,

67
00:03:27,231 --> 00:03:28,689
say to yourself,
there's no way I'm

68
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:31,139
going to accept
that proposal, you

69
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:34,631
can still hear out the
ideas that sit behind it.

70
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:36,090
And why have you
come up with that?

71
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,813
Give us your thinking behind
why you think that would work.

72
00:03:38,813 --> 00:03:40,229
At least, then,
you're giving them

73
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:43,539
a little bit of due
respect for having thought

74
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:47,979
about a way of
solving the problem.

75
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:51,009
Let's take an example
from business, now,

76
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:53,620
of a proposal and
a counter proposal.

77
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,200
Let's say two companies are
talking about how they're

78
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:59,589
going to exploit a
market opportunity,

79
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,493
let's say, in
Indonesia, for example.

80
00:04:01,493 --> 00:04:02,909
These two Australian
companies are

81
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,099
talking about this opportunity.

82
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:09,729
And one company comes
up with a suggestion,

83
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:12,909
which is to formulate an
international joint venture,

84
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:15,299
what's called an IJV.

85
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:21,990
They're going to establish a
third entity, a new business,

86
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:26,620
if you will, but they
both contribute resources,

87
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,209
intellectual capital,
money, people, too.

88
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:31,844
And that will
operate in Indonesia.

89
00:04:31,845 --> 00:04:34,580


90
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:36,729
One side thinks
that's a good idea,

91
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,290
and they're really
strongly advocating it.

92
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,590
So what they want to do when
they propose this idea is

93
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:47,750
say we think we should
develop an international joint

94
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,149
venture-- that we both enter
this market establishing

95
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:56,709
a third entity, a third business
that we can both support one

96
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:59,899
another through by
providing shared resources.

97
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,500
Given what you've told
us about your business,

98
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,360
we think this is the best
way of us going forward

99
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,230
with this opportunity.

100
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,280
Your market position, your
cash flow-- all other things

101
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:13,759
point to an IJV as being
the best way forward.

102
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,367
And it's good for us, as well.

103
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:17,450
So what they're doing with
that kind of language--

104
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:20,259
they're selling the
proposal as tying it

105
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:22,500
to the other party's interests.

106
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,660
Now, they may come up
with a counter offer.

107
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,189
They might say, thanks
for the suggestion.

108
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:31,189
There's some elements
of it we like.

109
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:35,829
But we prefer to keep
a controlling interest

110
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:38,240
in any international
ventures we do.

111
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,889
So what we'd like to
suggest as an alternative

112
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:44,354
is that we establish that as
a subsidiary of our business

113
00:05:44,355 --> 00:05:49,980
where we keep a 60% equity
position in the business

114
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,900
and you take a 40% stake.

115
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:55,419
So you're a major investor
in that opportunity,

116
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,720
but we're the
controlling entity.

117
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,940
From our point of
view, this suits

118
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:02,910
us better from a
financial perspective.

119
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:06,920
And it's our fundamental
internationalization strategy.

120
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,780
We don't think this is going
to be a disadvantage to you

121
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:11,389
because of your
financial position.

122
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:14,939
The way you've told us about
what your international plans

123
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:18,949
are-- the human capital that
you've got, your operating

124
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:22,089
budget-- this is going to
be a good option for you,

125
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:23,699
as well as for us.

126
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,849
So as you can see,
in this example,

127
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,970
you're getting two quite
different options emerging

128
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:34,294
that are both being tied
to each other's interests.

129
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,709
And that's what
we want to do when

130
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:38,519
we establish a good proposal.

131
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:41,076
