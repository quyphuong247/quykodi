00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,810


2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,750
In this topic,
we're going to look

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,550
at the theory of human needs.

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,679
And what we're going to
look at is the explanation

5
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,969
for human conflict is
that they arise because

6
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:25,559
of the frustration and
the denial of human needs

7
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,769
that are universal
to all human beings.

8
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,380
Many of us will be familiar
with the concept or the term

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,090
"human needs" by
some familiarity

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,440
with the theories
of Abraham Maslow.

11
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,670
Maslow talked about human
needs presenting in hierarchy.

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,300
At the bottom of the hierarchy
are our physiological needs,

13
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,449
then our safety needs, our
love and belongingness needs,

14
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:54,609
our esteem needs, and finally,
our self-actualization needs.

15
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:59,280
And his theory is essentially
that before the bottom layer is

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,170
satisfied, we can't
move up the hierarchy

17
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,719
to the next level of
needs, and, essentially,

18
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:12,500
that needs are satisfied
in this hierarchical order.

19
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,640
And we move towards the
concept of self-actualization

20
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,879
but actually being
who we can be,

21
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:20,949
feeling as though we're
using our natural talents.

22
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,170
Now, this theory has been
very influential in designing

23
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,350
workplace relations
policies, things

24
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:29,979
to do with motivation
in the workplace,

25
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,990
with careers, with
ways of paying people

26
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:37,439
and rewarding people,
and with job design.

27
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,989
But can a theory of
human needs also provide

28
00:01:40,989 --> 00:01:44,519
a good explanation for conflict?

29
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:46,979
And that's just what
one theory-- human

30
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,120
needs theory-- actually says.

31
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,960
It's that conflict
is largely caused

32
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:57,059
by the frustration
and the suppression

33
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,250
of basic human needs.

34
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,219
Maslow's theory
of human needs was

35
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:03,679
developed by another
scholar, Paul Sites,

36
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,950
who write a book, Control,
The Basis of Social Order,

37
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,629
in the early '70s.

38
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:13,069
And what Sites articulated
was human needs,

39
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:15,729
a set of universal
human needs-- and he

40
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:18,829
narrowed those down to
eight universal human needs.

41
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,490
And they're these-- consistency
in response, stimulation,

42
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,689
security, recognition,
distributive justice,

43
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:33,329
the appearance of rationality,
meaning, and control.

44
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,760
And you'll see some similarities
with Maslow's theory here.

45
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,389
This theory was picked up on
by an Australian researcher

46
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:43,569
and a former diplomat,
Professor John Burton.

47
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:46,659
And Burton articulate
a ninth need.

48
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:48,000
He called a role defense.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,259
And he argued that this was
the most prepotent or dominant

50
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:52,949
of human needs.

51
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:56,169
And the idea of role
defense is that once

52
00:02:56,169 --> 00:03:01,079
you've acquired your identity,
that human things will

53
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,300
be very firm and very
strong and very committed

54
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,770
to defending that role,
that sense of who they are.

55
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,950
And he very strongly
likened that

56
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:14,729
and equated that
with one's identity.

57
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:18,179
Because of the
emphasis on identity

58
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,879
as a source of conflict,
Burton's theory

59
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,079
is really well-exemplified
in the case

60
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,935
of deeply-rooted
identity-based conflicts.

61
00:03:28,935 --> 00:03:32,640
And we're talking here about
conflicts like conflicts

62
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,929
over sectarian violence, such
as we saw in Northern Ireland,

63
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,060
or conflicts such as
in the Middle East,

64
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:46,030
and conflicts around
self-determination conflicts

65
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,060
within countries that have
multiple ethnic groups,

66
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,689
such as Indonesia, for example.

67
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:58,270
And those types of conflicts
have a very interesting

68
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:58,960
analysis.

69
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,385
They lend themselves
particularly well to this idea

70
00:04:01,384 --> 00:04:03,919
that identity is the
root cause of conflict,

71
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,979
and expression for identity,
and that that driving need

72
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:11,079
to express one's
identity will not

73
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,420
be responsive to a power-
or a control-based approach

74
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:17,399
to resolving the conflict.

75
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,045
So what Burton emphasized
is the idea that

76
00:04:20,045 --> 00:04:22,199
to resolve these
types of conflicts,

77
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,649
you need analytical approach,
where the parties come together

78
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:31,269
in a confidential,
non-binding environment where

79
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:33,789
they can analyze the
conflict and come up

80
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,100
with possible pathways
for its resolution,

81
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,890
where that identity can be
expressed in a way which

82
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:44,149
doesn't conflict with the
needs of the conflicting group.

83
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:49,500
A good example of this would
be semi-autonomous regions

84
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,279
in the political realm, where
the ethnic group can still

85
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:57,609
speak its own language,
it can fly its own flag,

86
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,449
it can retain its
cultural traditions

87
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:04,779
without necessarily
having statehood.

88
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:09,869
And that's quite a common model
now in the political world.

89
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,240
Burton's theory
gives us a pathway

90
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,040
for how we can approach
deeply-rooted conflict-- that

91
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,230
is, using this
analytical approach.

92
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,370
It's a complex
theory, and it has

93
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,319
been widely influential in
shaping conflict resolution

94
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:27,439
practice-- in particular,
the idea of bringing parties

95
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:33,389
together in a non-binding,
analytical space, a workshop,

96
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:37,069
if you will, to
explore the conflict.

97
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:38,269
It' a complex theory.

98
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:41,199
And it's a complex set of
practical implications.

99
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,750
But there is one
element that we can

100
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,050
explain which is quite clear.

101
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,855
And that's the concept
that what Burton says

102
00:05:47,855 --> 00:05:51,540
is that at the bottom of this
hierarchy, we have our needs.

103
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,080
And these needs are universal.

104
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,000
And they won't
change and they're

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,459
universal across ethnic groups
and across identity groups,

106
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:04,529
across ages-- essentially,
universal across human beings.

107
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:08,149
Then the next dimension
where conflict occurs

108
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:09,929
is around values.

109
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,959
And our values are fairly fixed.

110
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:16,810
They may change over time.

111
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,370
You can think, for example,
about your political beliefs

112
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,590
sometimes will shift and change.

113
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:25,429
Sometimes, people lose
their religious belief

114
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,930
or change their
religious belief.

115
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,069
And these are our values.

116
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:32,670
And then the final area he
identifies is interests.

117
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,870
And our interests
are more transient.

118
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,930
And these can be negotiated,
whereas our needs will not

119
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,910
be negotiable.

120
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,510
We will have a
commitment and a drive

121
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:47,560
toward meeting those needs.

122
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,079
Interests, however,
can be negotiated.

123
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:54,312
