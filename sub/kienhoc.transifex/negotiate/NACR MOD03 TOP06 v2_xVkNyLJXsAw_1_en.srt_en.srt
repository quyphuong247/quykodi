00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,789


2
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:13,149
In this topic, we're going to be
looking at how to cope with

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,170
strong emotions and how to
deal with the process of

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,790
stereotyping.

5
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,449
When people are in conflict,
they often feel very strong

6
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,530
negative emotions--

7
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:32,250
emotions like anger, fear,
disgust, surprise, anxiety.

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,079
These kinds of emotions are very
unpleasant, and people

9
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:39,000
want to avoid those emotions
either by suppressing them or

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,615
by channeling them externally
in an attack.

11
00:00:43,615 --> 00:00:47,850
And it's interesting that
sometimes people almost seem

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,990
as though they're addicted
to conflict.

13
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,590
And there's a good explanation
for this.

14
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,250
When we're in conflict, when
we're expressing strong

15
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,850
emotions, we're very
stimulated.

16
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,100
We're engaged.

17
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,500


18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,670
We get a rush of adrenalin
through our system.

19
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,439
So people at a sporting event
cheering for their favorite

20
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,789
sporting team often get this
heightened sense--

21
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,830
this heightened feeling, almost
like a natural high,

22
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:16,420
that you get.

23
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,719
And that can explain why people
often burst into anger

24
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,120
quite quickly, because they're
almost addicted to the feeling

25
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,685
that they get when
they're angry.

26
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,350
In this topic, I also want
to look at the process of

27
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:29,919
stereotyping.

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,689
And this is an important thing
to consider when you're in

29
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:34,679
conflict, particularly
prolonged conflict.

30
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,170
Let's say you had a neighbor who
had a barking dog that was

31
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,969
driving you crazy.

32
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:44,429
After a while, that person who
had those dogs might begin to

33
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,050
embody everything
that you hate.

34
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:49,379
And you begin to what's called
"enmify" that person.

35
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:51,519
They become the enemy.

36
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,939
Everything they do is associated
with that feeling

37
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,819
of anger, and that that
person is the enemy.

38
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:01,659
How do we cope with that process
of stereotyping and

39
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:02,829
creating the enemy?

40
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:05,439
We're going to look at some
ways that we can cope with

41
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,840
these strong emotions in this
process of stereotyping.

42
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,509
These strong emotions that we
feel when we're faced with

43
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:15,959
conflict stem from the amygdala,
or the brain stem,

44
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,090
sometimes called the "reptile
brain." And this is the old

45
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,280
part of the human brain where
our instincts come from, or

46
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,270
are stored.

47
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,930
So when we're faced with danger,
the amygdala sends a

48
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,340
signal to our central nervous
system readying us for action.

49
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,680
Our pupils become dilated.

50
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,905
We get a surge of adrenaline.

51
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,449
Our blood starts pumping.

52
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,389
Sometimes people flush on their
face, and you can see

53
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:41,639
them blushing.

54
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:45,539
And what's happening here is
the body is instinctively

55
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:47,359
readying itself for action.

56
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,620
And this has been called the
"fight/flight response." And

57
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,170
the fight/flight response is a
very instinctive response we

58
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:56,569
have to danger.

59
00:02:56,569 --> 00:02:58,340
When you're faced with
conflict-- let's say somebody

60
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,819
attacks you in a meeting, and
you feel very threatened by

61
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:05,069
that attack, you may have the
strong impulse to want to get

62
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:07,569
up and leave the meeting, or
you may want to attack the

63
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:10,289
person verbally in
that meeting.

64
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:12,500
That's basically your instincts,
the fight/flight

65
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,310
response, in action.

66
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,629
And what we need to be able to
do is to move beyond our

67
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:22,819
instincts and use a rational,
higher, newer part of our

68
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:26,229
brain to rationalize and make
sense of what's going on

69
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:28,699
rather than to instinctively
react.

70
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:33,449
One of the concerns that happens
when we have this

71
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:37,280
development of very strong
emotions is that we want to

72
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,680
fall back on simple explanations
for things.

73
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,560
We like to simplify our world.

74
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,379
Levi Strauss referred
to this-- the French

75
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:47,509
anthropologist--

76
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:50,659
as the "binary instinct"
that humans have.

77
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:57,359
We want to separate out world
into good/bad, evil/kind,

78
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,890
us/them, ingroup/outgroup.

79
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:02,789
We want to separate and organize
our world this way.

80
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:06,209
And because of this, people
do tend to stereotype,

81
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,330
particularly when they're in
strong conflict situations,

82
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,310
often around ethnic group,
religion, or national

83
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,520
background.

84
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,139
And stereotyping really tends
to entrench conflict

85
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:26,729
situations, and tends to mean
that we have limited options

86
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,590
in terms of what the resolution
will be, because

87
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:32,589
the conflict will always be
because of the traits of a

88
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:33,889
particular group.

89
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:38,789
And you see this problem of
stereotyping manifest in

90
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,970
warfare, which is an extreme
example of conflict.

91
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,025
And if you take the history of
propaganda, and the images

92
00:04:46,024 --> 00:04:49,014
that are used by governments
when they're going to war, or

93
00:04:49,014 --> 00:04:51,719
when they're in a war of the
enemy, they often have

94
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,170
exaggerated features of
the enemy soldiers.

95
00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:02,000
They depict them as rats
hoarding over the populace--

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,069
these demonic images of the
soldiers raping and pillaging

97
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:09,319
the population.

98
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:12,750
And this is designed to
galvanize the population for

99
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,389
war, to ready young soldiers for
the process of having to

100
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:19,819
go to war and having to kill.

101
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,509
And you see it also with
demeaning nicknames of the

102
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:27,019
enemy that people develop, and
soldiers develop, so they can

103
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:30,979
see that enemy as not human,
or as "the other."

104
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:37,689
So how do you develop a way
of moving past this almost

105
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:41,790
automatic process of starting
to "enmify," and create the

106
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,939
enemy, create the other?

107
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:46,259
You need to have some strategies
to move past that,

108
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,670
because obviously, it's going
to be very difficult for you

109
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,930
to try and resolve a conflict
with someone who you see as

110
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,269
your enemy.

111
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,599
So how can we cope with these
really strong emotions?

112
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,530
Well, Dozier wrote a book called
Why We Hate a few years

113
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:06,489
ago, which talks about this
phenomena of hatred, and how

114
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,269
we cope with these strong
negative emotions, and how it

115
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,799
creates conflict in societies
and between countries.

116
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,199
And he talks about 10 different
strategies for how

117
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,329
to cope with these
strong emotions.

118
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:22,726
And I'll leave some of that in
the additional resources for

119
00:06:22,726 --> 00:06:23,949
you to go and have a look at.

120
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:27,129
But just for now, let's just
look at a few of these.

121
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:30,290
He talks about the importance
of being specific--

122
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,100
focusing in on specific
behaviors that are causing

123
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,590
these strong emotions.

124
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:41,289
Being specific of the cause of
the complaint that you have.

125
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:45,960
Otherwise, you will tend to
overemphasize and simplify

126
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,229
where it's everything
about the person,

127
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,790
everything that they do.

128
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:54,069
And that's simply quite
unlikely to be true.

129
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:58,290
The next is to develop what he
calls an us/us orientation--

130
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:03,069
to try to see yourselves
as both in the problem.

131
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:06,550
So to try and develop a degree
of empathy, or to see the

132
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,009
problem from the other side's
perspective, and work out that

133
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:12,719
you're both trying to deal with,
essentially, a shared

134
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,840
problem, and that they probably
see you somewhat

135
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:18,589
negatively as well.

136
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:21,299
Next point is to look for
opportunities to negotiate

137
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,639
constructively.

138
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,509
It might be that there are
some elements within the

139
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:29,009
relationship that you can
seek to negotiate.

140
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:31,990
And that this builds momentum
in your relationship, and

141
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:37,129
allows you to see the other
party as having some aptitude

142
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:39,870
or willingness to negotiate
with you.

143
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,629
Next is to educate yourself.

144
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:44,120
Educate yourself about
the group who

145
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,509
you're in conflict with.

146
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:48,839
Perhaps understand a little
bit more about the culture

147
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:51,560
that you're dealing with, or
the frame of reference--

148
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,209
how that other person
sees the world.

149
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:57,239
And next is to put things
into perspective.

150
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,800
Often, we allow this
myopic view.

151
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,290
We allow issues to promulgate,
and we tend to catastrophize

152
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,580
the world when we're in this
situation, and we need to put

153
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:10,089
our conflict into perspective.

154
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,039
So there are some strategies
that we can deal with to cope

155
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,400
with these really strong
emotions and this stereotyping

156
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,729
impulse that comes from this
binary impulse that human

157
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,840
things have to want to
simplify the world.

158
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,030
