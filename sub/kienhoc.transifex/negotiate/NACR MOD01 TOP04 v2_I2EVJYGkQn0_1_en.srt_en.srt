1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,599


2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,009
OK, let's talk a little bit now
about the idea of being

3
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:15,490
strategic in a negotiation.

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,740
And people often say, you need
to be more strategic.

5
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:21,059
What do they mean when
they say that?

6
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:24,649
Essentially, being strategic
in a negotiation means that

7
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:30,919
you are developing a plan of
attack of how you plan on

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,429
interacting with the
counter-party, and how you

9
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:37,250
plan on moving your interests
forward, and advancing your

10
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,289
interests in the negotiation.

11
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:45,329
And a strategy is a
predetermined approach, and

12
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:48,799
usually involves having
some contingencies--

13
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,561
that is, think about
the word "if"--

14
00:00:50,561 --> 00:00:55,159
if the other side does x,
we will respond with y.

15
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:58,539
If the other side does
a, we need to do b.

16
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:02,399
So it's actually pre-planning in
advance what your argument

17
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,310
would be, or what your
next stage of your

18
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,129
strategy will be.

19
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,500
So it's reliant--

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,129
it's taking consideration--

21
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:11,879
of what the other side
plans on doing.

22
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:15,739
When we talk about strategies in
negotiation, a good way of

23
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:19,530
thinking about that is to
employ what's called a

24
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,519
conflict styles matrix, or
conflict styles framework.

25
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,439
Let me take you through that.

26
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:30,939
This idea builds on the premise
that we've got two

27
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:36,310
motivations, or we've got a
mixed-motive scenario in

28
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,560
negotiation and conflict.

29
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,420
And one of our motives
is to advance our

30
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,570
own interests here.

31
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:52,209
And this is our level of
assertiveness, or our

32
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:53,459
asserting behavior.

33
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:56,829


34
00:01:56,829 --> 00:01:59,480
And if that's high, then
we're up here.

35
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:06,640
We've also got a competing set
of pressures, and that is our

36
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,890
cooperating.

37
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,259


38
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:15,959
We can also think about this
as this is the outcome and

39
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,689
this is the relationship.

40
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:19,979
So we've got these
two pressures.

41
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:21,909
On the one hand, we've
got the pressure to

42
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,650
assert our own interests.

43
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,960
And on the other hand, we've
got a pressure to be

44
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,050
cooperative.

45
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:32,010
And if we combine these two
pressures, it gives us five

46
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:34,840
different ways of handling
a situation.

47
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,319
If we're high on asserting and
low in cooperating, we're said

48
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,030
to be using a competing
approach.

49
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,129


50
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:46,180
We're competing with the other
side-- that is, we're

51
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,460
predominately thinking about our
assertiveness, and we're

52
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,849
low on cooperating.

53
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:53,389
So a distributive
negotiation's a

54
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:54,849
good example of this.

55
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:58,960
If we're high on cooperating
and low on asserting, then

56
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,525
we're using what's called
a yielding approach.

57
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:05,370


58
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,009
We're yielding to the other
side's interests.

59
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:14,019
We're largely cooperating with
them, and we're not asserting

60
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,000
our own interests.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,400
If we're low on both-- if we're
low on cooperating and

62
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,500
we're low on asserting--

63
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,750
then we're essentially
avoiding.

64
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,610


65
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,390
We're avoiding interaction.

66
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:31,779
And some people have a very
strong avoiding style.

67
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,439
If we're high on asserting and
high on cooperating, we're

68
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,449
using what's called a
collaborating approach--

69
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:44,019


70
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,580
that is, we're in
a cooperative,

71
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,610
collaborative agreement.

72
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,880
We're high on asserting our own
interests, but we're also

73
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,359
concerned with an ongoing
relationship.

74
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,920
So we're high on both.

75
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:57,259
We're using a collaborating
style.

76
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:59,769
And somewhere in the
middle, we're using

77
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,520
a compromise approach.

78
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,580


79
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,390
And compromising is where we
sort of split the difference.

80
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:13,179
We come up with an agreement
that doesn't really work for

81
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:13,590
either of us.

82
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,140
It's a compromise.

83
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:18,990
And so it's often an expedient
type of agreement, because we

84
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,745
don't have a lot of time or it's
a short-term issue, or

85
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:23,129
it's not a major issue.

86
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,819
So we can talk about strategy
being one of these five

87
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:27,930
approaches.

88
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,269
And we can actually use a
competing strategy, a

89
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:34,490
collaborating strategy,
a yielding strategy, a

90
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,050
compromising strategy, and
an avoiding strategy.

91
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,740
And that's a really good way
of starting to talk in a

92
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,470
framework of, what are the
strategies that we've got

93
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,250
available to us?

94
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,160
OK, so if we're going to be
strategic in a negotiation, it

95
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,110
means we have to be flexible.

96
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,240
And one of the key things to
keep in mind is that you want

97
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,720
to be using the right strategy
to match the right situation.

98
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,980
So if you're dealing with a very
powerful adversary and

99
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,290
you've got a very important
relationship, then it might be

100
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,390
incumbent, or wise of you, to
use a yielding strategy for

101
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:15,979
that particular negotiation.

102
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:21,500
In contrast, if it's a very
highly important issue but a

103
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,310
low-important relationship, it
might be appropriate to use a

104
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,389
competing style.

105
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:31,740
So we need to think about this
idea of being strategic is

106
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,189
matching the approach
to the scenario.

107
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:38,569
Let's think about what happens
when we overuse or under-use a

108
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:40,689
particular style.

109
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:44,139
Let's take, for example, if
we're overusing a competing

110
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:47,919
strategy or style of
negotiation, then we're going

111
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,780
to be the sort of person that
sees conflict everywhere--

112
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:53,899
that everything feels like
it's a slight, that we're

113
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:55,419
always out to win.

114
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,900
You've probably worked with
a person, or know

115
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,699
people, like that.

116
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,129
Everything is a battle.

117
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:02,889
Everything is a fight.

118
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:05,759
Those kinds of people find
themselves getting caught up

119
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,779
in conflict a lot of the time.

120
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:12,109
And in small issues that get
blown out of all proportion,

121
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,350
and everything feels
very competitive.

122
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:18,040
And they often have a lot of
conflict in their life.

123
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,819
And they're often people who
sometimes people end up

124
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:28,000
avoiding, because they always
feel like they're out to win.

125
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,100
I'd like to contrast that with
people who have an avoidance

126
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,100
style, or who are very avoiding
when it comes to

127
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,070
conflict and negotiation.

128
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:44,120
And these people who overuse
avoiding often go through life

129
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,889
avoiding confrontation.

130
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:48,449
And it might mean, for example,
they see a person

131
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,180
they're in conflict with and
they walk the other way.

132
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,310
They see them coming in the
door and they walk out the

133
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,980
other door.

134
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,850
They prefer to avoid situations

135
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,390
where there's conflict.

136
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:01,789
Those kinds of people who get
stuck in that habit of

137
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,780
conflict avoidance often feel
as though they have low

138
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:06,609
self-efficacy.

139
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,199
They can't achieve things.

140
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,360
They can't get things done.

141
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,670
A strong sense of frustration
builds because they feel as

142
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:18,090
though they have to avoid a
conflict or a confrontation.

143
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:20,389
We go back to the Anne
and Joe example here.

144
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:24,969
This would be Anne, if she had
that style, avoiding Joe,

145
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:28,150
boiling inside, but never being
able to express the

146
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:30,769
frustration and work through
the problem.

147
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:32,979
So when we want to be strategic,
we want to have a

148
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,950
range of different styles
that we use.

149
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:37,870
We don't want to get stuck using
one style or another.

150
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,980
Indeed, we probably wouldn't
want to always use a

151
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,140
collaborating style.

152
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:44,339
Sometimes we just need to
make a decision, and not

153
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,119
collaborate with others.

154
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,759
So the key point here in being
strategic is, think about what

155
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,439
the outcome is you're trying to
achieve, match the strategy

156
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,040
and the style that you're going
to use to that outcome,

157
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,620
and try to develop a broad
repertoire of styles.

158
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:04,110
