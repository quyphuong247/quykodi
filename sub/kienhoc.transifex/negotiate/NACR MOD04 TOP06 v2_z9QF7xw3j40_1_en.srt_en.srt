00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,935


2
00:00:09,935 --> 00:00:11,969
In this topic, we're going
to look at the

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,970
skill we call reframing.

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,010
Reframing is something we've
touched on in the first module

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,130
of the course.

6
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:22,219
Now I'm going to look at the
concept of reframing as a

7
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:25,129
communication skill, and really
it's an extension

8
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:27,460
paraphrasing.

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,420
Let's talk about two ways that
we can use reframing.

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,810
Reframing--

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,420
to define it, first of all--

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,130
is the idea of taking a message
that the person is

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:42,260
saying to you and altering that
message slightly, usually

14
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:45,789
softening the message, and
reflecting it back to the

15
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:50,609
person in a newer, softer, or
in an altered way of some

16
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:51,250
description.

17
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,039
So let's talk about how
we might do that and

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,609
why we might do that.

19
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:58,310
There's two applications for
the skill of reframing.

20
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:01,690
The first is around influence
and persuasion.

21
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:04,429
Now let's take, for example, if
a person says it absolutely

22
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,780
has to be perfect, we might
put flip that back to them

23
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,609
when we paraphrase, it's really
important that we get

24
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:12,459
this right.

25
00:01:12,459 --> 00:01:15,409
Perfect and getting it right
are two slightly different

26
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,329
things, right?

27
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:19,959
So what we're looking for here
is sometimes a little bit of

28
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:21,500
wriggle room.

29
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,140
So a person might say, we
really, really need to get

30
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,280
this done today.

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,420
You might say, look, I think
it's important that we get it

32
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,579
done right, rather than
getting it done today.

33
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:36,039
So the key thing here is taking
what is usually a more

34
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,390
extreme position and softening
it somewhat with your

35
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,820
paraphrase.

36
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:43,729
Essentially what we're doing
here is we're often gaining a

37
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,450
little bit of flexibility
and wriggle room.

38
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,730
You might even use reframing
when you're coaching someone.

39
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:53,740
So a person might say, for
example, I can't do this.

40
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,839
And you could reframe and
say, what can you do?

41
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,740
What we're doing here is we're
giving the person an

42
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:02,619
alternative way of looking
at something.

43
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,010
You might have heard the person
say, let's not look at

44
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,469
this as a problem, let's look
at it as an opportunity.

45
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:09,939
That's reframing, and we
use it a lot when we're

46
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:14,219
negotiating, we also use a lot
in conflict resolution.

47
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:17,669
Let's talk about the conflict
resolution application now.

48
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:20,280
A good way that we can use
reframing in conflict

49
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,340
resolution is when we're
paraphrasing.

50
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,189
Now I particularly train my
ear to listen for what is

51
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:28,289
toxic language.

52
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:31,039
Let me give you an example of
what is a toxic language--

53
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:36,030
toxic words tend to make the
atmosphere feel strained.

54
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,219
They're extreme emotions,
sometimes they're criticisms

55
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:42,080
of the other side, or attacks
of the other side, and that

56
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,960
toxicity in the language and
in the atmosphere makes it

57
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,320
very hard to come
to a resolution.

58
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:51,219
So as a mediator, what I've done
a lot, and what I do when

59
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:55,199
I'm mediating, is listen very
carefully to toxic language.

60
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,879
So let's take, for example,
a person says--

61
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,919
I'll use a relatively
mild example--

62
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,159
I'm very angry about this.

63
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,069
In a paraphrase, you might say,
I appreciate that you're

64
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:07,009
upset about what's happened.

65
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:10,479
I've taken that word angry
and I've replaced it

66
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,889
with the word upset.

67
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:15,959
They're quite close together,
I'm still reasonably firm in

68
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,409
my language and in my gestures,
perhaps, but I'm not

69
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:22,030
using the same level
of toxicity.

70
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,689
I'm bringing it down a notch.

71
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:26,800
I don't want to bring it down
two notches or three notches,

72
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,219
so I don't want the person to
say, I'm really angry, and I

73
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:31,330
say, I know you're frustrated.

74
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,030
That is likely to inflame the
situation, because that word

75
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,129
has gone too far down.

76
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:40,759
I've deescalated the
conflict too far.

77
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:43,399
What I want to do is just bring
it down slightly so that

78
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,939
we can move on and we can start
to have a constructive

79
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:47,439
conversation.

80
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,240
So reframing, let's recap.

81
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,219
What we're trying to do with
reframing is alter slightly

82
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:56,680
the nuance or alter slightly
the language to serve the

83
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,000
purpose or to serve the
interests of the parties who

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,300
we're working with.

85
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,090
The second aspect or application
is when we're

86
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,789
paraphrasing, we might change
some of that toxic language

87
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,989
and make it a little
bit more neutral.

88
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,810
So have a go at reframing, and
you might want to go into the

89
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,919
discussion boards and give some
examples of how you might

90
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,285
have reframed and what
the effect of it was.

91
00:04:18,285 --> 00:04:20,840
And perhaps you can have some
interesting discussions there.

92
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:25,077
