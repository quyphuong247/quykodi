00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,227


2
00:00:10,227 --> 00:00:12,259
In this topic, we're
going to be looking

3
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:16,000
at the final of our five
phases of negotiation,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,379
and that is the agreement phase.

5
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:22,219
When we move towards this
phase, what we're trying to do

6
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:26,189
is to become far more
specific in our language

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,170
than we had been earlier on.

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,679
And if we were, for example, to
contrast this with the earlier

9
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:35,159
stages where we're
being quite expansive,

10
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,459
now we'd want to become
quite convergent.

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,289
We want to bring
things to a close.

12
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:42,339
We want to be really specific.

13
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,860
So moving towards
the agreement phase,

14
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:46,890
our language changes,
and now we want

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,910
to know exactly what
we're talking about,

16
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:50,750
we want to know what
we're agreeing to,

17
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,100
and what the implications are.

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,960
And this agreement
phase requires

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,759
us to listen very carefully, and
to ask some specific questions.

20
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:03,809
So at this stage, we've
got to be really sharp

21
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,299
and really on our game.

22
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,250
Let's talk about
some ways we can

23
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,849
start to move a negotiation
towards agreement.

24
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:13,140
We've been bargaining.

25
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,409
We've talked about
common ground.

26
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,340
We've identified interests.

27
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,140
And we've maybe
made some proposals

28
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,070
and some counter-proposals.

29
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:24,789
Once we start to shore up the
issues that we've touched on

30
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,140
through the bargaining process,
now we start to be able to say,

31
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,730
OK, let's now
start to say, well,

32
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,530
what's this agreement
going to look like?

33
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,210
So we need to start doing
some summarizing skills.

34
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:38,409
We need to ask some
direct questions--

35
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:39,590
Can you agree to that?

36
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,960
Let's move forward.

37
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,939
Is that OK with you?

38
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:46,719
And now we start to summarize
what the total package is

39
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,480
that we've agreed to.

40
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,980
And that entails us sweeping
around all of the issues

41
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,430
and making sure we
covered everything.

42
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,600
Usually in the agreement
phase, one person

43
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,729
will either make
a verbal summary,

44
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:06,140
or it's usually a good idea to
also make a written summary.

45
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,879
Sometimes that's a contract.

46
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,990
Sometimes it might
be just an email.

47
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,189
Sometimes it's just
a summary of what

48
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:13,379
both parties have agreed to.

49
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,560
If it's quite an
informal negotiation,

50
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,340
it might seem unusual
to write it down.

51
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,539
But that process
of formalizing it

52
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:24,719
through either a
statement or a contract

53
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,359
signals that we've
got an agreement.

54
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,760
There's a few
things to watch out

55
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:31,439
for as you move towards
the agreement phase,

56
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,000
particularly around
formalizing the agreement.

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,789
The first is one we've
already mentioned,

58
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:38,299
and that's the
issue of the nibble.

59
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,550
This is something
that can happen right

60
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,520
at the very death of an
agreement, where we're almost

61
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,600
there and an additional clause
can come in and be requested.

62
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,930
That's sometimes been referred
to as skin in the game.

63
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,180
We want some skin in the game.

64
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,370
We want you to take a
little bit more risk,

65
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,030
or show us that
you're committed.

66
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,580
Something that makes you
more committed to the deal.

67
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,760
We also need to think a
bit about the documenting

68
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,030
of the agreement.

69
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,069
And experienced
negotiators often

70
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:12,984
talk about what's called
the power of the pen.

71
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:16,650
Now, the power of the
pen relates to the risk

72
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:22,520
that, if you forego the
opportunity to formalize

73
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,560
the agreement, if you give
that right to somebody else,

74
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,784
you allow them to write
up what's been agreed to,

75
00:03:28,784 --> 00:03:31,240
that the inference or the
nuance in the language

76
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,400
can sometimes
change a little bit

77
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,420
to advantage the other side.

78
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:38,669
So even though it may seem
like it's an inconvenience

79
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:41,209
to have to be the one that
formalize and documents

80
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,420
the agreement, it's
something that you really

81
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:44,369
want to watch out for.

82
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,500
That what gets formalized is
what was actually agreed to.

83
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,349
We also want to be careful, in
this final phase, in thinking

84
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:55,389
about the clauses
within contracts,

85
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:58,066
particularly if they're
pro forma contracts.

86
00:03:58,067 --> 00:03:59,650
And the building
industry's an example

87
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,631
where pro forma
contracts are often used.

88
00:04:02,631 --> 00:04:04,629
People will say, oh,
that's a standard contract,

89
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:10,819
you know, every building job
uses the same contract here.

90
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:13,729
And so people don't necessarily
pay attention to it.

91
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:16,949
Well, you can take it from
me, once a dispute arises,

92
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:18,639
they will be paying
attention to it.

93
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,829
So it's better off going
through the contract in detail

94
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:26,310
at the time, rather than being
caught by a clause later on.

95
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,589
If you're the one who's
going to be giving services,

96
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:31,699
you want to be thinking
a bit about the language

97
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:35,149
that you use, and
particularly, around assuming

98
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,549
any liability in a contract.

99
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,009
So think about words like these
and what they might imply.

100
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:46,149
You know, think about
guarantee, warranty,

101
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:54,250
assure, ensure, perfect,
those kinds of words.

102
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:58,529
They really imply that
you're taking 100% liability

103
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:03,169
for a service or a
product, and thus, there's

104
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,699
a legal risk
associated with that.

105
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,610
You just need to think
carefully in the agreement

106
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,770
stage about what
you're agreeing to,

107
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:16,560
and what liability or what
risk you're taking on.

108
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,870
There's, perhaps, a
little more light-hearted

109
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,110
point around the agreement
stage that we can think about.

110
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,470
And that is, we
want to make sure

111
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,550
that we don't look too happy.

112
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,540
That may sound silly to
you, but here's the point.

113
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:35,290
The person who, sort of,
jumps for joy in a negotiation

114
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,050
is the person who will
probably live to regret it,

115
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,990
because the other side
is going to feel what?

116
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,810
They're going to feel as they've
got the raw end of the stick.

117
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,699
They've been ripped
off in the deal.

118
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:47,229
It's the last thing you
want, because you're

119
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:52,300
going to set up either some
resistance from the other side

120
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,590
in implementing the agreement,
and they'll feel cheated,

121
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:58,259
or you may feel
some buyer's regret.

122
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:00,500
That is, they won't
like the deal,

123
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,259
and they'll be resistant to it.

124
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:07,063
Or you may set up some cycle of,
sort of, a retribution, where

125
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:08,730
they go to negotiate
with you next time,

126
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,080
they're out to get you.

127
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,699
So don't look too happy
at the end of a deal.

128
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:14,889
And the final point
I'll make in this topic,

129
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:18,740
and it's the point about
celebrating your agreement.

130
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,110
At the end of a
negotiation, you want

131
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,509
to mark that it's been
successful negotiation.

132
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:30,029
So open a bottle of
champagne, toast one another,

133
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:33,489
and mark the agreement with
some sort of formal ceremony.

134
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,100
Perhaps a gift-giving,
or a contract signing,

135
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,640
or a photograph.

136
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:41,779
This is often a good way of
showing that the negotiation is

137
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:44,329
finished in good faith.

138
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:47,461
