00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,390


2
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,600
In this topic, we're going
to look at cross-cultural

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,149
communication and throughout the
module so far, we've been

4
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:19,519
talking about communication--

5
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,710
listening, questioning,
re-framing,

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,600
assertiveness, and so on.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,380
All of these things can be
challenging when we're trying

8
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:29,329
to negotiate and managing
conflict, in particular, where

9
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:33,969
there's a lot of heated
emotional high stakes.

10
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:36,259
Negotiation, conflict
resolution--

11
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:39,689
they can be difficult enough
when people want to understand

12
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:42,489
one another, when they're from
the same cultural background,

13
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:46,609
when they have, broadly
speaking, the same values, the

14
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:51,780
same world view in a sense,
they have the same rules

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,120
around negotiating and
managing conflict.

16
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,289
What happens when people come
from vastly different cultural

17
00:00:58,289 --> 00:00:59,539
backgrounds?

18
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:02,799
They have different reference
points, different ways that

19
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,870
they see the world, different
values, and perhaps, most

20
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:11,520
importantly, very different
ways of communicating?

21
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,959
This topic or a look at that
issue in some more detail I

22
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,949
want to look at the difference
between what are called high

23
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,380
context cultures and low
context cultures.

24
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:25,589
And this idea comes from
Edward Hall, an

25
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,210
anthropologist.

26
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:32,389
And in the 1970s, he wrote a
book called, Beyond Culture.

27
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,379
And in that book, Hall talked
about the way people

28
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:39,509
communicate as giving reference
to their cultural

29
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,540
background.

30
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,550
And he talked about the
difference between high

31
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:44,030
context cultures--

32
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:50,500
and these are cultures where
the context conveys some

33
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,504
additional meaning, so where
things are said and who they

34
00:01:54,504 --> 00:01:58,280
are said by add an additional
layer of meaning

35
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,939
to the actual words.

36
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,200
Contrasted those cultures with
low context cultures.

37
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,609
And low context cultures is
where the context plays a very

38
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:11,889
minimal role in actually the
communication process.

39
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:15,429
In low context cultures,
what's said is what's

40
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,189
important, the actual words that
are being said not the

41
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:20,889
context that they're said in.

42
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:26,379
And this is a quite familiar
and very useful way of

43
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:31,000
describing cultural differences
in communication,

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,129
particularly between Asian
societies and the West--

45
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:39,669
Western societies--

46
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:40,769
many--

47
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:46,510
being low context societies and
Asian societies being high

48
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:49,509
context cultures.

49
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:54,949
Let's take an example of two
messages that we might see

50
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:57,359
delivered in a negotiation
process.

51
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,200
They are essentially the same
message, trying to convey

52
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:05,319
exactly the same idea, but
they've been communicated in

53
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,139
completely different ways.

54
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:10,639
And this is an example that Ray
Fills gives from his book,

55
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,599
Effective Negotiation.

56
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,250
Let's have a look at how they
might convey a request for an

57
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,360
increased offer on a
piece of business.

58
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,870
This is a high context
communicator sending the

59
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,840
message that the deal or the
offer is not sufficient.

60
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,750
We like your package overall and
would like to accept it.

61
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,870
Some other companies have put in
offers that place a higher

62
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,670
value on our product.

63
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:42,679
We'd like to discuss
your offer further.

64
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,159
Let's contrast that with a low
context communicator, who's

65
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,819
really blunt, comes straight
to the point and really

66
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:52,280
explicit in their
communication.

67
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,650
You'll have to do better than
that-- we had expected you to

68
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,860
offer around 4 million not 3.

69
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,650
So we can see from this really
nice, simple example of the

70
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,420
two communicators basically
getting the

71
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:06,119
same message across.

72
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,120
The high context communicators
is speaking in a very

73
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,530
indirect, implied way, almost
speaking in code.

74
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,949
And the listener is supposed
to infer what is being said

75
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:20,849
from this coded message.

76
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,810
The low context communicator,
in contrast, is very direct.

77
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,839
They say exactly
what they want.

78
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,529
There languages is perhaps
even a bit more

79
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:30,029
confrontational.

80
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:34,539
And this is the way a lot of
miscommunication emerges.

81
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,980
And it's something you need to
become used to if you're going

82
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,890
to communicate across
cultures.

83
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:43,449
So we need to be particularly
awake to these cultural

84
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,209
differences when we're
negotiating across cultures.

85
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:48,039
Let's take another example.

86
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,540
Western business people often
complain that when they're

87
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,620
doing business in Asia,
they don't get a

88
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,530
clear answer from people.

89
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:56,849
But they'll often say,
they never say no.

90
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,290
So what happens is an Asian
business person might say

91
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,680
something like, that would
be very difficult for us.

92
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,720
And the Westerner, who's trying
to be very explicit,

93
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,900
will say, well, what do
we need to change?

94
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:10,329
How do we need to fix this?

95
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:11,829
What do we need to shift?

96
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:13,779
How can we get you to say yes?

97
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:15,619
You know, push and
push and push.

98
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,300
Meanwhile, the embarrassment
is rising because you're

99
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,840
expected to know from the coded
language that would be

100
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,549
very difficult for us.

101
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,139
That the answer is
actually no.

102
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,839
So we really need to think
about finding some common

103
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:34,489
space where the negotiators
could start to understand one

104
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,740
another and becoming more
familiar with these two ways

105
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,759
of communicating.

106
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,519
Here's just a couple more tips
to think about cross-cultural

107
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,759
communication.

108
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,329
One, just because a person
speaks English doesn't mean

109
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:48,680
they come from the same cultural
background as you.

110
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,639
It doesn't mean they have
the same cultural rules.

111
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:55,800
They may speak English but still
have very culturally

112
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,920
different view of a conflict
or of a negotiation.

113
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,720
So just because people are
speaking the same language

114
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,990
doesn't mean they come from
the same cultures.

115
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,180
If a person is struggling with
your language, then sometimes

116
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,889
we have the tendency to want
to finish this sentence for

117
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:17,870
them and this means that we can
push our interpretation of

118
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,870
the point that they're making
on to that person.

119
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,910
So we really need to give people
time and give them an

120
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,270
opportunity to make their
point clearly.

121
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:29,399
And the final point I'd give
you in cross-cultural

122
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:32,810
negotiation is try to learn a
little bit about the culture

123
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,370
and the country where you're
doing business, or the people

124
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,310
who you're interacting with.

125
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,959
Learn a little bit
about history.

126
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,569
Learn a little bit about the
rules around decision-making,

127
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:47,870
authority, hierarchy, and
resolving conflict.

128
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,055
Do some research and that'll
stand you in good stead for

129
00:06:51,055 --> 00:06:52,305
being more successful
cross-culturally.

130
00:06:52,305 --> 00:06:57,122
