[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:09,368 --> 00:00:12,419
If we want to try and
get our thinking right,

3
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:15,410
as a negotiator,
we're going to have

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,320
to overcome some very
common thinking errors

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,769
that human things make,
not only in negotiation,

6
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,120
but more generally.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:30,370
And one of the very interesting
insights that we can use here

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,090
is around what are called
cognitive heuristics.

9
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,490
And a cognitive heuristic
is a decision shortcut.

10
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,289
It's the sort of thing
that a human being

11
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:44,030
uses to make a
split-second decision.

12
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,340
So I'm sure you're already
thinking about the classic one

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,550
here, and it's the
idea of a difference

14
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:54,949
between a red light means stop,
and a green light means go.

15
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:59,130
It's a very universal code,
or language that we use.

16
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,670
So wherever we
travel in the world,

17
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,200
we know when a green
light goes, we go,

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,750
and when a red
light goes, we stop.

19
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,689
Now, that sort of shortcut
is very useful for us,

20
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:12,090
because it means we don't have
to interpret complex messages.

21
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,569
We can use that code to make
a split-second decision.

22
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:17,109
Let's take another
one that might not

23
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:19,980
be always so handy
and so useful,

24
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,500
and that is the idea you
should always trust people

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,719
in a uniform, or
you should always

26
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:28,019
trust somebody wearing a suit.

27
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:30,149
Now, you may not
admit to that, but I

28
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,730
suspect you'll find
that you're probably

29
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,520
more trusting of people
who are well-dressed,

30
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:39,729
or a person who's
wearing a uniform.

31
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,250
The heuristic is that
conveys authority.

32
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,790
As we all know from
watching movies,

33
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,850
it's always the con man
whose wearing a suit.

34
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:48,265
And it's always
the bad guys who's

35
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:51,080
disguised as a
security guard who gets

36
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,039
trusted and gets into the bank.

37
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,560
Now, this is the idea of, we
use these decision short cuts,

38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,820
and we need to be conscious of
the way that our brain thinks,

39
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:04,250
and almost overcome
the cognitive heuristic

40
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,530
to be able to think rationally
when we're negotiating.

41
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,606
Let's use an example here
of some different cognitive

42
00:02:12,606 --> 00:02:14,689
heuristics, and the first
one I want to talk about

43
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:16,479
is the idea of framing.

44
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,009
And that's the topic that we're
talking about here, framing.

45
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:23,169
Let's think a little bit
about some different ways

46
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:25,750
that we can frame something.

47
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,389
And that's basically
the way that we

48
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:30,309
can position it, or
describe something,

49
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,740
and a different frame will
produce a different response.

50
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,760
Let's have a look at
three different ways

51
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:40,489
that Ann could frame
her request to Joe

52
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,620
about the researchers' time.

53
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:48,300
The first example we'll use
is an interest-based approach.

54
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,140
And if she was using
this, Ann would say,

55
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:54,859
Joe, I understand you've
got the researchers working

56
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,340
on some projects that
are important to you.

57
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,650
I've got also some
work that needs

58
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:05,219
to be completed in a
fairly short time frame.

59
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:06,969
These are really
important reports

60
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:09,569
that are going to be
good for the firm,

61
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:11,969
and a proposal that
may, in fact, bring us

62
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:13,639
in a lot of new business.

63
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:20,349
So we really need to find a way
of both getting our work done,

64
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:23,400
so that we can
actually make sure

65
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,909
that this project goes forward.

66
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:28,759
And that would be an
interest-based approach.

67
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:31,370
She could also then
use what we would

68
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,939
call a rights-based approach, so
she could frame the negotiation

69
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:39,159
through the lens, if
you like, of her rights.

70
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:42,329
She could say, Joe,
they're a shared resource.

71
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,000
You don't have the right
to monopolize those people.

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,169
We have to share them.

73
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:49,530
That's the way the
business has set it up.

74
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,419
I'm entitled to time
as much as you are.

75
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:56,719
You need to release those people
so they can work on my project

76
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:57,770
as well.

77
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:02,030
Here what she's doing is she's
making a call to her rights.

78
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,560
It's her right to
share the resource.

79
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,650
And that creates a different
nuance, or a different tone

80
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,250
around the negotiation.

81
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,000
And there's a third
way she could do it.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,750
She could frame the negotiation
through a power-based approach.

83
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:24,240
So she could say, Joe, my work
is more important than yours.

84
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,514
Mine's about bringing
in new business,

85
00:04:27,514 --> 00:04:29,680
a proposal for some new work.

86
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,110
This is far more important
than doing ongoing research

87
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,449
for a client.

88
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:37,589
I demand that you give
me those researchers

89
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:40,250
to work on this project tonight.

90
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,110
Here, she's invoking
her power, and it's

91
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,370
the power and the
influence of the importance

92
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,540
of the work, her work,
with respect to his.

93
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,590
So they're three
very different ways

94
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:53,669
that she frames
the request, and it

95
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,670
will produce three very
different response from Joe.

96
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:00,720
The idea of framing is probably
most closely associated

97
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,850
with the theory of
Kahneman and Tversky,

98
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,720
and that's the theory
of prospect theory.

99
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,040
And prospect theory is probably
best simplified by the phrase,

100
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,330
"The joy of winning
is outweighed

101
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:18,189
by the pain of losing".

102
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:22,610
And this is this
idea that people

103
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,420
are more conservative with
respect to making a decision

104
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,420
if it feels as though
there's a chance that they

105
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,629
may lose something.

106
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:33,550
And they're more risk
averse if there's

107
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,560
a sense that they could
actually lose something

108
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,670
in a proposition,
and they're less

109
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,870
likely to want to
take that chance.

110
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:45,639
So if Ann phrases her
proposition to Joe

111
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:48,979
that she's taking something
away from him, that she's

112
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,280
taking the researchers'
time away from him,

113
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:56,509
then he will be more
resistant to that proposition.

114
00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:00,810
If, however, she frames the
proposal that they're both

115
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,290
going to win
something, that they're

116
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:08,160
going to get a better
working relationship,

117
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,860
that will have more quality
time from the researchers,

118
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,650
that there'll be better
output, and she frames it

119
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:16,209
as a no-lose
situation, then Joe's

120
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,219
going to be more likely
to accept the proposition.

121
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,180
So this is this
concept of what's

122
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,389
called a lose frame
versus a win frame,

123
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:28,610
and we want to try and avoid
loss frames in negotiation,

124
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:32,205
because people will be resistant
to accepting a proposition

125
00:06:32,204 --> 00:06:35,240
if there's a chance that
they could lose something.

126
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,530
When we think about
framing, we also

127
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:41,969
can think about how
somebody presents an idea.

128
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,720
So let's take, for example,
a proposition a real estate

129
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,990
agent might put to you
in selling a house.

130
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,199
If you were to negotiate
with a real estate agent what

131
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,180
their fee would be, usually,
it'll be around 1-1/2% to 2%

132
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,400
of the sale price of what you
would pay the real estate agent

133
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,007
to sell your house.

134
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:03,090
Let's say you're selling
the house for $1 million,

135
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,109
which is about the median
price in many suburbs

136
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,120
where I live in Sydney.

137
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,720
If I negotiate for
a 2% fee, then we're

138
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,870
talking here about $20,000.

139
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:22,730
If I negotiate for a
1% fee, it's $10,000.

140
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,170
Now, $10,000 is a
lot of money to me,

141
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,120
as it probably is to you.

142
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,769
So there's a difference
between 1% and 2% of $10,000.

143
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:36,279
If I'm trying to get you
to pay 2% rather than 1%,

144
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:38,949
then I'm going to be
phrasing that discussion

145
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:40,319
as a percentage.

146
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,889
I'm not going to say to
you what the raw figure is.

147
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:46,475
I'm going to tell you,
hey, it's only a 1/2% more.

148
00:07:46,475 --> 00:07:48,100
You can turn around
and say to me, hey,

149
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,640
you know what that
1/2% represents?

150
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,759
It's $5,000.

151
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:58,909
So our choice of framing
will be influenced

152
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,671
by what the raw
figure is going to be.

153
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,170
If it sounds like
it's a lot to you,

154
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,460
I'm probably going
to use a percentage.

155
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:07,939
So when we think
about framing, it's

156
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:10,399
really about how
we present things,

157
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,899
how we present an idea
to the other side.

158
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:17,279
We're trying to do it in a way
which is honest, obviously,

159
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,849
it comes with integrity.

160
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,330
But also present the
idea in a way which

161
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:27,289
is going to be most influential,
or play to the people's

162
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,610
human nature with
respect to framing,

163
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,788
and play to they're cooperative
side, and get them in a mood

164
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:35,580
where they're going
to be more agreeable.

165
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,600
So think about the way
that you frame ideas,

166
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,279
and how you're going
to present an idea

167
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,728
to elicit the sort of
response that you're after.

168
00:08:44,729 --> 00:08:47,764
