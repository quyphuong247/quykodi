00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,182


2
00:00:09,182 --> 00:00:13,009
In this topic, I want to look
at another part of getting

3
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:14,740
your thinking right
as a negotiator.

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:20,530
And that is the concept of
the availability bias.

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,900
And two authors who talked about
this extensively are Max

6
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:29,419
Bazerman and Margaret Neale
in their book Negotiating

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,700
Rationally.

8
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:35,689
And the availability bias
is essentially this.

9
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:44,140
Human beings have a preference
for receiving information in

10
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,630
ways that are readily
accessible.

11
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,240
And this can mean that we
like to simplify things.

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,260
We like to simplify the world.

13
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:56,759
It can mean that when we're
making a decision, we like to

14
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:59,390
recall information.

15
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:04,090
We like to gather information
in familiar ways--

16
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:09,640
ways that match our
view of the world.

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,099
So often, we've got this
preference for recalling

18
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:20,669
information in ways that are
quite available to us.

19
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,100
Now, Bazerman and Neale make
is very important point.

20
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:27,640
Just because information is
available, it doesn't mean

21
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,620
that it is valuable.

22
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,579
And this is a problem that we
often make when we're trying

23
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:34,629
to make decisions.

24
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:39,089
And people rely very heavily on
their memory, for example.

25
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,540
And we know, of course, that
our memory is faulty and we

26
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,340
may recall things only partially
or only the good

27
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,340
part of it or only the
bad part of it.

28
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,950
And so we need to sometimes
check whether

29
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,579
our memory is accurate.

30
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,459
We also need to think about
the way information is

31
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:57,519
presented to us.

32
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,950
Simply because information--

33
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,730
a proposal, let's say--

34
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:07,719
is presented in a logical,
easily digestible way doesn't

35
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,960
mean that we should be
convinced by it.

36
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,680
Let's take, for example,
all the Ponzi schemes.

37
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,719
We seem to hear stories about
people being conned on a

38
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,840
regular basis.

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:25,710
by financial schemes or get rich
quick types schemes that

40
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:31,390
seem very logical, very
easily understood.

41
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:35,559
Of course, what the poor people
who were conned by

42
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,050
these schemes need to have done
is to have dug deeper and

43
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,150
done more due diligence and
questioned the value

44
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,010
proposition that they were
buying into with the

45
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:47,049
investment.

46
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,910
We also have a preference--

47
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:54,210
it's more likely, I should say,
that we would remember

48
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,349
information that's vivid.

49
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:03,689
So if we, for example, have had
an experience of going to

50
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:07,189
see Jaws in the movie theater
and then we go swimming the

51
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:09,615
next day, and we watch a picture
of a shark attack and

52
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:12,590
the next day we're swimming,
we're going to feel as though

53
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,640
a shark attack is quite likely
and probably a shark lurking

54
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:20,099
underneath us, because that
image is so vividly etched

55
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,799
into our brain.

56
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,650
And so if we've had some
experience of, let's say,

57
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,010
being conned, then we're always
going to be seeing that

58
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:35,459
likelihood as being of greater
chance of being conned.

59
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,689
And we'll be, therefore,
less trusting people.

60
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:44,129
So we've got to somehow account
for and respond to or

61
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:47,539
make allowance for this
availability bias.

62
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:50,069
And what it can mean is that
we need to sometimes gather

63
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:55,049
information from non-familiar
sources or sources that aren't

64
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,469
readily accessible.

65
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,109
And this will allow us to do
proper due diligence on a

66
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,910
proposal and to check our
assumptions and check our

67
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:05,599
conclusions.

68
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,439
So the key message out of this
topic is if information is

69
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,169
really accessible, it may not
necessarily be reliable.

70
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,276
