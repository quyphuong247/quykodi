00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,269
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:13,019
In module one, we looked
at this difference

3
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,100
between disputes and conflict.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,690
And I made the case that
we can approach disputes

5
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,700
through a bargaining
approach, using negotiation.

6
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:26,609
And that we should
resolve conflicts

7
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,550
using an analytical
approach which

8
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,000
may require some third
party intervention.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,009
In this module,
we're going to look

10
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:36,780
at where conflict comes from.

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,829
That is, what is
conflict and how do we

12
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:40,559
go about resolving it?

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,380
And what I want to
look at in this module,

14
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:47,790
is to introduce to you at
lease two different approaches

15
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:50,350
to the theory of conflict.

16
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,960
And that is the
biological approach,

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,649
or the inherency school,
and the learning approach,

18
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:00,179
or the contingency
school, of conflict.

19
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:02,299
There's some very
famous theories

20
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:06,140
that argue quite convincingly
that conflict is either

21
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,420
in our nature, or it's learned.

22
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,320
So the biological
approach essentially

23
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:16,099
argues that humans have
conflict and aggression

24
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:17,649
within their nature.

25
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,260
And there's enough history
that we can point to,

26
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,390
contemporary events, to
suggest this is true.

27
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,590
That some degree of
conflict services

28
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,130
an evolutionary purpose,
that it's in some way

29
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:34,049
connected to our genetic makeup.

30
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:35,649
The learning
approach essentially

31
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,900
argues the opposite idea.

32
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,490
That is, that we learned
our conflict behavior

33
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:43,140
through our socialization,
through the way we raise

34
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,219
our children, through
our social institutions,

35
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:47,789
through social learning.

36
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,390
That that's how we learn to
resolve conflict and it's

37
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,640
also how we learn to pursue
conflicts, sometimes violently.

38
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,629
So we're going to look at
those two schools of thought

39
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:02,859
and we'll start by looking
at the biological approach.

40
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:05,390
The biological
approach is essentially

41
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:10,330
arguing that human
nature gives us

42
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,680
a propensity toward violence,
and dominance, and aggression.

43
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,040
This is very much in line
with the English philosopher

44
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:20,219
Thomas Hobbes'
view of the world.

45
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:26,590
In the 18th century, he wrote
about how society requires

46
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,219
a dominant, powerful
government--

47
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:33,280
dominant, powerful state--
to control and suppress

48
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,280
humanity's urge for power
and dominance and aggression.

49
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,949
It's a very bleak
view of humanity.

50
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:42,979
We could probably capture that
with a contemporary reference.

51
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:45,599
We think about a book
like the Lord of the Flies

52
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,650
which was written by William
Golding in the 1950s.

53
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,010
And it's a book about a group
of English public school boys

54
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:56,114
who get shipwrecked in
this post-apocalyptic world

55
00:02:56,115 --> 00:02:57,270
on an island.

56
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:02,120
And the parents and
adults represent the state

57
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,000
in this metaphor
of human existence.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,319
When the boys are left
without that dominant state

59
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,479
to control their other urges,
they start out initially

60
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:14,549
with some degree of order.

61
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,780
But eventually their
world collapses

62
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,699
and they start
behaving like savages,

63
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,280
and they commit murder.

64
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,669
And their society disintegrates
and starts to fall apart.

65
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:27,000
And this is a
metaphor that Golding

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,770
uses, referencing Hobbes,
to look at how humanity,

67
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,840
at human nature, and at our
propensity towards violence

68
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,390
and conflict.

69
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:39,229
That's quite a
different approach

70
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:41,619
to thinking about the
learning approach, which

71
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,770
we'll talk about
in the next topic.

72
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,340
A famous theorist, well and
truly in the biological school,

73
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,960
is Konrad Lorenz.

74
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,770
He was active as a writer
in the 20th century,

75
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,270
late 20th century,
mid 20th century.

76
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,659
And Lorenz was an ethnologist.

77
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:01,389
That means he studied
animal behavior

78
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:05,379
and his particular area
of interest was geese.

79
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:08,019
Beyond the rest of
his work, he was

80
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,050
a really interested
in animal behavior,

81
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,340
in particular animal aggression.

82
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,560
And he said animal aggression
had three main functions.

83
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,819
One was the balanced
distribution

84
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:24,389
of the population of animals
over a particular territory

85
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,759
that could therefore
support that population.

86
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:34,719
The survival of the strongest
members of the species, bit

87
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,020
like the Darwinian idea of
survival of the fittest.

88
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:41,899
And the third one was the
protection of the young.

89
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:47,709
And so he's essentially arguing
that this biological propensity

90
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:51,939
towards aggression has an
evolutionary and a functional

91
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:55,420
role in protecting a species.

92
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,430
Another theorist
we can highlight

93
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,740
as being important in
the biological school

94
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,199
is Robert Ardrey.

95
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,019
And unlike Lorenz, who
talked about the protection

96
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:09,419
of the species, Ardrey
talks about the links

97
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,270
between aggression and group
identity in group protection.

98
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:15,680
So not species, but groups.

99
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,009
And for him, aggression
is about the protection

100
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:23,439
of a group's territorial space.

101
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,769
And we can think about a
contemporary example of this.

102
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:30,500
I think we all feel somewhat
territorial or protective

103
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,560
at times.

104
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,220
We might talk about
neighborhood disputes,

105
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,150
such as the one that Gabe and
Maria might find themselves

106
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:41,750
in with their neighbor as
being a good illustration

107
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,660
of territoriality.

108
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,070
People like to
protect their space,

109
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:49,969
protect the visual
assets of their house.

110
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,700
For example, a view might
be blocked by a neighbor's

111
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,920
extension, or there might be
a bit of the afternoon son

112
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,900
may be blocked.

113
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,500
That could be territoriality.

114
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,389
We might protect our
job role, for example.

115
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:09,319
Somebody might
encroach upon what

116
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:12,310
we see is our job or
our responsibility,

117
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,829
and that could be territorial
instinct starting to play out

118
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:19,629
in our aggressive
behavior, or our conflict

119
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,139
towards the person who we
feel is encroaching upon us.

120
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:25,759
So this biological
approach essentially

121
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,334
is arguing that
conflict is within us.

122
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:31,269
Our aggressiveness is inherent.

123
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:32,569
It's in our nature.

124
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:35,509
And it forms an
evolutionary role,

125
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:38,589
and takes an
evolutionary function--

126
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:42,819
an evolutionary explanation, if
you like, for that aggression.

127
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,627
