00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:06,562
Hello, I'm Matthew Harris,

3
00:00:06,562 --> 00:00:08,723
and I'm a philosophy grad[br]student at Duke University.

4
00:00:08,723 --> 00:00:10,851
And today, I'll be discussing[br]the formal fallacy

5
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:12,185
of affirming the consequent,

6
00:00:12,185 --> 00:00:14,008
and why you sometimes cannot conclude

7
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:16,272
that you should bathe[br]in a tub of peanut butter.

8
00:00:16,272 --> 00:00:17,771
Affirming the consequent occurs

9
00:00:17,771 --> 00:00:19,489
when someone tries to infer the truth

10
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:21,414
of the antecedent of a[br]conditional statement

11
00:00:21,414 --> 00:00:25,166
from the truth of the[br]conditional and its consequent.

12
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,068
But let's see what this means in more detail.

13
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,007
There are two kinds of logical fallacies:

14
00:00:29,007 --> 00:00:30,491
formal and informal.

15
00:00:30,492 --> 00:00:33,093
Both kinds are defective[br]argumentative patterns.

16
00:00:33,093 --> 00:00:34,650
First, we have informal fallacies,

17
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,774
which lack support for the conclusion

18
00:00:36,774 --> 00:00:38,748
because of a flaw in its content.

19
00:00:38,749 --> 00:00:40,769
We also have formal fallacies,

20
00:00:40,768 --> 00:00:43,170
which all have in common[br]with affirming the consequent

21
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,945
that they have defects in[br]the forms of the argument

22
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:47,733
and that they are invalid.

23
00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:50,426
Just to be clear, let's go[br]over a few more definitions.

24
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:52,807
We make conditional[br]statements all the time.

25
00:00:52,807 --> 00:00:54,304
They're generally easy to spot

26
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,848
because they usually are of the form

27
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:58,066
"if P, then Q."

28
00:00:58,067 --> 00:01:00,331
Here, "P" is the antecedent.

29
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:01,653
An easy way to spot antecedents

30
00:01:01,652 --> 00:01:02,908
is to remember that they typically

31
00:01:02,908 --> 00:01:04,903
come after the word "if,"[br]whether or not they're

32
00:01:04,903 --> 00:01:07,131
at the beginning, middle[br]or end of sentences.

33
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:08,712
If you need help remembering that,

34
00:01:08,712 --> 00:01:10,210
just remember that the antecedent comes

35
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:12,147
before the other logically,

36
00:01:12,147 --> 00:01:15,167
and that it sounds a lot like "ancestor."

37
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:17,576
The consequent of the conditional

38
00:01:17,575 --> 00:01:18,552
is the part that typically follows

39
00:01:18,552 --> 00:01:20,328
after the word "then."

40
00:01:20,328 --> 00:01:21,409
It should be easy to remember

41
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:23,335
because it sounds like "consequence"

42
00:01:23,335 --> 00:01:25,278
and basically is just that.

43
00:01:26,448 --> 00:01:29,099
So let's take the following[br]conditionals for examples.

44
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:30,375
Suppose someone tells you the following

45
00:01:30,376 --> 00:01:32,560
true conditionals and statement:

46
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,346
"If the neighbors ate Susan's parrot,

47
00:01:34,346 --> 00:01:36,007
"then Susan is angry,"

48
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:38,481
and "Susan is angry."

49
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,418
Just because it is true[br]that if the neighbors

50
00:01:40,418 --> 00:01:43,623
had eaten the parrot, then[br]she would have been angry,

51
00:01:43,623 --> 00:01:46,361
and it is also true that she is angry,

52
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:48,138
does not mean that she's angry

53
00:01:48,138 --> 00:01:51,283
because they ate her parrot.

54
00:01:51,284 --> 00:01:52,724
Perhaps she's mad because her parrot

55
00:01:52,724 --> 00:01:54,582
isn't very interesting.

56
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:56,323
Or maybe she's angry that it doesn't know

57
00:01:56,323 --> 00:01:57,786
how to use the toy car that she spent

58
00:01:57,786 --> 00:01:59,736
all afternoon building for it.

59
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:02,162
Nevertheless, it does not[br]follow from the conjunction

60
00:02:02,162 --> 00:02:04,682
of the true conditional[br]and the true consequent

61
00:02:04,682 --> 00:02:07,790
that the antecedent is true.

62
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,073
Let's look at a few more examples:

63
00:02:10,074 --> 00:02:11,978
"If Tom has a good reason to complain,

64
00:02:11,978 --> 00:02:14,974
"then Tom will complain tomorrow."

65
00:02:14,973 --> 00:02:17,875
Now, maybe you know Tom well,

66
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,836
so you know that this is true.

67
00:02:19,836 --> 00:02:21,356
Maybe you even know that it's true

68
00:02:21,356 --> 00:02:23,575
that he will complain tomorrow.

69
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:24,911
But it would not follow that Tom

70
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,140
has a good reason to complain.

71
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:28,496
Maybe he just doesn't know

72
00:02:28,497 --> 00:02:30,692
any better way to get attention.

73
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,073
Now, let's take a look[br]at one more example.

74
00:02:33,073 --> 00:02:36,230
Consider this conditional[br]and the assertion:

75
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,133
"If you are allergic to peanut butter,

76
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:39,712
"then it would be a bad idea

77
00:02:39,712 --> 00:02:41,918
"to bathe in a tub of peanut butter,"

78
00:02:41,918 --> 00:02:44,168
and "it is a bad idea to bathe

79
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:46,556
"in a tub of peanut butter;

80
00:02:46,556 --> 00:02:49,156
"therefore, you are[br]allergic to peanut butter."

81
00:02:50,344 --> 00:02:51,557
Just because it is true that it would be

82
00:02:51,557 --> 00:02:54,043
a bad idea to bathe in[br]a tub of peanut butter

83
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:55,481
if you are allergic,

84
00:02:55,481 --> 00:02:57,340
and it is also true that it is a bad idea

85
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,997
to bathe in a tub of[br]peanut butter in general,

86
00:02:59,997 --> 00:03:02,818
does not mean that you are[br]allergic to peanut butter.

87
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:04,537
If you were to conclude this,

88
00:03:04,538 --> 00:03:05,963
then you would be committing the fallacy

89
00:03:05,963 --> 00:03:07,914
of affirming the consequent.

90
00:03:07,914 --> 00:03:08,936
So that's the formal fallacy

91
00:03:08,937 --> 00:03:10,237
of affirming the consequent,

92
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:12,998
and a few examples that you[br]could use in the future.

93
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,080
