00:00:06,328 --> 00:00:09,455
Hi, my name is Kelley Schiffman.

3
00:00:09,595 --> 00:00:11,589
I'm a graduate student at Yale University,

4
00:00:11,954 --> 00:00:14,120
and today I'd like to talk a bit more

5
00:00:14,435 --> 00:00:16,472
about necessary and sufficient conditions.

6
00:00:16,611 --> 00:00:18,411
Now, this video builds somewhat on the

7
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:19,893
discussion of necessary and sufficient

8
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:22,373
conditions in my previous
video on the topic.

9
00:00:22,373 --> 00:00:25,449
That said, let's review quickly.

10
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:33,108
To say that p is a necessary condition for
q is to say that q is true only if p is true.

11
00:00:33,174 --> 00:00:35,497
We can put this in more ordinary terms,

12
00:00:35,566 --> 00:00:37,471
as one of our viewers did, by saying that

13
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:43,158
p is necessary for q because p being true
is needed for q to be true.

14
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:51,177
To say that r is a sufficient condition for s
is to say that if r is true, then s is true.

15
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:57,236
In other words, r is sufficient for s
because r is all you need to get s.

16
00:00:57,301 --> 00:00:59,530
r is enough to get s.

17
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:04,772
Now, there are four possible conditions
of necessity and sufficiency.

18
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,587
We can have necessity and
sufficiency together.

19
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,365
We can have necessity but not sufficiency.

20
00:01:10,466 --> 00:01:13,170
We can have sufficiency but not necessity.

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,230
And we can have a case where we have

22
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:17,725
neither necessity nor sufficiency.

23
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:19,953
Let's look at an example of each.

24
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:22,118
Here's an example where we have a

25
00:01:22,153 --> 00:01:23,763
necessary and sufficient condition

26
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,061
for some outcome.

27
00:01:25,134 --> 00:01:28,125
I walk into a fast food restaurant.

28
00:01:28,194 --> 00:01:30,626
I place an order for some french fries,

29
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:32,817
and pay for those fries.

30
00:01:32,855 --> 00:01:35,570
Now, my placing that order and paying for

31
00:01:35,611 --> 00:01:37,673
the fries is both necessary and sufficient

32
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:39,259
for receiving them.

33
00:01:39,325 --> 00:01:41,332
Necessary, because they're not going to

34
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:43,463
give me the french fries unless I order

35
00:01:43,506 --> 00:01:44,753
them and pay for them.

36
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:47,760
And sufficient, because
that's all I have to do.

37
00:01:47,826 --> 00:01:50,641
I just have to order them and pay for them,

38
00:01:50,704 --> 00:01:52,155
and I'll get them.

39
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:54,713
Of course, there's a caveat here.

40
00:01:54,777 --> 00:01:57,457
In saying that ordering and paying for the

41
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,111
fries is both necessary and sufficient,

42
00:01:59,144 --> 00:02:02,726
I'm making certain background assumptions.

43
00:02:02,757 --> 00:02:04,893
I'm assuming, for example, that there's

44
00:02:04,936 --> 00:02:06,768
not going to be a meteor hitting the

45
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:09,616
restaurant in two seconds, because if that

46
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:11,911
were the case, then my ordering the french

47
00:02:11,943 --> 00:02:14,694
fries and paying for them would not be

48
00:02:14,757 --> 00:02:16,475
sufficient for my receiving them, since

49
00:02:16,475 --> 00:02:20,487
the restaurant will be destroyed in two
seconds, before I can ever receive them.

50
00:02:20,487 --> 00:02:22,812
Similarly, I'm assuming that the

51
00:02:22,884 --> 00:02:25,646
restaurant isn't giving
away free fries today.

52
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:28,368
If they were, then my paying for the fries

53
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:31,664
would not, in fact, be necessary
for receiving them.

54
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:34,146
Now, there's an important lesson here,

55
00:02:34,177 --> 00:02:35,930
which is that any time we assess the

56
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:37,840
necessary and sufficient conditions for an

57
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:40,943
outcome, we make these sorts
of background assumptions.

58
00:02:40,975 --> 00:02:44,145
We take certain things for granted.

59
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:46,734
Consider, now, a condition that's

60
00:02:46,823 --> 00:02:49,670
necessary, but not sufficient.

61
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:53,617
It's relatively easy to come up
with these sorts of examples.

62
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:55,778
All we have to do is come up with

63
00:02:55,814 --> 00:02:57,465
something that's needed for something

64
00:02:57,497 --> 00:02:58,918
else, but not enough for it.

65
00:02:58,954 --> 00:03:00,635
A moderate degree of exercise,

66
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,481
for example, is necessary
for staying healthy.

67
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,221
It's not sufficient, because some other

68
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:08,123
things are necessary - a
good diet, for example.

69
00:03:08,186 --> 00:03:12,625
What, now, about sufficient, but
not necessary, conditions?

70
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:17,180
Consider my dog Teddy, who's
really easy to make happy.

71
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,454
Giving him a treat is sufficient
to make him happy.

72
00:03:20,493 --> 00:03:22,907
It's not necessary, though, since there's

73
00:03:22,978 --> 00:03:25,786
lots of other ways to make him happy.

74
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:30,021
Throwing a ball for him is also
enough to make him happy.

75
00:03:30,068 --> 00:03:32,413
Or I could scratch his belly.

76
00:03:32,443 --> 00:03:35,056
All of these activities are sufficient for

77
00:03:35,087 --> 00:03:37,477
Teddy's happiness, since each of them is

78
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,746
enough to make him happy.

79
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,840
But none is necessary, since there are so

80
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,592
many different ways to make him happy.

81
00:03:44,662 --> 00:03:47,760
Finally, let's consider conditions that

82
00:03:47,823 --> 00:03:50,349
are neither necessary nor sufficient.

83
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:51,835
Here's an example.

84
00:03:51,903 --> 00:03:53,520
I want a piece of cake.

85
00:03:53,582 --> 00:03:55,844
So I go into the kitchen, and I mix a

86
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:58,425
bunch of ingredients for the
cake together in a bowl.

87
00:03:58,461 --> 00:04:00,370
Now, that alone is not sufficient for my

88
00:04:00,413 --> 00:04:02,822
getting a piece of cake, because I still

89
00:04:02,895 --> 00:04:05,606
have to stir those ingredients,
put them in a pan,

90
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,129
put them in the oven,
bake the cake.

91
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,328
Mixing those ingredients is also not

92
00:04:10,508 --> 00:04:12,385
necessary for my getting a piece of cake.

93
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,878
Why not?

94
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:16,248
Well, because I could just as easily walk

95
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,637
down the street and buy a piece of cake.

96
00:04:19,672 --> 00:04:22,380
Let's turn, now, to consider the question

97
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:26,235
of why necessary and sufficient
conditions are important.

98
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:30,423
Why is it important that we be
clear on this distinction?

99
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:32,438
Well, one answer is that we tend to

100
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,016
confuse necessary and sufficient

101
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,093
conditions all the time, sometimes
with harmful results.

102
00:04:38,134 --> 00:04:40,805
Here's an example pulled from real life.

103
00:04:40,838 --> 00:04:45,357
Sarah, Tom, and Bobby are all found at the

104
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:49,304
scene of a crime, along
with an illegal gun.

105
00:04:49,305 --> 00:04:51,711
Sarah is charged with possession of the

106
00:04:51,755 --> 00:04:54,850
gun, and brought to trial on that charge.

107
00:04:54,882 --> 00:04:57,925
Her attorney argues that Sarah's innocent,

108
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,355
because the gun actually belongs to Tom.

109
00:05:00,422 --> 00:05:02,617
Now, before the jurors deliberate,

110
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,621
the judge tells them the following:

111
00:05:04,694 --> 00:05:07,246
"If you decide that the gun belongs to

112
00:05:07,276 --> 00:05:10,637
"Tom, then you must judge
Sarah to be innocent."

113
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,643
The jurors deliberate,

114
00:05:12,718 --> 00:05:16,141
they decide that the gun does
not belong to Tom,

115
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:21,975
and on that basis alone, conclude
that Sarah is, in fact, guilty.

116
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:24,535
That is her illegal gun.

117
00:05:24,596 --> 00:05:29,642
Now, if we pause, we see the
jurors made a huge mistake.

118
00:05:29,678 --> 00:05:33,846
They confused a sufficient condition
with a necessary one.

119
00:05:33,882 --> 00:05:36,428
If the gun belongs to Tom, that's a

120
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:39,543
sufficient condition for
Sarah's innocence.

121
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,471
It's not necessary, though.

122
00:05:41,538 --> 00:05:45,358
Sarah could be innocent even if
the gun does not belong to Tom.

123
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:47,649
There could be another reason
for her innocence.

124
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:49,816
For example, if the gun belongs to some

125
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:52,619
third person - Bobby, for example.

126
00:05:52,682 --> 00:05:55,340
Because the jurors confused a sufficient

127
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,632
condition with a necessary one,

128
00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:59,541
they overlook this possibility,

129
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:01,960
and so hastily convicted Sarah.

130
00:06:01,992 --> 00:06:04,162
If you're interested in this sort of

131
00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:06,602
mistake, I highly recommend that you check

132
00:06:06,637 --> 00:06:10,250
out Matthew Harris's video on
affirming the consequent.

133
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,735
Now, a very different sort of reason

134
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:14,774
that we're interested in necessary and

135
00:06:14,805 --> 00:06:16,747
sufficient conditions is that they can

136
00:06:16,747 --> 00:06:19,563
help us figure out what things are.

137
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:23,191
To see how this works,
consider a simple case:

138
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,123
what sort of thing is a square?

139
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,798
We can begin to answer this question by

140
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:31,778
articulating all the necessary
conditions for being a square.

141
00:06:31,778 --> 00:06:34,912
One necessary condition
is that it's a plane figure.

142
00:06:34,982 --> 00:06:38,977
Another is that it have four sides.

143
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:41,430
A third necessary condition is that those

144
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,177
sides are equal and straight.

145
00:06:43,274 --> 00:06:47,367
And finally, it's necessary that
it has four right angles.

146
00:06:47,432 --> 00:06:49,790
When we put all these necessary conditions

147
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:53,500
together, we get the sufficient
condition for being a square.

148
00:06:53,536 --> 00:06:56,411
Indeed, we get the definition of a square:

149
00:06:56,446 --> 00:06:58,942
a square is a plane figure with four

150
00:06:58,942 --> 00:07:02,620
equal, straight sides and four right angles.

151
00:07:02,682 --> 00:07:05,341
Now, of course, not all concepts are as

152
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:08,543
easy to get a handle on as
the concept of a square.

153
00:07:08,617 --> 00:07:12,254
Consider the concepts of fairness,
or equality, or happiness.

154
00:07:12,305 --> 00:07:15,942
These concepts, unlike the concept of a

155
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:20,806
square, are a lot fuzzier, or at
least more controversial.

156
00:07:20,855 --> 00:07:23,806
We disagree over what fairness is and over

157
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,107
what happiness is, and having a good

158
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,198
grasp on the difference between necessary

159
00:07:28,264 --> 00:07:30,725
and sufficient conditions allows us to

160
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:34,376
start making progress toward
figuring out what they are.

161
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,673
I'll leave you, then, with the task of

162
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:38,608
trying to come up with the necessary and

163
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,649
sufficient conditions for happiness.
