00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:05,887
Hi, I'm Kelley Schiffman.

3
00:00:05,887 --> 00:00:08,128
I'm a PHD student at Yale University,

4
00:00:08,128 --> 00:00:11,384
and today I want to talk[br]about justification.

5
00:00:11,384 --> 00:00:13,647
A large part of thinking critically

6
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,469
involves asking oneself

7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,609
whether one's beliefs and actions

8
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:18,468
are justified or not.

9
00:00:18,467 --> 00:00:21,929
But what is it for a belief or[br]action to be justified?

10
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:24,986
What counts as a justification?

11
00:00:24,986 --> 00:00:26,969
A full answer to this question

12
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:29,648
involves a lot of[br]philosophical complexities.

13
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:31,449
But without going into[br]those, we can at least

14
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:34,180
set out a few useful guidelines.

15
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,568
First of all, examining whether[br]one's beliefs or actions

16
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:39,891
are justified involves stepping back,

17
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,530
reflecting on them, and[br]examining whether they are good,

18
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,689
defensible reasons for taking that action

19
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:47,007
or for holding that belief.

20
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:48,908
Such reasons are drawn[br]from your experience

21
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:52,748
of the world, as well[br]as your other beliefs.

22
00:00:52,747 --> 00:00:54,926
Imagine, for example,[br]that I'm contemplating

23
00:00:54,926 --> 00:00:56,948
going to bed now rather than staying up

24
00:00:56,948 --> 00:00:59,548
for an hour so that I can[br]talk to my mom on the phone

25
00:00:59,548 --> 00:01:01,188
as I promised I would.

26
00:01:01,188 --> 00:01:04,487
I ask myself whether I have[br]good reason to do this.

27
00:01:04,486 --> 00:01:06,227
I recognize that I'm really tired,

28
00:01:06,227 --> 00:01:08,427
and I take that to be a[br]consideration in favor

29
00:01:08,427 --> 00:01:09,908
of going to bed now.

30
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:12,148
But I also recognize that going to bed now

31
00:01:12,147 --> 00:01:15,467
would involve breaking a promise[br]and disappointing my mom,

32
00:01:15,468 --> 00:01:16,770
both of which considerations give me

33
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:19,188
even greater reason to stay up.

34
00:01:19,188 --> 00:01:21,406
I therefore decide that I[br]don't have sufficient reason,

35
00:01:21,406 --> 00:01:24,485
or justification, to go to bed now.

36
00:01:24,486 --> 00:01:27,847
In fact, I have decisive reason[br]to stay up for another hour

37
00:01:27,846 --> 00:01:29,987
and keep my promise.

38
00:01:29,987 --> 00:01:32,427
As second useful thing to bear in mind

39
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:34,929
is that generally when[br]we take someone's belief

40
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,809
or action to be justified,

41
00:01:36,808 --> 00:01:39,367
we do not criticize her[br]for having that belief

42
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:41,066
or for doing that action.

43
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:43,866
Consider, for example, someone[br]who breaks into a house

44
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:46,646
to steal some jewelry,[br]just for the fun of it.

45
00:01:46,646 --> 00:01:48,525
Here, we don't think that the person's joy

46
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,929
justifies their doing this activity,

47
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:54,067
so we do criticize them for doing it.

48
00:01:54,067 --> 00:01:56,405
Contrast this with someone who's lost

49
00:01:56,406 --> 00:01:57,846
in the middle of a snow storm

50
00:01:57,846 --> 00:01:59,387
and needs to break into someone's cabin

51
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:02,147
to get food and warmth[br]for her and her family.

52
00:02:02,147 --> 00:02:03,867
Otherwise they'll die.

53
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:06,088
Here, the action seems justified.

54
00:02:06,087 --> 00:02:09,414
She's got good reason to do that.

55
00:02:09,414 --> 00:02:10,965
We might think that she[br]owes the cabin owner

56
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:13,325
compensation, but we[br]therefore won't criticize her

57
00:02:13,325 --> 00:02:16,953
for doing what she did.

58
00:02:16,953 --> 00:02:18,688
I'll leave you with one final thought

59
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:19,846
regarding the difference between

60
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:22,608
justification and explanation.

61
00:02:22,608 --> 00:02:26,367
Imagine I ask you why you[br]believe in, say, karma.

62
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:29,545
You say, "Well, I believe in it

63
00:02:29,545 --> 00:02:30,927
"because that's what my parents taught me

64
00:02:30,927 --> 00:02:32,265
"to believe in."

65
00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:34,487
Now, that's an explanation[br]for your belief.

66
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,846
That explains why you have it.

67
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:38,907
But that fact doesn't[br]justify your belief in Karma.

68
00:02:38,907 --> 00:02:40,384
It doesn't provide a compelling reason

69
00:02:40,383 --> 00:02:42,205
for believing in it.

70
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:45,025
There are thus two ways[br]to understand my question

71
00:02:45,026 --> 00:02:46,966
"Why do you believe in Karma?"

72
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:49,086
One way of reading it is to think

73
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,987
that I'm asking for an[br]explanation of your belief.

74
00:02:51,986 --> 00:02:53,626
Another way, though, is to read it as

75
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:56,243
asking for a justification for the belief.

76
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,799
It's this latter sense we[br]have in mind mostly

77
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:00,094
when reflecting critically on our beliefs

78
00:03:00,094 --> 00:03:03,574
to see if they're justified or not.

79
