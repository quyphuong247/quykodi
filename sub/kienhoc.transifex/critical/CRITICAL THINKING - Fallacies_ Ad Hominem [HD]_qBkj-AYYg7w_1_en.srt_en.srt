00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,754
(intro music)

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:06,467
Hello. I'm Paul Henne,

3
00:00:06,467 --> 00:00:08,999
and I'm a philosophy graduate
student at Duke University.

4
00:00:08,999 --> 00:00:10,973
And in this video, I'm gonna talk to you

5
00:00:10,973 --> 00:00:13,945
about an informal fallacy
called "ad hominem."

6
00:00:13,945 --> 00:00:17,844
The phrase "ad hominem" might
sound a bit bombastic,

7
00:00:17,844 --> 00:00:20,027
but I assure you that it's an interesting

8
00:00:20,027 --> 00:00:22,047
and useful critical thinking tool.

9
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:24,926
The latin phrase roughly
means "to the person,"

10
00:00:24,926 --> 00:00:27,364
and that's exactly what this fallacy is.

11
00:00:27,364 --> 00:00:30,058
It's an attack against the
person making the argument,

12
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:33,704
rather than an attack
against the argument itself.

13
00:00:33,704 --> 00:00:35,793
But let's see if we can pin down exactly

14
00:00:35,793 --> 00:00:38,463
what this means by using an example.

15
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,262
Suppose that my friend Vlad
made the following argument.

16
00:00:42,262 --> 00:00:45,280
"Cats stay indoors and use a litter box,

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,207
"while dogs need to be walked

18
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:49,018
"and they have to run outside.

19
00:00:49,018 --> 00:00:50,411
"Dogs are just more work.

20
00:00:50,411 --> 00:00:53,777
"Therefore, cats are better
domestic pets than dogs."

21
00:00:53,777 --> 00:00:58,167
And then I reply, "Yeah, Vlad,
but you're a total jerk."

22
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:00,535
So I disregard Vlad's argument

23
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:03,715
in favor of cats and decide to get a dog.

24
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:06,948
So let's think about my
reply to Vlad's argument.

25
00:01:08,117 --> 00:01:10,030
Maybe you think that my reply

26
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:12,655
is a completely good response to Vlad.

27
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,626
Suppose it's true that
Vlad is a total jerk

28
00:01:15,626 --> 00:01:17,878
and that I think no one should respect him

29
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,435
or listen to what he says.

30
00:01:19,435 --> 00:01:21,501
I think Vlad has bad
character in some way.

31
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:24,102
Therefore, his argument should be rejected.

32
00:01:24,102 --> 00:01:25,959
So my response is good, right?

33
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:28,421
If this example doesn't convince you,

34
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,905
suppose that Vlad is really Hitler.

35
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:34,759
Hitler is a total jerk, so
his conclusion is false,

36
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,617
or his argument isn't valid.

37
00:01:36,617 --> 00:01:38,521
Does that sound good?

38
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:41,563
But let's represent my
argument more generally,

39
00:01:41,563 --> 00:01:45,533
to see why this reasoning
is actually flawed.

40
00:01:46,686 --> 00:01:49,941
Premise (1): Person P makes claim C,

41
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:51,752
"cats rule, dogs drool."

42
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:54,677
Premise (2): Person P has unsatisfactory

43
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:56,512
standing or circumstance

44
00:01:56,512 --> 00:01:58,509
("Vlad is a total jerk.")

45
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:02,131
Conclusion: Therefore, claim C is false.

46
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:04,266
(it's false that cats are
better domestic pets.)

47
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:08,747
While it might seem
appealing in some cases

48
00:02:08,747 --> 00:02:11,626
to say that this is a good argument form,

49
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:14,745
it would be generally wrong to think so.

50
00:02:14,745 --> 00:02:16,927
The standing of the
person making the argument

51
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:20,526
in most cases will be
irrelevant to the validity

52
00:02:20,526 --> 00:02:22,639
or the soundness of the argument.

53
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,332
And this is the misconception that I would

54
00:02:25,332 --> 00:02:27,353
like to correct in this video.

55
00:02:27,353 --> 00:02:29,698
Simply because Vlad is a total jerk

56
00:02:29,698 --> 00:02:32,623
doesn't mean that his claim about cats

57
00:02:32,623 --> 00:02:35,502
as better domestic pets is false.

58
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:39,519
He could be a complete jerk,
yet still make a good argument

59
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,049
in favor of cats as domestic pets.

60
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:45,626
So let's look more closely at this fallacy

61
00:02:45,626 --> 00:02:47,831
and at its four sub-types.

62
00:02:47,831 --> 00:02:52,498
The first type of ad hominem
fallacy is the abusive type.

63
00:02:52,498 --> 00:02:55,239
To understand this type, let's
return to our first example

64
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:57,397
where I called Vlad a jerk.

65
00:02:57,397 --> 00:03:00,835
In this case, I've committed
the abusive ad hominem fallacy.

66
00:03:00,835 --> 00:03:03,342
In other words, I've attacked or abused

67
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:05,409
the person making the argument.

68
00:03:05,408 --> 00:03:08,008
I haven't criticized the argument itself.

69
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:10,841
More specifically, I've abused Vlad

70
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:13,141
by simply attacking his character,

71
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,064
and then I equated his poor
character with his argument.

72
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:20,942
This is a fallacy because,
while the speaker, Vlad,

73
00:03:20,942 --> 00:03:23,403
might not have good standing as I see him,

74
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,516
his argument may still be valid,

75
00:03:25,516 --> 00:03:29,463
that is, cats might be
better domestic pets.

76
00:03:31,093 --> 00:03:33,062
Another type of Ad Hominem fallacy

77
00:03:33,062 --> 00:03:35,060
is the circumstantial type.

78
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,379
Let's suppose that, when I'm
talking to my friend Catherine,

79
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:40,377
she makes the following argument.

80
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:44,695
Premise (1): Animals are sentient beings.

81
00:03:44,694 --> 00:03:47,620
Premise (2): If a being is sentient,

82
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:51,127
then killing it for food is immoral.

83
00:03:51,127 --> 00:03:56,127
Conclusion: Therefore, killing
animals for food is immoral.

84
00:03:56,675 --> 00:03:59,973
Suppose then that I make the
following statement in reply:

85
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:04,292
"Yeah, but Catherine, you
work for a vegan food company.

86
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:06,893
"So your argument must be invalid."

87
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:10,538
In this case, I attack
Catherine's circumstance,

88
00:04:10,538 --> 00:04:12,535
that she works for a vegan food company,

89
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:14,578
instead of her argument.

90
00:04:14,578 --> 00:04:17,201
Maybe I thought that she may have

91
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:20,103
a conflict of interest
in making her argument,

92
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:23,192
that is, she wants to sell
more vegan food products.

93
00:04:23,192 --> 00:04:25,329
So she may be motivated to give

94
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:29,299
a faulty argument in favor of veganism.

95
00:04:29,298 --> 00:04:32,224
Despite this potential
conflict of interest,

96
00:04:32,225 --> 00:04:34,500
my reply to her argument does not

97
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,216
effectively criticize her argument.

98
00:04:37,216 --> 00:04:39,538
Although she works for
a vegan food company

99
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:42,022
and may have a conflict of interest,

100
00:04:42,023 --> 00:04:46,063
she may also have a perfectly
valid and sound argument

101
00:04:46,062 --> 00:04:48,060
supporting her conclusion that

102
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,961
killing animals for food is immoral.

103
00:04:50,961 --> 00:04:54,305
If I wanted to effectively
combat her argument,

104
00:04:54,305 --> 00:04:57,811
I could maybe argue that
animals aren't sentient,

105
00:04:57,812 --> 00:05:00,528
or attack some other
premise in her argument.

106
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,427
The third type of ad hominem
fallacy is called "tu quoque,"

107
00:05:05,427 --> 00:05:08,213
which roughly means "you also."

108
00:05:08,213 --> 00:05:10,930
To explore this variation of the fallacy,

109
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,437
let's return to our previous example.

110
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:16,341
But suppose that my reply
to Catherine's argument were

111
00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:19,684
"Yeah, Catherine, but you eat meat.

112
00:05:19,684 --> 00:05:22,494
"So you support the killing
of animals for food.

113
00:05:22,494 --> 00:05:24,584
"Your argument must be invalid."

114
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:28,055
In this case, I highlight
Catherine's standing,

115
00:05:28,055 --> 00:05:30,701
in that she doesn't act in a way

116
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:32,930
that's consistent with her conclusion.

117
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,808
I take her hypocrisy to
invalidate her argument,

118
00:05:36,809 --> 00:05:40,199
or at least to be a reason
to reject her conclusion.

119
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,776
But again, my reply doesn't

120
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,771
effectively critique Catherine's argument.

121
00:05:45,771 --> 00:05:48,836
I've not even mentioned any
problems with the premises

122
00:05:48,836 --> 00:05:51,321
or the conclusion at hand.

123
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:54,409
So despite her purported hypocrisy,

124
00:05:54,408 --> 00:05:56,939
Catherine might have an effective argument

125
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,677
and just think that it's
immoral that she eats meat.

126
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:04,044
The last type of ad hominem fallacy is

127
00:06:04,045 --> 00:06:06,552
the guilt by assocation type.

128
00:06:06,552 --> 00:06:08,363
Let's suppose now that my response

129
00:06:08,363 --> 00:06:10,522
to Catherine's argument is this:

130
00:06:10,523 --> 00:06:13,681
"Yeah, Catherine, but
towards the end of his life,

131
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,118
"Hitler was a vegetarian.

132
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:19,137
"So, you might have made
a similar argument.

133
00:06:19,137 --> 00:06:22,829
"Since we'd reject his argument
simply because he's Hitler,

134
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:24,848
"the most evil person in the world,

135
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:27,356
"we should obviously
reject your argument, too."

136
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:29,818
What have I done in this case?

137
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:32,325
Well, I've associated Catherine

138
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:35,785
with a person of very poor character,

139
00:06:35,785 --> 00:06:37,225
and then I've suggested that

140
00:06:37,225 --> 00:06:40,290
it is a reason to reject
Catherine's argument.

141
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,519
This, however, is fallacious,

142
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:45,189
because while Hitler was a terrible person

143
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:48,045
who committed some of the most
atrocious acts in history,

144
00:06:48,045 --> 00:06:51,689
he still may have made a
valid and sound argument

145
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:54,778
about the morality of eating animals.

146
00:06:54,778 --> 00:06:58,516
Moreover, Catherine's slight
association with Hitler

147
00:06:58,516 --> 00:07:01,372
does not invalidate her argument.

148
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:03,949
And by discussing her character,

149
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:07,920
I have not even addressed
the issue at hand, veganism.

150
00:07:08,858 --> 00:07:11,274
Let's look at the fallacy
in our general schema.

151
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:14,036
The arguments that I've been
making against Catherine

152
00:07:14,036 --> 00:07:15,917
are of the following form.

153
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:17,612
Premise (1): Catherine claimed

154
00:07:17,612 --> 00:07:20,399
that killing animals for food is immoral.

155
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,322
Premise (2): But she has poor
standing or circumstances.

156
00:07:24,322 --> 00:07:27,015
Conclusion: Therefore, it is not the case

157
00:07:27,016 --> 00:07:30,244
that killing animals for food is immoral.

158
00:07:30,244 --> 00:07:33,448
Have I committed an informal
fallacy in these cases?

159
00:07:33,447 --> 00:07:34,329
Yes!

160
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,814
I have not invalidated or even addressed

161
00:07:36,814 --> 00:07:39,391
the subject of Catherine's argument.

162
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:41,180
Rather, I have personally attacked

163
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,852
her standing and character.

164
00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:45,126
This is the ad hominem fallacy,

165
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:47,124
and you will see it often.

166
00:07:47,124 --> 00:07:50,746
It is important to note,
also, that philosophers

167
00:07:50,745 --> 00:07:54,043
have many questions and
concerns about this fallacy

168
00:07:54,043 --> 00:07:56,341
and when a person's standing and character

169
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:58,175
are relevant to an argument.

170
00:07:58,175 --> 00:08:02,377
But we will have to save these
questions for another video.
