00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,410
hello I'm Paul honey and i'm a
philosophy graduate student at Duke

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,299
University and in this video I'm going
to introduce you to formal and informal

3
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:21,810
fallacies first consider the following
arguments premise one if someone is

4
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,948
allergic to peanuts

5
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,939
then she doesn't eat peanut butter
promise to Jane doesn't eat peanut

6
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,720
butter conclusion therefore James
allergic to peanuts

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,110
consider this other argument premise one
a feather is light from is too

8
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,870
what's light cannot be dark conclusion
therefore a feather cannot be dark

9
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,70
these arguments probably seemed a bit
off to you and you're right

10
00:00:47,70 --> 00:00:52,710
each argument contains a fallacy though
each has different kind a fallacy

11
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,660
as we've seen in other wireless velocity
videos is a defect in reasoning this

12
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,660
defect can be unintentional or
intentional

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,570
that is I could simply make a mistake in
my reasoning or I could want to trick

14
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,600
you into believing something by using
deceptive reasoning

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,399
either way it's probably a good idea
that we were able to understand and

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,159
identify distinct fallacy types so that
we can adequately correct any defects in

17
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,990
our reasoning but before we talk about
fallacy types

18
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,869
let's recall what a valid argument is
consider this argument premise one if

19
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:34,350
someone is a philosophy and she
publishes articles in philosophy

20
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,539
tomorrow gambler is a philosopher /
there for tomorrow gambler publishes

21
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,280
articles in philosophy

22
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,450
this is a valid argument actually
although it has no bearing on this

23
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,110
argument validity get lawyers published
over 20 articles

24
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,360
among her other works this form of
argument is called modus ponens and it

25
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:02,369
can be represented as the following
premise 1 if X then Y is 2x conclusion

26
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:09,899
therefore Y and this is a valid argument
form the conclusion necessarily follows

27
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:10,440
from the

28
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,630
mrs. remember though this valid form
does not mean that the premises are true

29
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,250
it would still be a valid argument it to
mark and lower had decided to become a

30
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,660
train conductor for instance instead of
a philosopher / see the videos on

31
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,140
soundness and validity if you have
questions about this

32
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,880
we can also have an invalid argument
form

33
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,339
let's return to our first argument this
argument as you might have suspected

34
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,550
contains a fallacy a formal fallacy and
a formal fallacy is exactly what it

35
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:50,130
sounds like a defect in the form of the
argument in other words there are

36
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:56,820
certain forms of arguments that are
invalid this invalid argument form is a

37
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:02,70
formal fallacy called affirming the
consequent this fallacy is a parent if

38
00:03:02,70 --> 00:03:05,519
you consider that Jane just might not
like peanut butter

39
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,910
so simply because Jane is like peanut
butter

40
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,620
she doesn't eat it given just the fact
that she doesn't eat it and the

41
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,370
conditional on premise one we cannot
conclude that Jane is allergic to peanut

42
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:17,940
butter

43
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,140
this form of fallacy can be represented
in the following way

44
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,500
if X then Y why

45
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:32,190
therefore X and this form of fallacy is
one that you don't want to use this is

46
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,540
actually one of the fallacies frequently
tested on the lsat so if you are

47
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,750
interested and want more practice and
identifying this fallacy

48
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:46,260
check out the video on affirming the
consequent we will talk more about this

49
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,18
and other formal fallacies and upcoming
videos

50
00:03:49,19 --> 00:03:54,720
but for now we need to see that formal
fallacies are fallacies because of the

51
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,140
poor form of the arguments any argument
of these forms will be invalid

52
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,208
so anything can be plugged into these
bad argument forms and the argument

53
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:09,390
would be about for instance if meow

54
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,370
then splat splat therefore meow is
invalid

55
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,640
so now that we have a general
understanding

56
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,260
a formal fallacies what about informal
woods

57
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,260
let's look at our other example from the
beginning of this video

58
00:04:26,70 --> 00:04:31,110
notice that this fallacy arises out of
the content of the argument not out of

59
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,800
the for the form may first plants seem
valid

60
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,349
that is if we ignored the meaning of the
constant consider that we can use a

61
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:46,710
seemingly similar argument form to make
a valid argument for instance premise

62
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,340
one

63
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,510
rain is wet promise - what sweat cannot
be dry

64
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:57,630
conclusion therefore rain cannot be dry
and here we have a valid argument that

65
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:03,180
seems to have a similar form as the
Palacios one and one that lacks defects

66
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:09,90
and its content but the content of are
fallacious argument given to two

67
00:05:09,90 --> 00:05:16,140
meanings of light light weight and like
color yields some problems that is if we

68
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,510
understand the meaning of the terms

69
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,740
the two meanings light for instance we
realize that the argument actually has

70
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,840
an invalid argument form initially
without considering the meaning of the

71
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,619
content

72
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,890
it looks like the form of the argument
is something like all xry what is why

73
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,840
cannot be easy

74
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:44,400
therefore no x RZ but actually given the
shifting meaning of light

75
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,460
the form is more like all x ry

76
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:57,330
what is w cannot be easy therefore no x
RZ this fallacy is called education and

77
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,479
see the video on this if you'd like to
know more about it

78
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:06,360
the only way we can understand this
defect is by examining the content of

79
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,740
the argument if we just looked at the
form without understanding the content

80
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,860
then we could not detect this fallacy

81
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,139
so as we now know informal fallacies
occur because of problems with the

82
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:25,289
content of the arguments so an argument
might have a seemingly valid form but

83
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:29,400
commit an informal fallacy because of a
defect in its content

84
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,679
hence an argument might have true
premises in a seemingly valid form yet

85
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,39
also commits a fallacy to reiterate a
formal fallacy means that the argument

86
00:06:41,39 --> 00:06:45,990
has a defect in its form while an
informal fallacy has a defect in the

87
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,580
arguments content which might also yield
a defective its form

88
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,330
so now that's the difference between
formal and informal fallacies
