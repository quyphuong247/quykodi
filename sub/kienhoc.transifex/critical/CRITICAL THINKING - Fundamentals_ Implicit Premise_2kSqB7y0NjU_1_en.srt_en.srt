Hi, I'm Kelley Schiffman.

3
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:09,219
I'm a PHD student at Yale University,

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,557
and today I'd like to talk[br]about suppressed premises.

5
00:00:12,557 --> 00:00:14,758
So, very often when we present an argument

6
00:00:14,757 --> 00:00:16,718
for a conclusion, we[br]don't explicitly state

7
00:00:16,718 --> 00:00:19,759
all the premises required for[br]getting to the conclusion.

8
00:00:19,759 --> 00:00:22,157
Consider this example:

9
00:00:22,157 --> 00:00:25,297
Premise (1): Mike is a Canadian.

10
00:00:25,297 --> 00:00:28,298
Conclusion: Mike must be polite.

11
00:00:29,117 --> 00:00:31,336
To get from the premise[br]that Mike is a Canadian

12
00:00:31,336 --> 00:00:33,377
to the conclusion[br]that Mike is polite,

13
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:35,118
we need a second premise

14
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:38,076
saying that all Canadians are polite.

15
00:00:38,076 --> 00:00:40,957
Only then is this argument strictly valid.

16
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,597
Only then does the conclusion follow

17
00:00:42,597 --> 00:00:44,556
from the premises.

18
00:00:44,555 --> 00:00:46,538
Now, premise two here, the premise

19
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:48,118
that all Canadians are polite,

20
00:00:48,118 --> 00:00:52,517
is an example of what we[br]call a "suppressed premise."

21
00:00:52,517 --> 00:00:55,464
Consider this other example.

22
00:00:55,463 --> 00:00:57,954
Premise (1): Smoking[br]will damage your health.

23
00:00:57,954 --> 00:01:01,018
Conclusion: So, you shouldn't do it.

24
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:03,236
Here, the suppressed premise is the claim

25
00:01:03,235 --> 00:01:06,256
that you shouldn't do things[br]that damage your health.

26
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:09,697
Now, notice that in both of these cases,

27
00:01:09,697 --> 00:01:11,456
even though these suppressed premises

28
00:01:11,456 --> 00:01:13,637
are required for the argument to be valid,

29
00:01:13,638 --> 00:01:15,557
it seems nonetheless acceptable

30
00:01:15,557 --> 00:01:18,496
to leave them only implicit,

31
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:20,697
to not state them explicitly.

32
00:01:20,697 --> 00:01:22,936
But why is this?

33
00:01:22,936 --> 00:01:24,914
I would suggest the following:

34
00:01:24,915 --> 00:01:27,678
that it's okay to keep[br]a premise suppressed

35
00:01:27,677 --> 00:01:29,716
if two conditions are met.

36
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:33,795
First, that the premise[br]is uncontroversial.

37
00:01:33,795 --> 00:01:36,615
And second, that it's[br]obvious to the person

38
00:01:36,615 --> 00:01:39,096
being presented with the argument.

39
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:40,576
If both of these conditions are met,

40
00:01:40,575 --> 00:01:44,990
then it seems acceptable to[br]keep the premise suppressed.

41
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,036
Sometimes, however, a premise[br]will be left implicit,

42
00:01:48,036 --> 00:01:49,495
it will be left suppressed,[br]even if it fails

43
00:01:49,495 --> 00:01:51,775
to meet these conditions.

44
00:01:51,775 --> 00:01:54,077
Now, sometimes this is[br]done unintentionally.

45
00:01:54,076 --> 00:01:55,876
Other times it's done in order

46
00:01:55,876 --> 00:01:57,137
to make the argument appear

47
00:01:57,137 --> 00:01:59,216
more persuasive than it really is.

48
00:01:59,216 --> 00:02:00,876
Regardless, that's why it's important

49
00:02:00,876 --> 00:02:02,375
to be sensitive to the possibility

50
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,835
of suppressed premises,

51
00:02:03,835 --> 00:02:06,594
and to develop a habit[br]for identifying them.

52
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:08,574
Consider the following argument.

53
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:12,031
Premise (1): Killing an[br]innocent person is wrong.

54
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:15,776
Conclusion: Therefore, abortion is wrong.

55
00:02:15,776 --> 00:02:18,036
The suppressed premise[br]here is something like

56
00:02:18,036 --> 00:02:21,914
"To have an abortion is to[br]kill an innocent person."

57
00:02:21,914 --> 00:02:23,812
That's the suppressed premise.

58
00:02:23,812 --> 00:02:25,834
Now, regardless of whether this premise

59
00:02:25,835 --> 00:02:29,474
is true or false, it certainly[br]isn't uncontroversial.

60
00:02:29,474 --> 00:02:31,354
It doesn't meet condition one.

61
00:02:31,354 --> 00:02:32,736
Nor can one count on others

62
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,794
taking this premise to be obvious.

63
00:02:34,794 --> 00:02:36,794
It doesn't meet condition two.

64
00:02:36,794 --> 00:02:38,914
It's therefore a premise[br]that should be made

65
00:02:38,914 --> 00:02:40,634
explicit and critically reflected upon

66
00:02:40,634 --> 00:02:44,307
when assessing the[br]strength of the argument.

67
00:02:44,307 --> 00:02:45,455
It's in cases like this

68
00:02:45,455 --> 00:02:47,713
where sensitivity to suppressed premises

69
00:02:47,713 --> 00:02:50,574
is truly important.

70
