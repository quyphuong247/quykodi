00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,855
(intro music)

2
00:00:05,855 --> 00:00:07,370
My name is Laurie Santos.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,370
I teach psychology at Yale
University, and today

4
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:12,548
I want to talk to you about anchoring.

5
00:00:12,548 --> 00:00:16,118
This lecture is part of a
series on cognitive biases.

6
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:19,428
Let's do a math problem.
really quickly, and you've

7
00:00:19,428 --> 00:00:20,759
gotta do it in your head

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,649
Ready?

9
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:27,528
First, multiply the following numbers:
eight times seven times six

10
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:32,460
times five times four times three times
two times one.

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,250
OK, that's it.

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,840
What's your guess?

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,840
A thousand?

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,820
Two thousand?

15
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,030
When the psychologists Danny Kahneman
and Amos Tversky tried this with

16
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,390
human subjects, subjects on average

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,990
guessed about two thousand
two hundred and fifty.

18
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,379
Seems like an OK guess.

19
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:53,108
But now, let's suppose I gave you
a different math problem.

20
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:54,649
What if I gave you this one?

21
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:56,049
Ready?

22
00:00:56,049 --> 00:01:00,029
One times two times three times four

23
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,769
times five times six times
seven times eight.

24
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,310
What's your answer?

25
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,150
If you're like Kahneman and Tversky's

26
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,040
subjects, your answer might
be a bit different here.

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,880
For this question, their subjects
guessed a lot lower.

28
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:17,449
On average they said the answer
was about five hundred and twelve.

29
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,509
The first amazing thing
about these similar

30
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:23,620
mathematical estimates is that people get
the answers really, really wrong.

31
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,219
In fact, the real answer?

32
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:29,338
Well, for both, its forty thousand
three hundred and twenty.

33
00:01:29,338 --> 00:01:31,938
People are off by an order of magnitude.

34
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:35,258
But the second, even more amazing 
thing is that people give

35
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:39,599
different answers to the two problems,
even though they're just different ways

36
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,019
of asking exactly the same question.

37
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,060
Why do we give completely different answers,

38
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,079
when the same math problem
is presented differently?

39
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:49,500
The answer lies in how we make estimates.

40
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,590
When you have lots of time to do a math

41
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,810
problem, like eight times seven times six
times five times four times three times

42
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,558
two times one, you can multiply all of

43
00:01:58,558 --> 00:02:01,138
the numbers together and get an exact product.

44
00:02:01,138 --> 00:02:02,718
But when you have to do the problem

45
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:05,278
quickly, you don't really have time to finish.

46
00:02:05,278 --> 00:02:07,308
So you start with the first numbers.

47
00:02:07,308 --> 00:02:10,187
You multiply eight times
seven, and get fifty-six.

48
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:12,699
And then you've gotta
multiply that by six,

49
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:16,669
and, well, you're guessing the final
number's gotta be pretty big, bigger than

50
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,659
fifty-six, like maybe two thousand or so.

51
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:22,449
But when you do the second problem, you start

52
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:26,879
with one times two, and, well, that's only
two, and two times three's only six.

53
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,530
Your answer's gonna be pretty small,

54
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,310
maybe only like five hundred or so.

55
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,780
This process of guessing based on the first

56
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,110
number you see is what's
known as "anchoring."

57
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,680
The first number we think of

58
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,730
when we do our estimate is the anchor.

59
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:41,829
And once we have an anchor in our head,

60
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,730
well, we sort of adjust
as needed from there.

61
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:48,750
The problem is that our minds are biased
not to adjust as much as we need to.

62
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,580
The anchors are cognitively really strong.

63
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,530
In the first, problem you probably
started with fifty-six, and

64
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,719
then adjusted to an even
bigger number from there.

65
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,998
And in the second problem, you started
with six, and then adjusted from there.

66
00:03:00,998 --> 00:03:05,848
The problem is that starting at different
points leads to different final guesses.

67
00:03:05,848 --> 00:03:10,969
Like real anchors, our estimated anchors
kinda get us stuck in one spot.

68
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:14,709
We often fail to drag the anchor far
enough to get to a correct answer.

69
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:17,709
Kahneman and Tversky discovered that this

70
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:19,889
sort of anchoring bias happens all the time,

71
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:22,480
even for anchors that are totally arbitrary.

72
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,479
For example, they asked
people to spin a wheel with

73
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:28,319
numbers from one to a hundred,
and then asked them to estimate

74
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,739
what percentage of countries in
the United Nations are African.

75
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,739
People who spun a ten on
the wheel estimated that

76
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,769
the number was about twenty-five percent.

77
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:39,769
But people who spun a
sixty-five estimated that

78
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:41,650
the number was forty-five percent.

79
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,340
In another experiment, Dan Ariely
and his colleagues had people

80
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,300
write down the last two digits
of their social security number.

81
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,770
They were then asked whether they would

82
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,118
pay that amount in dollars
for a nice bottle of wine.

83
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:58,250
Ariely and colleagues found that people
in the highest quintile of social security

84
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,799
numbers would pay three to four times
as much for the exact same good.

85
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,938
Just setting up a larger anchor can make a

86
00:04:04,938 --> 00:04:07,098
person who would pay eight
dollars for the bottle

87
00:04:07,098 --> 00:04:10,649
of wine be willing to spend
twenty-seven dollars instead.

88
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:14,618
Sadly for us, sales people use
anchors against us all the time.

89
00:04:14,618 --> 00:04:18,399
How many times have you noticed
a salesperson or an advertisement

90
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,100
anchoring you to a particular price, or

91
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,890
even to how much of a particular
product you should buy?

92
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,430
Whether it's buying a car, or a sweater,

93
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,269
or even renting a hotel room, our
intuitions about what prices

94
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:34,509
are reasonable to pay often come
from some arbitrary anchor.

95
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:38,490
So, the next time you're given an
anchor, take a minute to think.

96
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,139
Remember what happens when you

97
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,300
drop your anger too high, and then

98
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,329
consider thinking of a
very different number.

99
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:49,128
It might affect your final estimate
more than you expect.
