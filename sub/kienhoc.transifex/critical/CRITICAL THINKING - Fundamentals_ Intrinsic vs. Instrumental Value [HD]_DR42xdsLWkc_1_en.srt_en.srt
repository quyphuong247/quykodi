00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,540
Hi, I'm Kelley Schiffman.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,199
I'm a PhD student at Yale University,

4
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:10,919
and today I want to talk about instrumental

5
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:12,439
and intrinsic value.

6
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:15,080
So philosophers like to distinguish between

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,160
two ways in which something can have value, or worth.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,660
Something has intrinsic value

9
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,359
when we value it simply for its own sake.

10
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:25,239
For example, friendship or love,

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,899
wisdom, pleasure, beauty, or health.

12
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:31,059
Take friendship, for example.

13
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:31,977
Now it's true that friendship

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,880
is, in part, valuable because of other things

15
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,120
it brings about.

16
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:37,000
People with established friendships tend,

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,490
for example, to live longer and be happier.

18
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,859
But we don't value friendship

19
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:43,738
merely because it has these good results.

20
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,620
We think friendship is important or valuable

21
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:47,557
in and of itself, independently

22
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,719
of any good results it brings about.

23
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:50,798
We therefore think that friendship

24
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:53,299
is intrinsically valuable.

25
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:56,689
Something, in contrast, has instrumental value

26
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,320
when we value it not for its own sake,

27
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,511
but rather because it helps us

28
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,854
to get something else that we do value

29
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:04,358
for its own sake.

30
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:06,540
In other words, something has instrumental value

31
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,698
when it serves as a means to some end

32
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,359
that we value in and of itself.

33
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:15,679
Money, for example, has mere instrumental value.

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,360
No one wants money just for the sake

35
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,737
of having money, I suppose unless you're a coin collector.

36
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:22,179
Rather, people want money

37
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,433
because money lets you buy certain things

38
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:26,620
that you do value for their own sake.

39
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,320
For example, you can use money

40
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:30,595
to buy vitamins or medicine

41
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,155
that contribute to your health,

42
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,534
where health is an intrinsic good.

43
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,276
Now, it's important to note that many things

44
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,060
have both instrumental and intrinsic value.

45
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,012
As we've noted already,

46
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:41,819
friendship is such a case.

47
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:43,537
So, too, is health.

48
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,560
Health is good in and of itself,

49
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,040
but it also lets you attain

50
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,013
or achieve many other things.

51
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:51,799
It's, therefore, also an instrumental good.

52
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,914
Now, it's important to distinguish

53
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,480
between instrumental and intrinsic value,

54
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,395
because it helps you live better.

55
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,380
Many people spend their lives

56
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:01,655
pursuing, for example, money,

57
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:04,299
thinking that somehow it's intrinsically valuable,

58
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:05,890
it's good in and of itself,

59
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,490
when really, if they reflected,

60
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,759
they'd see that no, it's just good because it helps you to get other things,

61
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,179
and then you could reprioritize accordingly.

62
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,280
So this distinction between instrumental

63
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,612
and intrinsic value is not only philosophically interesting,

64
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,637
but practically important.
