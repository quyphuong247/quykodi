00:00:04,408 --> 00:00:07,903
Hi! I'm Jeff Pynn, and I teach philosophy[br]at Northern Illinois University.

2
00:00:07,902 --> 00:00:11,708
In my earlier Introduction to Critical[br]Thinking video, I described the difference

3
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:14,288
between deductive arguments and ampliative[br]arguments.

4
00:00:15,053 --> 00:00:18,647
In the next few videos, I'll talk a bit[br]more about each type of argument.

5
00:00:18,748 --> 00:00:20,617
Let's start with deductive arguments.

6
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:24,981
An argument is a set of statements, called[br]its premises, that are meant to give you

7
00:00:24,981 --> 00:00:28,818
a reason to believe some further statement[br]called the argument's conclusion.

8
00:00:29,323 --> 00:00:33,703
In some arguments, the premises are meant[br]to guarantee that the conclusion is true.

9
00:00:33,723 --> 00:00:36,571
Arguments like this are called deductive[br]arguments.

10
00:00:36,572 --> 00:00:39,499
A good deductive argument can give you a[br]very good reason

11
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:41,408
for believing its conclusion.

12
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:44,589
After all, it guarantees that its [br]conclusion is true.

13
00:00:45,103 --> 00:00:49,094
But not all deductive arguments are good,[br]and so there are several things to think

14
00:00:49,094 --> 00:00:52,926
about when deciding whether to believe the[br]conclusion of a deductive argument.

15
00:00:53,682 --> 00:00:56,731
A good deductive argument really does[br]guarantee its conclusion.

16
00:00:56,731 --> 00:01:00,274
Part of what this means is that its[br]impossible for the premises to be true

17
00:01:00,274 --> 00:01:01,844
while the conclusion is false.

18
00:01:02,393 --> 00:01:05,221
When this is the case, we say that the[br]argument is valid.

19
00:01:05,602 --> 00:01:08,432
Now this is a special, technical use of[br]the word "valid."

20
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:14,412
In ordinary life, we often use this word[br]to mean something like good, cogent, or

21
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:15,855
reasonable.

22
00:01:15,855 --> 00:01:19,549
Like if you're disagreeing with someone[br]about something, and they respond to a

23
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:22,890
claim you make by saying something that[br]seems pretty reasonable to you,

24
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,007
you might say, "Well, I guess you have[br]a valid point."

25
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:29,036
Though that's what the word often means[br]in ordinary life,

26
00:01:29,224 --> 00:01:31,371
it's not what the word means here.

27
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,292
When philosophers say that an argument is[br]valid, they always mean this very

28
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:39,828
specific thing: that if the premises are[br]true, the conclusion must also be true.

29
00:01:39,992 --> 00:01:43,635
There are several other Wi-Phi videos that[br]discuss this notion of validity

30
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,192
in more detail.

31
00:01:45,236 --> 00:01:49,171
To say that an argument is valid is to say[br]something about the relationship between

32
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:50,757
the premises and the conclusion.

33
00:01:50,757 --> 00:01:54,136
Namely, that if the premises are true, the[br]conclusion must also be true.

34
00:01:54,135 --> 00:01:57,144
But it's not to say that its premises or[br]conclusion are true.

35
00:01:57,206 --> 00:01:59,036
Consider, for example, this argument.

36
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:01,838
Premise 1: Beyonce was born in Paris.

37
00:02:02,382 --> 00:02:06,525
Premise 2: Everybody who was born in Paris[br]loves cheese.

38
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:09,810
Conclusion: Therefore, Beyonce loves[br]cheese.

39
00:02:10,056 --> 00:02:14,976
Those premises are false. Beyonce was born[br]in Houston, and I'm willing to bet that at

40
00:02:15,206 --> 00:02:17,477
least some people born in Paris hate[br]cheese.

41
00:02:17,545 --> 00:02:19,703
Still, it's a valid argument.

42
00:02:19,963 --> 00:02:23,265
If the premises were true, then the[br]conclusion would have to be true.

43
00:02:23,592 --> 00:02:27,631
But because the premises are false, this[br]argument doesn't give you a good reason to

44
00:02:27,673 --> 00:02:30,307
believe its conclusion, even though it's[br]valid.

45
00:02:30,596 --> 00:02:33,558
Philosophers call a valid argument with[br]true premises "sound."

46
00:02:33,701 --> 00:02:37,674
Like the word "valid," the word "sound" is[br]term with various meanings in ordinary

47
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:41,520
life, and it can be used to describe some[br]claim as reasonable or compelling.

48
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:45,723
But when philosophers describe an argument[br]as sound, they always mean this very

49
00:02:45,723 --> 00:02:50,807
specific thing: that it's valid, and that[br]its premises are in fact true.

50
00:02:50,968 --> 00:02:53,793
Here's a pretty boring sound argument.

51
00:02:54,016 --> 00:02:56,073
Premise 1: Beyonce was born in Houston.

52
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:59,258
Premise 2: Everybody who was born in[br]Houston was born in Texas.

53
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,992
Conclusion: Therefore, Beyonce was born in[br]Texas.

54
00:03:03,242 --> 00:03:05,876
For more discussion of the concept of a[br]sound argument,

55
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:09,417
see Aaron Ancell's Wi-Phi video entitled[br]"Soundness."

56
00:03:09,674 --> 00:03:13,336
So, before deciding whether to believe the[br]conclusion of a deductive argument,

57
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:15,821
you need to determine whether the argument[br]is sound.

58
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:19,255
And this, in turn, requires determining[br]whether the argument is valid,

59
00:03:19,254 --> 00:03:21,977
and whether its premises are true.

60
00:03:21,997 --> 00:03:24,438
Well, how do you tell whether an argument[br]is valid?

61
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:27,834
Sometimes, it's just obvious. But often,[br]it's not so obvious.

62
00:03:28,117 --> 00:03:30,526
One way to figure out whether an argument[br]is valid

63
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:33,031
is to see if you can think of a[br]counterexample to it.

64
00:03:33,032 --> 00:03:35,826
A counterexample is a case, either real or[br]imaginary,

65
00:03:36,046 --> 00:03:39,709
where the argument's premises are true,[br]but the conclusion is false.

66
00:03:39,937 --> 00:03:42,283
So, for example, consider this argument.

67
00:03:42,475 --> 00:03:45,623
Premise 1: Classical musicians appreciate[br]opera.

68
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,734
Premise 2: Beyonce is a pop star, not a[br]classical musician.

69
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:54,688
Conclusion: Therefore, Beyonce doesn't[br]appreciate opera.

70
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:59,574
Now, suppose that Beyonce's been listening[br]to opera since she was a little girl,

71
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,303
and loves Mozart's Don Giovanni.

72
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,531
Well, then she'd appreciate opera.

73
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:08,639
The conclusion would be false, even though[br]the premises would still be true.

74
00:04:08,894 --> 00:04:12,079
It would still be true that classical[br]musicians appreciate opera,

75
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:15,580
and that Beyonce is a pop star, not a[br]classical musician.

76
00:04:15,836 --> 00:04:19,365
This counterexample shows that the[br]argument isn't valid,

77
00:04:19,682 --> 00:04:23,800
and so that even if premises are true, the[br]argument doesn't provide you with a reason

78
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,250
to believe its conclusion.

79
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,115
There are other, more formal techniques[br]for figuring out whether an argument is

80
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,254
valid, which we'll hopefully be able to[br]discuss in future videos.

81
00:04:32,254 --> 00:04:35,469
Now, if you don't know whether the[br]premises of an argument are true,

82
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,205
then even if the argument really is sound,[br]it doesn't give you a good reason to

83
00:04:39,204 --> 00:04:40,742
believe its conclusion.

84
00:04:40,742 --> 00:04:44,504
When you know that an argument is valid,[br]but you don't know whether its premises

85
00:04:44,504 --> 00:04:47,461
are true, the argument gives you, at best,[br]a conditional reason

86
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:48,706
to accept its conclusion.

87
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,562
If you learn that its premises are true,[br]then you'll have to accept its conclusion.

88
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:56,588
So, how do you tell whether an argument's[br]premises are true?

89
00:04:56,781 --> 00:05:00,926
Well, this isn't the kind of thing logic[br]or philosophy can give you much help with.

90
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,955
To figure out whether an argument's[br]premises are true,

91
00:05:04,177 --> 00:05:06,165
you need to do some research.

92
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,507
This is one reason why being a good[br]critical thinker requires more

93
00:05:09,507 --> 00:05:10,891
than just logical ability.

94
00:05:11,146 --> 00:05:14,038
It also takes a lot of real world,[br]empirical knowledge.

95
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:19,055
Unless you know enough to know whether an[br]argument's premises are true, then even if

96
00:05:19,245 --> 00:05:22,687
you're a really brilliant logician and[br]know that the argument is valid,

97
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:25,834
it doesn't give you reason to believe its[br]conclusion.

98
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:30,653
The more you know, the better you'll be[br]able to evaluate deductive arguments.

99
