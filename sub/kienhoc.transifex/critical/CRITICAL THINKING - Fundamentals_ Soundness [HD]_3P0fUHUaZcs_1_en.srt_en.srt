Hi, I'm Aaron Ancell.

3
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:10,298
I'm a graduate student at Duke University,

4
00:00:10,298 --> 00:00:13,397
and in this video I'm going
to tell you about soundness,

5
00:00:13,397 --> 00:00:14,964
an important notion
that philosophers use

6
00:00:14,964 --> 00:00:17,460
to evaluate arguments.

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,817
Let's start by looking back at validity.

8
00:00:19,817 --> 00:00:22,301
You should already know
what a valid argument is.

9
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:25,762
If you don't, I encourage you
to watch the video on validity

10
00:00:25,762 --> 00:00:29,545
before watching the rest of this video.

11
00:00:29,545 --> 00:00:31,739
As you learned in the video on validity,

12
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:33,725
an argument is valid if it is impossible

13
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:35,745
for all of the premises to be true

14
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,765
while its conclusion is false.

15
00:00:37,765 --> 00:00:42,026
For example, the following
is a valid argument.

16
00:00:42,026 --> 00:00:45,718
Premise (1): All cats are purple.

17
00:00:45,718 --> 00:00:50,718
Premise (2): Everything
that is purple is a person.

18
00:00:50,826 --> 00:00:54,945
Conclusion: Therefore,
all cats are people.

19
00:00:55,945 --> 00:00:58,243
This argument is valid,
because it is impossible

20
00:00:58,243 --> 00:01:02,225
for the premises to be true
while the conclusion is false.

21
00:01:02,225 --> 00:01:06,753
If all cats were purple, and
all purple things were people,

22
00:01:06,753 --> 00:01:09,724
then all cats would be people.

23
00:01:09,724 --> 00:01:12,231
Of course, not all cats are purple,

24
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:14,287
and not all purple things are people.

25
00:01:14,287 --> 00:01:16,343
So even though this argument is valid,

26
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:18,409
it's not really informative.

27
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:20,847
It does not establish the
truth of its conclusion,

28
00:01:20,846 --> 00:01:23,491
since the premises are obviously false.

29
00:01:24,364 --> 00:01:26,512
Since the goal of an
argument is usually to show

30
00:01:26,512 --> 00:01:29,322
that some conclusion is true,

31
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:32,730
we usually want arguments
that are more than just valid.

32
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:36,107
This is where the notion
of soundness comes in.

33
00:01:36,462 --> 00:01:39,957
Soundness is a technical
notion in philosophy.

34
00:01:39,957 --> 00:01:42,313
What philosophers mean by "sound"

35
00:01:42,313 --> 00:01:45,416
is a bit different than
what people ordinarily mean

36
00:01:45,417 --> 00:01:48,519
when they say things like
"that was sound advice,"

37
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,984
or "she demonstrated sound judgement

38
00:01:50,984 --> 00:01:53,573
in making that decision."

39
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:56,557
In philosophy, soundness, like validity,

40
00:01:56,558 --> 00:01:58,990
applies only to deductive arguments.

41
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:00,957
In order to be sound, an argument

42
00:02:00,957 --> 00:02:03,013
must meet two requirements.

43
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:06,193
First, the argument must be valid.

44
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:09,652
All invalid arguments are unsound.

45
00:02:09,652 --> 00:02:13,727
Second, the premises of the
argument must all be true.

46
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:16,491
Any argument that has even
a single false premise

47
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:18,453
is unsound.

48
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:21,901
To be sound, an argument
must meet both requirements.

49
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:25,175
Let's go back to the example
with the purple cats.

50
00:02:25,175 --> 00:02:28,576
Is this argument sound? Let's check.

51
00:02:28,576 --> 00:02:31,816
The argument is valid, so it
meets the first requirement.

52
00:02:31,816 --> 00:02:34,439
But it definitely does not
meet the second requirement,

53
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:36,633
since not all of its premises are true.

54
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:40,012
In fact, both the premises are false.

55
00:02:40,012 --> 00:02:43,054
But not every unsound
argument has false premises.

56
00:02:43,054 --> 00:02:44,842
Consider another example.

57
00:02:44,842 --> 00:02:48,754
Premise (1): All dead parrots are dead.

58
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:52,632
Premise (2): Parrots are not frogs.

59
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:56,961
Conclusion: Therefore, frogs exist.

60
00:02:56,961 --> 00:02:59,039
Both premises of this argument are true,

61
00:02:59,038 --> 00:03:01,280
so this argument satisfies
the second requirement

62
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,871
for being a sound argument.

63
00:03:02,871 --> 00:03:05,616
However, it doesn't satisfy
the first requirement,

64
00:03:05,616 --> 00:03:08,181
because the argument is invalid.

65
00:03:08,181 --> 00:03:10,561
The conclusion does not
follow from the premises.

66
00:03:10,561 --> 00:03:12,280
So this is an unsound argument,

67
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,693
even though all the premises are true.

68
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:16,737
Note that the conclusion is also true.

69
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:17,737
But that doesn't matter.

70
00:03:17,737 --> 00:03:20,526
It's still an unsound argument.

71
00:03:20,526 --> 00:03:22,325
Here's another example.

72
00:03:22,325 --> 00:03:25,866
Premise (1): Ostriches cannot fly.

73
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:30,221
Premise (2): All insects wear top hats.

74
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:34,563
Conclusion: Therefore,
ostriches are insects.

75
00:03:34,562 --> 00:03:37,139
This argument fails to
meet both requirements.

76
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:40,239
It isn't valid, and the
second premise is false.

77
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,246
So this argument is definitely unsound.

78
00:03:43,246 --> 00:03:45,568
"Now," you might ask, "why should I care

79
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:47,507
"whether an argument is sound?"

80
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:50,397
The reason is that if we know
that an argument is sound,

81
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,545
then we know that the
conclusion of that argument

82
00:03:52,545 --> 00:03:54,182
must be true.

83
00:03:54,182 --> 00:03:55,929
There is no way that an argument can meet

84
00:03:55,929 --> 00:03:57,890
both requirements for soundness

85
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,037
and have a false conclusion.

86
00:04:00,038 --> 00:04:01,652
To meet the first requirement,

87
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:03,335
an argument must be valid.

88
00:04:03,336 --> 00:04:05,530
And by definition, a valid argument

89
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,932
is one where the
conclusion cannot be false

90
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:10,289
if the premises are true.

91
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:12,054
And to meet the second requirement,

92
00:04:12,054 --> 00:04:15,350
the premises of the
argument must all be true.

93
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,788
Putting the requirements
for soundness together,

94
00:04:17,788 --> 00:04:19,611
we can say that a sound argument

95
00:04:19,612 --> 00:04:22,095
is one where the
conclusion cannot be false

96
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,850
if the premises are true,

97
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,148
and where the premises are all true.

98
00:04:26,148 --> 00:04:29,647
This shows that the conclusion of
a sound argument cannot be false.

99
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:31,290
It has to be true.

100
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:33,997
Sound arguments are very useful.

101
00:04:33,997 --> 00:04:36,935
They enable us to establish
that things are true.

102
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:39,512
Let's finish off by looking at an example.

103
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:42,889
Premise (1): Whales do not have fur.

104
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:45,908
Premise (2): Whales are mammals.

105
00:04:45,908 --> 00:04:49,656
Conclusion: Therefore,
not all mammals have fur.

106
00:04:50,762 --> 00:04:52,490
This argument is valid.

107
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,012
If the premises are true,

108
00:04:54,012 --> 00:04:56,415
then the conclusion must also be true.

109
00:04:56,415 --> 00:04:59,759
And the premises are true,
so this is a sound argument,

110
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,910
and the conclusion must be true.

111
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,415
Give it a try.

112
00:05:03,415 --> 00:05:06,394
See if you can write a
sound argument of your own.
