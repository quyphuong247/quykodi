00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:08,050
Hi! My name is Laurie Santos.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,050
I teach psychology at Yale
University, and today

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,559
I want to talk to you about aliefs.

5
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:17,068
This lecture is part of a
series on cognitive biases.

6
00:00:17,068 --> 00:00:20,528
Imagine that you're visiting the Grand
Canyon, and you decide to take a

7
00:00:20,528 --> 00:00:23,009
walk on their skywalk, a huge glass bridge

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,690
suspended above the raging
waters of the Colorado River.

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,810
Now imagine that you head out to the
middle of the skywalk and look down.

10
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:37,009
You see your feet resting on the clear
glass, standing four thousand feet up.

11
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:38,329
How do you think you would feel?

12
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,920
If you're like most people, you
might feel pretty terrified.

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,539
Your heart would be faster, your
palms would get sweaty,

14
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:47,500
you might grip on the railing
just a little bit tighter.

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,619
But the fact that you feel
this scared is pretty weird.

16
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:52,989
After all, the Skywalk is perfectly safe.

17
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,090
It's bolted in place with
hundreds of steel girders.

18
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,520
It's exactly as strong as it would be if
it were made with an opaque floor,

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,520
and even stronger than it would be if it

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,140
were only four hundred, or forty,
or even four feet in the air.

21
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,549
It's basically as solid as anything you
have ever set foot on before.

22
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:12,539
You also have lots of data
showing how safe it is.

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,160
Thousands of visitors walk along
the skywalk every single year,

24
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,989
and not a single one of
them has fallen through.

25
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:21,838
It's safer than crossing the
street, or riding in a car,

26
00:01:21,838 --> 00:01:24,179
or even standing on a regular balcony.

27
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:26,269
So why do you get so scared?

28
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:27,408
What's going on?

29
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:30,409
The disconnect between your
belief that the skywalk is

30
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:32,200
perfectly safe and your sense that you

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,049
might to your death shows the power
of what are known as "aliefs."

32
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:39,869
Aliefs are automatic or habitual
belief-like attitudes.

33
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,930
They're the way we instinctively respond
to stuff, stuff that we instinctively like

34
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,249
or dislike, or even stuff there
we're just really used to.

35
00:01:47,248 --> 00:01:50,358
The term "alief" was coined by the
philosopher Tamar Gendler.

36
00:01:50,358 --> 00:01:52,628
She decided to use the word "alief"

37
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:58,159
because aliefs are kinda like beliefs,
except they're affective and associative

38
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,250
and automatic and arrational.

39
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,879
So she called them "aliefs."

40
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:06,170
When you're standing on the skywalk,
you believe that you're perfectly safe.

41
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,110
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have stepped out there.

42
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,160
But you also simultaneously alieve that

43
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:14,118
you're at risk for falling,
hence the sweaty palms.

44
00:02:14,118 --> 00:02:16,378
And that's the interesting
thing about aliefs.

45
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:20,340
They don't necessarily track what
we actually believe to be true,

46
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,520
like the fact that you'll be perfectly
safe on the skywalk.

47
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,760
The problem is that even we realize our

48
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,709
aliefs don't reflect reality,
that they don't match

49
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,320
what we believe to be true, that they're

50
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,819
perfectly arrational, our
aliefs don't just go away.

51
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:37,560
They stick around and guide many
many of our behaviours anyway.

52
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,030
It's this stickiness of aliefs
that make them so strange.

53
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,080
That's the reason we get scared
at horror movies like Jaws,

54
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,780
even though we know that the shark in
the movie is just a bunch of plastic.

55
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,620
And as the psychologist Paul Rozin
famously showed, that's why we wouldn't

56
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,650
want to eat a yummy piece of
chocolate that shaped like this.

57
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,000
And as the cognitive scientist
Fiery Cushman showed,

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,169
that's why you don't like 
using a hammer to do this,

59
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:05,239
even when you know the
hand is just plastic.

60
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,310
But aliefs are also at work
in more serious cases.

61
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,900
If you've lived in a society structured
by a legacy of racial bias,

62
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,810
you may believe that African-Americans
and Caucasians are equal,

63
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,870
but you're aliefs may reflect a whole
host of implicit racial biases.

64
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,269
If you have lived in a society where men
tend to be doctors and women tend to be

65
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:26,689
nurses, you may believe that women are

66
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:31,209
just as good as men at science,
but your aliefs might be different.

67
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:34,389
And, as many psychologists
have recently shown, those

68
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:36,730
biased aliefs may play a bigger role in

69
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:39,509
your hiring decisions more
than you might think.

70
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:43,219
So next time you hesitate to
touch a plastic spider, or

71
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:48,549
cry at a sad but fictional movie, or even
notice some of your mistaken biases,

72
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:51,740
you'll know that these are your
powerful aliefs at work.
