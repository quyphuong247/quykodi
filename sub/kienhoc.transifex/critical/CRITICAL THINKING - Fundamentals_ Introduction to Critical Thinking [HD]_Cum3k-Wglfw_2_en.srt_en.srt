1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,170
(intro music)

2
00:00:04,325 --> 00:00:05,578
I'm Geoff Pynn. I teach at

3
00:00:05,578 --> 00:00:07,304
Northern Illinois University,

4
00:00:07,304 --> 00:00:10,864
and this is an introduction[br]to critical thinking.

5
00:00:10,864 --> 00:00:13,728
In this lesson, we're gonna[br]talk about three things.

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,317
First, what is critical thinking?

7
00:00:18,317 --> 00:00:21,321
Second, what is an argument?

8
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,140
And third, what's the difference between

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,964
deductive and ampliative arguments?

10
00:00:27,286 --> 00:00:29,308
Okay, so what is critical thinking?

11
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:31,147
Well, fundamentally, critical thinking

12
00:00:31,147 --> 00:00:32,698
is about making sure that you have

13
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:34,975
good reasons for your beliefs.

14
00:00:34,975 --> 00:00:36,460
What does that mean?

15
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,140
So suppose that you and your friend

16
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,418
are talking about who's[br]gonna be at tonight's party.

17
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:43,619
And she says to you, quite confidently,

18
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:45,957
"Monty won't be at the party."

19
00:00:45,957 --> 00:00:47,691
You're not sure whether[br]or not to believe her,

20
00:00:47,691 --> 00:00:49,176
so it would be natural[br]for you to follow up

21
00:00:49,176 --> 00:00:52,326
by asking, "Why do you think so?"

22
00:00:52,326 --> 00:00:53,450
And there are a lot of different things

23
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,269
that she might say in response.

24
00:00:55,268 --> 00:00:56,428
We're gonna talk about three

25
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:58,734
possible answers she could give.

26
00:00:58,734 --> 00:01:01,081
First, she might say, "I can't stand him,

27
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:02,682
and I want to have a good time."

28
00:01:03,896 --> 00:01:06,390
Second, she might say,[br]"Well, he's really shy,

29
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,067
and he rarely goes to parties."

30
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:10,536
And third, she might say,

31
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:12,219
"He's in Beijing, and it's impossible

32
00:01:12,218 --> 00:01:14,709
to get here from[br]Beijing in an afternoon."

33
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:16,759
The first response that she gives you

34
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,242
does not give you a good reason to believe

35
00:01:19,242 --> 00:01:21,399
that Monty won't be at the party.

36
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:23,370
The second reason,[br]though, is a good reason

37
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,591
to believe that Monty[br]won't be at the party.

38
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:27,665
If he's really shy and[br]rarely goes to parties,

39
00:01:27,665 --> 00:01:30,986
then it's probable that he[br]won't be at tonight's party.

40
00:01:30,986 --> 00:01:33,494
Similarly, the third reason[br]also gives you a good

41
00:01:33,495 --> 00:01:36,134
reason to believe that[br]Monty won't be at the party.

42
00:01:36,134 --> 00:01:38,162
If he's in Beijing, and[br]it's impossible to get here

43
00:01:38,162 --> 00:01:40,862
from Beijing in an afternoon,[br]then it's guaranteed

44
00:01:40,862 --> 00:01:42,688
that he won't be at the party.

45
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:44,118
And when you notice things like that,

46
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:45,489
when you distinguish between good

47
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:47,878
and bad reasons for believing something,

48
00:01:47,878 --> 00:01:50,447
you're exercising your[br]critical thinking skills.

49
00:01:52,262 --> 00:01:53,567
So critical thinking is making sure

50
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:55,048
we have good reasons for our beliefs,

51
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:57,469
and so one of the essential[br]skills that you learn

52
00:01:57,468 --> 00:01:59,140
when you're studying[br]critical thinking is how

53
00:01:59,141 --> 00:02:01,847
to distinguish good reasons[br]for believing something

54
00:02:01,847 --> 00:02:04,667
from bad reasons for believing something.

55
00:02:04,668 --> 00:02:06,014
Now, it's worth saying something about

56
00:02:06,013 --> 00:02:08,266
how I'm using the term "good" here.

57
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:09,844
I'm not using it to indicate anything

58
00:02:09,844 --> 00:02:12,423
having to do with morality or ethics.

59
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,899
So it's not morally right or morally good

60
00:02:14,899 --> 00:02:17,677
to believe something on[br]the basis of good reasons.

61
00:02:17,677 --> 00:02:20,371
Similarly, it's not morally[br]wrong, or evil, or wicked

62
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:23,538
to believe something on[br]the basis of a bad reason.

63
00:02:23,538 --> 00:02:25,936
Rather, here, what it is to[br]say that a reason is good

64
00:02:25,936 --> 00:02:28,825
is closely tied to the notion of truth.

65
00:02:28,824 --> 00:02:30,417
So a good reason for a belief is one

66
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,623
that makes it probable, that is, it's one

67
00:02:32,623 --> 00:02:35,479
that makes the belief likely to be true.

68
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:37,429
The very best reasons for a belief

69
00:02:37,429 --> 00:02:40,532
make it certain, they guarantee it.

70
00:02:40,532 --> 00:02:41,663
So why does this matter?

71
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:43,003
Well, the reason that critical thinking

72
00:02:43,002 --> 00:02:45,215
is important is because,[br]since we're rational,

73
00:02:45,216 --> 00:02:47,522
we want our beliefs to be true.

74
00:02:47,522 --> 00:02:49,597
Rational people want to have true beliefs,

75
00:02:49,597 --> 00:02:52,128
and they want not to have false beliefs.

76
00:02:52,127 --> 00:02:54,841
And the best way to be[br]rational in this way

77
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,749
is to form beliefs only when you

78
00:02:56,748 --> 00:02:59,252
find good reasons for them.

79
00:02:59,252 --> 00:03:00,960
Okay, that leads us to[br]our second question:

80
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:03,170
What is an argument?

81
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:06,018
Well, an argument is a set[br]of statements that together

82
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,300
comprise a reason for a further statement.

83
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,399
So, for example, we can consider one

84
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:15,806
of your friend's responses[br]before as an argument.

85
00:03:15,806 --> 00:03:17,584
She's given you two statements,

86
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:20,618
"Monty's really shy" and[br]"Monty rarely goes to parties,"

87
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:22,366
which together comprise[br]a reason for believing

88
00:03:22,366 --> 00:03:24,875
that Monty won't be at the party.

89
00:03:24,876 --> 00:03:26,656
The statements that are the reason,

90
00:03:26,656 --> 00:03:29,117
we call the argument's premises.

91
00:03:29,116 --> 00:03:31,131
So "Monty's really shy" is premise one,

92
00:03:31,131 --> 00:03:34,156
"Monty rarely goes to[br]parties" is premise two,

93
00:03:34,156 --> 00:03:36,391
and the statement that[br]those premises give you

94
00:03:36,391 --> 00:03:39,349
reason to believe, we call[br]the argument's conclusion.

95
00:03:40,858 --> 00:03:42,801
A good argument is one[br]in which the premises

96
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,793
give you a good reason for[br]the conclusion, that is,

97
00:03:45,794 --> 00:03:49,132
the premises make the[br]conclusion likely to be true.

98
00:03:49,132 --> 00:03:50,394
In that case, we say that the argument

99
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:52,963
supports the conclusion.

100
00:03:52,963 --> 00:03:55,546
Good arguments support their conclusions,

101
00:03:55,546 --> 00:03:59,108
and bad arguments don't[br]support their conclusions.

102
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:00,894
So a key part of critical[br]thinking is learning

103
00:04:00,894 --> 00:04:02,823
to evaluate arguments to determine

104
00:04:02,823 --> 00:04:04,758
whether or not they're good or bad,

105
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:06,137
that is, whether or not their premises

106
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:07,846
support their conclusions.

107
00:04:09,307 --> 00:04:11,730
The red argument is the first response

108
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,365
that she gave, two premises,

109
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:16,129
"I can't stand Monty" and "I[br]want to have a good time."

110
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:18,745
And the conclusion is "Monty[br]won't be at the party."

111
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:20,855
And the third argument,[br]which we'll put in purple,

112
00:04:20,855 --> 00:04:22,911
consisted also of two premises,

113
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,199
"Monty's in Beijing" and[br]"He can't get from Beijing

114
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,132
to the party in time, so[br]he won't be at the party."

115
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,968
Now, as I indicated[br]before, the first argument

116
00:04:31,968 --> 00:04:35,560
is not good, while the[br]purple argument is good.

117
00:04:37,836 --> 00:04:40,346
And here I can explain a[br]little bit more about why.

118
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:43,901
If you consider what the[br]red argument's premises say,

119
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:45,235
that your friend can't stand Monty,

120
00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:47,295
and she wants to have a good time,

121
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:48,535
and think about their relationship

122
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:50,222
to the conclusion of the argument,

123
00:04:50,221 --> 00:04:52,086
you'll see that those[br]statements don't make

124
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:54,701
that conclusion any[br]more likely to be true.

125
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:56,197
The fact that your[br]friend can't stand Monty

126
00:04:56,197 --> 00:04:58,076
and wants to have a good[br]time doesn't do anything

127
00:04:58,076 --> 00:05:01,019
to make it more likely[br]that Monty won't be there.

128
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:03,959
It's simply unrelated to the conclusion.

129
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,491
In the purple argument,[br]though, the premises,

130
00:05:05,492 --> 00:05:08,759
if they're true, they guarantee[br]the conclusion is true.

131
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,764
So they make it very probable.

132
00:05:10,764 --> 00:05:13,100
The truth of the premises[br]guarantees the truth

133
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,415
of the conclusion, and so[br]in the purple argument,

134
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,400
the premises do support the conclusion.

135
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,081
Now, it's worth pointing[br]out that the red argument,

136
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:22,456
though it's bad as it[br]stands, could be made

137
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,269
a good argument with the addition

138
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:26,336
of some background premise.

139
00:05:26,336 --> 00:05:27,843
So, for example, if you found out

140
00:05:27,843 --> 00:05:29,632
that your friend was[br]the person who decided

141
00:05:29,632 --> 00:05:32,024
who was going to be invited to the party,

142
00:05:32,024 --> 00:05:33,601
then the fact that she can't stand Monty

143
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:34,834
and wants to have a good time

144
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,343
would give you a good reason to believe

145
00:05:36,343 --> 00:05:38,098
that Monty won't be at the party,

146
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:39,091
because it would give you reason

147
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:41,615
to believe that she didn't invite him.

148
00:05:41,615 --> 00:05:44,122
But as it stands, the[br]argument is not good.

149
00:05:44,122 --> 00:05:46,257
Those two premises[br]considered in themselves

150
00:05:46,257 --> 00:05:47,372
give you no reason to believe

151
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:49,221
that Monty won't be at the party.

152
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:51,992
Okay, our last topic is to distinguish

153
00:05:51,992 --> 00:05:54,283
two different types of arguments.

154
00:05:54,283 --> 00:05:55,908
So I'm gonna put up here, on the left,

155
00:05:55,908 --> 00:05:57,425
the orange argument, which is the

156
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:58,911
second response that your friend gave,

157
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,543
"Monty's really shy" and[br]"He rarely goes to parties."

158
00:06:01,543 --> 00:06:03,200
On the right we'll put[br]the purple argument,

159
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:04,206
"Monty's in Beijing" and

160
00:06:04,206 --> 00:06:06,540
"He can't get from Beijing[br]to the party in time."

161
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,851
Both of them have the same conclusion,

162
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:09,693
"Monty won't be at the party."

163
00:06:09,694 --> 00:06:10,908
Now, as I said before, both of these

164
00:06:10,908 --> 00:06:12,596
are good arguments, they both do

165
00:06:12,596 --> 00:06:14,283
give you reason to believe the conclusion,

166
00:06:14,283 --> 00:06:15,770
i.e., both of them have premises

167
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:17,442
which support the conclusion,

168
00:06:17,442 --> 00:06:18,752
but there's an important difference

169
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:21,335
between the two arguments[br]that I want to point out.

170
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:22,726
If you consider the purple argument,

171
00:06:22,726 --> 00:06:25,294
and think about what those premises say,

172
00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:28,229
you'll notice that if[br]those premises are true,

173
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:30,536
if Monty's in Beijing,[br]and can't get from Beijing

174
00:06:30,536 --> 00:06:33,105
to the party in time, then it must be true

175
00:06:33,105 --> 00:06:34,901
that Monty won't be at the party.

176
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:38,700
Those premises guarantee the conclusion.

177
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:40,620
In such an argument, where the premises

178
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,262
guarantee the truth of the conclusion,

179
00:06:42,262 --> 00:06:44,747
we call the argument deductive.

180
00:06:44,747 --> 00:06:46,844
In a deductive argument,[br]given the premises,

181
00:06:46,845 --> 00:06:49,670
the conclusion must be true.

182
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,365
Just thinking about the information

183
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:53,059
in the premises in a deductive argument

184
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:56,027
gives you all you need[br]to deduce the conclusion.

185
00:06:57,596 --> 00:06:58,927
If you look at the[br]orange argument, though,

186
00:06:58,927 --> 00:07:01,225
you'll notice that that's not the case.

187
00:07:01,225 --> 00:07:03,365
In the orange argument,[br]even if those premises

188
00:07:03,365 --> 00:07:06,798
are true, the conclusion[br]might still be false.

189
00:07:06,798 --> 00:07:08,351
Even given that Monty is really shy

190
00:07:08,351 --> 00:07:10,665
and rarely goes to parties,[br]it's still possible

191
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:12,749
that he'll get over[br]his shyness and suspend

192
00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:14,684
his policy of rarely going to parties,

193
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,462
and unexpectedly show up.

194
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:18,498
It's unlikely, but it's possible.

195
00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:20,681
So the truth of the premises[br]in the orange argument

196
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,621
does not guarantee the[br]truth of the conclusion.

197
00:07:23,622 --> 00:07:26,232
Arguments like this, we call ampliative.

198
00:07:26,232 --> 00:07:29,631
In an ampliative argument,[br]the truth of the premises

199
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:33,279
makes the conclusion probable[br]but doesn't guarantee it.

200
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,238
Now, as I said, both of[br]the arguments are good.

201
00:07:35,238 --> 00:07:36,604
Ampliative arguments can often be

202
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:39,922
very good arguments,[br]they're just not deductive.

203
00:07:39,922 --> 00:07:42,927
The premises don't guarantee[br]the truth of the conclusion.

204
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:44,387
Now, when you're evaluating an argument,

205
00:07:44,387 --> 00:07:46,237
it can be important to know whether or not

206
00:07:46,237 --> 00:07:48,148
the argument is supposed to be deductive

207
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:50,586
or supposed to be merely ampliative.

208
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:53,299
If an argument is[br]supposed to be deductive,

209
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:54,998
but careful consideration of the argument

210
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:56,932
reveals that in fact the premises

211
00:07:56,932 --> 00:07:59,372
don't guarantee the[br]truth of the conclusion,

212
00:07:59,372 --> 00:08:00,779
if the conclusion could[br]be false even though

213
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:03,271
the premises are true,[br]that's often a good reason

214
00:08:03,271 --> 00:08:06,444
to reject the argument as a bad argument.

215
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,947
Whereas in an ampliative argument,

216
00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:09,649
to notice that the truth of the premises

217
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:11,810
doesn't guarantee the[br]truth of the conclusion,

218
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,052
is simply to notice that[br]it's an ampliative argument.

219
00:08:15,052 --> 00:08:17,053
If you were to object[br]to the orange argument

220
00:08:17,053 --> 00:08:19,377
by pointing out that,[br]still, the conclusion

221
00:08:19,377 --> 00:08:22,326
could be false, you'd[br]really be missing the point.

222
00:08:22,326 --> 00:08:24,812
In an ampliative argument,[br]it's taken for granted

223
00:08:24,812 --> 00:08:28,148
that the conclusion is not[br]guaranteed by the premises.

224
00:08:28,148 --> 00:08:30,386
Rather, what an ampliative[br]argument is doing

225
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:31,499
is giving you reasons to think

226
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:33,738
that the conclusion is probable.

227
00:08:33,738 --> 00:08:36,263
So knowing what type of[br]argument an argument is

228
00:08:36,263 --> 00:08:38,768
is essential to knowing which tools to use

229
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,322
to evaluate whether or[br]not it's a good argument.

230
00:08:41,322 --> 00:08:42,459
And we'll talk quite a bit more

231
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,903
about different tools for[br]evaluating both ampliative

232
00:08:44,903 --> 00:08:47,830
and deductive arguments in future lessons.

233
00:08:49,214 --> 00:08:51,391
Okay, so summing up this lesson.

234
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,713
Critical thinking is making sure

235
00:08:52,714 --> 00:08:54,937
that we have good reasons for our beliefs,

236
00:08:54,937 --> 00:08:56,621
where we understand a good reason as one

237
00:08:56,621 --> 00:09:00,399
that makes the belief[br]probable, or likely to be true.

238
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,265
An argument is a set of statements,

239
00:09:02,265 --> 00:09:04,394
which we call premises,[br]that together comprise

240
00:09:04,394 --> 00:09:06,089
a reason for another statement,

241
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:08,589
which we call the argument's conclusion.

242
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,235
And in a good argument, the premises

243
00:09:10,235 --> 00:09:12,339
support their conclusions, that is,

244
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:14,967
the premises give you a[br]good reason for believing

245
00:09:14,966 --> 00:09:17,369
the conclusion, because[br]they make it probable.

246
00:09:19,061 --> 00:09:21,629
A deductive argument is[br]one where the conclusion

247
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:24,658
is guaranteed by the premises.[br]If the premises are true,

248
00:09:24,658 --> 00:09:27,419
then the conclusion must be true.

249
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:29,979
An ampliative argument[br]is one where the premises

250
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,560
don't guarantee the conclusion,

251
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,325
but they do make it probable.

252
00:09:33,326 --> 00:09:34,494
So they can still provide you

253
00:09:34,494 --> 00:09:37,610
with good reason for[br]believing the conclusion.

254
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,289
Okay, so that ends this[br]introductory lesson.
