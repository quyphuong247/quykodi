Hi! my name is Laurie Santos.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,290
I teach psychology at Yale
University, and today I

4
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:13,868
want to talk to you about
the GI Joe fallacy.

5
00:00:13,868 --> 00:00:17,878
This lecture is in the series
on cognitive biases.

6
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:22,640
If you've watched a bunch of these videos,
you've probably gotten a bit better at

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,089
noticing your biases at work, and knowing
that you might fall prey to them.

8
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:30,850
You might also think that knowing
about your biases would, naturally,

9
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,149
make you less susceptible to them.

10
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,949
Unfortunately, it's not
always that simple.

11
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,150
In fact, if you think knowing your biases
is all you need to overcome them,

12
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:44,960
then you'd be falling prey yet
another bias: the GI Joe fallacy.

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,189
If you're a child of the
nineteen-eighties, then

14
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:51,839
you might have a guess about where
the name from this bias comes from.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,559
Yes - it's from that cartoon known as "GI Joe."

16
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:58,228
Maybe you remember how these shows ended.

17
00:00:58,228 --> 00:01:02,670
Each episode had a sort of cheesy public
service announcement that ended with the

18
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,570
show's famous epithet: "Now you
know, and knowing is half the battle."

19
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:12,739
The problem with this idea, the idea
that knowing is half the battle, is that

20
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:17,058
cognitive science has shown us that merely
knowing about our biases is often

21
00:01:17,058 --> 00:01:19,060
way less than half the battle.

22
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,129
Now, there are certainly some cases
where knowing is half the battle:

23
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:25,018
Knowing your multiplication
tables, for example,

24
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:27,319
or knowing which aisle the milk is in.

25
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:31,289
But there are many more where it's not
the case, cases where just knowing

26
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,200
something doesn't really
help us all that much.

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,359
For example, you may know that standing on

28
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:38,929
the Grand Canyon Skywalk is perfectly safe,

29
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,900
but your mind will still feel like it's pretty scary.

30
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,290
You may know that arbitrary
anchors can mess up your final

31
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,770
judgment, but you'll still feel like it's
best to get five chocolates when you see

32
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:52,200
a "five for five dollars" sign.

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,200
Finally, you may know that different
wordings can affect your

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,719
intuitions, but you still may be more
hesitant to take a risk involving lives

35
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:05,069
lost than lives saved using years of
research on cognitive bias he's shown

36
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:09,168
them know him recognizing yourself as
having information is only a small part

37
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,489
of what controls our behavior

38
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,219
indeed indeed situations

39
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:16,870
most of our behavioral control comes
from other classes you like our habits

40
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,840
with the situations we finders and not
from our conscience tells this is why

41
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,360
shaping our situations another behavior
in the right direction or even just

42
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,590
learning to regulate your emotions over
time to be really powerful the funniest

43
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,469
part of the GI Joe fallacy is that even
knowing about it and the fallacy would

44
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:39,199
protect is less than half the battle

45
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,569
even if you know knowing is half the
battle

46
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:46,590
you still have a tendency to think that
way you consciously know is a mean thing

47
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,670
that controls your behavior but it's not
even if you watch all of these videos

48
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:56,229
you're still going to be subject to the
same effects that the videos described

49
00:02:56,229 --> 00:03:02,739
for most cognitive biases including the
GI Joe Kraus knowing is not even half

50
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:08,040
the battle and so now you know and
that's less than half the battle
