00:00:00,185 --> 00:00:05,184
(gentle music)

2
00:00:06,046 --> 00:00:07,963
- [Kelly] Hi, I'm Kelly Schiffman.

3
00:00:07,964 --> 00:00:10,406
I'm a PHD student at Yale University

4
00:00:10,406 --> 00:00:12,425
and today I wanna talk
about the distinction

5
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:16,157
between normative and descriptive claims.

6
00:00:16,157 --> 00:00:18,445
So, people make claims all the time.

7
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:21,606
Someone might say, "The
sky is beautiful today."

8
00:00:21,606 --> 00:00:23,246
Or, "I just saw a UFO."

9
00:00:23,246 --> 00:00:25,185
Or "Chris Rick is hilarious!"

10
00:00:25,185 --> 00:00:28,725
Or "The Golden Gate Bridge
is in San Francisco."

11
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:30,467
Now, of course, it's
important for us to figure out

12
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:33,027
whether claims like
these are true or false

13
00:00:33,027 --> 00:00:34,670
but before we can do that it's important

14
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,368
to understand what sort of claim it is.

15
00:00:37,368 --> 00:00:38,591
Philosophers find it useful

16
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:41,829
to distinguish between two
different sorts of claims:

17
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:45,286
normative claims and descriptive claims.

18
00:00:45,286 --> 00:00:47,186
When you make a descriptive claim,

19
00:00:47,186 --> 00:00:49,046
you're describing something.

20
00:00:49,046 --> 00:00:51,286
You merely express your understanding

21
00:00:51,286 --> 00:00:53,746
of how something is or could be

22
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:56,008
without offering any even implicit

23
00:00:56,008 --> 00:00:58,629
evaluation of it relative to a standard,

24
00:00:58,628 --> 00:01:00,748
or ideal, or alternative.

25
00:01:00,749 --> 00:01:03,269
Examples of descriptive claims include:

26
00:01:03,268 --> 00:01:05,948
"The moon is made of cheese."

27
00:01:05,948 --> 00:01:08,048
"Dinosaurs used to exist."

28
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:09,865
"Obama's president."

29
00:01:09,865 --> 00:01:12,248
"That boys has large ears."

30
00:01:12,248 --> 00:01:14,689
"I could have more money."

31
00:01:14,688 --> 00:01:16,669
Notice that even if I'm likely to have an

32
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,487
opinion about somebody having large ears

33
00:01:19,487 --> 00:01:21,248
or the fact that I could have more money

34
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,430
this opinion isn't being expressed

35
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,550
in the descriptive claim itself.

36
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:28,265
Based just on the claim, you can't tell

37
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:31,984
whether I think the way
things are is better or worse

38
00:01:31,984 --> 00:01:33,948
than the way they could be.

39
00:01:33,948 --> 00:01:35,628
When you make a normative claim

40
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,947
you express your evaluation of something.

41
00:01:38,947 --> 00:01:41,567
When you evaluate something
you're assessing it,

42
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:44,665
often implicitly,
relative to some standard,

43
00:01:44,665 --> 00:01:47,885
or ideal, or alternative
way that it could be.

44
00:01:47,885 --> 00:01:49,548
It's to say that something is,

45
00:01:49,548 --> 00:01:52,146
well, in some respect,
better than or worse than

46
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:54,989
or on par with some standard,

47
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,989
or ideal, or alternative.

48
00:01:56,989 --> 00:02:00,308
When you make normative
claims we often use words like

49
00:02:00,308 --> 00:02:03,946
good or bad or better than.

50
00:02:03,945 --> 00:02:08,847
For example, "Leonardo Di
Caprio's a really good actor."

51
00:02:08,847 --> 00:02:10,326
That's a normative claim.

52
00:02:10,326 --> 00:02:14,207
Or that "Tomatoes taste bad
but ketchup tastes great."

53
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:16,925
Or "My math class is no better than

54
00:02:16,925 --> 00:02:20,046
"and no worse than my English class."

55
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:21,846
These are all normative claims.

56
00:02:21,846 --> 00:02:24,867
They contain an element of evaluation.

57
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:27,826
Normative claims also include words like

58
00:02:27,826 --> 00:02:29,586
should and shouldn't

59
00:02:29,586 --> 00:02:31,226
or right and wrong.

60
00:02:31,227 --> 00:02:34,347
Example, "You should do your homework."

61
00:02:34,347 --> 00:02:36,566
"You shouldn't pick your nose."

62
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:39,605
"It's not okay to steal a candy bar."

63
00:02:39,605 --> 00:02:42,893
"Sending a thank you note
is the right thing to do."

64
00:02:42,893 --> 00:02:45,733
These are also normative claims.

65
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:48,533
But there are many, many
more evaluative words

66
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:50,875
that can appear in normative claims.

67
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:54,373
Consider the following, "It's fine to eat

68
00:02:54,373 --> 00:02:56,316
"three burgers a day."

69
00:02:56,316 --> 00:02:59,054
"The movie was ridiculous."

70
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,813
"Broccoli is disgusting."

71
00:03:01,813 --> 00:03:03,972
"Video games are awesome."

72
00:03:03,973 --> 00:03:07,693
And, "It's not cool to skip school."

73
00:03:07,693 --> 00:03:11,013
These are all normative claims as well.

74
00:03:11,013 --> 00:03:13,293
Now, once we figure out whether a claim is

75
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,052
normative or descriptive that helps us

76
00:03:15,052 --> 00:03:18,413
to assess its truth,
answer certain questions,

77
00:03:18,413 --> 00:03:20,594
settle certain disagreements.

78
00:03:20,593 --> 00:03:24,233
Consider a case in which you
think our neighbor's car is red

79
00:03:24,234 --> 00:03:26,074
and I think it's not.

80
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:27,134
I think it's blue.

81
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:29,951
Here we're disagreeing
about a descriptive claim.

82
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:32,253
So, all we need to do to
settle the disagreement

83
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,323
is to figure out whether

84
00:03:33,324 --> 00:03:35,524
that descriptive claim is true or not.

85
00:03:35,524 --> 00:03:37,301
We need to figure out how the world is.

86
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:40,221
So, contrast this with
a case in which you say

87
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:42,319
that red cars are better than blue cars

88
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,281
and I say that blue cars
are better than blue cars.

89
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:48,278
Here we're disagreeing
over normative claims

90
00:03:48,278 --> 00:03:50,100
so what we need to do
is sort through that.

91
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,736
For example, I might
argue that well blue cars

92
00:03:52,736 --> 00:03:54,391
are better than red cars because red cars

93
00:03:54,391 --> 00:03:57,550
get pulled over
disproportionately by the police.

94
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,069
Here we're working
through a normative issue.

95
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:01,852
Either way, getting clear
on whether something's

96
00:04:01,853 --> 00:04:03,992
a normative claim or a descriptive claim

97
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:06,051
is the first step towards figuring out

98
00:04:06,051 --> 00:04:10,450
and towards settling debates like this.
