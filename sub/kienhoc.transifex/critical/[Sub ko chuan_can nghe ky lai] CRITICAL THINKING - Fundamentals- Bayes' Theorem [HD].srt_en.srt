00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,290
my name is Ian Olav i'm a graduate
student at the cuny graduate center and

2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,579
today I want to talk to you about Bayes
theorem Bayes theorem is a fact about

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,570
probabilities a version of which was
first discovered in the 18th century by

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,830
thomas bayes theorem is based most
famous contribution to the mathematical

5
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,630
theory of probability

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,590
it has a lot of applications and some
philosophers even think it's the key to

7
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,560
understanding what it means to think
rationally

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,530
in order to understand the theorem
though we'll have to understand a little

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,940
bit about probabilities the probability
of a proposition is the chance or

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,460
likelihood that that proposition is true

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,629
suppose you know that one student in a
class of 20 has the flu but you don't

12
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:46,440
know who

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,218
if you know that Sally is a student in
the class you would say the probability

14
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:57,90
that sally has the flu is one in 20 or
five percent 4.05 we can call this your

15
00:00:57,90 --> 00:00:59,579
prior probability that sally has the flu

16
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,960
because it's your probability prior to
finding out any new information as a

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:11,310
shorthand will write P of sally has the
flu equals . 05 suppose now that there

18
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,729
are five girls and 15 boys in the class
now

19
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:17,909
you don't know whether the classes flu
patient is a boy or a girl

20
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,240
but if you were to find out that the
patient was a girl your probability that

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,339
sally has the flu would go up to one in
five or twenty percent or . -

22
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,909
on the other hand if you were to find
out that the patient was a boy your

23
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,259
probability that sally has the flu would
go down to 0 because these things are

24
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:35,430
still iffy though

25
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,549
remember you don't yet know whether the
flu patient is a boy or a girl

26
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,530
we'll call these things conditional
probabilities your probability that

27
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,880
sally has the flu

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,130
conditional on the flu patient being a
girl is . to your probability that sally

29
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,89
has the flu

30
00:01:51,90 --> 00:01:57,479
given that the flu patient is a boy is 0
as a shorthand will write P of sally has

31
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,200
the flu

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,380
given that the flu patient is a girl
equals . 2 and p of sally has the flu

33
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,649
given that the flu patient is a boy
equals 0

34
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:10,979
the little vertical line tells you that
we're talking about conditional

35
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,150
probabilities

36
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,470
now here's

37
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,160
the thing sometimes you don't know what
your conditional probability should be

38
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,30
in other words you know that you might
encounter some new evidence in the

39
00:02:21,30 --> 00:02:24,990
future but you don't yet know how that
evidence should affect the probability

40
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,940
you assigned to some hypothesis

41
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,50
here's where base theorem comes in it
gives you a way of figuring out what

42
00:02:31,50 --> 00:02:35,880
your conditional probability should be
so what does base theorem actually say

43
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,79
remember our shorthand your probability
in some hypothesis

44
00:02:40,80 --> 00:02:43,350
let's call it h conditional on some new
piece of evidence

45
00:02:44,10 --> 00:02:50,820
let's call it E is written p of h given
e here's what Bayes theorem tells us

46
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:59,160
p of h given e equals P of e given H
times P of H divided by P of e

47
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,899
in other words it tells us the three
ingredients that go into the probability

48
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,730
of the hypothesis conditional on some
evidence the probability of the evidence

49
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,49
conditional on the hypothesis the prior
probability of the hypothesis and the

50
00:03:13,50 --> 00:03:15,330
prior probability of the evidence

51
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,950
let's look at an example imagine that
one morning you don't feel right and you

52
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,470
go on WebMD to figure out what's wrong

53
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:27,30
you're browsing around until you find an
illness that catches your eye hypothesis

54
00:03:27,30 --> 00:03:31,200
itís so the hypothesis under
consideration is that you've come down

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,440
with hypothesis itís as you read
through the list of symptoms

56
00:03:35,10 --> 00:03:38,880
you realize that you have all of them in
other words you have all of the symptoms

57
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,359
that you would have if you had
hypothesized asst

58
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:49,920
so let's say P of e given H or p of
symptoms given hypothesis itís equals .

59
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,660
95 you begin to freak out but then you
remember Bayes theorem

60
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,140
it tells you that there are two more
things you need to know in order to

61
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,859
figure out the probability that you have
hypothesized asst the prior probability

62
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,180
that you would come down with hypothesis
itís and the prior probability that you

63
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,360
would have the symptoms that you
actually have with a little more

64
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,660
googling you discover that the disease
is extremely rare

65
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:19,620
only 1 in 100,000 people habit so P of
hypothesis itís is point zero zero zero

66
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,239
zero one

67
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:26,219
now for the last ingredient what kind of
symptoms are they suppose they're very

68
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:26,639
common

69
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,289
like a headache and a runny nose lots of
people have those google tells you one

70
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:36,479
in a hundred so P of symptoms your prior
probability that you would come down

71
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,568
with the symptoms you have is point zero
one

72
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:43,680
at last you know everything that you
need to know in order to figure out the

73
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,680
probability that you have hypothesis
given your symptoms

74
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,279
bayes theorem tells you that p of
hypothesis itís given symptoms equals P

75
00:04:53,279 --> 00:05:00,300
of symptoms given hypothesis itís times
P of hypothesis itís / p of symptoms

76
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:08,580
in other words p of hypothesis given
symptoms equals . 00095 or a little less

77
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,409
than one in a thousand Bayes theorem is
very helpful because in figuring out

78
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:15,750
what to make of some new piece of
evidence

79
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,949
people often ignore the prior
probability of the hypothesis or Treat p

80
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:25,949
of h given e as P of e given H this
mistake is sometimes known as the base

81
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:29,249
rate fallacy in the case we just looked
at

82
00:05:29,249 --> 00:05:35,69
p of h given me is very different from P
of e given h1 is less than one tenth of

83
00:05:35,69 --> 00:05:39,779
a percent and the other is ninety-five
percent without Bayes theorem

84
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:42,899
you might have gotten a lot more worked
up about hypothesis itís than you

85
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:47,909
needed to be wrapping up then base
theorem is a formula that tells you how

86
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:51,659
to calculate conditional probabilities
or the probability you should assign to

87
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:54,419
some hypothesis given a piece of
evidence

88
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,930
even if you forget the formula though
try to remember that the conditional

89
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,520
probability of H given e is determined
by three things the conditional

90
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,198
probability of a given H the prior
probability of H and the prior

91
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,339
probability of eight if you leave one of
those three things out

92
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:12,389
you don't have a complete picture
