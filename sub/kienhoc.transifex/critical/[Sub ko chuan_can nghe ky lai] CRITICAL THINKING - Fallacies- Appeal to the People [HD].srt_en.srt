hi everyone my name is Jordan makenzie
and I'm a graduate student at the

2
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,139
university of north carolina at chapel
hill i'm going to talk to you today

3
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:19,669
about a type of informal fallacy known
as the argumentum ad populum fallacy or

4
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,529
the appeal to the people fallacy

5
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:24,560
now let's start with a walk down memory
lane

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,860
do you remember ever trying to control
your parents into buying you the latest

7
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,450
fad toy say furby by whining about how
everyone at school thought that for

8
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,800
these were the best toy ever

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,328
so they must really be the best toy ever
your parents probably responded by

10
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:42,140
saying something like if everyone at
school jumped off a cliff would you jump

11
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,280
off a cliff

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,600
your parents were in fact calling you
out for making an appeal to the people

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,19
and for reasons that will become clear
as you watch this video

14
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:56,449
they were perfectly right to do so let's
take a closer look at how this fallacy

15
00:00:56,449 --> 00:01:02,420
works and appeal to the people tries to
establish the truth of some claim p on

16
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,250
the basis that a lot of people believe
me to be true because it's an informal

17
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,240
fallacy rather than a formal fallacy we
know that there's something wrong with

18
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,399
its content rather than its form in this
case the content that the argument

19
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:20,360
provides in support of its conclusion
simply isn't sufficient or even

20
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,399
necessarily relevant to establishing the
truth of that conclusion example will

21
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:26,780
help clarify things

22
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,439
suppose you and your friend are arguing
over whether or not Justin Bieber has

23
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,449
any musical talent your friend says of
course he has musical talent millions

24
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,310
upon millions of fans can't possibly be
wrong if you wanted to formalize your

25
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,380
friends argument it would look something
like this premise one millions of people

26
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,210
think justin bieber has musical talent
conclusion therefore justin bieber has

27
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,380
musical talent

28
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,189
now if you think there's something fishy
about this argument you're right

29
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:59,298
the big problem with this argument is
that it tries to establish the truth of

30
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:03,859
its conclusion that is the justin bieber
has musical talent by appealing to the

31
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:07,699
fact that many people believe that
conclusion to be true but this simply

32
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,960
doesn't follow something can be true
even if everyone believes it to be false

33
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,30
and something can be false

34
00:02:14,30 --> 00:02:18,860
even if everyone believes it to be true
now I don't mean to say that we should

35
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,600
always completely disregard

36
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,299
popular opinion when we're trying to
figure out whether or not something is

37
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,680
true or false

38
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,700
often the fact that most people believe
in the truth of some claim does actually

39
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,350
give us at least some reason to think
that that claim really is true if for

40
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,220
example you find out that ninety-eight
percent of your sociology class thought

41
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,120
that the answer to question five on the
exam with see it would be reasonable for

42
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,120
you to think that see probably was
indeed the right answer

43
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,770
after all if they all manage to arrive
at that answer it was probably because

44
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:53,750
they properly studied for the test you
would be committing a fallacy however if

45
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,40
you thought that the answer to question
five with see because ninety-eight

46
00:02:58,40 --> 00:03:01,519
percent of your sociology class had
answered the question that way

47
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,560
so while popular support may give you a
reason to believe a claim to be true it

48
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,620
is very rarely itself the thing that
makes that claim true

49
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,730
note that I said very rarely and not
never

50
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,740
in fact there are a few cases in which
appeals to popularity are not fallacious

51
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,900
consider etiquette if I'm trying to
argue that it is rude in India to leave

52
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,580
one shoes on indoors

53
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,210
it is very reasonable for me to appeal
to the fact that most people in India

54
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:34,400
think that it's rude to leave one shoes
on indoors in this case the content to

55
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,840
which I am appealing that is the
opinions of the indian population is

56
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,270
completely relevant to the conclusion
that i am trying to establish or suppose

57
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,420
that you're having an argument with a
friend about how this letter is

58
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,320
pronounced in Canadian English here's a
situation where there would be nothing

59
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,660
wrong about making an argument like
almost everyone in Canada's said so the

60
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,530
correct pronunciation in Canadian
English must be said and not easy

61
00:04:02,90 --> 00:04:05,630
keep in mind however that these examples
are the exception and not the rule

62
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,40
most of the time it's a good idea to be
suspicious of arguments that attempt to

63
00:04:10,40 --> 00:04:13,160
establish the truth of the conclusion by
appealing to popular opinion
