00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:06,330
Hi! My name is Julianne Chung,

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,163
and I am a graduate student
at Yale University.

4
00:00:09,163 --> 00:00:12,925
Today, I am going to talk
about truth and validity.

5
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:14,783
There are many different good qualities

6
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:16,987
that arguments can have.

7
00:00:16,987 --> 00:00:19,646
For example, they can be clear,

8
00:00:19,646 --> 00:00:21,341
they can be interesting,

9
00:00:21,341 --> 00:00:23,860
they can be persuasive, and so on.

10
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:26,844
In this video, however,
we are going to discuss

11
00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:29,607
just two good qualities
that arguments can have

12
00:00:29,608 --> 00:00:31,789
that are particularly
important for determining

13
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:34,286
whether we should accept
their conclusions.

14
00:00:34,286 --> 00:00:38,605
The first is this: the premises
of an argument may be true,

15
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:41,790
that is, they may be in
agreement with the facts.

16
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,028
In philosophy, truth and
falsity are held to be

17
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:48,559
properties of statements,
but not arguments.

18
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:51,137
Second, an argument may be valid.

19
00:00:51,137 --> 00:00:53,273
An argument is valid when its conclusion

20
00:00:53,273 --> 00:00:55,595
follows logically from its premises.

21
00:00:55,594 --> 00:00:58,298
In other words, an argument is valid

22
00:00:58,298 --> 00:01:00,679
just in case the truth of its premises

23
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:03,431
guarantees the truth of its conclusion.

24
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,995
In philosophy, validity and invalidity

25
00:01:05,995 --> 00:01:08,155
are held to be properties of arguments,

26
00:01:08,156 --> 00:01:10,534
but not statements.

27
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:12,892
To see the difference
between these properties,

28
00:01:12,891 --> 00:01:15,189
it will be helpful to
look at some examples,

29
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:18,881
all of which involve my good
friend Julia's dog, Split.

30
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:20,578
This is an example of an argument

31
00:01:20,578 --> 00:01:23,399
that has true premises and is valid.

32
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:26,870
Premise (1): All Australian
Shepherds are dogs.

33
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,539
Premise (2): Split is
an Australian Shepherd.

34
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:33,906
Conclusion: Therefore, Split is a dog.

35
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:37,109
In this argument, not only
are the premises true,

36
00:01:37,108 --> 00:01:40,289
but the conclusion follows
logically from them.

37
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,507
Next is an example of an
argument that has true premises

38
00:01:43,507 --> 00:01:45,201
but is not valid.

39
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:47,906
Premise (1): All dogs are animals.

40
00:01:47,906 --> 00:01:50,890
Premise (2): All cats are animals.

41
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,570
Conclusion: Therefore, all cats are dogs.

42
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:57,042
Here, the premises are obviously true,

43
00:01:57,043 --> 00:02:00,467
but the conclusion does not
follow logically from them.

44
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:03,626
Of course, this argument
is clearly unacceptable,

45
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:06,388
because its conclusion is obviously false.

46
00:02:06,388 --> 00:02:09,709
However, sometimes arguments
can have true premises,

47
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:11,461
as well as true conclusions,

48
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:13,703
but still be invalid
because the conclusions

49
00:02:13,703 --> 00:02:16,524
do not follow logically from them.

50
00:02:16,524 --> 00:02:19,228
Here is an example of such a case.

51
00:02:19,228 --> 00:02:22,120
Premise (1): All dogs are animals.

52
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,788
Premise (2): All Australian
Shepherds are animals.

53
00:02:25,788 --> 00:02:30,142
Conclusion: Therefore, all
Australian Shepherds are dogs.

54
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:32,021
Because of this, it is important

55
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:33,578
that we are careful to ensure

56
00:02:33,578 --> 00:02:35,236
that the conclusion really does follow

57
00:02:35,236 --> 00:02:37,199
from the premises under consideration

58
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,525
when we are evaluating an argument.

59
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,058
We are now going to look at an argument

60
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:44,519
with at least one false
premise that is valid.

61
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,675
Premise (1): You can't
teach an old dog new tricks.

62
00:02:48,675 --> 00:02:52,599
Premise (2): Split is an old dog.

63
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:57,218
Conclusion: Therefore, you
can't teach Split new tricks.

64
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,180
Here, the first premise is false,

65
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:01,618
but the reasoning is valid,
because the conclusion

66
00:03:01,618 --> 00:03:03,836
follows logically from the premises.

67
00:03:03,836 --> 00:03:06,436
Notice, too, that just
as in the last example,

68
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:09,676
the conclusion of this
argument may happen to be true,

69
00:03:09,675 --> 00:03:12,982
although the argument does
not establish that it is.

70
00:03:12,983 --> 00:03:15,503
Alright, just one more example.

71
00:03:15,503 --> 00:03:19,531
This argument has at least one
false premise and is invalid.

72
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,691
Premise (1): I like Split.

73
00:03:21,691 --> 00:03:24,408
Premise (2): Training dogs is easy.

74
00:03:24,408 --> 00:03:27,205
Conclusion: Therefore,
I'll win a lot of awards

75
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:29,701
for teaching Split how to roll over.

76
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:32,686
In this example, not only
is premise two false,

77
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:34,741
but the conclusion does
not follow logically

78
00:03:34,741 --> 00:03:36,470
from the premises.

79
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:39,048
You've probably already
noticed that truth and falsity,

80
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:41,846
as well as validity and invalidity,

81
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:45,364
can appear in various
combinations in an argument,

82
00:03:45,364 --> 00:03:47,963
giving rise to four possibilities.

83
00:03:47,963 --> 00:03:50,645
Let's take a moment to
review them together.

84
00:03:50,645 --> 00:03:53,988
Possibility one: we may
have our facts right,

85
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:57,587
our premises are true, and
we may use them properly.

86
00:03:57,587 --> 00:03:59,620
Our reasoning is valid.

87
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,870
Possibility two: we may
have our facts right,

88
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:06,829
our premises are true, and
we may use them improperly.

89
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,127
Our reasoning is invalid.

90
00:04:09,127 --> 00:04:10,765
Possibility three:

91
00:04:10,764 --> 00:04:12,762
we may have our facts wrong,

92
00:04:12,762 --> 00:04:14,967
some of our premises are false,

93
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:17,162
and we may use them properly.

94
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:19,227
Our reasoning is valid.

95
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:22,061
And finally, possibility four:

96
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,941
we may have our facts wrong,

97
00:04:23,942 --> 00:04:26,228
some of our premises are false,

98
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:28,423
and we may use them improperly.

99
00:04:28,423 --> 00:04:30,627
Our reasoning is invalid.

100
00:04:30,627 --> 00:04:32,985
When we are evaluating an argument,

101
00:04:32,985 --> 00:04:34,762
we should only accept its conclusions

102
00:04:34,762 --> 00:04:37,384
if the first possibility obtains.

103
00:04:37,384 --> 00:04:41,447
Philosophers call such
arguments "sound arguments."

104
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,537
Because of this, you might be wondering

105
00:04:43,538 --> 00:04:45,721
why we should be at all interested

106
00:04:45,721 --> 00:04:49,947
in arguments that are valid,
but whose premises are false?

107
00:04:49,947 --> 00:04:52,211
One answer is that we are often not

108
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:55,182
in a position to know whether
our premises are true.

109
00:04:55,182 --> 00:04:58,108
But being able to validly
infer the conclusions

110
00:04:58,108 --> 00:05:01,754
that would follow from such
premises if they were true

111
00:05:01,754 --> 00:05:04,935
sometimes enables us to
judge whether they are true.

112
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:07,197
This is because validly
inferring a conclusion

113
00:05:07,197 --> 00:05:10,448
that we know to be false
from a given set of premises

114
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:14,475
will tell us that one of our
premises must be false too.

115
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:17,553
After all, a false
conclusion cannot validly

116
00:05:17,553 --> 00:05:20,293
be deduced from true premises.

117
00:05:20,293 --> 00:05:22,174
Consider the following example.

118
00:05:22,175 --> 00:05:24,369
Say that John calls his
boss at work one day,

119
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:25,971
and tells her that he is in bed

120
00:05:25,971 --> 00:05:28,107
with a terrible case of the flu.

121
00:05:28,107 --> 00:05:30,487
His boss, it seems, could
use that information

122
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:32,808
to construct the following argument.

123
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:36,754
Premise (1): John is in bed
with a terrible case of the flu.

124
00:05:37,057 --> 00:05:39,391
Premise (2): If john is in bed

125
00:05:39,391 --> 00:05:41,249
with a terrible case of the flu,

126
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:43,513
then he is not bowling.

127
00:05:43,512 --> 00:05:47,360
Conclusion: Therefore,
John is not bowling.

128
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,171
This argument is valid.

129
00:05:50,172 --> 00:05:53,353
Its conclusion follows
logically from its premises.

130
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,812
So, if John's boss were
to see him bowling,

131
00:05:56,812 --> 00:05:58,819
what could she conclude?

132
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:02,072
Premise (2) seems untouched
by this bit of evidence.

133
00:06:02,072 --> 00:06:04,893
Premise (1), however, is in danger.

134
00:06:04,892 --> 00:06:07,353
She could conclude that John is not in bed

135
00:06:07,353 --> 00:06:09,315
with a terrible case of the flu.

136
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:11,196
It seems he lied.

137
00:06:11,197 --> 00:06:14,494
This is, of course, just
a very simple example.

138
00:06:14,494 --> 00:06:16,758
That said, hopefully it suffices to show

139
00:06:16,757 --> 00:06:18,695
that we often use reasoning like this

140
00:06:18,696 --> 00:06:21,436
to figure out whether
claims are true or false.

141
00:06:21,435 --> 00:06:24,036
Thus, it is indeed often
very useful for us to know

142
00:06:24,036 --> 00:06:26,033
whether an argument is valid,

143
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:29,608
even if we don't know whether
its premises are true.

144
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:32,916
For more information about
truth, validity, and soundness,

145
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:36,156
I highly recommend checking
out Paul's video on validity

146
00:06:36,156 --> 00:06:39,218
and Aaron's video on soundness.
