2
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:07,073
Hi, my name is Julianne Chung,

3
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:10,091
and I'm a graduate student
at Yale University.

4
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:13,842
Today, I am going to talk
about ad hominem fallacies.

5
00:00:13,842 --> 00:00:15,676
"Ad hominem" is a Latin term

6
00:00:15,676 --> 00:00:19,112
that can be translated into
English as "to the man,"

7
00:00:19,112 --> 00:00:21,480
which is a very literal translation,

8
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:25,858
or "against the person," which
is a bit more descriptive.

9
00:00:25,858 --> 00:00:28,458
Ad hominem fallacies are
also very often called

10
00:00:28,457 --> 00:00:30,814
"fallacies of personal attack."

11
00:00:30,815 --> 00:00:32,939
This is because such
fallacies are commited

12
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:34,971
whenever one attempts
to challenge a position

13
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,058
by criticizing something
having to do with its source,

14
00:00:38,058 --> 00:00:40,856
thereby shifting attention
away from the points at issue,

15
00:00:40,856 --> 00:00:44,293
and focusing it instead on
those who are arguing for them.

16
00:00:44,293 --> 00:00:46,812
There are many different
kinds of ad hominem fallacies.

17
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:49,737
We are going to briefly survey six here.

18
00:00:49,737 --> 00:00:51,758
They go by the following names.

19
00:00:51,758 --> 00:00:54,300
First, abusive ad hominem.

20
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:57,051
Second, circumstantial ad hominem.

21
00:00:57,051 --> 00:00:59,478
Third, tu quoque.

22
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:01,939
Fourth, guilt by association.

23
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:04,376
Fifth, genetic fallacy.

24
00:01:04,376 --> 00:01:06,896
And sixth, ad feminam.

25
00:01:06,897 --> 00:01:08,684
Abusive ad hominem arguments

26
00:01:08,683 --> 00:01:11,180
present personal
characteristics of individuals

27
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,884
as good reasons to discount their ideas.

28
00:01:13,885 --> 00:01:16,777
However, although certain
personal characteristics

29
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,878
might give us reason for suspicion,

30
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:20,805
they do not affect the virtues of claims

31
00:01:20,805 --> 00:01:22,721
considered on their own.

32
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:25,240
Here's an example of such an argument:

33
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:28,259
"We should never think that
anything politicians ever say

34
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,204
"is true, because they're
all dirty, lying scumbags."

35
00:01:32,204 --> 00:01:33,599
It should be easy enough to see

36
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,561
that this argument does not give us reason

37
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:38,579
to discount everything
that politicians say.

38
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:41,445
Indeed, even those who
are the least admirable

39
00:01:41,445 --> 00:01:44,941
likely say true things at
least some of the time.

40
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:47,022
Whereas an abusive ad hominem argument

41
00:01:47,022 --> 00:01:49,670
works by attacking an individual directly,

42
00:01:49,671 --> 00:01:51,726
a circumstantial ad hominem argument

43
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:53,664
attempts to challenge a person's position

44
00:01:53,665 --> 00:01:55,847
by suggesting that she
is advancing it merely

45
00:01:55,846 --> 00:01:58,203
to serve her own interests.

46
00:01:58,203 --> 00:02:00,363
Although this can be seen as abusive,

47
00:02:00,364 --> 00:02:02,291
circumstantial ad hominem arguments

48
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,484
differ from abusive ad hominem arguments

49
00:02:04,484 --> 00:02:07,653
in that they focus on
their target's situations,

50
00:02:07,653 --> 00:02:10,649
rather than on their
personal characteristics.

51
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,307
Once again, however,
although such arguments

52
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:16,768
may give us reason to question
an individual's intentions,

53
00:02:16,768 --> 00:02:19,170
they do not impact whether
her claims themselves

54
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,096
are nonetheless worth taking seriously.

55
00:02:22,096 --> 00:02:23,872
Consider this argument:

56
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,008
"Summer vacation should be abolished.

57
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:29,153
"Any student who argues otherwise
should not be listened to,

58
00:02:29,153 --> 00:02:32,730
"because he or she stands to
benefit from its continuation."

59
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,889
Although me might wonder
whether a student who opposes

60
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:36,468
getting rid of summer vacation

61
00:02:36,468 --> 00:02:38,906
is doing so solely out of self-interest,

62
00:02:38,907 --> 00:02:40,834
that has no bearing on
whether it should indeed

63
00:02:40,834 --> 00:02:42,772
be eliminated or not,

64
00:02:42,772 --> 00:02:46,127
or whether such a student's
arguments are any good or not.

65
00:02:46,127 --> 00:02:48,205
Plenty of excellent
positions and arguments

66
00:02:48,205 --> 00:02:50,991
also happen to benefit
those advocating them.

67
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:54,103
That does not diminish
their merit, however.

68
00:02:54,335 --> 00:02:56,855
Another tactic that is
often used to attack claims

69
00:02:56,854 --> 00:02:59,316
by undermining their
advocate's credibility

70
00:02:59,316 --> 00:03:02,555
involves allegations of a
certain kind of hypocrisy.

71
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:05,618
This fallacy goes by the name "tu quoque,"

72
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:10,114
which in Latin means
"you too," or "you also."

73
00:03:10,437 --> 00:03:13,119
When one commits the tu quoque fallacy,

74
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,325
one accuses the person
of acting in a manner

75
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:18,146
that contradicts some
position that she supports,

76
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:20,084
and concludes that her view is worthless

77
00:03:20,085 --> 00:03:21,861
on account of the fact that she failed

78
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:24,323
to follow her own advice.

79
00:03:24,323 --> 00:03:27,224
However, whether someone
is acting in a manner

80
00:03:27,224 --> 00:03:28,919
that is somehow in tension

81
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:31,079
with the position she is advancing

82
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,901
has no bearing on whether
it is right or wrong,

83
00:03:33,901 --> 00:03:37,221
although it can admittedly
strike us as somehow dishonest,

84
00:03:37,221 --> 00:03:39,125
or less than noble.

85
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,622
Here's an example:

86
00:03:40,622 --> 00:03:42,480
"I can't believe you're
trying to convince me

87
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,685
"that I should give more money to charity,

88
00:03:44,686 --> 00:03:48,623
"when you don't give
nearly as much as I do."

89
00:03:49,086 --> 00:03:51,408
Whether the person that
this argument attacks

90
00:03:51,407 --> 00:03:54,727
(let's call him "person B")
gives as much money to charity

91
00:03:54,728 --> 00:03:57,549
as the person advancing
this argument does

92
00:03:57,549 --> 00:03:59,906
(let's call her "person A")

93
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,122
has no bearing on whether
person A should or should not

94
00:04:03,122 --> 00:04:05,572
give more money to charity.

95
00:04:05,572 --> 00:04:07,509
Presumably, that depends on other things

96
00:04:07,508 --> 00:04:09,587
besides what B is doing,

97
00:04:09,587 --> 00:04:12,768
say, for example, how
much money person A makes,

98
00:04:12,768 --> 00:04:16,730
how much money person A
presently gives, and so on.

99
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:19,299
The guilt by association fallacy

100
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:21,375
is committed whenever one tries to argue

101
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,850
against a certain view

102
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,916
by pointing out that some unsavory person

103
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,076
is likely to have agreed with it,

104
00:04:27,076 --> 00:04:30,872
as in: "Chocolate chip
cookies can't be any good.

105
00:04:30,872 --> 00:04:33,113
"My philosophy professor loves them,

106
00:04:33,113 --> 00:04:37,096
"and she is the meanest
teacher I have ever had!"

107
00:04:37,096 --> 00:04:39,915
As we all know, chocolate
chip cookies are delicious,

108
00:04:39,915 --> 00:04:43,108
despite the fact that some
mean people think so as well.

109
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:45,204
A claim can be true
despite its being endorsed

110
00:04:45,204 --> 00:04:47,067
by someone we don't like.

111
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,591
However, while arguments that commit

112
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:51,653
the guilt by association fallacy

113
00:04:51,653 --> 00:04:53,396
aim to cast a claim into question

114
00:04:53,396 --> 00:04:56,437
by condemning someone who is
likely to have agreed with it,

115
00:04:56,437 --> 00:04:59,420
the genetic fallacy occurs
whenever an attempt is made

116
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,449
to cast a claim into question
by condemning its origin.

117
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:04,969
Here's an example of an argument

118
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,617
that commits the genetic fallacy:

119
00:05:07,617 --> 00:05:09,509
"The founder of organization X

120
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,610
"served time in prison for embezzlement,

121
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,676
"so we can conclude that the organization

122
00:05:13,677 --> 00:05:15,953
"must still be corrupt."

123
00:05:15,952 --> 00:05:17,856
We can imagine this
argument being advanced

124
00:05:17,857 --> 00:05:19,714
in order to argue against a claim

125
00:05:19,713 --> 00:05:21,769
to the effect that organization X

126
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:23,511
offers many excellent services

127
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:25,554
and deserves financial support.

128
00:05:25,553 --> 00:05:28,734
However, the mere fact that
the founder of organization X

129
00:05:28,735 --> 00:05:31,649
was a criminal does not
show that the organization

130
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:35,108
currently acts in a way that
is morally unacceptable.

131
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:37,950
Things could have
changed a lot since then.

132
00:05:38,735 --> 00:05:41,723
As a note, arguments that
commit the genetic fallacy

133
00:05:41,723 --> 00:05:45,021
can also be used positively,
to support claims

134
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:47,540
rather than undermine them.

135
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,002
The last fallacy that I am
going to talk about today

136
00:05:50,002 --> 00:05:52,706
goes by the name "ad feminam."

137
00:05:52,706 --> 00:05:55,701
Ad feminam arguments
attempt to discredit a claim

138
00:05:55,701 --> 00:05:59,011
on the grounds that a
female person proposed it.

139
00:05:59,011 --> 00:06:02,493
Such arguments often include
statements to the effect of:

140
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:05,872
"Why should I believe
anything you have to say?

141
00:06:05,872 --> 00:06:08,948
"After all, you're just a woman."

142
00:06:08,947 --> 00:06:10,770
I take it to be more or less obvious

143
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:13,951
as to why such arguments
are deeply problematic.

144
00:06:13,951 --> 00:06:15,750
How about this example?

145
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,594
Does it commit one of the
fallacies just considered?

146
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:21,370
If so, which one?

147
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,213
"Ronald Reagan was in
favor of similar policies,

148
00:06:24,213 --> 00:06:28,824
"so they must be the right thing to do."

149
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,079
