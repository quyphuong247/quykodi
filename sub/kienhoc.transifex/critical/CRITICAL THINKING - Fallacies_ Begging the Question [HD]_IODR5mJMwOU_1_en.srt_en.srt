00:00:04,692 --> 00:00:05,754
Hello, I'm Matthew Harris.

3
00:00:05,754 --> 00:00:07,379
I'm a PhD student at Duke University,

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:08,721
and in this video I'll be discussing

5
00:00:08,721 --> 00:00:11,717
the informal logical fallacy[br]called "begging the question,"

6
00:00:11,717 --> 00:00:14,541
and the related concept[br]of circular reasoning.

7
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:16,978
Begging the question is an[br]informal logical fallacy,

8
00:00:16,978 --> 00:00:18,461
which means it has to do with a flaw

9
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:19,964
in the argument's content.

10
00:00:19,964 --> 00:00:21,448
An argument that begs the question

11
00:00:21,448 --> 00:00:23,682
assumes a proposition[br]that's in need of proof.

12
00:00:23,682 --> 00:00:25,512
The term itself can be[br]a source of confusion

13
00:00:25,512 --> 00:00:28,377
because it's often used to[br]suggest different things.

14
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:30,041
Often, we say that an[br]argument begs the question

15
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:31,910
to mean that it's inherently circular.

16
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,555
In other cases, the same phrase indicates

17
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:35,750
the presence of a questionable assumption.

18
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,253
Sometimes people use it loosely

19
00:00:37,253 --> 00:00:39,448
to mean "raising the question."

20
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:41,520
Accusing someone's argument[br]of begging the question

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,978
is to suggest that they[br]have unjustly assumed

22
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:46,234
a proposition that is in need of proof.

23
00:00:46,234 --> 00:00:47,920
Think of it like this.

24
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,640
Suppose, instead of arguing,[br]that you and your opponent

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,359
are on opposing teams[br]in a game of tug-of-war.

26
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:55,673
Teams A and B are supposed[br]to pull on the rope.

27
00:00:55,673 --> 00:00:58,274
It'd be cheating if either[br]team arranged to have the line

28
00:00:58,274 --> 00:01:00,996
that is supposed to be drawn[br]to divide the two of them

29
00:01:00,996 --> 00:01:04,064
already on B's or A's side of the divide.

30
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,486
Similarly, people engaged[br]in an argument can object

31
00:01:06,486 --> 00:01:08,067
that their opponent's[br]premises presuppose

32
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:10,120
what's at stake during the disagreement,

33
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,558
by accusing them of begging the question.

34
00:01:12,558 --> 00:01:14,406
Statements and arguments can be accused

35
00:01:14,406 --> 00:01:16,418
of begging the question[br]in different senses.

36
00:01:16,418 --> 00:01:18,214
The first sense we'll look at is when

37
00:01:18,213 --> 00:01:20,948
question-begging concerns[br]a questionable premise.

38
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:23,590
Of course, a premise, like[br]the foundation of a house,

39
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,129
cannot give support to its[br]conclusion if it itself

40
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:28,547
is not supported on independent grounds.

41
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,762
Next, there's the colloquial[br]sense of begging the question

42
00:01:30,762 --> 00:01:32,346
that can be used very differently.

43
00:01:32,346 --> 00:01:34,722
This sense is controversial[br]because it often is unrelated

44
00:01:34,722 --> 00:01:38,115
to the logical fallacy that[br]is the term's origin.

45
00:01:38,115 --> 00:01:39,762
For example, someone might say in response

46
00:01:39,762 --> 00:01:41,530
to a particular statement or argument

47
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,500
that it begs the question,[br]to mean that it raises,

48
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,878
relates, or introduces some other topic

49
00:01:45,878 --> 00:01:47,462
of question for discussion.

50
00:01:47,462 --> 00:01:48,924
However, the context of conversations

51
00:01:48,924 --> 00:01:50,956
are often complicated matters.

52
00:01:50,956 --> 00:01:52,987
Lastly, we have the most common sense

53
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,305
in which the term begging[br]the question is used,

54
00:01:55,305 --> 00:01:57,194
which brings us back[br]to circular reasoning.

55
00:01:57,194 --> 00:01:58,718
When someone says that[br]an argument really is

56
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,302
question-begging in this sense,

57
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:01,582
they mean that there is a circularity

58
00:02:01,582 --> 00:02:02,740
in the chain of reasoning.

59
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,832
typically about justification or meaning.

60
00:02:04,832 --> 00:02:06,012
We can distinguish these cases

61
00:02:06,012 --> 00:02:08,224
of circularity into two main sorts:

62
00:02:08,224 --> 00:02:09,769
circularity by equivalency

63
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,700
and circularity by dependency.

64
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,302
In cases of circularity by equivalency,

65
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:16,081
one of the premises of an argument asserts

66
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:17,645
a proposition that is equivalent

67
00:02:17,645 --> 00:02:19,433
to that argument's conclusion.

68
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:21,913
For example, the premise[br]and conclusion might express

69
00:02:21,913 --> 00:02:24,420
the same proposition twice by substituting

70
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:27,438
synonymous words to say the same thing.

71
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,718
An example of this would be to argue that

72
00:02:28,718 --> 00:02:32,050
music is a superior[br]art to film; therefore,

73
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,996
organized sounds are better[br]than organized images.

74
00:02:34,997 --> 00:02:36,602
And the other[br]type of circularity,

75
00:02:36,602 --> 00:02:38,328
circularity by dependency,

76
00:02:38,328 --> 00:02:39,954
is the charge that the conclusion

77
00:02:39,954 --> 00:02:42,006
and the premise are mutually dependent.

78
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:44,443
For example, imagine that Cowboy Ted

79
00:02:44,443 --> 00:02:47,308
is claiming to have a five-thousand-pound horse.

80
00:02:47,308 --> 00:02:50,437
Now, he claims to know that his[br]horse weighs five thousand pounds

81
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:53,891
because he used a highly[br]accurate scale on his ranch.

82
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,308
But he also claims to know[br]that the scale is precise

83
00:02:56,308 --> 00:02:58,015
because he personally calibrated it

84
00:02:58,015 --> 00:03:00,778
by the horse's weight of[br]five thousand pounds.

85
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:02,567
This argument is circular by dependency

86
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:04,963
because the extravagant claims[br]about the horse's weight

87
00:03:04,963 --> 00:03:06,466
and the reliability of the scale

88
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:08,600
are mutually dependent upon each other.

89
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,956
Importantly, it is not the[br]presence of circularity

90
00:03:10,956 --> 00:03:14,187
that is problematic per se, but[br]the lack of an independently

91
00:03:14,187 --> 00:03:16,970
grounded source of justification.

92
00:03:16,971 --> 00:03:19,469
If the horse looked like it[br]weighed five thousand pounds,

93
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:21,989
you might consider this[br]an independent reason.

94
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:23,655
Or even better, if someone from

95
00:03:23,655 --> 00:03:27,759
the Federal Scale Inspection[br]Agency inspected the scale,

96
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,953
we might have stronger independent reasons

97
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:32,026
to accept his argument.

98
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:33,936
Though the circularity would still exist,

99
00:03:33,936 --> 00:03:35,987
we would not consider it bad.

100
00:03:35,987 --> 00:03:37,532
