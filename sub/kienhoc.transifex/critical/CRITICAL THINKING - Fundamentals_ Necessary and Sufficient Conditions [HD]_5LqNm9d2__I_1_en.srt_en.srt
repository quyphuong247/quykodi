00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,361
Hi, I'm Kelley Schiffman!

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:10,085
I'm a PhD student at Yale University.

4
00:00:10,221 --> 00:00:13,605
And today I want to talk about necessary [br]and sufficient conditions.

5
00:00:15,455 --> 00:00:18,952
We hear the words "necessary" and [br]"sufficient" all the time.

6
00:00:19,347 --> 00:00:22,657
"Merely taking the test isn't sufficient [br]for passing it."

7
00:00:22,736 --> 00:00:24,437
"The lawyer convinced the jury

8
00:00:24,443 --> 00:00:28,027
that there is sufficient evidence to [br]convict the accused."

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,836
"Pain is a necessary part of every human[br]life."

10
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,844
"Practice is really necessary for [br]success."

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,685
But what exactly do these words mean?

12
00:00:38,387 --> 00:00:44,241
If P is necessary for Q, then Q cannot be[br]true unless P is true.

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,821
Philosophers sometimes put this by saying[br]that Q is true only if P is true.

14
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:54,439
Let's consider a case to helps us get [br]clear on this.

15
00:00:54,677 --> 00:00:57,578
What's necessary for getting accepted to [br]a university?

16
00:00:58,786 --> 00:01:02,100
Well, you might think that one necessary [br]condition is being human.

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,147
You can only be accepted to a university[br]if you are human.

18
00:01:06,144 --> 00:01:08,908
Another necessary condition is submitting[br]an application.

19
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:13,548
You can't get accepted to a university [br]unless you apply there.

20
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:17,635
Another necessary condition is perhaps[br]having decent grades.

21
00:01:17,686 --> 00:01:20,577
Okay, so what about sufficient conditions?

22
00:01:22,692 --> 00:01:28,353
If p is sufficient for Q, then P's being [br]true is enough to make Q true.

23
00:01:29,575 --> 00:01:34,133
Philosophers often put this by saying that[br]if P is true, then Q is true.

24
00:01:35,334 --> 00:01:38,268
Now it's a little harder to think of a [br]sufficient condition

25
00:01:38,268 --> 00:01:40,278
for getting accepted to a university.

26
00:01:40,278 --> 00:01:44,284
But consider some seventeen year old who[br]just won the Nobel Prize in chemistry.

27
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,824
Seems like that is pretty sufficient for [br]getting accepted to university.

28
00:01:49,373 --> 00:01:53,837
Now, necessary and sufficient conditions [br]come in all combinations.

29
00:01:54,358 --> 00:01:57,505
Here is an example of a necessary, but [br]not sufficient, condition.

30
00:01:57,921 --> 00:02:01,139
Steering well is a necessary condition[br]for driving well.

31
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:04,475
You can't drive well unless you steer [br]your car well.

32
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:08,334
However, steering well is not sufficient [br]for driving well,

33
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:12,122
since steering well is not enough to make[br]it true that you are driving well.

34
00:02:12,122 --> 00:02:15,976
You could steer well but still drive badly[br]for other reasons.

35
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:19,834
Here is an example of a sufficient but [br]not necessary condition.

36
00:02:19,838 --> 00:02:24,075
Boiling potatoes in water is a sufficient[br]condition for cooking them,

37
00:02:24,584 --> 00:02:28,564
since it's true that boiling potatoes is [br]enough to cook them.

38
00:02:28,564 --> 00:02:32,431
However, boiling potatoes in water is not [br]a necessary condition for cooking them,

39
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:34,572
since you can cook them in many other [br]ways:

40
00:02:34,786 --> 00:02:38,387
frying them, grilling them, baking them, [br]roasting them.

41
00:02:38,717 --> 00:02:42,766
And finally here is an example of a [br]necessary and sufficient condition:

42
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:45,528
getting all of the answers correct on a [br]test

43
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:48,546
is necessary for getting a perfect score[br]on the test,

44
00:02:48,641 --> 00:02:51,206
because you will not get a perfect score [br]on the test

45
00:02:51,206 --> 00:02:54,346
unless you get all the answers correct.

46
00:02:54,347 --> 00:02:57,468
Getting all of the answers correct is also[br]a sufficient condition

47
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,951
for getting[br]a perfect score,

48
00:02:59,153 --> 00:03:02,844
because getting all of the answers correct[br]is enough to get a perfect score.

49
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,113
There is nothing else you must do in order[br]to get a perfect score.
