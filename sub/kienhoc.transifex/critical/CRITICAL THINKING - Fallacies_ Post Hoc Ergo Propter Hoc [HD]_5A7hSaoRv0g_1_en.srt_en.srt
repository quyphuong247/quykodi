00:00:05,996 --> 00:00:07,870
Hello! I'm Paul Henne, and I'm a

3
00:00:07,993 --> 00:00:10,345
philosophy graduate student
at Duke University.

4
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:12,430
In this video, I'm gonna talk to you about

5
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:16,676
an informal fallacy called
"post hoc ergo propter hoc."

6
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,474
In doing this, I'm also gonna tell you

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,660
why it's sometimes wrong to conclude that

8
00:00:20,786 --> 00:00:22,659
a cat scratch caused your fever.

9
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,580
But I'll get to this idea in a bit.

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,377
Let's start with a problem.

11
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,140
Suppose that one day, I decide to work

12
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,463
from home, and my roommate Alex asks to

13
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,676
use my bike, and of course I let him.

14
00:00:33,835 --> 00:00:35,730
So he takes my bike, and goes to work.

15
00:00:35,887 --> 00:00:38,208
Later that day, he returns home

16
00:00:38,395 --> 00:00:40,904
with my bike, only the chain is busted.

17
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:43,574
I say, "Alex, you broke my bike!

18
00:00:43,732 --> 00:00:44,985
"You caused the chain to break!

19
00:00:45,174 --> 00:00:46,396
"You're responsible for this!"

20
00:00:46,557 --> 00:00:49,070
He rode my bike, and then it broke.

21
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:52,023
It seems as though he caused it to break.

22
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,885
So he should be responsible, right?

23
00:00:55,084 --> 00:00:58,259
But is this the correct conclusion
for me to draw?

24
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,834
Did Alex cause my bike to break?

25
00:01:00,987 --> 00:01:02,154
What do you think?

26
00:01:02,343 --> 00:01:06,002
I'd like to suggest that that's the
wrong conclusion to draw.

27
00:01:06,134 --> 00:01:08,195
Well, it's wrong for me to conclude this

28
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,243
without gathering more evidence that

29
00:01:10,373 --> 00:01:12,723
Alex was negligent while riding my bike.

30
00:01:12,882 --> 00:01:14,524
For it could be the case that the chain

31
00:01:14,746 --> 00:01:16,164
on my bike was defective in some way,

32
00:01:16,355 --> 00:01:19,048
and that whoever rode my
bike that day, maybe me,

33
00:01:19,243 --> 00:01:21,751
would've returned home with a broken bike.

34
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:24,319
In this scenario, I've committed the

35
00:01:24,492 --> 00:01:27,179
post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy.

36
00:01:27,313 --> 00:01:29,762
"Post hoc ergo propter hoc"

37
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,141
is a Latin phrase roughly meaning

38
00:01:32,307 --> 00:01:35,159
"after this; therefore, because of this."

39
00:01:35,322 --> 00:01:36,542
Here is the idea.

40
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,049
It's a fallacy to argue that because

41
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:41,981
one event (like my bike breaking)

42
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:45,799
occurred after another
event (like Alex riding it),

43
00:01:45,986 --> 00:01:48,511
the first event caused the second event.

44
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:50,763
Let's represent this formally.

45
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,947
Premise one: X happened after Y.

46
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,774
Conclusion: Therefore, Y caused X.

47
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:02,637
Returning to our example, my
argument now looks like this.

48
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,589
Premise one: My bike
broke after Alex rode it.

49
00:02:06,742 --> 00:02:10,569
Conclusion: Therefore,
Alex caused it to break.

50
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,597
So, is this a valid argument?

51
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:14,991
What do you think?

52
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:18,098
As it is now, the argument is invalid.

53
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:19,840
Here's a counterexample:

54
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:23,436
the sun sometimes comes
out after it rains,

55
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:27,229
but that doesn't mean that the
rain caused the sun to come out.

56
00:02:27,427 --> 00:02:30,382
But let's be more charitable
to my invalid argument.

57
00:02:30,576 --> 00:02:33,143
Maybe we can add a few premises,

58
00:02:33,298 --> 00:02:34,974
implicit ones, to make it valid,

59
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:37,292
and to make it seem more reasonable.

60
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:38,548
Let's try this.

61
00:02:38,766 --> 00:02:42,752
Premise one: My bike
broke after Alex rode it.

62
00:02:42,885 --> 00:02:45,485
Premise two: Usually, the person who rides

63
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:48,867
the bike before it broke
caused it to break.

64
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:52,626
Conclusion: Therefore, Alex caused it to break.

65
00:02:52,817 --> 00:02:57,312
But this argument is now
inductive, which is fine.

66
00:02:57,475 --> 00:02:59,275
However, it shows us that we need more

67
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,006
evidence that Alex broke my bike in order

68
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:04,965
to conclude that he broke it, as opposed

69
00:03:05,155 --> 00:03:07,120
to the bike just breaking, no matter what.

70
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,683
So, let's consider two cases
with more or less evidence.

71
00:03:11,782 --> 00:03:14,233
Case one: Suppose my other roommate,

72
00:03:14,412 --> 00:03:16,950
Aleah, saw Alex hitting my bike chain

73
00:03:17,084 --> 00:03:19,201
with a hammer, and then
she told me about it.

74
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,510
If this were the case, I would have better

75
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:24,177
evidence, a better case for concluding

76
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:25,759
that Alex broke my bike.

77
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:27,747
So let's consider now case two.

78
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:31,741
Suppose Aleah did not see Alex
hitting my bike with a hammer.

79
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:34,824
I can conclude, although hastily, that

80
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:38,066
it's only likely Alex who broke my bike,

81
00:03:38,323 --> 00:03:40,079
though I'm still committing the fallacy in

82
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,947
this case, and I need more evidence,

83
00:03:42,108 --> 00:03:43,905
like the testimony of my roommate.

84
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:47,116
Let's take another stab at my argument.

85
00:03:47,251 --> 00:03:51,653
Premise one: My bike
broke after Alex rode it.

86
00:03:51,746 --> 00:03:54,895
Premise two: If a bike breaks after

87
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:58,014
someone rides it, the rider
caused it to break.

88
00:03:58,092 --> 00:04:02,898
Conclusion: Therefore, Alex
caused my bike to break.

89
00:04:02,897 --> 00:04:04,828
Is this argument valid?

90
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,699
Yes!

91
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,174
But wait: is it sound?

92
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:09,205
Let's check.

93
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,203
Is premise one true?

94
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:12,161
Yes.

95
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:14,542
Is premise two true?

96
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:15,308
No!

97
00:04:15,336 --> 00:04:18,042
Plenty of bikes break without
the rider causing it.

98
00:04:18,076 --> 00:04:21,639
So suppose Alex didn't
act negligently at all.

99
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,788
Like I said earlier, the bike
could've been worn out.

100
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:26,942
So no one acted negligently.

101
00:04:27,163 --> 00:04:29,483
It's just natural wear
and tear of the bike.

102
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:31,833
And the natural wear and tear caused

103
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,018
the bike to break, not Alex.

104
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,163
Here, premise two is false.

105
00:04:36,197 --> 00:04:38,579
Regardless of the exact argument

106
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:42,088
representation I use, I need more evidence

107
00:04:42,122 --> 00:04:45,461
about this case for me to
make my conclusion.

108
00:04:45,492 --> 00:04:48,134
If I don't have evidence that Alex acted

109
00:04:48,225 --> 00:04:51,286
negligently, I'll not have
a good argument.

110
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:54,270
I'll make a hasty conclusion, and I'll

111
00:04:54,302 --> 00:04:56,197
commit the post hoc fallacy.

112
00:04:56,197 --> 00:04:57,617
We can see now that this

113
00:04:57,682 --> 00:05:01,538
"after this; therefore, because
of this"-reasoning is defective.

114
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:04,653
A cat might've scratched you right before

115
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:07,031
you got a fever, but that doesn't mean

116
00:05:07,062 --> 00:05:10,444
that the cat scratch caused your fever.

117
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:12,622
It's perfectly possible that the flu that

118
00:05:12,622 --> 00:05:16,875
your roommate recently had was
the actual cause for your fever.

119
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,956
The sequence of the two events alone

120
00:05:18,956 --> 00:05:21,496
does not establish a causal
relation between them.

121
00:05:21,528 --> 00:05:23,752
You probably have a lot of questions about

122
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:25,711
this fallacy now, and there's a lot more

123
00:05:25,747 --> 00:05:27,571
to talk about, like causation,

124
00:05:27,571 --> 00:05:30,951
controlled experiments, possibility,
and superstitions.

125
00:05:30,995 --> 00:05:34,901
But unfortunately, they'll have
to wait for other videos.
