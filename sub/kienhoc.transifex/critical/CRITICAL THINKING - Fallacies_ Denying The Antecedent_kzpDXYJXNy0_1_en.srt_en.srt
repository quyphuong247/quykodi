00:00:04,108 --> 00:00:05,835
Hello, I'm Matthew Harris.

3
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:08,089
I'm a philosophy graduate[br]student at Duke University,

4
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:09,266
and today I'll be discussing

5
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:12,173
the formal fallacy of[br]denying the antecedent.

6
00:00:12,173 --> 00:00:14,407
Denying the antecedent[br]is a formal fallacy,

7
00:00:14,407 --> 00:00:17,597
meaning that the argument has a flaw

8
00:00:17,597 --> 00:00:20,482
contained in its logical form.

9
00:00:20,483 --> 00:00:21,437
This is important because

10
00:00:21,437 --> 00:00:23,610
whenever this pattern of argument occurs,

11
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:25,501
regardless of topic or content,

12
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:27,560
the argument will always be invalid.

13
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:29,564
So how can we tell when

14
00:00:29,565 --> 00:00:31,909
the fallacy of denying[br]the antecedent occurs?

15
00:00:32,978 --> 00:00:34,502
Well, it happens when we mistake

16
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:36,777
the direction of a conditional,

17
00:00:36,777 --> 00:00:39,161
or confuse it for a biconditional.

18
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:41,917
And it starts with the denial of

19
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:44,435
the conditional statement's antecedent,

20
00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:47,360
then concludes the[br]denial of its consequent.

21
00:00:48,356 --> 00:00:50,085
The logical form of arguments that commit

22
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:53,984
the fallacy of denying the[br]antecedent look like this:

23
00:00:53,984 --> 00:00:56,381
"If P, then Q.

24
00:00:56,381 --> 00:00:59,062
"Not P. Therefore, not Q."

25
00:01:00,487 --> 00:01:02,822
Now, let's take a look[br]at this conditional:

26
00:01:02,822 --> 00:01:07,395
"If you are a ski instructor,[br]then you have a job."

27
00:01:07,394 --> 00:01:09,506
The antecedent statement[br]of this conditional

28
00:01:09,507 --> 00:01:11,621
is "you are a ski instructor,"

29
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,581
and the consequent is "you have a job."

30
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:17,247
But suppose someone made an argument

31
00:01:17,248 --> 00:01:20,072
with this conditional[br]as its first premise.

32
00:01:20,072 --> 00:01:24,156
Premise (1): If you are a ski[br]instructor, then you have a job.

33
00:01:24,156 --> 00:01:27,853
Premise (2): But you are[br]not a ski instructor.

34
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:30,594
Conclusion: Therefore,[br]you do not have a job.

35
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:35,920
Here, the second premise is[br]a denial of the antecedent.

36
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,728
This premise does not tell us

37
00:01:37,727 --> 00:01:39,942
that only ski instructors have jobs.

38
00:01:39,942 --> 00:01:42,603
So, even if the conditional[br]statement is true

39
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,858
(that ski instructors have jobs),

40
00:01:44,858 --> 00:01:49,713
it cannot be inferred that if[br]you are not a ski instructor,

41
00:01:49,713 --> 00:01:52,051
then you are unemployed.

42
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:53,859
A conditional could validly

43
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:56,480
be used to argue for the[br]truth of this consequent

44
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,039
by affirming the antecedent.

45
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,137
We find this in the arguments

46
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:02,290
of a form called "modus ponens."

47
00:02:04,018 --> 00:02:07,064
It is also valid to argue from[br]the denial of a consequent

48
00:02:07,064 --> 00:02:09,478
to a denial of the antecedent.

49
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,479
But it is never, ever valid[br]to deny the antecedent

50
00:02:14,644 --> 00:02:16,145
to reject its consequent.

51
00:02:17,865 --> 00:02:19,754
Let's try another example:

52
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:23,155
"If you are a property[br]owner, then you are a human.

53
00:02:24,426 --> 00:02:26,804
"But you are not a property owner.

54
00:02:26,804 --> 00:02:28,253
"Therefore, you are not a human."

55
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:31,171
The antecedent, that you are

56
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:33,651
a property owner, is being denied.

57
00:02:33,651 --> 00:02:36,738
Even though you need to be[br]a human to own property,

58
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,483
this has no bearing on humans

59
00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:41,181
who do not own property at all.

60
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:43,403
For example, graduate students.

61
00:02:43,402 --> 00:02:45,658
Let's consider one last example:

62
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:48,096
"If anyone is watching this video,

63
00:02:48,097 --> 00:02:49,926
"then they are on the internet.

64
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:52,708
"Some people are not watching this video.

65
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:55,003
"Therefore, they are not on the internet."

66
00:02:55,003 --> 00:02:57,341
Again, denying the antecedent

67
00:02:57,342 --> 00:02:58,885
by pointing out that not everyone

68
00:02:58,884 --> 00:03:00,936
is currently watching this video

69
00:03:00,937 --> 00:03:04,005
does not validly demonstrate[br]the denial of the consequent,

70
00:03:04,004 --> 00:03:06,646
that they're not on the internet at all.

71
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:09,450
These have been a few cases[br]that I hope will come in handy

72
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,314
in avoiding this formal[br]fallacy in your own arguments.

73
00:03:12,314 --> 00:03:15,382
For more related to the fallacy[br]of denying the antecedent,

74
00:03:15,382 --> 00:03:18,349
I recommend that you take a[br]look at the other related videos

75
00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:21,332
on informal and formal fallacies,

76
00:03:21,332 --> 00:03:25,082
the fallacy of affirming the[br]consequent, and conditionals.
