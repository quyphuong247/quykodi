(intro music)

00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:06,005
Hello, I'm Paul Henne

3
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:09,166
and I'm a philosophy graduate
student at Duke University.

4
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:12,483
And in this video I'm
going to discuss validity,

5
00:00:12,483 --> 00:00:16,666
an important tool for
evaluating deductive arguments.

6
00:00:17,035 --> 00:00:18,867
You've probably heard someone say

7
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:20,481
"that's a valid point," or

8
00:00:20,481 --> 00:00:21,907
maybe in an argument you've heard a friend

9
00:00:21,907 --> 00:00:24,661
say something like
"that's valid, but..."

10
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:27,223
In these everyday uses of the term

11
00:00:27,222 --> 00:00:29,785
"valid" or "validity,"

12
00:00:29,785 --> 00:00:32,347
people often mean to
convey something like

13
00:00:32,347 --> 00:00:34,006
"that's a good point," or

14
00:00:34,006 --> 00:00:35,783
"that statement's true."

15
00:00:35,783 --> 00:00:36,886
But I won't be talking,

16
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:38,348
in this video at least,

17
00:00:38,347 --> 00:00:40,368
about those usages.

18
00:00:40,368 --> 00:00:42,981
Instead, I'll be discussing the technical

19
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:45,721
philosophical notion of validity,

20
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,181
as in "a valid argument."

21
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:51,618
You already know that an
argument is a set of statements,

22
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:54,463
and that one or more of these statements

23
00:00:54,463 --> 00:00:56,285
is offered in support

24
00:00:56,284 --> 00:00:58,090
of some other statements.

25
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,439
The statements doing the supporting

26
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,518
are called "premises,"

27
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:05,641
and the statements being supported

28
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:07,611
are called "conclusions."

29
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:10,681
Validity, in the sense
that I'm talking about it,

30
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,396
applies to deductive arguments.

31
00:01:13,397 --> 00:01:16,808
So an argument is valid or invalid.

32
00:01:16,808 --> 00:01:19,179
Validity, then, isn't a
property of statements

33
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,560
or anything of the like.

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,968
So, what exactly is a valid argument then?

35
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,513
Well, suppose that you make
the following argument,

36
00:01:26,513 --> 00:01:29,627
and here I'll use "P"s
to stand for "premises"

37
00:01:29,626 --> 00:01:32,317
and I'll use a "C" to
stand for the conclusion.

38
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:36,999
(P1): All humans are mortal.

39
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:39,145
(P2): Iris Murdoch is a human.

40
00:01:39,144 --> 00:01:43,078
(C): Therefore, Iris Murdoch is mortal.

41
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:47,123
Suppose that I say that
your argument is valid.

42
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:50,164
Do I mean to say that
your argument is good?

43
00:01:50,164 --> 00:01:52,323
Do I mean to say that your conclusion,

44
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:55,782
or that all of the premises
and the conclusion, are true?

45
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:58,221
While this might sound
like what I'm saying,

46
00:01:58,221 --> 00:01:59,882
validity has nothing to do

47
00:01:59,882 --> 00:02:01,924
with the truth of the conclusion

48
00:02:01,924 --> 00:02:05,833
or with how good the
argument is in general.

49
00:02:06,402 --> 00:02:07,960
So, let's define it.

50
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:12,478
An argument is valid if and only if

51
00:02:12,478 --> 00:02:14,544
the truth of its premises

52
00:02:14,544 --> 00:02:18,253
guarantees the truth of its conclusion.

53
00:02:18,252 --> 00:02:22,042
That is, validity is a
property of arguments,

54
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:26,153
such that if the premises
of the arguments are true,

55
00:02:26,153 --> 00:02:29,526
then the conclusion must be true.

56
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:33,993
So it's impossible for a valid argument

57
00:02:33,993 --> 00:02:36,682
to have all true premises

58
00:02:36,682 --> 00:02:39,900
unless the conclusion is also true.

59
00:02:40,515 --> 00:02:43,241
When an argument is valid in this sense,

60
00:02:43,241 --> 00:02:47,676
we say that the premises
entail the conclusion.

61
00:02:48,122 --> 00:02:50,971
So, let's back up for a second.

62
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:53,598
An argument is composed of statements.

63
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:55,517
Statements can be true or false,

64
00:02:55,516 --> 00:02:58,598
like the statement "this
square is orange."

65
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:01,210
Arguments cannot be true or false.

66
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:04,508
They can, however, be valid or invalid,

67
00:03:04,508 --> 00:03:06,322
as well as other things.

68
00:03:06,322 --> 00:03:09,097
And, if an argument is valid,

69
00:03:09,097 --> 00:03:11,198
then if its premises are true,

70
00:03:11,198 --> 00:03:13,316
its conclusion is true.

71
00:03:14,253 --> 00:03:17,480
Notice that I have not
said that a valid argument

72
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,895
has true or false premises

73
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:22,060
or a true and false conclusion.

74
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:24,641
I have said something conditional.

75
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,578
That is, if the argument is valid,

76
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:29,437
then the truth of its conclusion

77
00:03:29,437 --> 00:03:32,331
follows from the truth of its premises.

78
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:36,193
Conversely, if the truth of the premises

79
00:03:36,193 --> 00:03:37,912
entails the conclusion,

80
00:03:37,912 --> 00:03:40,724
then the argument is valid.

81
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:43,252
Now, this all sounds very abstract,

82
00:03:43,252 --> 00:03:44,900
so let's return to some examples.

83
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,757
Let's look at our previous example.

84
00:03:46,757 --> 00:03:47,918
I have said that the argument

85
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:51,390
about the British philosopher,
Iris Murdoch is valid.

86
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:52,810
Am I right?

87
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:53,391
Yes!

88
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:55,953
If the premises of the argument are true,

89
00:03:55,953 --> 00:03:58,817
then the conclusion must
be true, in this case.

90
00:03:59,371 --> 00:04:00,677
Remember, it doesn't matter

91
00:04:00,676 --> 00:04:03,173
if our premises are true or false.

92
00:04:03,174 --> 00:04:04,578
Consider, for example, an argument

93
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,920
with all false premises in it.

94
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:10,613
(P1): All humans are immortal.

95
00:04:10,614 --> 00:04:13,800
Premise (2): Iris Murdoch is a human.

96
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,983
Conclusion: Therefore,
Iris Murdoch is immortal.

97
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:21,322
This argument is also valid,

98
00:04:21,322 --> 00:04:22,593
just like the first argument.

99
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:24,755
The truth of the premises entails

100
00:04:24,755 --> 00:04:27,178
the truth of the conclusion, right?

101
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:30,916
If it is the case that
all humans are immortal,

102
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:35,226
and it is the case that Iris
Murdoch is one of these humans,

103
00:04:35,226 --> 00:04:36,968
then it's necessarily the case

104
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:39,510
that Iris Murdoch is immortal.

105
00:04:39,511 --> 00:04:41,610
Let's try an example with premises

106
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,763
of which we don't know the truth.

107
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,591
(P1): All aliens speak English.

108
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:50,656
(P2): Splock is an alien.

109
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:54,542
Conclusion: Therefore,
Splock speaks English.

110
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,506
We don't know if there are aliens,

111
00:04:56,507 --> 00:04:58,394
let alone ones that can speak at all.

112
00:04:58,394 --> 00:05:00,449
We don't know if they speak English.

113
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:01,250
It could be the case,

114
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,771
or it couldn't be the case.

115
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:05,372
But this argument, nonetheless, is valid.

116
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:08,112
If premise one and two are true,

117
00:05:08,112 --> 00:05:10,736
then the conclusion must be true.

118
00:05:10,735 --> 00:05:12,945
We could even use undefined terms.

119
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:16,111
(P1): All sliff are splat.

120
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,094
(P2): Sniff is a sliff.

121
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:22,972
Conclusion: Therefore, sniff is a splat.

122
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:26,709
Again, although the truth of
the premises is undefined,

123
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:28,415
we have a valid argument.

124
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:31,052
This is just one type
of valid argument form,

125
00:05:31,052 --> 00:05:32,411
and you can learn about others

126
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:34,035
in upcoming videos.

127
00:05:34,035 --> 00:05:35,556
Note now what it means

128
00:05:35,555 --> 00:05:37,403
for an argument to be invalid.

129
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,735
The truth of the argument's premises

130
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:42,801
does not entail the
truth of the conclusion.

131
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:44,682
For instance:

132
00:05:44,682 --> 00:05:47,682
(P1): All dogs have fur.

133
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:50,555
(P2): Claire has a lot of fur.

134
00:05:50,555 --> 00:05:54,189
Conclusion: Therefore, Claire is a dog.

135
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:55,826
Now, it could be the case

136
00:05:55,826 --> 00:05:57,875
that all of the premises in this argument

137
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:01,221
are true, but the conclusion false.

138
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:02,614
The truth of this conclusion,

139
00:06:02,615 --> 00:06:03,569
in other words,

140
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:06,576
does not follow from the premises, right?

141
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:09,990
Because cats also have a lot of fur.

142
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,129
So this is an invalid argument.

143
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:16,747
You may wonder why
validity matters at all,

144
00:06:16,747 --> 00:06:19,545
if the truth of the
premises doesn't matter.

145
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,788
This is a good question to ask,

146
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:22,795
and it deserves a long discussion.

147
00:06:22,795 --> 00:06:25,013
But the short answer is
that validity is used

148
00:06:25,012 --> 00:06:27,949
to determine whether or
not an argument obeys

149
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:31,512
valid inference rules, the
laws of deductive logic.

150
00:06:31,512 --> 00:06:34,834
That is, we are ensuring that
inferences in the argument

151
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:37,139
are good inferences to make.

152
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,711
I'll leave you with one last example,

153
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:40,812
and ask you to determine

154
00:06:40,812 --> 00:06:43,137
its validity or invalidity.

155
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:46,687
(P1): All fruit is a chair.

156
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:49,914
(P2): Square is a chair.

157
00:06:49,915 --> 00:06:53,809
Conclusion: Therefore, square is a fruit.

158
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:55,486
What do you think?

159
