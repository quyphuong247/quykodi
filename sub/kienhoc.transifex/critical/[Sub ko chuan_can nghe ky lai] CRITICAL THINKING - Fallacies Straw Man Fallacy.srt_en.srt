00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,010
hi I'm Joseph flu and I'm a philosophy

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,679
graduate student at the University of

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,379
Cambridge in this video I'll explain the

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,000
straw man fallacy and informal fallacy

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,800
that comes up all the time

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,180
let's start off with an example to see

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,920
how it works

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,199
suppose my friend Maureen presents the

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,599
following argument i miss one

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,990
advertisement for beer encourage

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,910
underage drinking promise to underage

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,870
drinking often has negative consequences

13
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:40,050
conclusion therefore advertisements for

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,309
beer should be banned from TV and let's

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,300
say I respond with the following

16
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,629
objection

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,800
well yeah but people will never give up

18
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,680
drinking beer

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,559
they've been doing it for ages is this a

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,719
good response to Maureen's argument no

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,430
because Maureen ever claims it would be

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,460
a good idea to give up drinking beer

23
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,680
that's not her argument all in this

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,989
scenario I've committed the straw man

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,650
fallacy since I've attacked position

26
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:10,590
that Maureen ever advances the strawman

27
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,170
strawperson fallacy occurs when an

28
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,259
opponent's position is misrepresented in

29
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,270
order to make it easier to critique just

30
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,460
like how a man made of straw is intended

31
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,439
to resemble an actual man a straw man

32
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,479
fallacy occurs when an opponent's

33
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,850
position is presented in the way that

34
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,579
resembles the original claim that is not

35
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,409
the actual claim advanced it creates the

36
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,750
illusion that a position has been

37
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,579
refuted or critiqued by switching out

38
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,829
the original position with a different

39
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,509
one to see this more clearly

40
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,329
consider the following two claims

41
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,790
advertisements for beer should be banned

42
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,369
from TV this is Maureen's original claim

43
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,259
people should stop drinking beer

44
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,420
this is my portrayal of Maureen's

45
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,240
original claim and these are two very

46
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,219
different claims Mourinho endorse the

47
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,460
first one based on our conversation

48
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:02,790
however my objection is the second claim

49
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,290
which is much easier to refute this is

50
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,930
because the second claim is a very

51
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,970
extreme view it would take a lot of good

52
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,619
arguments to convince others that people

53
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,989
should stop drinking beer

54
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:15,299
but an argument i have improperly

55
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:18,180
attributed this extreme you too Maureen

56
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:20,250
and then proceeded to attack it since

57
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,440
this claim is much easier to refute that

58
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,379
her original claim I've committed the

59
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,360
straw man fallacy the general structure

60
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:31,260
straumann fallacies goes like this

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:35,340
first-person one advances position X

62
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:37,769
second person to present a distorted

63
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,519
version of position X let's call this

64
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:44,760
position Y third person to a tax

65
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:48,390
position Y and fourth person to

66
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,980
concludes that position X is false in

67
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,930
the straw man fallacy we've just

68
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,239
considered the original view is

69
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,519
exaggerated to a very extreme view and

70
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,170
then attacked but there are other ways

71
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:02,069
in which position can be misrepresented

72
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:04,620
as well sometimes a position can be over

73
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:07,319
simplified to the point of being absurd

74
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,760
here's an example of that suppose my

75
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,849
friend geo presents the following

76
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,859
argument Promised One the theory of

77
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:17,340
evolution says that humans are no

78
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:19,139
different from apes promise to humans

79
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,870
are different from apes because humans

80
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:24,389
are obviously smarter conclusion

81
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,319
therefore the theory of evolution is

82
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:28,530
false

83
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:30,090
is this a good argument clearly not

84
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,799
since the theory of evolution does not

85
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,129
claim that humans are no different from

86
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,440
apes Gio has falsely characterize what

87
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:39,120
the theory of evolution says and then

88
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,769
proceeded to attack it

89
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,769
he has committed the straw man fallacy

90
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:46,440
but it's worth noting that the structure

91
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:49,169
of his argument is valid so for anyone

92
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,449
not familiar with evolutionary theory it

93
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:54,329
might seem as if Gio has provided a good

94
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:56,129
argument against evolution and this is

95
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:58,709
why strong and fallacies can often be

96
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:01,410
difficult to spot the straw man fallacy

97
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:03,329
is prevalent in politics as well and it

98
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,720
is not just used to misrepresent an

99
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:08,790
opponent's position often strong men are

100
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,859
set up to distract people from difficult

101
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:13,889
topics that politicians want to avoid

102
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:16,410
for example consider how politicians

103
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:18,060
construct straumann responses by

104
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:21,120
answering a question they were never

105
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,310
asked suppose a politician is being

106
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,090
accused of illegally using campaign

107
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,669
funds for /

108
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:30,180
it's no use let's say reporter asked the

109
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:32,400
politician directly so did you or did

110
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,030
you not use campaign funds for personal

111
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,130
spending and the politician my respond

112
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,560
with something like this that's an

113
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:43,050
excellent question i received a lot of

114
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,910
generous donations to my campaign my

115
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,620
favorite donation has been a handwritten

116
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,430
card thanking me for everything I've

117
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,590
done

118
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,360
I really love that card especially since

119
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,780
I value the dedication of working-class

120
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,729
people in this example the politician

121
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,770
sets of a strawman by responding to a

122
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:01,229
different question the one originally

123
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,700
asked the question was whether campaign

124
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:05,220
funds have been used for personal

125
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,320
spending but the politician provides an

126
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,260
answer to the question what has been

127
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,750
your favorite campaign donation this is

128
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,669
a much easier question to answer and it

129
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,860
allows the politician to avoid answering

130
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:19,560
the original question while also

131
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,590
portraying himself or herself positively

132
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,389
strongman palaces are everywhere and

133
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,190
you've probably come across variations

134
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:29,010
of the examples presented herein your

135
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:31,350
everyday life sometimes strawman

136
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,780
fallacies are intentional which is often

137
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,820
the case in politics but other times

138
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:38,039
they are unintentional like when someone

139
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,500
genuinely misunderstands and opponents

140
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:42,870
claim in order to keep discussions

141
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,210
productive is important to grasp the

142
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:47,820
exact position being advanced before

143
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,440
proceeding to attack it otherwise you

144
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:54,770
may be guilty of committing the straw

145
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,770
man fallacy
