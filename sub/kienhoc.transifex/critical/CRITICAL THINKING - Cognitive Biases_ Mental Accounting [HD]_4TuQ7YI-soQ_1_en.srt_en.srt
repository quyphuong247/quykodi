(intro music)

2
00:00:05,855 --> 00:00:07,600
My name is Laurie Santos.

3
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:10,669
I teach psychology at Yale
University, and today

4
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:13,120
I want to talk to you about
mental accounting.

5
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,949
This lecture is part of a
series on cognitive biases.

6
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,989
Imagine that you decide to go see a
new movie opening up in your town

7
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:24,699
You head to the counter and hand
the cashier a twenty dollar bill.

8
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:27,789
She gives you back a ten dollar
bill and a ten dollar ticket.

9
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:29,279
But when you get to the theater door,

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,450
you realize you don't know where your ticket is.

11
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:33,289
It's not in your purse or your pocket.

12
00:00:33,289 --> 00:00:34,280
It's just lost.

13
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:35,740
What would you do?

14
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,780
Do you think you'd pay ten
dollars for a new ticket,

15
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,170
or would you just head home?

16
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,480
If you're like most people, you might
be tempted to head home.

17
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:46,269
In fact, when the psychologists
Kahneman and Tversky

18
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,170
presented this problem to college
students, fifty-four percent of people said

19
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,820
they'd probably just head back home.

20
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,230
But now imagine a different scenario.

21
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:56,509
This time, you decide to see the movie,

22
00:00:56,509 --> 00:00:59,289
and you head to the counter and
hand the cashier twenty dollars.

23
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:02,289
This time, she gives you
back two ten dollar bills,

24
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:05,250
so that you can easily pay ten
dollars at the door to get in.

25
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,638
But when you get to the door,

26
00:01:06,638 --> 00:01:11,028
you realize that you can only find
one of the ten dollar bills.

27
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:13,388
The other one's not in your
purse or your pocket.

28
00:01:13,388 --> 00:01:14,388
It's just lost.

29
00:01:14,388 --> 00:01:15,909
What would you do?

30
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,390
Would you pay ten dollars for
the movie or just head home?

31
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,920
if you're like most people, you'd
probably still go see the movie.

32
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,840
In fact, when Kahneman and
Tversky presented this

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,510
problem to college students, eighty-eight

34
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,679
percent of people said they'd
probably go to the movie anyway.

35
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:32,469
The different responses to these cases

36
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:35,448
illustrate a bias known
as "mental accounting."

37
00:01:35,448 --> 00:01:37,390
We use different accounts in our heads for

38
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,560
different activities, and the resources
from one account aren't automatically

39
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,250
transferred for use in another.

40
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,019
This is why we pretty rarely
take fifty dollars from our

41
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:51,578
401k account to have a nice meal, or why
we sometimes blow our tax return on stuff

42
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,089
we'd never blow our savings on.

43
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,090
In our head, we automatically
set up different

44
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,549
accounts for different stuff, and if we
end up with extra money we didn't expect,

45
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,069
say from a windfall in a tax return, or
even from an unexpected coupon,

46
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:07,429
we end up blowing that money
in this new extra account.

47
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:11,188
It's why gamblers gamble a lot more when
they're playing with house money.

48
00:02:11,188 --> 00:02:13,129
We use different mental
accounts all the time,

49
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:17,500
from the money we plan to spend on
something fun like movies and plays,

50
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,280
to the accounts we keep for
our kids' college tuition.

51
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,870
Our minds just naturally
keep things separate.

52
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,189
The problem is that our intuition
to keep things separate

53
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:31,300
violates a classic economic principle:
the idea that money should be fungible.

54
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,350
Classical economist are often
puzzled by the fact that we

55
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:36,389
can't just think of money as, well, money.

56
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:40,509
Why shouldn't a ten dollar ticket and
a ten dollar bill be the same thing?

57
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:42,530
To an economist, it should be.

58
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,000
But for our minds, not so much.

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,509
The good news is that we can use

60
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:49,000
these funny mental accounts
to our advantage.

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,560
A friend of the behavioral economist
Dick Thaler did just this.

62
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,150
He set up a new account with money that

63
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,860
he planned to donate to charity
at the end of every year.

64
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,840
Each time something bad happened,

65
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,390
a parking ticket or lost ten
dollars for a movie,

66
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,409
he took the money out of
that account instead.

67
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:08,579
His mental accounting caused him to think
that the money wasn't really his anyway,

68
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,420
and it made him feel less bad
whenever he experienced losses.

69
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:14,629
Our biases toward mental accounting

70
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:18,479
mean that our minds don't work in the way
that classical economists like to think.

71
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,969
But we can use these mental accounting
biases to our advantage.

72
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:25,819
We have control over which accounts
we set up and which we deduct from

73
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:30,400
Just be sure to remember that the next
time you happen to lose your movie ticket.

74
