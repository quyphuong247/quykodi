00:00:04,645 --> 00:00:06,246
Hello, I'm Paul Henne

3
00:00:06,246 --> 00:00:07,526
and I'm a philosophy graduate student

4
00:00:07,525 --> 00:00:09,144
at Duke University.

5
00:00:09,144 --> 00:00:10,824
And in this video I'm gonna talk to you

6
00:00:10,824 --> 00:00:12,983
about a particular informal fallacy

7
00:00:12,984 --> 00:00:16,059
called the fallacy of composition.

8
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,339
In doing this, I'm also going to tell you

9
00:00:17,338 --> 00:00:20,098
why we sometimes can't conclude[br]that there are colorless cats.

10
00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:22,298
But I'll get to that idea in a second.

11
00:00:22,298 --> 00:00:24,257
To recall, an informal fallacy

12
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:27,658
is an argument whose premises[br]do not support its conclusion.

13
00:00:27,658 --> 00:00:31,138
Generally, a fallacy is[br]a defect in reasoning.

14
00:00:31,138 --> 00:00:34,519
And there are two types of[br]fallacies: formal and informal.

15
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,379
A formal fallacy is an[br]argument with an error

16
00:00:37,378 --> 00:00:39,039
in the form of the argument

17
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,265
and an informal fallacy contains

18
00:00:40,265 --> 00:00:42,426
an error in the content of the argument.

19
00:00:42,426 --> 00:00:44,585
But you can learn more[br]about this distinction

20
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:47,405
in the video about informal[br]and formal fallacies,

21
00:00:47,405 --> 00:00:49,024
which should be out soon.

22
00:00:49,024 --> 00:00:50,769
For this video, we're going to focus

23
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,931
on a particular informal fallacy.

24
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,349
So, the fallacy of composition[br]is an error in reasoning

25
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,990
that arises in the content of an argument.

26
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,170
People commit this error[br]when they draw conclusions

27
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,870
about the whole from truths[br]about its constituent parts,

28
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,331
without having a[br]justification for doing so.

29
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:09,389
That is, they think without justification

30
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,700
that what is true of[br]the parts of something

31
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,930
must also be true of the whole

32
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,829
those parts compose.

33
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:17,411
Sounds problematic, right?

34
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:21,147
But let's represent this[br]logical error more formally.

35
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,748
The reasoning would be[br]something like this.

36
00:01:23,748 --> 00:01:26,089
Premise one: The parts of whole A

37
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,689
have qualities X, Y, and Z.

38
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:31,289
Conclusion one: Therefore, whole A

39
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,810
must have qualities X, Y, and Z.

40
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,090
The argument seems[br]attractive, but the style

41
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,510
of argument is like saying

42
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,909
that because the states[br]have some set of qualities,

43
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:43,400
then the entire nation[br]must have those qualities.

44
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,320
You may now be able to see what's wrong

45
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,779
with this line of reasoning.

46
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,090
Without sufficient justification,

47
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,640
we cannot infer that the[br]whole has the same qualities

48
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,269
as its parts simply because[br]the parts have that quality.

49
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:56,850
It may be the case that the[br]whole lacks the qualities

50
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:57,949
that the parts have.

51
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,811
It's like saying that because[br]Arizona has an arid climate,

52
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:03,610
the entire nation has an arid climate too.

53
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:05,908
Let's look at a few more examples.

54
00:02:05,908 --> 00:02:07,618
It's true that the number three

55
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:10,769
and the number seven are both odd numbers.

56
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:11,870
We might say that three and seven

57
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,310
have the characteristic of being odd.

58
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,911
Each is also a part of the number ten.

59
00:02:16,911 --> 00:02:18,520
Three plus seven equals ten.

60
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,391
But we cannot say that the number ten

61
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,251
is odd simply because its[br]parts, three and seven,

62
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:25,151
have that quality.

63
00:02:25,151 --> 00:02:28,350
If we did, we would commit[br]the fallacy of composition.

64
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,469
Let's try another example.

65
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:32,990
Suppose your friend made this argument.

66
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,669
Premise one: Atoms are colorless.

67
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:39,871
Premise two: Cats, we know, are[br]composed of a bunch of atoms.

68
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:44,871
Conclusion: Therefore,[br]cats are colorless too.

69
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,088
Well, we know that cats[br]are not in fact colorless

70
00:02:48,088 --> 00:02:51,687
but we can also see where[br]this person made her error.

71
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:53,429
Without justification,[br]she assumed that the whole

72
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:56,310
has the same qualities as its parts.

73
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,908
So, even though the premises[br]of her argument are true

74
00:02:59,908 --> 00:03:02,228
she committed the fallacy of composition.

75
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:05,309
So, we don't have to worry[br]about any colorless cats.

76
00:03:05,308 --> 00:03:08,527
So, we just learned about[br]the fallacy of composition,

77
00:03:08,527 --> 00:03:10,526
or the error in reasoning that comes about

78
00:03:10,526 --> 00:03:13,229
when one infers that the[br]whole has the same qualities

79
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:15,018
as its constituent parts.

80
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:16,629
It is important, however, to note

81
00:03:16,628 --> 00:03:18,050
that this style of reasoning

82
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,846
doesn't always lead to false conclusions.

83
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:23,728
You friend, for instance,[br]might argue the following.

84
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:28,709
Premise one: Every part of[br]my cat is composed of matter.

85
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,789
Conclusion: Therefore, my[br]cat is composed of matter.

86
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:35,569
And her argument leads[br]to a true conclusion.

87
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:37,087
The fallacy only arises when we don't

88
00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:39,686
have a good reason to infer that the whole

89
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,188
has the same qualities as its parts.

90
00:03:42,187 --> 00:03:45,006
So, remember to stay[br]vigilant of this fallacy

91
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:49,207
and not to worry about any colorless cats.

92
