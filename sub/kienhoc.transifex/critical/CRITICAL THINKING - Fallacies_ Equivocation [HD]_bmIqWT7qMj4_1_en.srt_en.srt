Hello. I'm Joseph Wu,

2
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:11,340
and I'm a Philosophy graduate student
at the University of Cambridge.

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,330
In this video, I'll be explaining the
informal fallacy known as equivocation,

4
00:00:16,687 --> 00:00:18,278
a fallacy that comes up all the time.

5
00:00:19,015 --> 00:00:21,331
Before we look at some more problematic
examples,

6
00:00:21,798 --> 00:00:24,399
let's start off with a simple one,
to see how it works.

7
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:26,785
Consider the following argument:

8
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:28,202
Premise one:

9
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:31,012
All stars are exploding balls of gas.

10
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:32,229
Premise two:

11
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:34,151
Miley Cyrus is a star.

12
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:35,341
Conclusion:

13
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,260
Therefore, Miley Cyrus is an exploding
ball of gas.

14
00:00:40,093 --> 00:00:42,087
Wow, this is clearly a terrible argument!

15
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:44,647
The form of this argument appears to
be valid,

16
00:00:45,173 --> 00:00:49,173
and each of the premises, when considered
individually, is true.

17
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:54,592
You might recall from a previous video
that an argument with a valid form

18
00:00:54,593 --> 00:00:57,150
and true premises is considered sound.

19
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:00,173
You might also recall that a sound
argument

20
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,414
necessarily has a true conclusion.

21
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:07,177
But you're probably not convinced that
Miley Cyrus is an exploding ball of gas.

22
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:09,695
And you're right to think that the logic
is flawed.

23
00:01:10,225 --> 00:01:11,316
So what's wrong with this argument?

24
00:01:12,418 --> 00:01:14,858
This argument commits the fallacy of
equivocation.

25
00:01:15,448 --> 00:01:18,438
Here, the word "star" is used with
different meanings

26
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:19,540
in the two premises.

27
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:23,587
In the first premise, star is intended
to mean something like:

28
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:25,887
a celestial sphere of plasma.

29
00:01:26,302 --> 00:01:28,932
But then the meaning of star shifts
in the second premise,

30
00:01:29,204 --> 00:01:31,635
where star refers to a famous person.

31
00:01:31,963 --> 00:01:35,240
The premises equivocate between two
meanings of the word "star."

32
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:39,995
To be precise, equivocation occurs when
the same word is used

33
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:42,859
to express different meanings through out
an argument.

34
00:01:43,543 --> 00:01:46,490
The arguer is committing a fallacy,
because he or she

35
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:49,795
uses the word as if that word have the
same meaning,

36
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:52,387
and so the argument would appear to
be valid,

37
00:01:52,995 --> 00:01:54,359
even though it actually is not.

38
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:57,704
Equivocation results from ambiguities
in language.

39
00:01:58,179 --> 00:02:01,716
Since many words can have more than
one meaning, we need to be cautious

40
00:02:01,716 --> 00:02:05,463
that key terms are not shifting meaning
during the course of an argument.

41
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:10,569
Since equivocation results from multiple
meanings of a single term,

42
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:16,222
a helpful strategy to expose this fallacy
is to restate the premises of the argument

43
00:02:16,475 --> 00:02:18,431
but without the ambiguous term.

44
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,676
For example, let's substitute our
definitions of the word "star"

45
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:25,338
into the premises of the previous example.

46
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,308
Premise one:

47
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,191
All celestial spheres of plasma are
exploding balls of gas.

48
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,611
Premise two:

49
00:02:33,342 --> 00:02:35,161
Miley Cyrus is a famous person.

50
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,236
Conclusion:

51
00:02:36,754 --> 00:02:39,950
Therefore, Miley Cyrus is an exploding
ball of gas.

52
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:43,549
Clearly, this argument isn't valid,

53
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:46,254
once we got rid of the ambiguous term,
"star."

54
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,352
Even though both of the premises are true,
the conclusion does not follow.

55
00:02:52,948 --> 00:02:55,050
This example is surely far fetched.

56
00:02:55,451 --> 00:02:59,550
After all, no one has ever equivocated
Miley being a fomous person

57
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:02,281
with Miley being an exploding ball of gas.

58
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:05,405
But know that we understand how this
fallacy generally works,

59
00:03:05,962 --> 00:03:08,673
let's look at two examples that are not so
easy to spot.

60
00:03:10,192 --> 00:03:14,780
Suppose a respectable newspaper was
criticized for spreading celebrity gossip.,

61
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,081
and suppose that, in response,
the editor gave the following argument:

62
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:20,901
Premise one:

63
00:03:21,146 --> 00:03:24,780
Newspapers have a duty to print stories
that are in the public interest.

64
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:26,433
Premise two:

65
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:29,968
The public has great interest in rumors
about celebrities,

66
00:03:29,968 --> 00:03:33,704
since circulation increases when
newspapers print such stories.

67
00:03:34,371 --> 00:03:35,112
Conclusion:

68
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:38,264
It's not wrong for respectable newspapers
to pass on rumors

69
00:03:38,264 --> 00:03:39,371
about celebrities.

70
00:03:40,912 --> 00:03:44,750
As with our Miley Cyrus example, this
argument appears to be valid.

71
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,341
But is it actually?

72
00:03:47,342 --> 00:03:50,145
The key term that shows in both
premises of this argument

73
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:51,082
is "interest."

74
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:53,142
So let's focus on how it is used.

75
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,402
In the first premise, interest is used
to mean

76
00:03:56,401 --> 00:03:58,172
the benefit of a person or a group,

77
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,552
like in the sentence:

78
00:03:59,551 --> 00:04:03,055
It is in your interest to keep your
bank account information private.

79
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:04,717
In the second premise,

80
00:04:04,717 --> 00:04:08,280
interest is used to mean an activity
one enjoys doing,

81
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,342
like in the sentence:

82
00:04:09,342 --> 00:04:12,403
My interests are swimming, hiking,
and reading.

83
00:04:13,341 --> 00:04:17,088
Since the meaning of the term "interest"
has shifted between the first and second

84
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:18,310
premises,

85
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,209
this editor has committed the fallacy
of equivocation;

86
00:04:21,572 --> 00:04:22,722
his argument isn't valid.

87
00:04:24,324 --> 00:04:25,783
Here's another example.

88
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:27,723
Suppose your friend tells you this:

89
00:04:28,161 --> 00:04:31,074
Organic compounds contain carbon,

90
00:04:31,074 --> 00:04:34,697
and organic foods are better for the
environment,

91
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:37,008
so when you're grocery shopping,

92
00:04:37,507 --> 00:04:40,229
you should look for foods that contain
carbon in it,

93
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,422
as these foods are better for 
the environment.

94
00:04:43,738 --> 00:04:47,050
The absurdity of the conclusion should
alert us that something has gone wrong

95
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,361
int this argument.

96
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:52,045
So let's take a closer look at how the
term "organic" is being used.

97
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,255
The statement "organic compounds contain
carbon" is true.

98
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,983
This is the scientific definition of
"organic" used by chemists.

99
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:05,064
The next statement:,"organic foods are
better for the environment," is also true.

100
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:09,284
But note that, now, the definition of
organic refers to the methods

101
00:05:09,283 --> 00:05:11,524
by which that food was produced
and processed.

102
00:05:12,543 --> 00:05:15,402
The term "organic" is now used in an
agricultural sense,

103
00:05:15,692 --> 00:05:17,072
rather than a scientific one.

104
00:05:17,954 --> 00:05:21,555
This argument equivocates between two
different meanings of organic,

105
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:22,524
so it isn't valid.

106
00:05:23,677 --> 00:05:28,086
It's worth noting that even if we limit the
term "organic" to its agricultural sense,

107
00:05:28,086 --> 00:05:32,147
the thread of equivocation still looms,
due to the ambiguity of the term.

108
00:05:32,785 --> 00:05:36,632
For instance, different countries have
different standards for what counts as

109
00:05:36,632 --> 00:05:37,403
organic.

110
00:05:37,932 --> 00:05:40,194
Different foods also adhere to different
standards.

111
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,525
And in the United States, there are various
categories for labeling organic products,

112
00:05:45,524 --> 00:05:49,346
ranging from a product made with 100 %
organic ingredients,

113
00:05:49,346 --> 00:05:52,846
to a product made with at least 70 %
organic ingredients.

114
00:05:54,903 --> 00:05:58,132
If you're ever suspicious that an
argument is guilty of equivocation,

115
00:05:58,132 --> 00:06:01,350
try the method we used in the first
example of this video:

116
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:06,877
First, distinguish the potential meanings
of the ambiguous term in an argument.

117
00:06:06,877 --> 00:06:10,800
Then, restate the argument without the
ambiguous term,

118
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,932
so that the premises are still true.

119
00:06:12,932 --> 00:06:16,060
Finally, evaluate the translated
argument.

120
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:17,497
Is it valid?

121
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:22,253
If not, then the argument has committed
the fallacy of equivocation.

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
