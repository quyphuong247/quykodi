00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,929
(intro music)

2
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:07,339
My name is Laurie Santos.

3
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:10,339
I teach psychology at Yale
University, and today

4
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:13,109
I want to talk to you about
peak-end effects.

5
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:17,000
This lecture is part of a
series on cognitive biases.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,289
I want you to think back to the last

7
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,070
time you went to a restaurant
and had an expensive meal.

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,510
Now remember all the different
parts of that event.

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,590
Done?

10
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:29,190
Well, then I want you to answer a
very simple question: how was it?

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,118
No matter whether you said it was just

12
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:35,308
so-so or the best meal ever, I bet you
experienced the act of answering

13
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:37,579
this question as relatively simple.

14
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,479
Deciding whether some event was good

15
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:41,619
or bad is something we find pretty easy.

16
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:43,369
We can quickly say whether we

17
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:46,500
liked a particular movie, or how
much fun we had on vacation,

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,229
or even how our last job interview went.

19
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:52,479
But making this kind of judgment
should involve some pretty

20
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:54,078
complicated computations.

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,539
To judge how your last
restaurant meal was, you might

22
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,750
have to computationally combine how you
rated a whole bunch of different

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,088
points in the experience, and you have to
judge how each of them fits together, and

24
00:01:05,088 --> 00:01:06,659
come up with an overall rating.

25
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,500
You also have to decide how
many time points you're

26
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,379
going to sample to figure out your rating.

27
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:13,189
When you thought about the restaurant,

28
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:16,149
did your mind give you a rating
to the experience across every

29
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,500
single minute, or every second,
or even every millisecond?

30
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,719
It turns out that our minds figure out

31
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,939
this complicated problem by using
a surprisingly streamline strategy.

32
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,000
In fact, when we remember an event,

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,319
we tend to ignore lots and lots
of the parts of that event.

34
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:37,558
In fact, we seem to make an evaluation
based on only two parts of our experience:

35
00:01:37,558 --> 00:01:41,120
the peak (that is, the part
of the experience that's most extreme,

36
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,100
either good or bad) and the
end (that is, how it ended).

37
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:48,250
All of our memories, both
good ones and bad ones,

38
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:53,129
are often remembered as such because
of the action of these two points.

39
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:57,149
To study this effect, the psychologist
Danny Kahneman and his colleagues

40
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:59,549
presented participants
with a painful event.

41
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:02,810
They had to stick their hand in
really, really cold, fourteen

42
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,120
degree water for sixty seconds.

43
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,270
After that, the subjects were
given a second event.

44
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,999
It started out exactly
the same as the first.

45
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,370
Their hands were placed in
really, really cold, fourteen

46
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,300
degree water for sixty seconds.

47
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,030
But then the second painful
event continued.

48
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,009
Participants kept their hand in the water

49
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:23,310
for thirty more seconds, as the
temperature was increased

50
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,530
to a still painful, but not
as painful, fifteen degrees.

51
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,818
Kahneman and colleagues then
asked participants which event

52
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:34,228
they liked better, or which they
would prefer to experience again.

53
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:38,830
Surprisingly, participants overwhelmingly
preferred the second event.

54
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:43,670
Even though they were in pain for longer,
the second event ended a bit better.

55
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:46,448
And when you average the peak
and end point of each event,

56
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:52,170
the second one is better, even though
it involves overall more pain.

57
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:55,629
Kahneman and colleagues wondered whether
the same peak-end effect would work for

58
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:59,189
people's memories in situations that
we experience in the real world.

59
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:01,150
They teamed up with doctors who were

60
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,599
giving patients a painful
medical procedure.

61
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,079
Usually, the procedure went like this.

62
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,159
It started out as not so painful, and
gradually got more and more

63
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:13,818
painful, ending in a moment
of maximum pain.

64
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,818
Kahneman and his colleagues thought
that this procedure would be

65
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:21,699
remembered as particularly awful, not
because it was a painful procedure, but

66
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:25,568
because the peak and end point of
this procedure were particularly bad.

67
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:29,689
To test this assumption, Kahneman
and his colleagues ran a clinical trial.

68
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:33,789
They extended the length of the painful
procedure so it worked like this.

69
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:36,989
Patients had to be in
pain for overall longer,

70
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:40,229
but the procedure ended on
a slightly less painful note.

71
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:42,289
Kahneman and colleagues found that people

72
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,748
reported liking the second
procedure much better.

73
00:03:44,748 --> 00:03:48,558
They reported not feeling as much
pain, and were even willing to come

74
00:03:48,558 --> 00:03:50,818
back for more repeated procedures.

75
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:54,229
Kahneman and colleagues' clinical
trial highlights one of the most

76
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:57,849
surprising things about our peak-end
heuristic, namely, the information that

77
00:03:57,849 --> 00:03:59,780
it doesn't take into account,

78
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,060
and that's how long the
event happens to be.

79
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,860
Patient would rather be in pain for twice

80
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,779
as long, so long as the average of
the peak and end is more pleasant.

81
00:04:09,778 --> 00:04:12,948
Since our minds only take into
account the peak and the end when

82
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:17,309
remembering an event, there's no way
to tell how long a particular event was.

83
00:04:17,309 --> 00:04:20,830
We just kind of ignore that part
of the event in our evaluations.

84
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:24,149
This phenomena is known
as "duration neglect."

85
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:28,138
Our duration neglect means that wonderful
experiences can stay just as wonderful

86
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,410
even when you keep them really short.

87
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,810
It also means that you
can make somewhat

88
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,610
annoying experiences longer, and you
won't even remember them that way.

89
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,389
The peak-end effect also gives us some

90
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:42,509
hints about how to make an
event especially awesome.

91
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:47,360
Since each event's goodness involves only
its peak and its end point, we can make

92
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,970
events particularly fun by making
them end their best point possible.

93
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,299
In fact, lots of the events that we enjoy
most involve ends that are also peaks.

94
00:04:57,298 --> 00:05:02,408
>From the final winning goal to firework
finales, saving the best for last

95
00:05:02,408 --> 00:05:04,029
seems to make it an event better.

96
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:07,239
So next time you're having
a really nice meal,

97
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,400
be sure to save some room for dessert

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
