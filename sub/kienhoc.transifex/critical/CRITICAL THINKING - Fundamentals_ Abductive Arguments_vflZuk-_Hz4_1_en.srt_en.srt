00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,759
(intro music)

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,588
Hi! I'm Geoff Pynn, and I

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:09,750
teach philosophy in Northern
Illinois University.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,449
In this video, I'm going to talk
about abductive arguments.

5
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:18,500
Abductive arguments rest on an
inference to the best explanation .

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,379
The simplest way of thinking about this idea

7
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:23,169
is in terms of "why"-questions.

8
00:00:23,169 --> 00:00:26,429
Suppose you tell your friend that
someone has a crush on him,

9
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:28,019
and his cheeks turn bright red.

10
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,800
Why did that happen?

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,250
What's the explanation?

12
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,789
Well, the most natural answer
seems to be that it's

13
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:35,969
because he was embarrassed
to find out about the crush.

14
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,710
That's why his cheeks turned red.

15
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,039
This example can be turned into
an abductive argument.

16
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:45,469
The premise is "Charlie's
cheeks turned red

17
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:47,689
"after I told him that Lucy
had a crush on him."

18
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:52,539
And the conclusion is "So, Charlie was
embarrassed to learn about Lucy's crush."

19
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:56,989
Notice that the promise doesn't guarantee
that the conclusion is true.

20
00:00:56,988 --> 00:00:59,528
Something else might explain it instead.

21
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:01,960
Maybe Charlie was eating a jalapeno,

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,200
and his cheeks turned red
because it was so spicy.

23
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,250
Or maybe he just got scratched by a cat,

24
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,049
and he's having an allergic reaction.

25
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:11,719
If you let your imagination rip,

26
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:13,010
you'll be able to think of other possible

27
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,500
answers to the question "Why
did Charlie's cheeks turn red?" too.

28
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,549
Nonetheless, given your
background knowledge,

29
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:23,920
C seems like it's the best explanation
for P, or at least it's a contender.

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,478
If it is, then P gives you good
reason to believe C.

31
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:30,509
That's how abductive arguments work.

32
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,359
We know that some stuff is
true (these are the premises),

33
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:36,349
and reason from that to whatever is

34
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:39,729
the best answer to the question
"Why are these things true?"

35
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:44,210
Our knowledge doesn't guarantee
that the explanation is correct,

36
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:46,608
but that's OK, because abductive arguments

37
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:48,739
aren't supposed to be deductively valid.

38
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:53,239
Abductive arguments are nonetheless
extremely common in all walks of life.

39
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:57,319
It's a very important critical thinking
skill to be able to make,

40
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:00,629
spot, and evaluate abductive arguments.

41
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:03,629
Think of how a TV detective solves a crime.

42
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:07,569
Suppose she knows that the murder
weapon was found in Smith's trunk,

43
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:11,000
Smith doesn't have an alibi,
Smith had a motive

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,759
and Smith failed the lie detector test.

45
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,759
The best explanation for all this evidence

46
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,069
is that Smith's the murder.

47
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:22,129
And so the detective believes that Smith
is the murder, and for good reason.

48
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:25,509
She passes this argument
on to the prosecutor,

49
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:28,719
who uses it to convince the jury
to believe its conclusion too.

50
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,849
Abduction also plays a
crucial role in science.

51
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:35,849
Scientific hypotheses often rest on

52
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:39,219
inferences to the best explanation
for some observed data.

53
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:42,219
For example, that's how the planet
Neptune was discovered.

54
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:46,759
In the early 1800s, astronomers
noticed small discrepancies

55
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,949
between the observed orbit of Uranus

56
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:50,489
and the predictions that Newton's theory

57
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,209
of motion made about what
the orbit should be.

58
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:56,620
the best explanation
for these discrepancies

59
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,480
was that they were caused by another
planet that no one had ever observed.

60
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,269
And it turned out that this was correct.

61
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,610
There was another planet, which
we know as Neptune today.

62
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,340
So what makes something
a good explanation?

63
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,150
Well, there's a lot of debate about
this amongst philosophers,

64
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,340
but here are two characteristics
of good explanations

65
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,019
that most generally agree about.

66
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:23,039
First, the more an explanation fits in
with everything we already know,

67
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,828
the better it tends to be.

68
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,829
Consider another possible
explanation for the

69
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:30,310
discrepancies between the
observed orbit of Uranus

70
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,280
and the predictions of Newton's theory:
that Newton's theory was wrong.

71
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,299
To accept that Newton's theory was wrong
would require giving up on lots and lots

72
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:41,170
of other very good explanations,

73
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:44,518
and so wouldn't fit very well with
what astronomers already knew.

74
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,810
The idea that an unobserved planet
was causing the discrepancies

75
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,109
fit much better with what
they already knew,

76
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:53,799
and so counted as a better explanation.

77
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:57,310
Second, other things being equal,

78
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,919
a simpler explanation is better
than a complicated one.

79
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:03,739
Here's another possible explanation
for Charlie's blush:

80
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:06,969
Maybe he misheard you,
and thought you said that

81
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:09,030
Penny had a crush on him, and so he's

82
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,459
embarrassed to learn about
Penny's crush, not Lucy's.

83
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:15,459
This explanation could be right,

84
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:17,629
but its needlessly complicated.

85
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:24,699
Since the original explanation is simpler,
it's preferable to this more complex one.

86
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:27,339
Both fit and simplicity come in degrees,

87
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:31,289
and other factors are also relevant
to how good an explanation is.

88
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:35,930
There's no sure-fire recipe for saying
when an explanation is the best one.

89
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,259
One way to challenge an abductive argument

90
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:40,699
is to try to come up with a better

91
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:43,779
explanation of the data than
what the argument provides.

92
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:47,159
Another way to challenge
an abductive argument

93
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,010
is to look for more evidence
to add to the promises.

94
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:55,509
Suppose the detective also found out that
Smith had a very clever nemesis who had

95
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:57,009
a motive to commit the murder

96
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:00,189
and had been planning to
frame Smith for a long time.

97
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:02,750
Then Smith's being guilty would no longer

98
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,889
clearly be the best explanation for
all of the detective's evidence.

99
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,529
Now there's another, perhaps
equally good, contender,

100
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:12,789
namely, that Smith was
framed by his nemesis

101
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,960
It's important when relying
on an abductive argument

102
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,729
to make sure that you get all
of the evidence that you can

103
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,480
and then consider all of the evidence
before drawing your conclusion.

104
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,580
That's because the fact that a conclusion
is a good explanation for some

105
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:31,099
evidence doesn't mean that it's a good
explanation for all of your evidence.

106
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,660
So, summing up.

107
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,100
Abductive arguments are a
kind of ampliative argument:

108
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,720
their premises don't guarantee
their conclusions.

109
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,210
Abductive arguments involve an
inference to the best explanation:

110
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:48,370
their conclusions are supposed to be the
best explanations for their premises.

111
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:53,689
Abductive arguments play a central role
in everyday life and scientific inquiry.

112
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:58,170
Good explanations tend to fit with
our background knowledge

113
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,189
and to be simpler than the alternatives.

114
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:03,920
And finally, you can challenge an
abductive argument by coming up

115
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,090
with a better explanation for
the premises, or by finding

116
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:10,949
additional relevant evidence that isn't
well-explained by the conclusion.

117
