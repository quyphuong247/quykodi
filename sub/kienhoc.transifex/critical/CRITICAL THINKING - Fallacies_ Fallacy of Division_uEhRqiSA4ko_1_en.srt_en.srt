00:00:04,552 --> 00:00:06,530
Hello, I'm Paul Henne,

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,170
and I'm a philosophy graduate student

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,869
at Duke University.

5
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:12,089
And in this video I'm gonna talk to you

6
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:13,811
about an informal fallacy

7
00:00:13,811 --> 00:00:16,289
called the "fallacy of division."

8
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:18,431
And I'm also going to[br]discuss why it's wrong

9
00:00:18,431 --> 00:00:22,090
to conclude that water molecules are wet.

10
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:25,972
The fallacy of division[br]is a defect in reasoning

11
00:00:25,972 --> 00:00:29,131
that arises when someone[br]infers that what is true

12
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:33,112
of something must also be[br]true of that thing's parts.

13
00:00:33,112 --> 00:00:35,050
So, the fallacy is kind of like saying

14
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:37,850
that because a university[br]has some qualities,

15
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,371
then all of that university's departments

16
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:43,773
must also have those qualities.

17
00:00:43,773 --> 00:00:46,870
And that's a fallacy[br]because even if a university

18
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:50,049
is good all around, it doesn't necessarily

19
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:54,590
mean that the university[br]has a good taxidermy

20
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:55,849
program, for instance.

21
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:58,028
So, sounds problematic, right?

22
00:00:58,029 --> 00:01:02,569
But let's represent the[br]logical error more formally.

23
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:05,298
The reasoning is something like this.

24
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:10,170
Premise (1): Whole A has[br]properties A, B, and C.

25
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,850
Premise (2): P is a part of A.

26
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:18,088
Conclusion: Therefore,[br]P must have properties

27
00:01:18,088 --> 00:01:21,150
A, B, and C.

28
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,310
The argument seems attractive,

29
00:01:23,311 --> 00:01:25,890
but the style of argument will not always

30
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,191
lead to true conclusions,

31
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:29,769
for it might not be the case

32
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:34,107
that the parts and the whole[br]have the same qualities.

33
00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:35,609
You may now be able to see

34
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:37,808
what's going wrong with[br]this line of reasoning.

35
00:01:37,808 --> 00:01:40,310
So, let's look at a few examples.

36
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,609
Suppose that I have a car,

37
00:01:42,608 --> 00:01:45,869
and I made this argument about my car.

38
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:50,500
Premise (1): My car is red[br]and it goes really fast.

39
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,165
Premise (2): The muffler[br]is a part of my car.

40
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:58,165
Conclusion: Therefore, my car's muffler

41
00:01:58,165 --> 00:02:01,988
is red and goes really fast.

42
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:04,296
Okay, that was an easy one.

43
00:02:04,296 --> 00:02:06,867
Of course no one would make this argument,

44
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:08,766
or assume that I own a car,

45
00:02:08,766 --> 00:02:12,948
but it demonstrates where[br]the style of argument fails.

46
00:02:12,948 --> 00:02:15,087
Clearly the muffler doesn't have

47
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:17,745
the same properties as the car.

48
00:02:17,746 --> 00:02:21,207
So, let's try another[br]more familiar example.

49
00:02:21,206 --> 00:02:24,486
Suppose that your friend[br]made this argument:

50
00:02:24,486 --> 00:02:27,525
the computer is indestructible;

51
00:02:27,526 --> 00:02:31,752
the hard drive is a part of the computer;

52
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:36,223
therefore, the hard[br]drive is indestructible.

53
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:39,205
Now, suppose your friend's[br]premises are true.

54
00:02:39,205 --> 00:02:41,685
The conclusion could still be false.

55
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:43,884
Maybe your friend was making this argument

56
00:02:43,884 --> 00:02:45,875
in order to transfer the hard drive

57
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:49,686
of the indestructible computer[br]to a different computer.

58
00:02:49,686 --> 00:02:52,165
So, if would be unfortunate[br]for her to find out

59
00:02:52,164 --> 00:02:55,426
that the hard drive is only indestructible

60
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:58,365
when it's connected to[br]the other components

61
00:02:58,366 --> 00:03:00,547
of the original computer.

62
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:04,067
So, the hard drive itself[br]isn't indestructible

63
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:05,605
like the whole computer.

64
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:07,705
Your friend committed[br]the fallacy of division.

65
00:03:07,705 --> 00:03:11,706
That is, to be precise,[br]she hastily assumed

66
00:03:11,706 --> 00:03:15,385
that the hard drive, the[br]part, is indestructible

67
00:03:15,385 --> 00:03:19,359
like the whole computer.

68
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:21,747
So, we just learned about[br]the fallacy of division,

69
00:03:21,747 --> 00:03:23,947
or the error in reasoning that comes about

70
00:03:23,947 --> 00:03:27,346
when a person infers that[br]what is true of something

71
00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:31,044
must also be true of its parts.

72
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,186
It is important, however,[br]to note that this

73
00:03:34,186 --> 00:03:37,884
fallacious reasoning doesn't always lead

74
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:40,123
to a false conclusion.

75
00:03:40,123 --> 00:03:43,506
I, for instance, might[br]argue the following.

76
00:03:43,506 --> 00:03:46,305
Premise (1): The house in pink.

77
00:03:46,305 --> 00:03:49,986
Premise (2): The front[br]door is part of the house.

78
00:03:49,985 --> 00:03:54,884
Conclusion: Therefore, the[br]front door is also pink.

79
00:03:55,854 --> 00:03:58,064
And in this case, my argument leads

80
00:03:58,063 --> 00:04:00,444
to a true conclusion.

81
00:04:00,444 --> 00:04:02,402
For I've, for whatever reason,

82
00:04:02,402 --> 00:04:05,406
painted every part of my house pink.

83
00:04:05,406 --> 00:04:08,919
Simply because there's[br]fallacious reasoning

84
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:11,524
doesn't necessarily mean[br]that the conclusion

85
00:04:11,524 --> 00:04:13,644
will be false.

86
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:16,346
It's interesting to note that this fallacy

87
00:04:16,346 --> 00:04:19,745
is also the converse of[br]the fallacy of composition,

88
00:04:19,745 --> 00:04:21,706
which says that it's fallacious

89
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:24,465
to infer that what is true[br]of the parts of something

90
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:29,340
is also true of the whole[br]those parts compose.

91
00:04:29,341 --> 00:04:31,185
These fallacies are quite similar,

92
00:04:31,185 --> 00:04:33,863
so you might want to check[br]out that video as well.

93
00:04:33,863 --> 00:04:36,403
Anyway, watch out for this fallacy.

94
00:04:36,403 --> 00:04:39,002
And remember that just[br]because water is wet,

95
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:40,865
doesn't mean that you can conclude

96
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:44,223
that water molecules are wet too.

97
