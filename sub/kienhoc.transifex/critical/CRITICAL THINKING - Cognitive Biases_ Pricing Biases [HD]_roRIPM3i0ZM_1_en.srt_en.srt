2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,419
My name is Laurie Santos.

3
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:10,620
I teach psychology at Yale
University, and today

4
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:13,318
I want to talk to you
about pricing biases.

5
00:00:13,319 --> 00:00:17,208
This lecture is part of a
series on cognitive biases.

6
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:19,129
Congratulations!

7
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:22,559
You've just won a raffle, and
your prize is a bottle of wine

8
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:23,988
Here are your choices.

9
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:27,939
Option number one is a lovely
bottle of California Pinot Noir

10
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:29,478
the costs twenty dollars.

11
00:00:29,478 --> 00:00:32,478
Option number two is another
bottle of Pinot Noir, from the

12
00:00:32,478 --> 00:00:34,850
same region, that
costs fifty dollars.

13
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,770
Which would you choose?

14
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,640
If you're like most people, you probably
went with the more expensive wine.

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,899
People tend to pick the most expensive
option, whether their choices involve

16
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:46,429
wine, or meats, or even cassette players.

17
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:50,059
What's a bit weirder, though,
is the fact that we still like

18
00:00:50,058 --> 00:00:55,879
higher-priced good even when we know
that the price it totally arbitrary.

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,540
One experiment that showed this bias
at work was done by the neuroscientist

20
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,299
Hilke Plassman and her colleagues.

21
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:06,140
They allowed people to taste a
glass of wine from two bottles

22
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,439
that were labeled as either
ten dollars or ninety dollars.

23
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,739
What they didn't tell
participants, however,

24
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:14,219
was that the two bottles were identical.

25
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:16,929
They contained exactly
the same wine inside.

26
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:22,150
Even though the wines should have tasted
identically, people reported liking the

27
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,230
wine with the more expensive
price tag even better.

28
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,490
It seems that merely labeling one thing

29
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:30,069
as more expensive makes us like it more.

30
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:34,349
We seem to be confusing a
good's price with its value.

31
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:37,409
This confusion is what's
known as a "price effect."

32
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,759
Simply telling someone
something costs more

33
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,939
make them like it more.

34
00:01:40,938 --> 00:01:44,498
And the effect seems to hold for
lots of different kinds of goods.

35
00:01:44,498 --> 00:01:47,308
You might be tempted to think
that people aren't as fooled as

36
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:49,849
it seems in Plassman and
colleagues' studies.

37
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:52,409
Maybe people just say they
like expensive stuff better,

38
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,749
even though they don't really
subjectively feel like it's better.

39
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:59,699
Plassman and her colleagues worried
about that too, which is why they used a

40
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,418
pretty ingenious technique to test
whether subjects actually liked

41
00:02:03,418 --> 00:02:04,909
one wine better than the other.

42
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:09,258
Rather than just asking subjects, they
used brain imaging techniques to

43
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:13,640
test how people's brains processed the
same wine with different price tags.

44
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:16,959
They found that the parts of a
subject's brain that process rewards,

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,760
the same spots that would fire
a lot if you won some money,

46
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,259
or saw an attractive mate,
or even tasted an

47
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:25,969
amazing dessert, fired more for
the very same wine when it was

48
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:27,560
labeled with a higher price tag.

49
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,560
So our pricing biases
appear to affect more than

50
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,599
just the subjective evaluations
we report on a survey.

51
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,180
We seem to like higher-priced things more,

52
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,849
even at the level of the
reward areas in our brains.

53
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:43,310
But arbitrarily higher prices don't just
affect what we like.

54
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,379
They can also affect how
well a given product works.

55
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,930
The behavioral economist
Baba Shiv and his

56
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,400
colleagues let people pay different
amounts for an energy drink,

57
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,800
and then tested how those drinks worked.

58
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,000
Did they make people
more or less energized?

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,419
Shiv and his colleagues found that people

60
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:02,879
reported feeling more energized
after drinking the very same

61
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,609
energy drink with a higher price tag.

62
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,140
But they also did better on a
set of mental acuity puzzles.

63
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:13,349
Somehow, participants really were
more energized after a drink

64
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:17,560
with a high price tag than when drinking
an identical drink with a lower price tag.

65
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,360
These results suggest that the price we
pay, for an aspirin, or a bottle of wine,

66
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,150
or even an energy drink, doesn't
just affect what's in our wallets.

67
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:31,360
Because of price biases, our minds assume
that higher prices mean better quality,

68
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,830
even in cases where the price
of a good is totally arbitrary.
