1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:04,758
That dream about the dinosaur in the leotard,
those times that you said that thing that

2
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:08,019
you know you shouldn't have said, or even
that thing you didn't even know you were gonna

3
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:12,798
say. The little cogs of your consciousness
cranking away, making your life possible,

4
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:17,230
making society function, all of the things
that you're so glad you can do and all of

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,160
the ones that you wish you could stop doing.
Excluding other human minds, your mind is

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,019
the most complicated piece of the universe
that humans currently know about. The rules

7
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:30,230
that govern it are mysterious and elusive.
Maybe our brains just aren't complex enough

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,119
to understand themselves. But that's not going
to stop us from trying!

9
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:38,599
The word 'psychology' comes from the Latin
for the "study of the soul." And while its

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,030
formal definition has evolved over the last
several decades, today we can safely call

11
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:48,109
it the science of behavior and mental processes.
The term 'psychology' wasn't coined until

12
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:51,630
around the turn of the sixteenth century,
and the practice that we would actually call

13
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:56,560
science today wasn't established until the
mid-1800s. But of course, humans have always

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,290
been curious about themselves and what's going
on up here. Aristotle pondered the seed of

15
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,760
human consciousness and decided that it was
in the heart, not the head -- being, as we

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,740
have seen quite a lot here on Crash Course,
absolutely and completely wrong.

17
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:14,829
Two thousand years ago, Chinese rulers conducted
the world's first psychological exams, requiring

18
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:19,039
public officials to take personality and intelligence
tests. And in the late 800s, Persian doctor

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,690
Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Rhazes, also known
as Rhazes, was one of the first to describe

20
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:28,890
mental illness, and even treated patients
in what was essentially a very early psych

21
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,359
ward in his Baghdad hospital.

22
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,200
From the efforts of those early thinkers up
until today, the field of psychology has been

23
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,960
all about tackling some of the big questions:
How can humans do horrible things like commit

24
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,978
genocide and torture other humans, and how
come we know those things are horrible? Do

25
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:47,310
we have free will, or are we simply driven
by our environment, biology, and non-conscious

26
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,840
influences? What is mental illness, and what
can we do about it? And what is consciousness?

27
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,118
Or the notion of self? If I lose my awareness
of myself, am I still human?

28
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:57,700
I DON'T KNOW!

29
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,689
But over the next 6 months, these are the
questions that we're gonna be exploring together:

30
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:05,658
how our brains work, how they can break, how
they can be healed, why we behave the way

31
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:12,658
we do, even when we don't want to, and what
it means to be thinking and feeling and alive.

32
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:21,459
[Intro]

33
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:25,289
When hearing the word psychology, most people
probably think of a therapist listening to

34
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:29,679
a patient unpacking the details of his day
while reclining on a couch. Maybe that therapist

35
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,120
is wearing glasses, chewing on a cigar, stroking
his whiskered chin.

36
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,269
Admit it! If you're thinking about psychology,
you're probably picturing Freud.

37
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:40,688
Sigmund Freud was one of the most tremendously
influential and controversial thinkers of

38
00:02:40,688 --> 00:02:46,049
his time, maybe of all time. His theories
helped build our views on childhood, personality,

39
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:50,919
dreams and sexuality. And his work fueled
a legacy of both support and opposition.

40
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:54,590
His life was long and spanned an important
swath of history from the American Civil War

41
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,808
to World War II. But like most great scientists,
Freud developed his revolutionary ideas by

42
00:02:58,808 --> 00:03:02,680
building on the work of others, and of course
innovation in the field didn't stop with him.

43
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,319
In truth, psychology is one of the most wildly
diverse sciences in terms of the questions

44
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:11,589
it proposes, the methods it applies, and the
different schools of thought and disciplines

45
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,120
it contains.

46
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,870
Perhaps more than any other science, psychology
is just a big old integrated melting pot.

47
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,778
For instance, right around Freud's time, there
were a lot of different schools of thought

48
00:03:20,778 --> 00:03:25,509
of about how the study of the human mind should
be tackled. Mainly, there were the ideas of

49
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:28,759
structuralism, functionalism and psychoanalysis.

50
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:34,318
Scientific psychology got its start in 1879
in Germany when physician Wilhelm Wundt set

51
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,528
up the first psychology laboratory at the
University of Leipzig just a few years after

52
00:03:38,528 --> 00:03:44,239
publishing his Principles of Physiological
Psychology, considered the first true psychology

53
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:44,778
textbook.

54
00:03:44,778 --> 00:03:49,838
Wundt and his student Edward Bradford Titchener
took cues from chemists and physicists and

55
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:54,558
argued that if those people could break down
all matter into simple elements or structures,

56
00:03:54,558 --> 00:03:56,919
why couldn't they do the same for the brain?

57
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:01,529
They tried to understand the structures of
consciousness by getting patients to look

58
00:04:01,528 --> 00:04:06,028
inward, asking them how they felt when they
watched the sun set, or smelled a coffee,

59
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:07,338
or licked a kitten, or whatever.

60
00:04:07,338 --> 00:04:11,978
Titchener named this approach 'structuralism',
but despite its rigid sounding name, it really

61
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:16,819
relied so much on introspection that it became
too subjective. I mean, you may sense and

62
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:20,810
feel something different that I do, even if
we lick the same kitten. Psychologists, of

63
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,120
course, can't actually observe a patient's
inner thoughts or feelings, so ultimately,

64
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,870
the structuralist school of thought was fairly
short-lived.

65
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,540
By contrast, American physician and philosopher
William James proposed a different set of

66
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:38,580
questions, focusing on why we think and feel
and smell and lick, or whatever. Basically,

67
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:43,089
he focused on the function of behavior. This
approach, 'functionalism', was based on Charles

68
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:47,569
Darwin's idea that adaptive behaviors are
conserved throughout the evolutionary process.

69
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:52,839
James published his seminal book, The Principles
of Psychology, in 1890, defining psychology

70
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:58,549
as the science of mental life, just as Freud
was starting to flex his big brain.

71
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,939
Sigmund Freud began his medical career at
a Viennese hospital, but in 1886, he started

72
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:07,709
his own practice, specializing in nervous
disorders. During this time, Freud witnessed

73
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:13,219
his colleague Josef Breuer treat a patient
called Anna O with a new talking cure. Basically,

74
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:18,250
he just let her talk about her symptoms. The
more she talked and pulled up traumatic memories,

75
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:23,589
the more her symptoms were reduced. It was
a breakthrough, and it changed Freud forever.

76
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:28,159
From then on, Freud encouraged his patients
to talk freely about whatever came to mind,

77
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,430
to free associate. This technique provided
the basis for his career, and an entire branch

78
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,240
of psychology.

79
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,889
In 1900 he published his book The Interpretation
of Dreams, where he introduced his theory

80
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:44,189
of psychoanalysis. Now, you probably think
of psychoanalysis as a treatment -- the whole

81
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:48,310
patient on the couch scenario. And that's
definitely part of it. But Freud's concept

82
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,149
was actually a lot more complex than that,
and it was revolutionary.

83
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:57,589
A radical kernel of psychoanalysis was the
theory that our personalities are shaped by

84
00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:02,949
unconscious motives. Basically Freud suggested
that we're all profoundly affected by mental

85
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:05,039
processes that we're not even aware of.

86
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,910
Now that sounds almost obvious to us now,
but part of the genius of Freud's theory was

87
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:14,780
that in 1900, it wasn't obvious at all. The
idea that our minds could be driven by something

88
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:20,049
that our minds themselves didn't know about
was hard to grasp. As hard as like, uhh, maybe

89
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:25,400
organisms evolving by natural selection. It
was abstract, invisible, and there was something

90
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,649
about it that seemed irrational.

91
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:30,560
But the other important part of Freud's theory
was that the unconscious, literally the thing

92
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,589
below consciousness, was still discoverable.
Even though you weren't aware of it, you could

93
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:39,939
come to understand it through a therapeutic
technique that used dreams, projections and

94
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:44,389
free association to root out repressed feelings
and and gain self-insight.

95
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:48,979
So what Freud was really saying was that mental
disorders could be healed through talk therapy

96
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:54,230
and self-discovery. And this was a really
big breakthrough. Because prior to this, people

97
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:58,800
with mental illnesses would be confined to
sanatoriums and at best given menial labor

98
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,730
to do and at worst, shackled to a bed frame.

99
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,990
After The Interpretations of Dreams, Freud
went on to publish over 20 more books and

100
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,509
countless papers with an iconic cigar in hand
all the while. He believed smoking helped

101
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:14,680
him think, but it also helped him get jaw
cancer. During the last sixteen years of his

102
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,120
life, he underwent at least thirty painful
operations while continuing to smoke.

103
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,209
By the late 1930s, the Nazis had taken over
Austria, and Freud and his Jewish family narrowly

104
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:29,769
escaped to England. By September 1939, the
pain in his cancerous jaw was too great and

105
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:34,299
a doctor friend assisted him in suicide through
morphine injection. He was eighty-three.

106
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,879
Whether you love him or hate him - and make
no mistake, plenty of people vehemently disagreed

107
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,439
with him - there is no question that Freud's
impact on psychology was monumental. While

108
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,490
competing theories in the young field of psychology
either fell away or evolved into something

109
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,918
else, psychoanalysis remains an important
concept and practice today.

110
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,509
The next big shake-up rolled in during the
first half of the 20th century when behaviorism

111
00:07:55,509 --> 00:08:00,279
gained a higher profile. Heavy hitters like
Ivan Pavlov, John B. Watson, and B. F. Skinner

112
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:05,299
were key players here. They focused on the
study of observable behavior. You may remember

113
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:10,509
Skinner as the dude who put rats and pigeons
and babies in boxes and conditioned them to

114
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:14,839
perform certain behaviors. Right around when
Freud escaped to England, Skinner published

115
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:19,729
his Behavior of Organisms, ushering in the
era of behaviorism which remained all the

116
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,480
rage well into the 1960s.

117
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,430
The other major force at the time was, of
course, Freud's psychoanalysis, and its many

118
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:30,600
descendents collectively known as the psychodynamic
theories. These focused on the importance

119
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,879
of early experiences in shaping the unconsciousness
and how that process affects our thoughts,

120
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,788
feelings, behaviors, and personalities.

121
00:08:37,788 --> 00:08:41,929
By the mid-20th century, other major forces
in psychology were also brewing -- schools

122
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:46,679
we'll explore later in this course including
humanist psychology, which focuses on nurturing

123
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:51,498
personal growth; cognitive science and neuroscience,
all of which contributed their own unique

124
00:08:51,499 --> 00:08:53,139
takes on the study of mind.

125
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:57,659
Today's formal definition of psychology, the
study of behavior and mental processes, is

126
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:02,068
a nice amalgamation that pulls from all these
different schools of thought. It recognizes

127
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:06,349
the need for observing and recording behavior,
whether that's screaming, crying or playing

128
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:11,499
air saxophone to an imaginary audience, but
it also gives credit to our mental processes:

129
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:15,558
what we think and feel and believe while we're
tearing it up on our invisible instruments.

130
00:09:15,558 --> 00:09:20,308
Because again, the point I really want you
to take home is that psychology is an integrative

131
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:24,850
science. Yes, folks still get grumpy and disagree
plenty, but the essence of the discipline

132
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:29,370
has everything to do with creating different
ways of asking interesting questions and attempting

133
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:34,389
to answer them through all kinds of data-gathering
methods. The human mind is complicated. There

134
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:40,019
is no single way to effectively crack it open;
it must be pried at from all sides.

135
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:44,249
Harvard astronomer Owen Gingerich has gazed
into the distant horizon of space, and even

136
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:49,528
he has acknowledged that the human brain is
by far the most complex physical object known

137
00:09:49,528 --> 00:09:55,470
to us in the entire cosmos. And we all get
to have one! Of our very own! Just knocking

138
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,680
around right up in here.

139
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,989
We here at Crash Course are really excited
to spend the next several months delving into

140
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,899
the world of psychology -- how it applies
to our lives, our minds, and our hearts, and

141
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:08,889
how it deepens our understanding of each other,
our world, and ourselves.
