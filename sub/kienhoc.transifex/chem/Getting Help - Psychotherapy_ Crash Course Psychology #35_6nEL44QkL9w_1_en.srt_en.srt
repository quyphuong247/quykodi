1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,299
Bernice has issues, and sure we all do, but
hers are getting out of hand. At times she

2
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:08,419
goes through bouts of depression that make
it hard for her to even get out of bed. Sometimes

3
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:13,838
she suffers from serious anxiety around things
like test taking, flying, lots of things.

4
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,199
All of which are brutalizing her self-worth and
affecting her performance in work and life.

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,760
She's ready to get professional help and,
lucky for Bernice, she has a lot of options.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,060
Psychotherapy, perhaps the predominant type
of psychological treatment, involves a therapist

7
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:32,859
using a range of techniques to help a patient overcome
troubles, gain insight, and achieve personal growth.

8
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:37,159
Now you know by now that there are kinds of
perspectives on the human mind and lots of

9
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:41,468
different philosophies on how to approach
it. So it may not come as a surprise that

10
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:46,789
there's also a variety of ways that experts
analyze and treat ailments of the mind.

11
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:50,379
They each create their own kind of experience
for a person seeking help and to be honest

12
00:00:50,378 --> 00:00:54,428
some approaches are better suited for treating
certain psychological conditions than others.

13
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:58,920
But with Bernice as our guide we can see how
each of these techniques works and maybe in

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,219
the end we can get her out of bed, feeling more calm
and confident, and back in the swing of things.

15
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:14,579
He's back!

16
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:19,019
If we're going to talk about psychotherapy,
we've got to start with Freud, right? Psychotherapy,

17
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:25,980
you will recall, is commonly grouped into
four major schools or orientations. The psychodynamic,

18
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,829
existential-humanistic, behavioral, and cognitive
therapies. Freud's famous lay on the couch

19
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:36,569
and talk psychoanalysis is just one of several
related therapies in the psychodynamic family

20
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:37,839
and it was basically the first.

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,810
In essence, Freud assumed that we didn't really
know or at least fully understand ourselves

22
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,350
or our motivations. So psychoanalysis served
as a kind of historical reconstruction that

23
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:51,839
helped patients access repressed feelings
and memories and unconscious thoughts, by

24
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,950
using free association and dream analysis
with helpful interpretations from the therapist

25
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,200
until they gained some self-insight.

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,549
As you free associate, talk about your past
and answer questions, your psychoanalyst picks

27
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:08,109
up on sensitive subjects around which you
appear to show resistance. Mental blocks that

28
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:12,290
keep you from your consciousness because they
cause you anxiety. The psychoanalyst notes

29
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:17,848
these resistances and offers interpretations of what
might be going on to help promote insight.

30
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:21,979
So if Bernice was visiting a psychoanalyst,
talking about her day, the therapist might

31
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:25,509
say "Tell me more about that dream with the
birds with the broken wings." Or he might

32
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:29,489
point out resistance, like, "I noticed that
when you mentioned your fear of flying, you

33
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:33,519
tend to bring up your childhood, but you never
talk about your mother. Why might that be?"

34
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,340
The therapist points out what may be unconscious
themes to coax them into the light. Maybe

35
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,560
Bernice needs to deal with a traumatic childhood
memory or the fact that her mom ran away with

36
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,579
a pilot or something to understand the roots
of her fear.

37
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:50,170
Today, traditional psychoanalysis is less
common. Critics have pointed out that psychoanalytic

38
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:55,309
interpretations aren't easy to prove or disprove,
which is a problem when you're trying to take

39
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:00,549
the scientific approach. Plus, psychoanalysis
tends to involve many sessions, sometimes

40
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:06,308
4 or 5 a week over a long period of time, and health
insurance just won't cover that anymore.

41
00:03:06,308 --> 00:03:09,919
Therapists who have branched off from the
psychoanalytic school fall into the psychodynamic

42
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,299
family, which includes not just Freudian,
theory, but also ideas from Karl Jung, Alfred

43
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:16,379
Adler, Karen Horney, and others.

44
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:21,298
The terms psychoanalytic and psychodynamic
are often confused, but you can think of psychoanalysis

45
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:26,599
as Freud's particular baby, while psychodynamic
theory is really the family descended from

46
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:31,668
that baby. Similar to psychoanalysis, psychodynamic
therapy focuses on helping people gain insight

47
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:37,200
on the impact of unconscious internal forces,
early relationships, and critical childhood

48
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,518
experiences. But these therapies don't dwell
on the id and the ego and superego or all

49
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:46,319
the sex stuff, at least not like traditional
psychoanalysis does.

50
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:51,068
And not all psychologists are interested in
rooting through your deep unconscious recesses

51
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:55,608
like it was your underwear drawer. Some therapies
focus more on conscious material and believe

52
00:03:55,609 --> 00:04:00,359
the present and future are worth more attention
than the past. These include the existential-humanistic

53
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:05,260
therapies, championed by Carl Rogers, Viktor
Frankl, Fritz Perls, and others, who emphasized

54
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:10,429
people's inherent capacity for making rational
choices, achieving self-acceptance, and attaining

55
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,778
their maximum potential.

56
00:04:11,778 --> 00:04:17,629
Like the psychodynamic school, existential-humanistic
therapy is still insight oriented, but it's

57
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:23,319
much more about promoting growth rather than
curing illness. Instead of calling folks patients,

58
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:27,520
humanistic therapies refer to those they help
as clients or just, ya know, people.

59
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,779
In the mid 1900s, Rogers developed a humanistic
technique called client-centered therapy.

60
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:37,728
He encouraged therapists to help their client
by providing an empathetic, genuine, and accepting

61
00:04:37,728 --> 00:04:43,088
environment and using active listening where
the therapist echoes and clarifies what their

62
00:04:43,088 --> 00:04:47,579
clients are saying and feeling. Rogers believed
these techniques helped to provide a safe,

63
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:52,429
non-judgmental place where clients could accept
themselves, feel valued, and work towards

64
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,910
self-actualization. But other therapists in
this school brought in more somber topics.

65
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,610
Perls, Frankl, and others incorporated the
existentialist perspective, understanding

66
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,960
anxiety and limits to personal growth is driven
by the human impulse to deny the fact that,

67
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,519
let's face it, we're all going to die. Sounds
a little grim, but much like the existentialist

68
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,818
philosophers, these theorists thought to maximize
human potential and meaning in life in the

69
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:22,389
face of those existential fears, helping people
access their genuine selves.

70
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:27,750
So let's say Bernice sees an existentialist-humanistic
therapist and talks about her depression and

71
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,209
how it's keeping her from living a full life.
By focusing on the present, this therapist

72
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:37,329
might suggest that Bernice is afraid and avoidant
of her true emotions, the bad and scary ones

73
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:41,719
as well as the good ones, which is why she
feels emotionally lifeless and drained. So

74
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,870
her therapist might say, "Say more about the
feelings that you're having right now, in this

75
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,060
moment, as you talk about your depression."
The therapist would listen without interpreting,

76
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:55,129
at least at first, and help Bernice understand
that she was being heard and accepted, which

77
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:58,809
hopefully would give her comfort and
strength to begin dealing with the tough

78
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:00,560
emotions that she's been avoiding.

79
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,470
Now if Bernice were to make her appointments
with a behavior therapist, she'd experience

80
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:08,659
quite a different session. Behavior therapists
argue that simply knowing that you're afraid

81
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:12,819
of flying, for example, won't help you from
freaking out at the thought of getting on

82
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:17,259
a plane. Instead these therapists suggest
that the problem behavior is the actual issue

83
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:21,788
and the best way to get rid of unwanted automatic
behavior is to replace it with more functional

84
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:26,079
behavior through new learning and conditioning.
In other words, behavior therapy aims to change

85
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:30,658
behavior in order to change emotions and moods.
Behavior therapy is rooted in the experiments

86
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:35,250
of Ivan Pavlov and his classically conditioned
dogs that drooled at the sound of a bell and

87
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:41,579
work by E L Thorndike and B F Skinner on operant
conditioning or changing behavior by using

88
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:43,310
positive or negative reinforcement.

89
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,810
So say Bernice is seeing a behavior therapist
because of an intense fear of flying. We know

90
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,908
her fear is keeping her from personal and
career goals like going to conferences and

91
00:06:52,908 --> 00:06:57,978
vacationing to Baja. But sometimes it even
effects her ability to look up at a blue sky

92
00:06:57,978 --> 00:07:02,128
or flip through a travel magazine. Her therapist
might use counter-conditioning to evoke new

93
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:07,599
responses to the stimuli that trigger this
unwanted behavior or she may use other behavior

94
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:13,000
therapy methods like exposure, systematic
desensitization, and aversive conditioning

95
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,069
to help Bernice modify her reactions and behavior.
So she doesn't dwell on having Bernice relive

96
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:23,329
old memories or helping her self-actualize,
she just wants to fix the problem behavior.

97
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:28,038
Aversive conditioning is less common and usually
involves pairing an unpleasant stimulus with

98
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:32,639
the targeted behavior. A classic example is
giving someone with an alcohol problem a pill

99
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,460
that makes them puke when they drink.

100
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:39,418
Far more common and better studied, the exposure
therapies treat an anxiety by having a person

101
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:44,728
face their fears by exposing them to real
or imagined situations that they typically

102
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:49,418
avoid. Systematic desensitization is a type
of exposure therapy that associates a relaxed

103
00:07:49,418 --> 00:07:55,688
state of mind with gradually increasing anxiety-inducing
stimuli. Taking Bernice from, say, just thinking

104
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:59,718
about flying, to looking at photos of planes
in the air to sitting on a grounded plane,

105
00:07:59,718 --> 00:08:02,740
to eventually soaring in the skies for reals.

106
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,060
Behavior therapy works pretty well in treating
specific fears and problems like phobias and

107
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:12,439
it can also work for people with generalized
anxiety disorder or major depression, but

108
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:16,449
it often needs a boost. And we can get that
boost from the cognitive therapies, the kind

109
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:20,848
that teach people new, more adaptive ways
of thinking. Cognitive therapy focuses more

110
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:26,069
on what people think rather than what they
do, assuming that if you can change a self-defeating

111
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:27,999
thought, you can change the related behavior.

112
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:32,610
This is the approach used by founding American
cognitive therapist Aaron Beck. He and his

113
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,839
colleagues pioneered the Socratic questioning
method to help clients reverse destructive

114
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,169
and catastrophic beliefs about themselves,
the world, or the future at large, such as

115
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:46,429
everything that could possibly go wrong will
go wrong.

116
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:50,370
Say Bernice has a big test coming up, like
a really big, all or nothing, end of the year

117
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:55,980
exam. She's freaking out and her anxiety around
the test already has her depressed, imagining

118
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,289
that she'll fail. If she bombs the test, she
fears that her dreams of getting into the

119
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:05,230
graduate programs she wants will be dashed
and her life will be over. Classic catastrophic

120
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:09,460
thinking. A cognitive therapist would actively
discuss all of this with her, challenging

121
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:14,160
her thinking along the way and, in the end,
help Bernice reexamine her assumptions about

122
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,809
what's going to happen if she does fail like
the world will not end and she will not utterly

123
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:24,069
fail at life. Helping her work toward thinking more
positive thoughts about herself and her future.

124
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:28,550
The cognitive therapist helps patients understand
that changing what we say to ourselves is

125
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:33,669
a very effective way to cope with our anxieties
and modify our behavior. In other words, it

126
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:38,229
really is the thought that counts. Not surprisingly,
the cognitive and behavioral schools have

127
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,899
joined forces frequently enough that cognitive-behavior
therapies are typically considered a single

128
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:47,019
school, and a lot of therapists use integrative
approaches that try to use the best elements

129
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,740
of all of these schools of thought.

130
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,399
But all of these different psychotherapies
don't always mean being alone with your therapist

131
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,730
and your thoughts. Most of them can be done
in groups, too. Group therapy fosters the

132
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,680
therapeutic benefits you get from interacting
with other people. Not only does it help with

133
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:05,049
the social aspects of mental health, but it
also may remind clients that they're not alone.

134
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:10,049
In a similar way, family therapy treats a
family as a system, and views an individual's

135
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:14,490
problem behaviors as being influenced by,
or directed at, other family members. Family

136
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,120
therapists work with multiple family members
to heal relationships, improve insight and

137
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,870
communication, and mobilize communal resources.

138
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:26,179
So, the big question remains. Does psychotherapy
work? You're going to have to wait until next

139
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:29,519
time to find out because that is what we will
be taking about, along with a look at the

140
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,470
biomedical approach to therapy.

141
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,870
For now, you've learned about the major types
of psychotherapy. These include psychodynamic

142
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:41,129
therapy and Freud's famous psychoanalysis,
existential-humanist therapy and Roger's 

143
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:44,990
client-centered focus, and behavior and cognitive therapies.

144
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,198
We also took a quick look at group and family therapy.
