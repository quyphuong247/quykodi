1
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:16,778
Way back in 1887, a journalist named Elizabeth
Cochran assumed the alias Nellie Bly and feigned

2
00:00:16,778 --> 00:00:22,079
a mental illness to report on the truly awful
conditions inside psychiatric hospitals in

3
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:27,448
the US, which were known as asylums at the
time. She found rotten food, cold showers,

4
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:33,859
prevalent rats, abusive nurses, and patients
being tied down in her famous expose "Ten

5
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:38,000
Days in a Mad House". What she documented
had been pretty standard mental health treatment

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,420
for centuries, but her work led the charge
in mental health reform.

7
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,379
It's been a long battle.

8
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:49,359
Nearly a century later in 1975, American psychologist
David Rosenhan published a paper called "On

9
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:54,478
Being Sane in Insane Places" detailing the
experiment that he conducted on psychiatric

10
00:00:54,478 --> 00:00:58,839
institutions themselves. The first part of
his experiment involved sending pseudopatients

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,680
- a group of eight totally mentally sound
associates, including David himself - to knock

12
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,049
on institution doors and falsely report that
they'd been hearing voices. Once admitted,

13
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:12,400
the fake patients abandoned their fake symptoms
and behaved as they normally did, waiting

14
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,770
for administrators to recognize them as mentally
healthy.

15
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:20,069
Like Cochran, Rosenhan and his team learned
that it's easy to get into a mental institution,

16
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:24,349
but it is much, much harder to get out. The
participants were kept in the institution

17
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:28,769
for an average of 19 days, one of them for
52 days. They were forced to take psychotropic

18
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:33,500
medication (which they sneakily spit out)
and were eventually discharged with a diagnosis

19
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,328
of paranoid schizophrenia in remission. Of
course, being dubbed in remission isn't exactly

20
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:42,468
the same thing as being labeled sane, and
that was just one of Rosenhan's criticisms

21
00:01:42,468 --> 00:01:48,319
of the system. It viewed mental illness as
an irreversible condition, almost like a personality

22
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,989
trait, rather than a curable illness.

23
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:54,899
Part two of his experiment came later when
Rosenhan shared his results with a teaching

24
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,259
hospital and then told the staff that he'd
be sending more pseudopatients their way in

25
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:03,978
the next few months, and challenged them to
detect the imposters. With that in mind, out

26
00:02:03,978 --> 00:02:09,639
of 193 new patients, 41 were ferreted out
as likely or suspected pseudopatients. The

27
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:15,179
thing is, Rosenhan never actually sent in
any pseudopatients. In the end Rosenhan concluded

28
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,819
that the way people were being diagnosed with
psychiatric issues often revealed less about

29
00:02:19,818 --> 00:02:24,908
the patients themselves and more about their
situation. Like, saying you've heard voices

30
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:29,649
one time might catch a doctors attention a
lot more than weeks of normal behavior.

31
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,319
Naturally people criticized his methods and
his findings, but his experiment raised a

32
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:38,869
lot of important questions like: How do we
define, diagnose, and classify mental disorders?

33
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,280
At what point does sad become depressed? Or
quirky become obsessive compulsive? Or energetic

34
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,840
become hyperactive? What are the risks and
benefits of diagnostic labeling, and how does

35
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,080
the field keep evolving?

36
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,840
When people think of psychology they probably
most often think about the conditions that

37
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,110
it's been designed to understand, diagnose,
and treat - namely psychological disorders.

38
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,970
From common problems that most of us will
experience at some point in our lives to the

39
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:06,090
more serious dysfunctions that require intensive
care. They're a big part of what psychology

40
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,310
is here for and over the next several lessons
we're going to be looking at mental illness,

41
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:15,628
as well as wellness. How symptoms are diagnosed
and what biological and environmental causes

42
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:20,018
may be at work. But, to grasp those ideas,
we first have to find out how we came to understand

43
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:25,289
the idea of mental health itself and build
a science around studying, discussing, and

44
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:26,280
caring for it.

45
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,329
In 2010, the World Health Organization reported
that about 450 million people worldwide suffer

46
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:36,260
from some kind of mental or behavioral disorder.
No society is immune from them, but when I

47
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:39,568
say psychological disorder I'm guessing some
of you will conjure up all sorts of dramatic

48
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:45,039
images like diabolical criminals from Arkham
Asylum or Hollywood stereotypes of various

49
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:50,400
eccentric, scary, or tragic figures. This
roll call of one-sided stock images is part

50
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,920
of the problem our culture faces - the misconceptions
and often destructive stigma associated with

51
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,908
psychological disorders.

52
00:03:56,908 --> 00:03:59,298
So, what does that term actually mean?

53
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:04,140
Mental health clinicians think of psychological
disorders as deviant, distressful, and dysfunctional

54
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:08,938
patterns of thoughts, feelings, or behaviors.
And yeah, there are a lot of sensitive and

55
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:12,750
loaded words in there, so let's talk about
what we mean, starting with deviant.

56
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,560
Sounds like I'm talking about doing things
that are dicey or raunchy, but in this context

57
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,579
it's used to describe thoughts and behavior
that are different from most of the rest of

58
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,490
your cultural context. Of course, being different
is usually wonderful. Geniuses and Olympians

59
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,870
and visionaries are all deviants from the
norm so it probably goes without saying that

60
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:35,079
the standards for so-called deviant behavior
change a lot across cultures and in different

61
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:39,800
situations. For example, in a combat situation
killing people is probably to be expected,

62
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,610
but murder is definitely deviant criminal
behavior back home in times of peace. And

63
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:50,610
in some contexts speaking to spirits or ancestors
is A-OK, but in other settings say a bar in

64
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,699
Iowa City at happy hour it might not be quite
acceptable.

65
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,939
But, to be classified as a disorder, that
deviant behavior needs to cause that person

66
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:02,740
or others around them distress, which just
means a subjective feeling that something

67
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,000
is really wrong. In turn, distress can lead
to truly harmful dysfunction - when a person's

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,560
ability to work and live is clearly, often
measurably, impaired.

69
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,839
So that's today's definition but it took a
long time for the Western world to come up

70
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:20,009
with a way of thinking about psychological
disorders that was rooted in science and investigative

71
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:23,589
inquiry. It wasn't until around the 18th and
19th centuries that we really started to put

72
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:28,169
forth the notion that mental health issues
might be about a sickness in the mind. For

73
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,220
example, by the 1800s doctors finally caught
on to the fact that advanced syphilis could

74
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,020
manifest in serious neurological problems
like dementia, and irritability, and various

75
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:42,199
mental disorders. So eventually a lot of so-called
mental patients were removed from asylums

76
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:46,199
to full medical hospitals where all of their
symptoms could be treated.

77
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,829
This "a-ha" moment is just one instance of
how perspectives on mental health began to

78
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:56,079
shift towards what is called the Medical Model
of Psychological Disorder. The Medical Model

79
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,870
champions the notion that psychological disorders
have physiological causes that can be diagnosed

80
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,050
on the basis of symptoms, and treated,
and sometimes even cured. That way of thinking

81
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,960
about mental health was an important step
forward, at least at first. It took us past

82
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,529
the old days of simply locking people up when
they didn't seem quite right to others.

83
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:16,339
But even if it was an improvement, the medical
model was seen by some in the field as kind

84
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:20,219
of narrow and outdated. Most contemporary
psychologists prefer to view mental health

85
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,220
more comprehensively through what is called
the Biopsychological Approach. You've heard

86
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,190
us say over and over again that everything
psychological is simultaneously biological

87
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:33,550
and that truism is particularly useful here.
The Biopsychological view takes that holistic

88
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,620
perspective, accounting for a whole number
of things clearly physiological and not in

89
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,120
order to understand what's happening to us,
what might be going wrong, and how it can

90
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,629
be treated.

91
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:47,610
It takes into account psychological influences
for sure like stress and trauma and memories,

92
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:52,550
but also biological factors like genetics
and brain chemistry, and social-cultural influences

93
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,400
like all the expectations wrapped up in how
a culture defines normal behavior. So by considering

94
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:02,189
the whole host of nature and nurture influences,
we can take a broader view of mental health,

95
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:05,959
realizing that some disorders can be cured
while others can be coped with, and still

96
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:10,000
others may end up not being disorders at all
once our culture accepts them.

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,250
But another important part of handling disorders
with scientific rigor is attempting to standardize

98
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,879
and measure them. How we talk about them,
how we diagnose them, and how we treat them.

99
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,540
So the field has literally come up with a
manual that shows you how to do that. But

100
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,430
it is not without it's flaws. It's called
the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic

101
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:34,269
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders;
or, DSM-5 because it's currently in its fifth

102
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:39,370
edition. And it is used by practically everybody:
clinicians obviously, but also by insurance

103
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:43,129
and drug companies, and policy makers, and the
whole legal system.

104
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:48,819
The first edition came out in 1952, and this
newest version was released in 2013. What's

105
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:53,269
particularly interesting about it is that
it's designed to be a work in progress...

106
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:58,029
forever. Each new edition incorporates changes
based on the latest research but also how

107
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:01,859
our understanding of mental health and behavior
evolves over time. For example, believe it

108
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,590
or not the first two editions actually classified
homosexuality as a pathology, basically a

109
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:11,729
disease. The 1973 third edition eliminated
that designation, reflecting changing attitudes

110
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:16,759
and a developing understanding of sexual orientation.
And just by looking at the changes between

111
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,539
the edition used today and the previous version
released in the year 2000, you can get a picture

112
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,220
not only of how quickly things change but
also how classification can affect diagnosis

113
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:31,200
- for better or worse - and also what the
risks are of classifying psychological disorders

114
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:31,860
in the first place.

115
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,459
For instance, the new edition reflects our
growing understanding of the symptoms of Post

116
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:39,899
Traumatic Stress Disorder, and it changed
the name of Childhood Bipolar Disorder to

117
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:45,500
Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder because
kids were being over-diagnosed and over-treated

118
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,899
for bipolar disorder when the condition that
they had didn't actually fit that description.

119
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:53,639
And totally new diagnoses are being explored
as well, like Gambling Addiction and what's

120
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:58,799
called Internet Gaming Disorder, showing that
new disorders continue to arise with changing times.

121
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:03,289
But the DSM is not perfect, even though we've
come a long way since the Rosenhan experiment,

122
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:08,429
critics still worry about how the DSM might
inadvertently promote the over- or mis-diagnosis

123
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:12,750
and treatment of certain behaviors. Others
echo Rosenhan's concerns that by slapping

124
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,799
patients with labels we're making them vulnerable
to judgments and preconceptions that'll affect

125
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,349
how others will perceive and treat them.

126
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,310
In the end, it's just important to keep in
mind that definitions are powerful and things

127
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:25,969
can get tricky pretty fast in the world of
mental health.

128
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,579
Today you learned about how we define psychological
disorders, and looked at medical and biopsychological

129
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:35,120
perspectives on mental illness. We talked
about how professionals use the DSM to diagnose

130
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,669
disorders and how it's constantly evolving
to incorporate new thinking. Thanks for watching,
