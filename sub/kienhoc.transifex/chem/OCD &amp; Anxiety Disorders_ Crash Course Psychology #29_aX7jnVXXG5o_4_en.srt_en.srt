1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,320
Ever heard a really good joke about polio?
Or made a casual reference to someone having

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,849
hepatitis? Or maybe teased your buddy by saying
he has muscular dystrophy?

3
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:10,958
Of course you have never done that, because
you are not a terrible person. You'd never

4
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:15,320
make fun of someone for having a physical
illness, but folks make all kinds of offhand

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,539
remarks about people having mental illnesses
and never give it a second thought.

6
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,289
How often have you heard a person say that
someone's psycho, or schizo, or bipolar, or

7
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:29,199
OCD? I can pretty much guarantee that the
people who used those terms had no idea what they actually meant.

8
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,899
We've talked about how psychological disorders
and the people who have them have often  been stigmatized.

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,160
But at the same time, we tend to minimize
those disorders, using them as nicknames for

10
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,599
things that people do, think, or say, that
may not exactly be universal, but are still basically healthy.

11
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,219
And we all do it, but only because we don't
really understand those conditions.

12
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:52,530
But that's why we're here, because as we go
deeper into psychological disorders, we get

13
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,299
a clearer understanding of their symptoms,
types, causes, and the perspectives that help explain them.

14
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,890
And some of the most common disorders have
their root in an unpleasant mental state that's

15
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,320
familiar to us all: anxiety.

16
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,169
It's a part of being human, but for some people
it can develop into intense fear, and paralyzing

17
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:13,180
dread, and ultimately turn into full-fledged
anxiety disorder.

18
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,729
Defining psychological disorders again: a
deviant, distressful, and dysfunctional pattern

19
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:22,500
of thoughts, feelings, or behaviors that interferes
with the ability to function in a healthy way.

20
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,969
So when it comes to anxiety, that definition
is the difference between the guy you probably

21
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:31,129
called phobic because he didn't like Space
Mountain as much as you did, and the person

22
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:34,759
who truly can't leave their house for fear
of interacting with others.

23
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,640
It's the difference between the girl who's
teased by her friends as being OCD because

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,900
she does her laundry every night and the girl who
has to wash her hands so often that they bleed.

25
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:45,900
Starting today, you're going to understand
all of those terms you've been using.

26
00:01:56,019 --> 00:02:00,500
We commonly equate anxiety with fear, but
anxiety disorders aren't just a matter of fear itself.

27
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,900
A key component is also what we do to get
rid of that fear.

28
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,978
Say someone almost drowned as a kid and is
now afraid of water.

29
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:11,739
A family picnic at the river may cause that
anxiety to bubble up, and to cope, they may

30
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:16,170
stay sequestered in the car, less anxious
but probably still unhappy while the rest

31
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,449
of the family is having fun.

32
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:22,259
So, in clinical terms, anxiety disorders are
characterized not only by distressing, persistent

33
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:27,169
anxiety but also often by the dysfunctional
behaviors that reduce that anxiety.

34
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:32,429
At least a fifth of all people will experience
a diagnosable anxiety disorder of some kind

35
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,730
at some point in their lives. That is a lot
of us.

36
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:38,949
So I want to start out with a condition that
used to be categorized as an anxiety disorder

37
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:43,189
but is now considered complex enough to be
in a class by itself, Obsessive-Compulsive

38
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:44,829
Disorder or OCD.

39
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,349
You probably know that condition is characterized
by unwanted repetitive thoughts, which become

40
00:02:49,348 --> 00:02:53,628
obsessions, which are sometimes accompanied
by actions, which become compulsions.

41
00:02:53,628 --> 00:02:57,899
And it is a great example of a psychological
disorder that could use some mental-health myth busting.

42
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,819
Being neat, and orderly, and fastidious does
not make you OCD.

43
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:07,729
OCD is a debilitating condition whose sufferers
take normal behaviors like, washing your hands,

44
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:12,128
or double checking that you turned off the
stove and perform them compulsively.

45
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:18,000
And they often use these compulsive, even ritualistic
behaviors to relieve intense and unbearable anxiety.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,199
So, soon they're scrubbing their hands every five minutes, or constantly checking the stove,

47
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:25,199
or counting the exact number of steps they
take everywhere they go.

48
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,209
If you're still unclear about what it means
for disorders to be deviant, distressful and

49
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,979
dysfunctional, OCD might help you understand.

50
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:36,988
Because it is hard to keep a job, run a household,
sit still, or do much of anything if you feel

51
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:40,680
intensely compelled to run to the kitchen
twenty times an hour.

52
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,650
And both the thoughts and behaviors associated with
OCD are often driven by a fear that is itself

53
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,879
obsessive, like if you don't go to the kitchen
right now your house will burn down and your

54
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,568
child will die which makes the condition that
much more distressing and self-reinforcing.

55
00:03:52,568 --> 00:03:58,099
There are treatments that help OCD including certain
kinds of psychotherapy and some psychotropic drugs.

56
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:01,969
But the key here is that it is not a description
for your roommate who cleans her bathroom

57
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:05,900
twice a week, or the guy in the cubicle next to
you, who only likes to use green felt tip pens.

58
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:10,169
And even though OCD is considered its own
unique set of psychological issues, the pervasive

59
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:15,458
senses of fear, worry, and loss of control
that often accompany it, have a lot in common

60
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:17,069
with other anxiety disorders.

61
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:21,569
The broadest of these is Generalized Anxiety
Disorder or GAD.

62
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:26,860
People with this condition tend to feel continually
tense and apprehensive, experiencing unfocused,

63
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,000
negative, and out-of-control feelings.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,319
Of course feeling this way occasionally is
common enough, but feeling it consistently

65
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:37,039
for over six months - the length of time required for
a formal diagnosis - is not.

66
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:42,068
Folks with GAD worry all the time and are
frequently agitated and on edge, but unlike

67
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:46,930
some other kinds of anxiety, patients often can't
identify what's causing the anxiousness, so

68
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,379
they don't even know what to avoid.

69
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:53,700
Then there's Panic Disorder, which affects about
1 in 75 people, most often teens and young adults.

70
00:04:53,788 --> 00:04:59,269
It's calling card is Panic Attacks or sudden
episodes of intense dread or sudden fear that

71
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:00,838
come without warning.

72
00:05:00,838 --> 00:05:06,098
Unlike the symptoms of GAD which can be hard
to pin down, Panic Attacks are brief, well-defined,

73
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:08,930
and sometimes severe bouts of elevated anxiety.

74
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,478
And if you've ever had one, or been with someone
who has, you know that they call these attacks

75
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:14,658
for good reason.

76
00:05:14,658 --> 00:05:19,538
They can cause chest pains and racing heartbeat,
difficulty breathing and a general sense that

77
00:05:19,538 --> 00:05:23,068
you're going crazy or even dying. It's as
awful as it sounds.

78
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:27,319
We've talked a lot about the body's physiological
fight or flight response and that's definitely

79
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:31,270
part of what's going on here, even though
there often isn't an obvious trigger.

80
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:35,430
There may be a genetic pre-disposition to
panic disorder, but persistent stress or having

81
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,369
experienced psychological trauma in the past
can also set you up for these attacks.

82
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:43,360
And because the attacks themselves can be
downright terrifying, a common trigger for

83
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,528
panic disorder is simply the fear of having
another panic attack.

84
00:05:47,528 --> 00:05:48,930
How's that for a kick in the head?

85
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,348
Say you have a panic attack on a bus, or you
find yourself hyperventilating in front of

86
00:05:52,348 --> 00:05:56,088
dozens of strangers with nowhere to go to
calm yourself down, that whole ordeal might

87
00:05:56,088 --> 00:05:59,658
make you never want to be in that situation
again, so your anxiety could lead you to start

88
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:01,468
avoiding crowded or confined places.

89
00:06:01,468 --> 00:06:07,259
At this point the initial anxiety has spun
of into a fear of anxiety which means, welcome

90
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:10,679
you've migrated into another realm of anxiety
disorder, Phobias.

91
00:06:10,678 --> 00:06:14,408
And again this is a term that's been misused
for a long time to describe people who, say,

92
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:18,259
they don't like cats, or are uncomfortable
on long plane trips.

93
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:21,990
Simply experiencing fear or discomfort doesn't
make you phobic.

94
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:27,338
In clinical terms, phobias are persistent,
irrational fears of specific objects, activities,

95
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:31,728
or situations, that also, and this is important,
leads to avoidance behavior.

96
00:06:31,728 --> 00:06:37,118
You hear a lot about fears of heights, or
spiders, or clowns, and those are real things.

97
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:40,899
They're specific phobias that focus on particular
objects or situations.

98
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:44,629
For example, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in
Maryland is a seven-thousand meter span that

99
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:49,419
crosses the Chesapeake Bay, if you want to
get to or from Eastern Maryland that's pretty

100
00:06:49,418 --> 00:06:53,928
much the only way to do it, at least in a
car, but there are thousands of people who

101
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:57,378
are so afraid of crossing that bridge that
they simply can't do it.

102
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:01,520
So, to accommodate this avoidance behavior,
driver services are available.

103
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:08,000
For $25 people with Gephyrophobia, a fear of bridges,
can hire someone to drive themselves, and their kids, 

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,100
and dogs, and groceries across the bridge
in their own car, while trying not to freak out.

105
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:18,439
But other phobias lack such specific triggers,
what we might think of as social phobia, currently

106
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:23,659
known as social anxiety disorder, is characterized
by anxiety related to interacting or being

107
00:07:23,658 --> 00:07:28,110
seen by others, which could be triggered by
a phone call, or being called on in class,

108
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,088
or just thinking about meeting new people.

109
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:34,389
So you can probably see at this point how
anxiety disorders are related and how they

110
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:36,449
can be difficult to tease apart.

111
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:39,499
The same thing can be said about what we think
causes them.

112
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:44,869
Because much in the same way anxiety can show
up as both a feeling like panic, and a thought,

113
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:50,100
like is my kitchen on fire, there are also two main
perspectives on how we currently view anxiety

114
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,900
as a function of both learning and biology.

115
00:07:52,968 --> 00:07:57,139
The learning perspective suggests that things
like, conditioning, and observational learning

116
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:01,639
and cognition, all of which we've talked about
before best explain the source of our anxiety.

117
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,278
Remember our behaviorist friend, John B. Watson
and his conditioning experiments with poor

118
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:09,538
little Albert, by making a loud scary noise
every time you showed the kid a white rat,

119
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:15,000
he ended up conditioning the boy to fear any
furry object, from bunnies, to dogs, to fur coats.

120
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:20,500
That conditioning used two specific learning processes
to cement itself in Little Albert's young mind.

121
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:26,069
Stimulus Generalization, expanded or generalized
his fear of the rat to other furry objects,

122
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:29,300
the same principle holds true if you were,
like, attacked by your neighbours mean parrot

123
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,999
and subsequently fear all birds.

124
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:36,719
But then the anxiety is solidified through
reinforcement, every time you avoid or escape

125
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,199
a feared situations, a pair of fuzzy slippers
or a robin on the street, you ease your anxiety,

126
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:46,899
which might make you feel better temporarily,
but it actually reinforces your phobic behavior,

127
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:48,039
making it stronger.

128
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:52,889
Cognition also influences our anxiety, whether
we interpret a strange noise outside as a

129
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:58,079
hungry bear, or a robber, or merely the wind,
determines if we roll-over and keep snoring,

130
00:08:58,078 --> 00:08:59,818
or freak out and run for a kitchen knife.

131
00:08:59,818 --> 00:09:04,219
And we might also acquire anxiety from other
people through observational learning.

132
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,160
A parent who's terrified of water may end
up instilling that fear in their child by

133
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,669
violently snatching them away from kiddie
pools or generally acting anxious around park

134
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:14,250
fountains and duck ponds.

135
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,350
But there're also equally important biological
perspectives. Natural selection, for instance,

136
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:23,709
might explain why we seem to fear certain potentially
dangerous animals, like snakes, or why fears

137
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,559
of heights or closed in spaces are relatively
common.

138
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,508
It's probably true that our more wary ancestors
who had the sense to stay away from cliff

139
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:35,509
edges and hissing serpents were more likely
to live another day and pass along their genes,

140
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:40,339
so this might explain why those fears can
persist, and why even people who live in places

141
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:43,149
without poisonous snakes would still fear
snakes anyway.

142
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:46,000
And then you got the genetics and the brain
chemistry to consider.

143
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,980
Research has shown for example that identical
twins, those eternal test subjects, are more

144
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,250
likely to develop phobias even if they're
raised apart.

145
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:58,000
Some researchers have detected seventeen different
genes that seem to be expressed with various

146
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,509
anxiety disorders.

147
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:03,919
So it may be that some folks are just naturally
more anxious than others and they might pass

148
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,610
on that quality to their kids.

149
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,188
And of course individual brains have a lot
to say about how they process anxiety.

150
00:10:10,188 --> 00:10:14,539
Physiologically, people who experience panic
attacks, generalized anxiety, or obsessive

151
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:19,389
compulsions show over-arousal in the areasof the brain that deal in impulse control

152
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:20,688
and habitual behaviors.

153
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:24,919
Now we don't know whether these irregularities
cause the disorder or are caused by it, but

154
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:30,099
again, it reinforces the truism that everything that
is psychological is simultaneously biological.

155
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,899
And that holds true for many other psychological
disorders we'll talk about in the coming weeks,

156
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:38,519
many of which have names that you've also
heard being misused in the past.

157
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:43,259
Today you learned what defines an anxiety
disorder, as well as the symptoms of obsessive

158
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:46,959
compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder,
panic disorder and phobias.

159
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,799
You also learned about the two main perspectives
on the origins of anxiety disorders, the learning

160
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:56,698
perspective and the biological perspective
and hopefully you learned not to use "OCD"

161
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,149
as a punch line from now on.

162
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:01,419
