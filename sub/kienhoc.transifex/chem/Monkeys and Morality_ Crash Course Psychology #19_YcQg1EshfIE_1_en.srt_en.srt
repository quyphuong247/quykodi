1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:04,330
So you’ve probably seen a little kid react
to a sudden bang or a terrifying clown or

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,660
some strange Santa at the mall, right?

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,480
Yeah, not pretty.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,618
That child probably immediately reached for
a parent, looking for comfort, and that same

5
00:00:11,618 --> 00:00:17,000
kid might freak out if she was separated from
her adult of choice, especially is she was

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,750
in an unfamiliar environment. It’s called
attachment and if you’ve ever seen a clingy

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,559
kid you know why it’s called that. They
attach.

8
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:27,640
For a long time psychologists assumed that
this was just an intense innate survival instinct;

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,910
I mean it makes sense that babies would be
attached to their food source and bigger kids

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,980
would stick around to the people who helped
them survive. But in the 1950s American psychologists

11
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:40,099
Harry and Margaret Harlow came along with
a barrel of monkeys, complicating and illuminating

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,899
our idea of bonding with caregivers in what
has to be one of the saddest psychological

13
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,090
experiments of all time.

14
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,000
The Harlow’s were breeding Rhesus macaque
monkeys for their research on learning. Part

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,950
of the process involved separating babies
from their mothers right after birth, which,

16
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,399
yeah, pretty cruel already.

17
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,840
They began noticing that baby monkeys were
very attached to the blankets they had in

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,899
their cages, so they set up an experiment.
They created two artificial mothers. One was

19
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:10,989
a bare wire cylinder with a feeding bottle
attached; they called that Wire Mother, and

20
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:16,349
the other was a cozier cloth and foam wrapped
cylinder without a feeding bottle: Cloth Mother.

21
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:20,589
It took no time at all to see the baby’s
preference. They overwhelming preferred the

22
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:25,700
comfy cloth mama, clinging to it whenever
they seemed to be anxious or in need of comfort,

23
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,469
and sometimes they fed from the Wire Mother
with the baby bottle while standing on the

24
00:01:30,468 --> 00:01:31,169
cloth one.

25
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,888
This discovery that attachment wasn’t just
about getting breakfast surprised a lot of

26
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:39,670
people. It turns out that contact and touch
are vital to attachment, learning, emotional

27
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,978
well-being, and psychological development.
As the brain and mind develop in infants so

28
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:49,019
too do they’re emotions and social behavior.
Caregivers can greatly influence this development,

29
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:53,218
and most psychologists will tell you that
how a child is raised early on can have a

30
00:01:53,218 --> 00:01:57,968
huge effect on how they view the world, other
people and themselves, not to mention how

31
00:01:57,968 --> 00:02:00,899
they react to stressful situations or sort
out moral dilemmas.

32
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,789
I mean, it’s a big complex challenging world
out there and wire monkey baby mama just ain’t

33
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:10,649
gonna cut it.

34
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,219
[Intro]

35
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:21,219
Touch. You can convey all sorts of emotions
through touch. A hug, a slap, a pat on the

36
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:26,759
back, a poke on the side all convey meaning.
Babies learn a lot through touch. It’s how

37
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:31,310
they feel security and trust. You can imagine
how all those poor macaques, who were separated

38
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:36,560
not just from their mothers, but everyone,
grew up to have some social issues as adults.

39
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,890
That is maybe putting it too mildly. Those
monkeys showed many signs of being really

40
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:45,059
disturbed, from trouble eating, to rocking
back and forth in a trance, to even engaging

41
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,360
in self-mutilation. Most of the macaques used
in this study never recovered, and those who

42
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,930
were forced into pregnancy didn't know how
to care for their own offspring. Although

43
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,860
the Harlow's research taught us a lot, it
was inhumane and would never pass today's

44
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,070
ethical standards.

45
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:04,259
Monkeys, like humans, need to be loved. And
loving touch and care are tremendously important,

46
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:08,449
but familiarity is also key to attachment.
When you're little, a hug from a stranger

47
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:12,250
is not the same as a hug from your mom or
your grandma or your dad or your zookeeper

48
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:17,150
or whomever you're most comfortable and familiar
with. The unfamiliar can cause anxiety. And

49
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,750
for some critters, all these factors need
to come together sooner rather than later.

50
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,068
Some baby animals experience a critical period
in early life when certain things have to

51
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:28,929
happen for normal development to occur. For
ducks and geese, that critical period occurs

52
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,420
just after hatching when they accept the first
moving object they see as their mother. This

53
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:37,899
so-called "imprinting process" can be difficult
to reverse, which can make things a bit awkward

54
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,890
if that moving thing is a golden retriever
or a person or a beach ball.

55
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:46,149
Thankfully, human babies don't imprint. The
world would be a lot different and a lot more

56
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,210
bizarre if they did. Human babies do, however,
feel a lot more comfortable around people,

57
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:54,750
things, and settings that they're familiar
with. They form emotional attachments, but

58
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,959
not all attachments are created equal.

59
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,990
In the 1970's, American psychologist Mary
Ainsworth created the "strange situation"

60
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,379
experiment to observe children's different
attachment styles. She'd put a one-year-old

61
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:10,169
kid and their mom in an unfamiliar room, like
a playroom at the lab and then observe the

62
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:14,280
child playing with the mother. Eventually,
the child would encounter something potentially

63
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,249
stressful. Like, a stranger would come in
and interact with the child and then the mom

64
00:04:17,249 --> 00:04:21,939
would leave. If the kid freaked out, the stranger
would try to comfort them. And then mom would

65
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:23,930
come back and the stranger would leave.

66
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,639
Different children responded differently to
the strange situation. Ainsworth measured

67
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,210
and observed 4 different categories of behavior,
including separation anxiety, the child's

68
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:37,228
willingness to explore, stranger anxiety,
and reunion behavior, or how the child reacted

69
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:40,658
when the mom returned, which was what she
was particularly interested in. Ainsworth

70
00:04:40,658 --> 00:04:46,379
broke this behavior down into three main attachment
styles: secure, insecure avoidant, and insecure

71
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:51,289
ambivalent. About 70% of her subjects showed
secure attachment and could happily explore

72
00:04:51,288 --> 00:04:56,079
their new digs and interact with the stranger,
so long as their mom was nearby. If mom left,

73
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,658
they might freak out a bit, but they greeted
her return in a happy and positive way. About

74
00:05:00,658 --> 00:05:06,019
15% of the kids demonstrated insecure ambivalent
attachment. They were afraid of the stranger,

75
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:11,740
cried more and explored less, and had a major
freak out when mom left, only to act all salty

76
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,829
and mad when she returned. The last 15% or
so showed insecure avoidant attachment. They

77
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:21,609
were fine with the stranger, kinda indifferent
actually, didn't cling to mom, didn't seem

78
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,848
bothered when she left, showed little interest
upon her return.

79
00:05:24,848 --> 00:05:29,848
Ainsworth observed that sensitive, attentive
mothers usually raised securely attached kids,

80
00:05:29,848 --> 00:05:34,009
whereas less responsive mothers who often
ignored their children, or super-anxious mothers

81
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:38,650
who obsessed over every little thing, often
raised insecurely attached toddlers. And then

82
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:44,908
of course, on the extreme, the poor monkeys
with their unresponsive, fake moms, they became

83
00:05:44,908 --> 00:05:50,478
absolutely terrified in unfamiliar situations.
Attachment is vital. It builds the foundation

84
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:55,478
for our sense of basic trust and quite possibly
for our adult relationships, our motivation

85
00:05:55,478 --> 00:06:00,188
to achieve and our willingness to be bold,
like that toddler playing with new toys in

86
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:03,809
a strange room. Given what those messed-up
monkeys taught us, it should be no surprise

87
00:06:03,809 --> 00:06:07,979
that disruptions in attachment can bring a
world of pain. Babies raised under abuse or

88
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:12,558
extreme neglect are often withdrawn and frightened,
and many parents who've engaged in abusive

89
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:15,150
behavior were abused themselves as children.

90
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:19,838
Young kids exposed to extended abuse, trauma,
and neglect are at higher risk for psychological

91
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:23,889
disorders, health problems, and substance
abuse as adults. Studies of children raised

92
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:28,300
in understaffed Romanian orphanages, for example,
found that they scored lower in cognitive

93
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:33,059
tests and were twice as likely to exhibit
symptoms of anxiety as their counterparts

94
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:37,990
raised in quality foster homes. It's certainly
true that some kids can show remarkable resilience,

95
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:43,120
but disrupted attachment and care, often further
complicated by social and economic marginalization

96
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,269
of all kinds, can leave life-long scars.

97
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:49,968
So if one of infancy's major social achievements
is forming positive attachments, then one

98
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:54,918
of the biggest achievements in childhood would
have to be achieving a positive sense of self.

99
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:59,468
This self-concept, or an understanding and
evaluation of who we are, is usually pretty

100
00:06:59,468 --> 00:07:03,908
solid by about the time we turn 12. Charles
Darwin proposed that our self-awareness begins

101
00:07:03,908 --> 00:07:08,259
when we can recognize ourselves in a mirror.
This self-recognition typically doesn't occur

102
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:12,689
in humans under 15 to 18 months. And by the
time that tot's heading to kindergarten, their

103
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:17,740
self-concept is rapidly expanding. They probably
know their age, hair color, and family name.

104
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,800
Perhaps they know they're good at drawing
and not so good at tree climbing, and they're

105
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,309
noticing the differences and similarities
they share with other people.

106
00:07:25,309 --> 00:07:30,150
Kids with positive self-images are more happy,
confident, independent, and sociable. So,

107
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:36,459
how can we instill these values and security
in kids? And how does parenting affect development?

108
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:40,278
Whether your parents were aloof or affectionate,
strict or lax, and whether they spanked you

109
00:07:40,278 --> 00:07:44,379
or preferred to talk it out, one model of
parenting would probably categorize them into

110
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:48,369
one of three major styles, all related to
control.

111
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:52,680
The authoritarian parent makes rules with
consequences and expects you to follow them

112
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,598
because "I said so!" and tends to not be very
warm to their child. Whereas the permissive

113
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,360
parent often caves to their child's demands
and exerts little control over any of the

114
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,009
child's behavior. The authoritative parent,
meanwhile, seeks to find a balance between

115
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:10,520
the two. They are demanding, but always explain
the reasons for their rules, and are loving

116
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:14,478
and responsive. And, of course, research indicates
that finding that culturally appropriate sweet-spot

117
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:17,959
between too hard and too soft is the best
way to go.

118
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:22,329
Now, in addition to that growing sense of
self, two other important landmarks of childhood

119
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:27,348
and adolescence are the ability to discern
right from wrong and the formation of individual

120
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:31,709
character. When those two things combine,
they give us morality. Last week, we talked

121
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:37,038
about Jean Piaget and his three-tiered model
for cognitive development. Well, American

122
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,389
psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg modified and
expanded on that, and blew it up into his

123
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:46,129
own three-level theory of moral development,
which emphasized the notion that our moral

124
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:50,210
reasoning continues to develop throughout
our lives. Kohlberg outlined his theory by

125
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:55,129
posing a series of moral dilemmas to children,
teens, and adults, and then analyzing their

126
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:56,519
reasoning behind the judgments.

127
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:01,149
One of his most famous questions is known
as the Heinz Dilemma. A woman is dying of

128
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:05,340
cancer; there's a special new drug that might
save her, but the pharmacist wants to make

129
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:10,870
a big profit, so he charges a lot of money
for it. Her husband, Heinz, can't afford it

130
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:16,269
and has tried everything, from fundraising
to begging the pharmacist, to no avail. So,

131
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:19,399
he steals the drug. Was he wrong?

132
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,480
Kohlberg was less interested in people's answers
than in the reasoning behind their choice.

133
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,139
He ended up organizing his subjects' responses
into three basic levels of moral thinking.

134
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:31,139
Kohlberg found that if the subject was younger
than nine, they were likely in what he called

135
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:35,379
the preconventional morality phase. In this
phase, kids are concerned with self-interest,

136
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:39,559
but they're also starting to judge people
individually, based on their needs and point

137
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:44,319
of view. So, Heinz needed the medicine, and
stealing it best served his needs.

138
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,650
But in the second phase, in early adolescence,
our moral compasses seem to shift, during

139
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:53,490
what Kohlberg called the conventional morality
phase. Here, his subjects put an emphasis

140
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:58,230
on conformity and worry about what would happen
to Heinz if he was seen as a criminal. This

141
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,590
phase seems to worry "what would people think?".
From adolescence on, Kohlberg believes, some

142
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:08,930
people exist in the postconventional morality
phase. This is a more complex adult morality,

143
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:13,959
when we begin to account for differing values
and basic rights. Laws are important, but

144
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,960
some situations, like saving your beloved's
life, might overrule them. This phase tops

145
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:23,490
out with reasoning based on universal ethical
principles and more abstract reasoning. Heinz

146
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,409
was right to steal the medicine because people
have a right to live.

147
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:31,179
Critics of Kohlberg's set up question his
emphasis on moral thinking rather than moral

148
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:35,289
action, arguing that there's a big difference
between reasoning out what you should do and

149
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:39,179
actually doing it. But one thing's for sure,
what we experience during our first years

150
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:43,489
on this planet, the nature and quality of
our attachments, our sense of self, and our

151
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,909
moral development, they all set the stage
of our adolescence and adulthood.

152
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:53,120
Today, your developing brain learned about
Ainsworth's three styles of secure, insecure

153
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,840

And about authoritarian, permissive, and authoritative

154
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:04,129
parenting styles. You also learned about developing
self-concept and Kohlberg's stages of morality.
