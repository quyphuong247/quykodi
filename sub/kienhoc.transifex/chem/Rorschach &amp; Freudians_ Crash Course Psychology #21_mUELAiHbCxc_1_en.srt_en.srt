1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,360
What do you see in this image?

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,299
A scary face?

3
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:03,699
A couple of squirrels fighting?

4
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,419
Or this one?

5
00:00:04,419 --> 00:00:05,320
A squashed frog?

6
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,180
Or tumbling poodles?

7
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:08,140
A bleeding bat?

8
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,880
Hermann Rorschach wants to know.

9
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,620
Eh, he wanted to know–he's dead now

10
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:16,500
He believed that your answers, what you saw in the ink, said something about your personality.

11
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,359
Rorschach was a Swiss psychoanalyst who, in his youth, was fascinated

12
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:25,079
by the childhood game of making pictures out of inkblots called klecksography

13
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,259
As an adult, Rorschach was intrigued with Carl Jung's use of word association

14
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,460
in attempts to access patients' unconscious minds.

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,840
Jung would ask patients to say the first thing that came to mind

16
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,840
when they saw words like

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,380
"dead"

18
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:36,980
or "window"

19
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:37,739
or "abuse"

20
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,660
and Rorschach thought,

21
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,100
"Why not do the same thing with amorphous blobs?"

22
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,320
So he'd show a patient a series of ink blots and record what they saw

23
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,280
to determine how people "projected" their personal associations onto random shapes.

24
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,160
Assuming there are important differences between those who saw

25
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,459
dancing bunnies versus those who saw severed, screaming heads,

26
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,120
he drew conclusions about a patient's personality.

27
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:59,640
And yeah, this was controversial.

28
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,439
Some clinicians still do think that Rorschach test can be a helpful diagnostic tool

29
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,759
when used correctly and cautiously.

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,780
But others remain critical of the test, calling them unscientific and unreliable.

31
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,939
It's even been called "the Dracula of psychological tests"

32
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,620
because no one has been able to drive a stake through its heart yet.

33
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,180
So I guess this is that part when I apologize for the set design.

34
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:19,560
Sorry.

35
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,420
But love it or hate it, the Rorschach test is one of the many methods

36
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,359
psychologists have used in an ongoing quest to understand personality.

37
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:30,299
And of all of the concepts we cover in this course, personality is one of the most complex,

38
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,019
and one of the most contested.

39
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:34,140
This is where we bring in the household names.

40
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,120
Not just Rorschach, but Freud, and Jung, 

41
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,579
as well as other influential thinkers like Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers.

42
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:43,480
It's where some of the most familiar concepts in early psychology come into play,

43
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,520
ones that people with even passing knowledge of the field have heard of:

44
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:53,159
the ego, the Oedipus complex, penis envy, inferiority complexes, even the idea of self-help itself.

45
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,879
Whether you've heard of these as hard facts or simply as historical curiosities,

46
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,959
these notions represent the starting points for some of the biggest and most compelling questions in the field.

47
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,179
But they all come back to the same question:

48
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,580
What makes us who we are?

49
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:08,579
♪ [Crash Course intro] ♪

50
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:20,639
We always gotta start out with defining things. Personality. You think you know what that means,

51
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:26,339
but we're gonna define it as your distinctive and enduring characteristic patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving.

52
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,460
And psychologists typically study personality in two broad ways:

53
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,080
1. By trying to understand differences in specific characteristics,

54
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,719
like introvertedness versus extrovertedness.

55
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:40,500
And 2. By looking at how all the various parts of each person mesh together as a whole.

56
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,919
Basically, what are our characteristics and how do they combine to make me me and you you?

57
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,979
And guess what?

58
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:51,159
As you might expect, there are a number of competing perspectives on personality theory.

59
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,659
4 to be exact.

60
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:56,460
The first, and one of the most influential has been the psychoanalytic perspective,

61
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,340
first championed by our coke-loving, cigar-chewing friend, Sigmund Freud.

62
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,259
It was through his clinical observation of patients that

63
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:05,280
Freud came to theorize the existence of the unconscious.

64
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,140
For Freud, the unconscious represented a vast reservoir

65
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:13,039
of often unacceptable and frequently hard-to-tolerate thoughts, feelings, desires, and memories.

66
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:15,579
Usually involving a lots of weird sex stuff.

67
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,500
You gotta point out, by the way,

68
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,900
that the Freudian unconscious is a different thing 

69
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,460
from the contemporary idea of non-conscious information processing

70
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,219
when we're, like, processing information that we don't know we're processing.

71
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:28,359
Freud's thing is, you know, a lot more titillating,

72
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,120
but, the non-conscious is like empirically validated a real thing that we study now.

73
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,300
Anyway, Freud believed that our personalities are largely shaped by the enduring conflict

74
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,280
between our impulses to do whatever we feel like, and our restraint to control those urges

75
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,740
between our pleasure-seeking aggressive urges and our inner social control over them.

76
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,800
He theorized our minds as being divided into three interacting parts—

77
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,200
the id, the ego, and the superego—

78
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,899
that provide the battleground for this internal conflict that shaped our personalities.

79
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,120
You can think of the classic Freudian mind like this iceberg.

80
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,800
It's mostly hidden, and that big underwater chunk is your id:

81
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,540
your unconscious, primitive, and instinctive self.

82
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:09,159
Freud thought the id was all about sex and agression,

83
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:12,819
the so-called pleasure principle of immediate gratification.

84
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,819
To him, infants were all id.

85
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:18,819
That's in part why babies freak out when they don't get a snack like "Right now!",

86
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:21,079
instead of just taking a deep breath for a second.

87
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,039
For that matter, a lot of the off-the-wall celebrities and dictators are big ids.

88
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,360
The id's like a honey badger—they don't care.

89
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,780
Eventually kids develop the ego part of their personality,

90
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:33,679
that largely conscious component that's charged with dealing with reality.

91
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,319
The ego works on getting the id what it wants in a reasonable, timely, and realistic way

92
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,599
without, you know, getting arrested or beaten up.

93
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,300
The final aspect to form in Freud's personality trifecta is the superego,

94
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,519
the Jiminy Cricket of voice of our conscience that represents not just the real, but also the ideal.

95
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,240
As you can imagine, the superego and the id don't much like each other,

96
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,180
and it's up the the Referee Ego to sort everything out.

97
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,360
And it's hard to be the ego.

98
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,759
Freud believed that anxiety comes in part from the ego getting all stressed out about losing control

99
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,240
over the id and superego.

100
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,860
So he proposed that our egos use a series of indirect and unconscious defense mechanisms

101
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,379
to protect themselves from this fear.

102
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:13,439
And each person's particular configuration of defense mechanisms, in turn,

103
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,980
makes up part of what we're referring to here as personality.

104
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,420
You might already have heard of repression,

105
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,160
the defense that's thought to work by banishing any thoughts, feelings, or memories

106
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,040
that cause anxiety to the unconscious.

107
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,340
And repression, Freud thought, allows our many other defense mechanisms to do their work.

108
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:33,099
Regression, for example, involves a retreat to a more infantile psychosexual stage,

109
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,020
like, when a second-grader sucks their thumb when they're nervous.

110
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:38,019
Reaction formation is kinda like passive-aggression.

111
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:42,399
It involves flipping unacceptable impulses like desire to punch someone in the face

112
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,919
with their opposites, like offering them cookies with a fake smile.

113
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,560
Projection is when you disguise your own impulses by calling them out in other people,

114
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,759
and rationalization is just what it sounds like, when we offer explanations and excuses for our behaviors

115
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,920
instead of getting to the real unconscious reasons.

116
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,620
Like, "Yeah, well, I ate six hot pockets at the party just 'cause I was being social!"

117
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,480
Displacement is the typical you got yelled at by your boss, and then came home and yelled at your roommate.

118
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,879
It's when you shift your impulses toward a less threatening victim.

119
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:10,959
And then there's denial,

120
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,539
which is when you refuse to believe or sometimes even perceive some kind of painful reality.

121
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,860
Like, "No, my boyfriend isn't cheating on me."

122
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,379
and "I'm not gonna fail that class,"

123
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,040
and "These pants TOTALLY STILL FIT!"

124
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,980
Our defense mechanisms, as theorized by Freud, are pretty tied in with our personalities.

125
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,439
Someone who engages in a lot of denial and not as much projection would probably look and act 

126
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,100
a lot differently from someone who chronically does the reverse.

127
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,100
Still, Freud was convince our personalities form in our first few years as we pass

128
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,620
through a series of five psychosexual stages,

129
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:43,139
essentially during which the id seeks to get its rocks off in different pleasure-sensitive areas.

130
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,779
Infants start out in the oral stage because they get pleasure from eating.

131
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:49,919
From there, a child enters the anal stage, focused on peeing and pooping;

132
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,540
then on to the phallic stage, as they discover their boy and girl bits.

133
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,040
It was during this stage that Freud believed the infamous Oedipus complex reared up,

134
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,000
characterized by a boy experiencing a form of sexual desire toward his mother

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,519
and a parallel jealousy or hatred of his father.

136
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:08,539
Freud called from about age 6 to puberty the latency stage, marked by dormant sexual feelings

137
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:14,160
which eventually evolved into the fifth and final, adult, genital stage of mature sexual interests.

138
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,620
Now, he believed if certain conflicts weren't resolved in any of these given stages,

139
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,920
a person could develop a fixation, or a lingering focus on a younger stage.

140
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,720
Like if a baby was overfed or neglected and underfed, they might be fixate in the oral stage;

141
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,880
an orally fixated adult might seek oral gratification through excessive eating or chain smoking

142
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:34,300
and may develop issues with dependency or aggression.

143
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,960
Now of course, not everyone was on board with Freud's model of personality development.

144
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:41,239
Many of his ideas were controversial and remain so to this day;

145
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,360
even most modern psychoanalysts now dispute the whole Oedipal thing.

146
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,699
In fact, while many pioneering psychoanalysts built on Freud's theories -- these are so-called neo-Freudians --

147
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:55,060
many disagree with lots of his ideas, and instead either emphasize the role of the conscious mind

148
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,379
or focus on non-sexual motivations.

149
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:59,300
Take Karen Horney, for instance,

150
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,699
a German-born psychoanalyst credited with founding feminist psychology.

151
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:07,620
She wasn't down with the idea that our personalities are primarily shaped by sex and aggression.

152
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,620
She especially rejected the notion of penis envy,

153
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,560
which she thought was more than a little insulting to women.

154
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,680
She actually proposed that womb envy may occur as much in men who were envious they can't give birth.

155
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,720
She encouraged patients to take charge of their own mental health and engage in self-help and analysis,

156
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,600
believing people were often able to sorta be their own therapists.

157
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,240
We mentioned Carl Jung, the famous Swiss psychoanalyst.

158
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:33,379
Jung was a friend and disciple of Freud, but eventually, theoretical differences took them in different directions.

159
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,379
He agreed that the unconscious was a powerful force,

160
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:40,500
but he believed it was more than just a holding cell for repressed sexual thoughts and feelings and memories.

161
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Jung believed sexual drive was only part of the equation,

162
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,980
and that we're also driven by a need to achieve a full knowledge of self.

163
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,160
He also suggested that we have a collective unconscious,

164
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:53,500
a group of shared images or archetypes that are universal to all humans,

165
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,659
and this was why different cultures share similar myths and imagery.

166
00:08:56,659 --> 00:09:00,799
Vienna-born Alfred Adler was another former collaborator of Freud who struck out on his own.

167
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,019
Adler agreed with Freud that childhood was important,

168
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:08,519
but he emphasized ongoing social tensions, not sexual ones, as most crucial to the formation of personality.

169
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,500
He coined the term "inferiority complex" 

170
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,720
and believed that much of our adult behavior is linked to childhood struggles with feeling inferior.

171
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,899
In the end, not all of their their theories have endured,

172
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:20,919
but Freud and his contemporaries were key to the evolution of psychoanalytic theory

173
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,519
because they explored ways in which our mental life and personality

174
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:27,379
may be submerged beneath the veil of consciousness.

175
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:28,659
But the psychoanalytical approach

176
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,580
is only one perspective on what makes us who we are.

177
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,580
Rather than focuseing on how messed up we can be,

178
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:39,540
humanistic theorists focus on the basic goodness of people and how they strive to achieve their full potential.

179
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:42,539
In other words, they believe in the potential for personal growth.

180
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:44,379
Abraham Maslow is one of these guys;

181
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:47,919
he believed we're motivated by that pyramid-shaped hierarchy of needs

182
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:53,039
and that once basic needs are met, like food and shelter and whatnot, we're able to achieve higher goals.

183
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,779
Maslow believed the top two rungs of that pyramid are where the real growth in personality takes place.

184
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:02,399
First, with self-actualization, or the need to live up to our full, unique potential,

185
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:07,799
and then with self-transcendence, or finding meaning and purpose and identity beyond ourselves.

186
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,799
Rather than study only troubled patients,

187
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:12,159
Maslow look at healthy, creative types

188
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,799
with whom he discovered this common thread of self-actualization.

189
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,699
Bolstered by a secure sense of self,

190
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,620
these people were more sure of themselves, more compassionate, caring, driven,

191
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,240
and uneasy around cruelty and pettiness.

192
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,460
American psychologist, Carl Rogers, was another pioneer of humanistic theory,

193
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,420
who proposed a person-centered perspective on personality.

194
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:33,559
Like Maslow, Rogers believed we're all basically good eggs

195
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:38,739
so long as we're nurtured in a growth-promoting environment that he thought required three conditions.

196
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,500
The first is genuineness.

197
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,100
Just the idea that parents and teachers should be transparent and open with their feelings.

198
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,259
Then, there's acceptance; when folks are accepting,

199
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:49,519
people around them won't be afraid to be themselves or make mistakes.

200
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,639
And the third requirement, according to Rogers,

201
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:56,039
is empathy, or the ability to share others' feelings and reflect their meanings.

202
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:01,679
Rogers thought of these traits as the nutrients required to make a personality grow into a healthy self-concept,

203
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,059
that mix of thoughts and feelings that answer the fundamental question, who am I?

204
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:11,239
So, psychoanalytic and humanistic theories of personality were and are incredibly influential,

205
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,000
even if one was a little sorted, and the other, a little sunshine and rainbows.

206
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,279
But they didn't always lend themselves to clear measurement,

207
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,299
and as empirical standards began to take hold in the mid-20th century, this became a major concern.

208
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:26,319
How did we deal with that? Well, tune in next week when we explore some of the newer ways 

209
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,480
of looking at personality and how we started measuring it.

210
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,039
Today, you learned about personality theory and two of its early schools of thought:

211
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:39,399
the psychoanalytic theory, including Freud's three-part model of the mind and defense mechanisms,

212
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,000
along with the neo-Freudians.

213
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,600
You also learned about the humanistic theory,

214
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,480
including Maslow's model of self-actualization and Roger's person-centered perspective.
