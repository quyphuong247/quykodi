1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,810
In your lifetime, you have probably stared
down any number of ability tests and course

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:09,550
exams and PSATs, SATs, ACTs, GREs, GCSEs,
whatever you got in your country. Humans,

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,559
it seems, really get a thrill out of measuring,
ranking, and comparing each other's intelligence.

4
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,599
Unfortunately, as you saw last week, historically,
we have been kind of bad at that. Today, we

5
00:00:18,599 --> 00:00:24,039
think of intelligence as determined by a series
of factors related to genetics, environment,

6
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:28,390
education, perhaps even randomness itself,
some aspects of which may correlate with belonging

7
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,549
to a particular social group, and others not.
The key here, though, is that we don't fully

8
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,839
understand how or how much some of these factors
work.

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,140
How do elements like personal history and
conditions like poverty, access to education,

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,530
stress, even nutrition affect someone's scores
on cognitive tests? And if a group of people

11
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:49,049
share some of these conditions, how will they
respond--both as individuals and as a group--to

12
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:54,309
certain potentially biased intelligence tests?
In the end, the irony is that in our ongoing

13
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:59,410
effort to measure human intelligence, most
of what we've learned is simply what we don't

14
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:04,849
know.

15
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:10,288
[Intro]

16
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:15,379
What is a piano? Which one of these things
is least like the others? Juice is to glass

17
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:19,048
as hand is to what? Which one of these numbers
does not belong in the series? Bernice had

18
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:23,109
x number of jelly beans. She ate one, then
gave half of what was left to Bruno, then

19
00:01:23,108 --> 00:01:27,328
she ate another and gave half of the remainder
to her dog. Now, she only has five beans.

20
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:28,868
How many did she--ahheh uhhhh.

21
00:01:28,868 --> 00:01:33,149
These questions are similar to what you'd
find on today's most widely-used intelligence

22
00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:37,989
tests. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale,
or WAIS, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale

23
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:43,208
for Children, or WISC. Originally published
by psychologist David Wechsler in 1955, the

24
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:47,969
current edition of the exam consists of fifteen
different sub-tests that assess things like

25
00:01:47,968 --> 00:01:53,578
vocabulary, similarities between objects and
concepts, and patterns in letters and numbers.

26
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:57,809
Cognitive tests usually fall into one of two
categories: achievement, or the kind that

27
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,248
reflect what you've learned, and aptitude
- the kind that's supposed to predict your

28
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:06,019
ability to learn something new. So the WAIS
and the WISC are aptitude tests, and your

29
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:08,949
final exam at the end of your math class is
an achievement test.

30
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:12,969
So, how do we know if an intelligence test,
or any other test for that matter, is actually

31
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:18,310
any good? Well, today, we do have some standards.
To be widely accepted, a test must hit three

32
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:23,860
important marks. It has to be standardized,
reliable, and valid. Standardization is basically

33
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,700
about comparability. Whether you answer 15
or 50 questions correctly on a test actually

34
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:33,969
means very little until you can compare those
scores against how others performed. So, to

35
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:38,580
achieve meaningful comparisons, test-makers
must first give the test to a representative

36
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,030
sample group, which sets a standard by which
to compare future test-takers. You've probably

37
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,810
heard of a bell-curve. Whether you're measuring
height or mental aptitude or love of the Beatles,

38
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:52,900
it's often assumed that everyone you're measuring
will fall into what's called a normal pattern:

39
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,060
most scores will fall in the mid-range, while
fewer hit the extremes. And actually, it's

40
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,140
those extremes that intelligence tests are
most widely and effectively used for. It might

41
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,929
help an educator identify a gifted student
who totally blows the roof off a test, but

42
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,750
they're also useful in helping clinicians
determine who might have a disability or be

43
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,430
facing some specific barrier. With victims
of traumatic brain injury or stroke, for example,

44
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,890
a WAIS test can do a nice job of sussing out
whether a patient who's struggling with language

45
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:23,469
actually has a problem remembering and identifying
words, or if they're just having a hard time

46
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,250
processing the information quickly.

47
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,150
But these tests should be regarded more skeptically
when it comes to issues that are either way

48
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,599
more specific or way more broad. Like, they
won't be able to answer questions along the

49
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,879
lines of, "Will Jesse get into Harvard?" or
"Are women smarter than men?" They're just

50
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:41,900
not designed to do that. And in any case,
simply knowing where you fall on a normal

51
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,629
curve on a standardized test doesn't mean
much if the test is poorly designed, so along

52
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:51,139
with being standardized, a good test has high
reliability, meaning it yields dependably

53
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:54,869
consistent results. One way to determine this
is to have people take the same test a second

54
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,580
time, or some similar version of it. If the
two performances resemble one another -- if

55
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,780
the scores correlate -- then the test is thought
to have good reliability.

56
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,120
And the third requirement for the testing
trifecta is simply validity, or the extent

57
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,009
to which a test measures or predicts what
it's supposed to. And there are different

58
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:15,649
kinds of validity -- for instance, if I take
the WAIS IQ test and my scores accurately

59
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,340
predict how good my grades in college will
be, that's a simple kind of predictive or

60
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,250
criterion validity. On the other hand, if
I take the test and my scores correlate strongly

61
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,129
with my results on another similar cognitive
test, like the Stanford Binet, that falls

62
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:33,159
under the broad category of construct validity.
The key is that all of these are ways to see

63
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,210
if a test measures what it claims to measure.
But the stickiest wicket of them all is what

64
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:40,189
we make of the test scores themselves.

65
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:44,300
We've all heard plenty about the influence
of both nature and nurture in psychology,

66
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,340
so the big question is: do our genetics influence
our intelligence, or does our environment?

67
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:53,810
And this is an easy question to answer because
they both do. And that is important. If the

68
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,949
history of intelligence testing has taught
us anything, it's that assuming everyone is

69
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:01,379
smart in the same way and for the same reason
can lead to disastrously bad conclusions.

70
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:05,430
So let's look at the scientific evidence,
and the best place for that is the wealth

71
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,720
of twin and adoption studies, which have been
fascinatingly helpful in illustrating how

72
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,030
genetics and environment can both influence
intelligence.

73
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:17,449
For example, research has shown that identical
twins who were raised together have the highest

74
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:21,969
rate of similarity in intelligence scores
of any group. Fraternal twins who share only

75
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,520
half the genes tend to be much less similar
in their scores, even when raised in the same

76
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,740
home. Likewise, neuroimaging studies show
that certain brain regions, like those associated

77
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,668
with language, are structurally similar between
identical twins, and show similar activity

78
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:39,639
while doing the same kinds of mental tasks.
The brains of fraternal twins raised in the

79
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:44,230
same home are very similar in some areas,
but less so in others. But identical twins

80
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:49,040
who are raised together have the same brain,
at least, according to neuroimaging scans.

81
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,060
Some studies even showed that identical twins
raised apart from each other show higher intelligence

82
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,649
correlation than fraternal twins raised together.
And maybe even more interesting is that these

83
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:01,560
intelligence correlations actually increase
over time.

84
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,910
In one mega-study of eleven thousand twin
pairs in four countries, that correlation

85
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:11,169
kept increasing from middle-childhood to adolescence
to young adulthood and continued to increase

86
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:15,089
through adulthood. Similar research has looked
at adopted children and compared their scores

87
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:19,668
with those of their adopted siblings, parents,
and biological parents. And the results can

88
00:06:19,668 --> 00:06:23,889
be kind of surprising, because as adopted
kids grow up, their mental similarities to

89
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:29,680
their adoptive families actually get smaller
over time until there's virtually no correlation

90
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,720
by adulthood. Instead, they become more similar
in terms of mental aptitude to their biological

91
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,199
parents over time, even if they never met.
In other words: genes appear to matter. You

92
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,370
could take a hundred kids and raise them in
the exact same way, and as adults, they'd

93
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,430
still have different aptitudes. But, does
this mean that when it comes to intelligence,

94
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,090
we're all nature and no nurture?

95
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:55,399
Well, luckily, and somewhat obviously, no.
Life experiences and environment also matter.

96
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:58,870
One sad example of how early environments
affect children can be found in the work of

97
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,949
American psychologist J. McVicker Hunt in
a destitute Iranian orphanage in the 1970s.

98
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:08,830
Conditions were really, really bad; infants
received minimal care, and whatever attention

99
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:12,859
they did get was on a routine schedule, never
in response to whether they were cooing or

100
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,030
crying or anything else. Basically, they were
being raised with no cause and effect between

101
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:21,089
their behaviors and the responses of their
caregivers, and as a result, they didn't learn

102
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:25,789
how to communicate. With no stimulation or
social response, the kids were just kind of

103
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:31,560
passive, vacant lumps. Deprivation was essentially
trumping any inborn intelligence. So, Hunt

104
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,790
started a program. He trained caregivers to
actually talk to infants, to teach them how

105
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:40,180
to mimic sounds and actions, and eventually,
sounds and words from their language. The

106
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,340
results were tremendous. The kids started
to learn really quickly, and basically just

107
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:48,659
came alive. While it's an extreme example,
Hunt's research showed how malleable early

108
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,120
childhood intelligence can be, especially
in disadvantaged and stressful conditions.

109
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,439
So you can see that environment and heredity
interact to affect intelligence, and that

110
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,379
some tricky implications can come out of that
conclusion. But that's hardly the only controversy

111
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:05,209
when it comes to how we view and measure intelligence.

112
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:10,120
There have been some sensational headline-courting
studies of genetic and social influences that

113
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,720
have suggested that fundamental differences
in intelligence may exist between genders

114
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,000
and races, but many of these studies are tangled
up in questions of how potential testing bias

115
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,918
may affect performance. Basically, if a test
inadvertently measures differences caused

116
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:29,189
by cultural experiences or social factors
instead of what we might call "innate intelligence",

117
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:31,360
then you might say that the test is biased.

118
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,580
Extreme example: in the past, immigrants to
the US were classified as "feeble minded"

119
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,339
if they couldn't answer distinctly American
questions, like "Who was the first American

120
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:44,279
president?" or "What's a milkshake?". Today,
concerns about bias focuses on differences

121
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:49,129
among members of the same general culture.
Say, a poor, rural kid who might be plenty

122
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:54,189
smart, but will test low if questions involve
urban, upper-class concepts like taking taxis

123
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,060
and drinking tea out of china cups or the
rules of tennis.

124
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:01,389
So the questions themselves can skew performance
results, but who administers the test can

125
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:06,909
also affect outcomes. Women tend to do better
with a fellow female administrator, and African

126
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:10,278
Americans often score higher if their test
is given by an African American instructor.

127
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:15,200
And the risk of bias may even fall to the
test-takers' own expectations. For example,

128
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,790
many studies have found that if you give a
math test to equally capable men and women,

129
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:24,230
but just before starting, you tell the subjects
that women usually score lower than men, you

130
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,730
actually negatively affect the women's performance.
This self-fulfilling concern that you might

131
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:33,589
mess up and inadvertently fulfill some negative
stereotype is called stereotype threat. It

132
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:37,460
was first described by social psychologist
Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson, and it's

133
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:41,160
been demonstrated frequently across a whole
host of interesting studies.

134
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:45,399
Now, we've only scratched the surface of this
mess that is intelligence testing. An important

135
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:49,460
thing to remember next time you ace or bomb
a test is that you are far more complicated

136
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,730
and nuanced than any test score. Don't let
a number puff you up or drag you down, and

137
00:09:54,730 --> 00:10:00,320
don't let it define you. We all have room
for self-improvement. We are all full of infinite

138
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,790
surprising potential. Ah, and answers to the
questions I asked earlier: A piano is a musical

139
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:08,559
instrument played using a keyboard, banana
is the least similar to the others, juice

140
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:13,379
is to class as hand is to glove, the number
two does not belong in the series, and Bernice

141
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,549
began with twenty-three jellybeans.

142
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:21,079
Today, your intelligent mind learned how we
currently use WAIS and WISC tests to measure

143
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,959
intelligence, and how important it is that
a test be standardized, reliable, and valid.

144
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:30,479
We also looked at how genetics, environment,
testing bias, and stereotype threat can affect

145
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,610
IQ test performance. Thank you for watching,
