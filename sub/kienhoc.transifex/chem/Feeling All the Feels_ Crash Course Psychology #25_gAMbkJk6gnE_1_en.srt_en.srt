1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,240
Mel Gibson did it, Tom Cruise nearly busted
Oprah's couch doing it, and Kanye pretty much

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,259
has owned it for years now. I'm talking about
expressing too much emotion, usually in public

3
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:13,519
and in weird and often insensitive ways.

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,349
Such regrettable outbursts are not unique
to celebrities, of course, and they can be

5
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:23,599
enough to make us think of our emotions as
irrational. But they're not... well, not usually.

6
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:27,469
When they're not getting the better of us,
they have work to do. Part of their job is

7
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:31,489
to provide the energy and motivation that
lets us meet our goals and our needs, and

8
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:37,269
despite the occasional public fail, they often
improve our performance in a given situation.

9
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,340
So emotions play an important role in how
we think and behave. Of course, when they

10
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,870
blow up and someone screams at a flight attendant
or punches a paparazzo or jumps on stage and

11
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:49,549
grabs the mic away from a teenager in the
middle of her acceptance speech to say that

12
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:53,529
someone else deserve the honor more - all
hail BeyoncÃ© - you're kind of off the rails

13
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,160
of normal emotional function.

14
00:00:55,159 --> 00:01:01,640
Okay, definition time, general idea. Emotion
is a mind and body's integrated response to

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,649
a stimulus of some kind. Emotions involve
physiological arousal, expressive behaviors

16
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:11,780
and conscious experience. These can be short
flashes or long, lingering responses, and

17
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,769
they can be very clear or very confusing.
Say, you're walking home at night and you

18
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:21,078
hear footsteps behind you. Physiological arousal
occurs in the form of your heart pounding,

19
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:26,078
your expressive behaviors could be like quickening
your pace or moving toward a streetlight,

20
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:29,828
and your conscious experience may include
thinking "Oh I'm... I'm... gonna get mugged

21
00:01:29,828 --> 00:01:34,358
now? Is this like a werewolf behind me?" Feeling,
you know, fear and panic.

22
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:38,478
We know those three pieces are there, but
psychologists are still puzzling out exactly

23
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:43,319
how they fit together. How do thinking and
feeling interact? Which one comes first? And

24
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:48,060
do these bodily reactions - the pounding heart,
the need to pee, the sweaty palms - come as

25
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,659
a result of the thought "I"m scared", or did
my tweaking out body trigger the thought in

26
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:57,009
my brain? These are just some of the questions
that we'll be looking at in this messy, exhilarating,

27
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:04,009
and terrifying world of emotions - no one
gets out unscathed.

28
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:11,169
[Intro]

29
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:16,359
Our emotions represent and construct a big
part of who we are. Think of how boring we

30
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,170
would be - how boring the world would be without
joy, embarrassment, heartache, or fear. What

31
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:26,250
would motivate us to make decisions, be cautious,
or bold, or strive to understand each other?

32
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:32,520
What would keep our humanity intact? Where
would punk rock come from? No doubt, we need

33
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,810
our emotions, but how do they work?

34
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,900
Well, like, apparently everything in psychology,
there are a few different theories. In the

35
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,010
late 1800s, pioneering American psychologist
William James suggested that our feelings

36
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:50,039
follow our bodily reactions to external situations;
that, for example, you feel sad because you

37
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,359
are crying, or you're scared because you're
shaking like a leaf. This idea was also proposed

38
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,190
by Danish psychologist Carl Lange, and so,
this concept that physiological arousal precedes

39
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:01,509
emotion is called the James-Lange theory.

40
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:06,039
But American physiologist Walter Cannon wasn't
feeling it. He thought that too many of the

41
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:11,009
body's reactions were too similar: a racing
heart, fluttering stomach, and sweaty hands

42
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:17,000
could be attributed to passion, fear, excitement,
or anger. So how could they cause such different

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,409
emotions? His colleague, Philip Bard, agreed,
concluding that bodily responses and emotions

44
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:26,780
occur separately, but simultaneously - and
this idea is the base of the Cannon-Bard theory

45
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,640
of emotion. In other words, a racing heart
doesn't cause fear, nor does the feeling of

46
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:35,939
fear result in a racing heart, rather, both
things just happen together.

47
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:40,960
Today, most psychologists agree that our emotions
are also tangled up with our cognition: whether

48
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,090
or not we're afraid of a dog on the sidewalk
depends a lot on whether we're interpreting

49
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,060
the animal's behavior as threatening or friendly,
probably also, what our personal history with

50
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:55,740
dogs is. In the 1960s, American psychologist
Stanley Schachter and Jerome Singer interpreted

51
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:01,340
this idea that cognition can define emotion,
into what they called their "two-factor theory".

52
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,390
They believed that to experience emotion,
you must both fear physiological arousal,

53
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:10,429
and cognitively label that arousal. And again,
please remember that in psychology, arousal

54
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:15,860
is different from how you're used to using
it. Here, arousal can be thought of as activation

55
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:21,209
or stress, or even energy - an increase in
reactivity or wakefulness that primes us for

56
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,709
some kind of action. So sometimes, arousal
can spill over from one event to the next:

57
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:29,258
say you just watched a heated soccer match,
and you're all revved up, and someone looks

58
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:34,310
at you funny. Suddenly, you might label that
lingering arousal as anger, and the next thing

59
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,968
you know, the whole stadium is one big rioting
aggro chain reaction.

60
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:42,019
Schachter and Singer examine this so-called
"spillover effect" with an experiment that

61
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:47,038
involved an usual combination of college guys
and drugs. First, they injected a bunch of

62
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:51,438
college guys with the hormone epinephrine.
This is basically adrenaline, and as you yourself

63
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:56,218
have probably experienced, it induces a level
of physiological activation that can go any

64
00:04:56,218 --> 00:05:00,038
number of ways emotionally. But then they
threw a curve ball - some of the subjects

65
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:05,089
were told to expect symptoms of feeling all
revved up, while others were told the injection

66
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:09,318
wouldn't produce any effects at all. Then,
after being injected, each subject was left

67
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:14,389
in a waiting room, and with them in the room
was an actor, pretending to wait as well,

68
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:19,050
and acting either all jerky and irritated,
or super happy and euphoric. So the dude's

69
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,528
just sitting there, jacked up on this hormone,
and his heart is racing, and his cheeks are

70
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:27,658
all flushed, and in the case where the subject
was told not to expect the effects, the study

71
00:05:27,658 --> 00:05:31,370
found that the guy would actually adopt the
emotion of the actor in the room, becoming

72
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:36,180
happy or testy, depending on how the person
was acting. His body was having a physiological

73
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,550
response to the hormone, but he ended up effectively
deciding which emotion he was feeling. But,

74
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,379
if the subject had been told that the injection
would make him feel all pumped up, he'd actually

75
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:50,699
report very little emotion, just because he
was blaming that racing heart and flushed

76
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:55,710
face on the drug, not a particular state of
mind. So in terms of the two-factor theory,

77
00:05:55,709 --> 00:06:00,120
the cause of physiological arousal had to
be identified before a person could feel and

78
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,309
label the response as a particular emotion.

79
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:06,860
To Schachter, Singer, and their disciples,
this meant that arousal spurs emotion, but

80
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:12,210
cognition directs it. And yet, some researchers
like Polish-born American psychologist Robert

81
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:17,689
Zajonc, contend that all emotions are the
result of just putting a name to our arousal

82
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:23,028
- he suggests that many of our emotional reactions
occur separately, or even before our cognition

83
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:27,490
kicks in. If you hear a sudden crash outside
your window, you'll automatically react with

84
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,278
a jolt before your brain has the chance to
think, "Gee, what was that crazy noise? Should

85
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:35,639
I feel startled?" This is, in part, because
when it comes to emotions, it's thought that

86
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:42,079
our brains process sensory input by two different
kinds of roots - top-down, or bottom-up approaches,

87
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,258
and neuroscientists can actually chart these
two pathways in action. Some bigger, more

88
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:50,729
complex feelings, like love and hatred take
what we call the "high-road." Say, you read

89
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:56,058
a love letter from your sweetie. You can pin
that mushy feeling in your heart to the sensory

90
00:06:56,059 --> 00:07:00,189
stimulus of reading traveling from your eyes
all the way through your thalamus to your

91
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:04,629
brain's cortex. There, it can be analyzed
by means of your cognitive process, perhaps,

92
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:10,249
consciously, perhaps implicitly - and labelled
with, like, "Aw, so sweet," at which point,

93
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:14,400
it heads to your limbic system, the central
brain region that drives emotion, motivation.

94
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,269
At that point, you respond with all the warm-fuzzies.

95
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:22,649
Other emotions, like simple likes, aversions,
and fears, don't have to involve actual thinking,

96
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:27,218
and take a sort of "low-road" neural path.
Like, that crash outside, or a baseball flying

97
00:07:27,218 --> 00:07:31,639
at your head. Such "jump-out-of-your-chair"
stimuli bypass the cortex and zip right from

98
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,259
the ear or the eye to the amygdala in the
limbic system. It's a knee-jerk reaction that

99
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:40,588
allows us to react quickly, often in the face
of potential danger. In other words, that

100
00:07:40,588 --> 00:07:46,389
slower, high-road cortex route allows thinking
about feeling, while the quick low-road shortcut

101
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:48,408
allows instant emotional reaction.

102
00:07:48,408 --> 00:07:52,088
The stomach flip that happens when you see
your ex, or the ten thousand pee breaks you

103
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:56,629
gotta take before you give a speech, or your
heart racing after a really good kiss - it's

104
00:07:56,629 --> 00:08:00,710
hard to argue with the fact that we often
feel emotions with our bodies as much as with

105
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:04,609
our brains. And you can thank your autonomic
nervous system the next time you're freaking

106
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:08,468
out or trying to calm yourself down. Perhaps,
you recall when we talked about the roles

107
00:08:08,468 --> 00:08:12,838
of the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches
of our autonomic nervous system. The sympathetic

108
00:08:12,838 --> 00:08:17,408
division is what arouses you in a crisis - it
makes you hyper aware, makes your heart rate

109
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:22,118
and breathing increase, spikes your blood
sugar for extra energy - all that fun stuff.

110
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:26,400
It's like a pit crew readying you for action,
and once it's done its job and the danger

111
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:31,459
has passed, the parasympathetic division steps
in and talks you back down from the edge,

112
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:36,458
slowing down your heart and breathing rates,
and shutting off those stress hormones. Generally,

113
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,718
rubbing your back and being all, "Everything's
gonna be okay, baby." What you need is the

114
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,930
right degree of arousal for the situation:
for example, if you're navigating through

115
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:48,088
fast moving traffic in an unfamiliar city,
you wanna hit the sweet spot of optimal arousal

116
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:52,380
that allows you to focus your attention without
either freaking out or getting all mellow

117
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:53,159
and sleepy.

118
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:57,319
Like we said before, there's a lot of overlap
in the symptoms of different emotions. If

119
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,009
you monitor the heart rate, breathing, and
perspiration of a group of people who are

120
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:04,940
watching three different movies, you probably
couldn't tell who was watching the grisly

121
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:10,990
horror movie, an angry fight, or a hot sex
scene. Fear, anger, and sexual arousal often

122
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:15,759
deliver some of the same biological signals.
But those emotions certainly feel different

123
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,699
to the people experiencing them, just as they
usually look different to others observing

124
00:09:20,698 --> 00:09:24,769
their expressions. And though differences
in emotion can appear subtle, or even undetectable

125
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:30,259
on brain scans, many of them do show distinctive
patterns. For most people, positive feelings

126
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:34,839
tend to show more activity in the left frontal
lobe, while negative ones show up more in

127
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,630
the right frontal lobe. And someone who's
very afraid will show increased activity in

128
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:42,149
the amygdala, our more primal emotional center.

129
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:46,909
Emotions are fascinating things that drive
us to do all sorts of brilliant and weird

130
00:09:46,909 --> 00:09:52,539
stuff. Understanding them and being able to
read them both in yourself and others is vital

131
00:09:52,539 --> 00:09:57,360
if you wanna make it through even an average
day. But misreading your emotions or someone

132
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,269
else's can be confusing - even dangerous - and
it's just one of the things that we'll be

133
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,799
looking at next week.

134
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:07,958
Today, you learned about what emotions are,
how they work, and why we need them. We talked

135
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:13,659
about the James-Lange, Cannon-Bard, Schachter
& Singer, and Zajonc theories, and we also

136
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:17,129
looked at the relationship between cognition
and emotion, and how the autonomic nervous

137
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:21,789
system mobilizes emotion. Thanks for watching,
