1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,830
How would you describe your personality? Maybe
friendly, creative, quirky? What about nervous,

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:10,710
or timid, or outgoing? But has anyone ever
called you a sanguine? What about a Kapha,

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,450
or full of metal? Ancient Greek physician
Hippocrates believed personality manifested

4
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:19,799
itself in four different humors, and, basically,
you are who you are because of your balance

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,839
of phlegm, blood, and yellow and black bile.

6
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:26,198
According to traditional Chinese medicine,
our personalities depend on the balance of

7
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:30,609
five elements: Earth, Wind, Water, Metal and
Fire. Those who practice traditional Hindu

8
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:34,819
Ayurvedic Medicine view each other as unique
combinations of three different mind-body

9
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:39,050
principles called Doshas. But Sigmund Freud
thought our personalities depended in part

10
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:44,209
on who was winning the battle of urges between
the Id, Ego, and Superego. Meanwhile, humanistic

11
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,569
psychologist Abraham Maslow suggested that
the key to self-actualization was first successfully

12
00:00:48,569 --> 00:00:52,149
climbing a hierarchy of more basic needs.
And then, you've got your BuzzFeed quizzes

13
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:55,999
to determine what kind of pirate, or font,
or sandwich, or Harry Potter character you

14
00:00:55,999 --> 00:00:58,199
are, but, that, I would never take one of
those seriously.

15
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:03,399
All this is to say that people have been characterizing
one another for a long, long time, and whether

16
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:09,200
you're into blood, or bile, or ego, or id,
or BLT, or PB&J, there are a lot of ways to

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,950
describe and measure a personality. And all
these theories, all the years of research,

18
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,829
and cigar smoking, and inkblot gazing, and
the fans debating whether they're more of

19
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:24,329
a Luke or a Leia, they're all funneling down
to one big central question. Who, or what,

20
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:27,390
is the self?

21
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,079
[Intro]

22
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:37,079
Last week we talked about how psychologists
often study personality by examining the differences

23
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:43,490
between characteristics, and by looking at
how these various characteristics combine

24
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:48,229
to create a whole thinking, feeling person.
The early psychoanalytic and humanistic theorists

25
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:52,590
had a lot of ideas about personality, but
some psychologists question their lack of

26
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,780
clearly measurable standards. Like, there
was no way to really quantify someone's inkblot

27
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,560
response, or how orally fixated they might
be. So this drive to find a more empirical

28
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,170
approach spawned two more popular theories
in the twentieth century, known as the trait

29
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,920
and social cognitive perspectives.

30
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:14,388
Instead of focusing on things like lingering
unconscious influences or missed growth opportunities,

31
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:19,260
trait theory researchers look to define personality
through stable and lasting behavior patterns

32
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:20,810
and conscious motivations.

33
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,400
Legend has it that it all began in 1919, when
young American psychologist Gordon Allport

34
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,299
paid a visit to none other than Freud himself.
Allport was telling Freud about his journey

35
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:34,579
there on the train, and how there was this
little boy who was obsessed with staying clean

36
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:39,400
and didn't want to sit next to anyone or touch
anything. Allport wondered if the boy's mother

37
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,459
had a kind of dirt phobia that had rubbed
off on him. So yadda yadda yadda, he's telling

38
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:48,938
his tale, and at the end of it Freud looks
at him and says, "Mhmm.. Was that little boy

39
00:02:48,938 --> 00:02:53,759
you?" Allport was basically like, "No, man,
that was just some kid on the train. Don't

40
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,358
try to make this into some big unconscious
episode from my repressed childhood".

41
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:00,689
Allport thought Freud was digging a little
too deep, and that sometimes you just need

42
00:03:00,688 --> 00:03:05,598
to look at motives in the present, not the
past, to describe behavior. So Allport started

43
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:10,709
his own club, describing personality in terms
of fundamental traits, or characteristic behaviors

44
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:15,468
and conscious motives. He wasn't so much interested
in explaining traits as he was in describing

45
00:03:15,468 --> 00:03:19,340
them. Modern trait researchers like Robert
McCrae and Paul Costa have since organized

46
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,579
our fundamental characteristics into what's
casually known as The Big Five: openness,

47
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,909
conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness,
and neuroticism, which you can remember using

48
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:34,158
the mnemonic OCEAN, or CANOE, whichever one
you prefer. Each of these traits exist on

49
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,078
a spectrum, so, for example, your level of
openness can range, on one end, from being

50
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:43,760
totally open to new things and variety, or
wanting strict, regular routine on the other

51
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,489
end. Your degree of conscientiousness can
translate into being impulsive and careless,

52
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:51,980
or careful and disciplined. Someone high on
the extroversion end will be sociable, while

53
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:56,908
those on the low end will be shy and reserved.
A very agreeable person, meanwhile, is helpful

54
00:03:56,908 --> 00:04:00,748
and trusting, while someone at the opposite
end may be suspicious or uncooperative. And

55
00:04:00,748 --> 00:04:05,959
finally, on the neuroticism spectrum, an emotionally
stable person will be calm and secure, while

56
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,699
a less stable person is often anxious, insecure,
and self-pitying.

57
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:14,359
The important idea here is that these traits
are hypothesized to predict behavior and attitude.

58
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:17,560
Like an introvert might prefer communicating
through e-mail more than an extrovert, and

59
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,910
an agreeable person is much more likely to
help their neighbor move that couch than a

60
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,500
suspicious one who's just glaring through
the window. By adulthood, trait theorists

61
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,420
will tell you these characteristics are pretty
stable, but it isn't to say that they can't

62
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:32,629
flex a little in different situations. Like
that same shy person might end up singing

63
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:36,540
Elvis karaoke in a room full of people under
the right conditions. So our personality traits

64
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,379
are better at predicting our average behavior
that what we'd do in any specific situation,

65
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:45,000
and research indicates that some traits, like
neuroticism, seem to be better predictors

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,170
of behavior than others.

67
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,699
This flexibility that we all seem to have
leads to the fourth major theory on personality,

68
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:55,529
the social cognitive perspective. Originally
proposed by our Bobo-beating friend Alfred

69
00:04:55,529 --> 00:05:00,569
Bandura, the social cognitive school emphasizes
the interaction between our traits and their

70
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:05,259
social context. Bandura noted that we learn
a lot of our behavior by watching and imitating

71
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:09,620
others. That's the social part of the equation.
But we also think a lot about how these social

72
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,850
interactions affect our behavior, which is
the cognitive part. So, in this way, people

73
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:18,500
and their situations basically work together
to create behavior. Bandura referred to this

74
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,500
sort of interplay as reciprocal determinism.
Meaning, that for example, the kind of books

75
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,029
you read or music you listen to or friends
you hang out with say something about your

76
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:31,750
personality, because different people choose
to be in different environments, and then

77
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,660
those environments in turn continue to reinforce
our personalities.

78
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,180
So if Bernice has a kind of anxious-suspicious
personality, and she has a serious, titanic

79
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:45,240
crush on Sherlock Holmes, she might be extra
attuned to potentially dangerous or fishy

80
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,519
situations. But the more she sees the world
in that way, the more anxious and suspicious

81
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:53,560
she gets. In this way, we're both the creators
and the products of the situations we surround

82
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,839
ourselves with.

83
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:58,969
That's why one of the key indicators of personality
in this school of thought has to do with our

84
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,360
sense of personal control -- that is, the
extent to which you perceive that you have

85
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,189
control over your environment. Someone who
believes that they control their own fate,

86
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:11,120
or make their own luck, is said to have an
internal locus of control, while those who

87
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,370
feel like they're just guided by forces beyond
their control are said to have an external

88
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:20,740
locus. Now whether we're talking about control
versus helplessness, introversion versus extroversion,

89
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,550
calm versus anxious, or whatever, each of
these different personality perspectives have

90
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,740
their own methods of testing and measuring
personality. We've talked before about how

91
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:34,300
the psychoanalyst super-hunk Hermann Rorschach
used his inkblot test to infer information

92
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,520
about a person's personality; we know that
Freud used dream analysis, and both he and

93
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:42,019
Young were both fans of free association,
but the broader school of theorists, now known

94
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:46,620
as the psycho-dynamic camp that descended
from Freud and pals, also use other projective

95
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,459
psychological tests, including the famous
thematic apperception test.

96
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:55,799
In this kind of test, you'd be presented with
evocative but ambiguous pictures, and then

97
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,189
asked to provide information about them. You
might be asked to tell a story about the scenes,

98
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:04,319
considering things like how are the characters
feeling, or what's going on, or what happened

99
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,139
before this event and what will happen after.
Like check it out, is the woman crying because

100
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:12,339
her brother just died, or from a bee sting?
Or is she a maid laughing because some royal

101
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:17,000
just passed out drunk on his bed, or perhaps
the object of her long-burning affection has

102
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,879
just confessed his love in a fever haze all
Jane Austen-style and she's having a mini-breakdown

103
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:25,240
in the hall?! The idea is that your responses
will reveal something about your concerns

104
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,250
and motivations in real life, or how you see
the world, or about your unconscious processes

105
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,139
that drive you.

106
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:35,089
By contrast with that approach, though, modern
trait personality researchers believe that

107
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:39,299
you can assess personality traits by having
people answer a series of test questions.

108
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,370
There are lots of so-called personality trait
inventories out there. Some provide a quick

109
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,090
reading on a particular enduring trait, like
anxiety or self-esteem, while other gauge

110
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:52,579
a wide range of traits, like our friends The
Big Five. These tests, like the Myers-Briggs,

111
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:56,949
which you might have heard of, involve long
questionnaires of true-false or agree-disagree

112
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:01,949
questions like, "Do you enjoy being the center
of attention?", "Do you find it easy to empathize

113
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:06,829
with others?", or "Do you value justice over
mercy?" But the classic Minnesota Multiphasic

114
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:12,180
Personality Inventory is probably the most
widely used personality test. The most recent

115
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,360
version asks a series of five hundred and
sixty-seven true-false questions, varying

116
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:22,340
from "No one seems to understand me" to "I
like mechanics magazines" to "I loved my father",

117
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:24,388
and is often used to identify emotional disorders.

118
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:28,269
Then there's how Bandura's social cognitive
camp sizes you up. Because this school of

119
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:33,139
thought emphasizes the interaction of environment
and behavior rather than just traits alone,

120
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:37,340
they aren't solely into questions and answers.
Instead, they might measure personality in

121
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,560
different contexts, understanding behavior
in one situation is best predicted by how

122
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:45,699
you acted in a similar situation. Like, if
Bernice freaked out and tried to hide under

123
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,259
the bed during the last five thunderstorms,
we can predict that she will do that again

124
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:53,000
next time. And if we conducted a controlled
lab experiment where we, say, we looked at

125
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,330
the effects of thunderstorm noises on people's
behavior, we might get an even better sense

126
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:01,180
of what baseline psychological factors could
best predict storm-induced freak-outs.

127
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:06,259
And finally, there are the Humanistic theorists
like Maslow. They often reject standardized

128
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:10,939
assessments altogether. Instead, they tend
to measure your self-concept through therapy,

129
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,630
interviews, and questionnaires that ask subjects
to describe both how they would ideally like

130
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:19,990
to be and how they actually are. The idea
is that the closer the actual and ideal are,

131
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,379
the more positive the subject's sense of self.

132
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:27,689
Which brings us back to that biggest motherlode
question of them all: Who, or what, is the

133
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,150
self?

134
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:32,009
All the books out there about self-esteem,
self-help, self-awareness, self-control, and

135
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:36,689
so on are built upon one assumption: that
the self is the organizer of our thoughts

136
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:41,790
and feelings and actions: essentially the
center of a personality. But of course, it's

137
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:45,799
a sticky issue. One way to think about self
is through the concept of possible selves,

138
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:50,240
like your ideal self, perhaps devastatingly
attractive and intelligent, successful, and

139
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,240
well-loved, as well as your most feared self,
the one who could end up unemployed and lonely

140
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,019
and rundown. This balance of potential best
and worst selves motivates us through life.

141
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:03,179
In the end, once you factor in environment
and childhood experiences, culture and all

142
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:07,319
that mess, not to mention biology which we
haven't even touched on today, can we really

143
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,510
firmly define self? Or answer certainly that
we even have one? That, my friend, is one

144
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:16,778
of life's biggest questions, and so far it
has yet to be universally answered.

145
00:10:16,778 --> 00:10:21,189
But you learned a lot anyway today, right?
As we talked about the trait and social cognitive

146
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:25,920
perspectives, and also about different ways
these schools and others measure and test

147
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:31,019
personality. We also talked about what self
is, and how our self-esteem works. Thanks
