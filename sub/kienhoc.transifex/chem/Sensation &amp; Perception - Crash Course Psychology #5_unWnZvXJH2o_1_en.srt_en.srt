00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,040
Let me tell you about Oliver Sacks, the famous
physician, professor and author of unusual

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,208
neurological case studies. We’ll be looking
at some of his fascinating research in future

3
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:12,908
lessons, but for now, I just want to talk
about Sacks himself. Although he possesses

4
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:17,690
a brilliant and inquisitive mind, Dr. Sacks
cannot do a simple thing that your average

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,940
toddler can. He can’t recognize his own
face in the mirror.

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,960
Sacks has a form of prosopagnosia, a neurological
disorder that impairs a person’s ability

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,570
to perceive or recognize faces, also known
as face blindness. Last week we talked about

8
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:36,460
how brain function is localized, and this
is another peculiarly excellent example of

9
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,558
that. Sacks can recognize his coffee cup on
the shelf, but he can’t pick out his oldest

10
00:00:41,558 --> 00:00:45,649
friend from a crowd, because the specific
sliver of his brain responsible for facial

11
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:49,948
recognition is malfunctioning. There’s nothing
wrong with his vision. The sense is intact.

12
00:00:49,948 --> 00:00:54,579
The problem is with his perception, at least
when it comes to recognizing faces. Prosopagnosia

13
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:59,370
is a good example of how sensing and perceiving
are connected, but different.

14
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:03,649
Sensation is the bottom-up process by which
our senses, like vision, hearing and smell,

15
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:08,689
receive and relay outside stimuli. Perception,
on the other hand, is the top-down way our

16
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:13,420
brains organize and interpret that information
and put it into context. So right now at this

17
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,799
very moment, you’re probably receiving light
from your screen through your eyes, which

18
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:21,829
will send the data of that sensation to your
brain. Perception meanwhile is your brain

19
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:25,230
telling you that what you’re seeing is a
diagram explaining the difference between

20
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,700
sensation and perception, which is pretty
meta. Now your brain is interpreting that

21
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:36,700
light as a talking person, whom your brain
might additionally recognize as Hank.

22
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,060
[Intro]

23
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,990
We are constantly bombarded by stimuli even
though we’re only aware of what our own

24
00:01:47,989 --> 00:01:53,129
senses can pick up. Like I can see and hear
and feel and even smell this Corgi, but I

25
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:58,229
can’t hunt using sonar like a bat or hear
a mole tunneling underground like an owl or

26
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:03,240
see ultraviolet and infrared light like a
mantis shrimp. I probably can’t even smell

27
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:10,189
half of what you can smell. No! No! We have
different senses. Mwah mwah mwah mwah mwah.

28
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:10,669
Yeah.

29
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:15,339
There’s a lot to sense in the world, and
not everybody needs to sense all the same

30
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,340
stuff. So every animal has its limitations
which we can talk about more precisely if

31
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,319
we define the Absolute Threshold of Sensation,
the minimum stimulation needed to register

32
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,839
a particular stimulus, 50% of the time. So
if I play a tiny little beep in your ear and

33
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,920
you tell me that you hear it fifty percent
of the times that I play it, that’s your

34
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,259
absolute threshold of sensation. We have to
use a percentage because sometimes I'll play

35
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:39,639
the beep and you’ll hear it and sometimes
you won’t even though it’s the exact same

36
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:43,079
volume. Why? Because brains are complicated.

37
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,440
Detecting a weak sensory signal like that
beep in daily life isn’t only about the

38
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:51,289
strength of the stimulus. It’s also about
your psychological state; your alertness and

39
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:56,289
expectations in the moment. This has to do
with Signal Detection Theory, a model for

40
00:02:56,289 --> 00:03:01,769
predicting how and when a person will detect
a weak stimuli, partly based on context. Exhausted

41
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,040
new parents might hear their baby’s tiniest
whimper, but not even register the bellow

42
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:11,129
of a passing train. Their paranoid parent
brains are so trained on their baby, it gives

43
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:15,620
their senses a sort of boosted ability, but
only in relation to the subject of their attention.

44
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,129
Conversely, if you’re experiencing constant
stimulation, your senses will adjust in a

45
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:24,370
process called sensory adaptation. It is the
reason that I have to check and see if my

46
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,959
wallet is there if it’s in my right pocket,
but if I move it to my left pocket, it feels

47
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,569
like a big uncomfortable lump. It’s also
useful to be able to talk about our ability

48
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:35,429
to detect the difference between two stimuli.
I might go out at night and look up at the

49
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,719
sky and, well, I know with my objective science
brain that no two stars have the exact same

50
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,379
brightness, and yeah, I can tell with my eyeballs
that some stars are brighter than others,

51
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:49,989
but other stars just look exactly the same
to me. I can’t tell the difference in their

52
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:50,689
brightness.

53
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:57,689
Are you done? Is it time for your to go? Gimme,
gimme a kiiiissss. Yes, yes. Okay. Good girl.

54
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:02,068
The point at which one can tell the difference
is the difference threshold, but it’s not

55
00:04:02,068 --> 00:04:06,189
linear. Like. if a tiny star is just a tiny
bit brighter than another tiny star, I can

56
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:10,739
tell. But if a big star is that same tiny
amount brighter than another big star, I won’t

57
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:14,270
be able to tell the difference. This is important
enough that we gave the guy who discovered

58
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:19,500
it a law. Weber’s Law says that we perceive
differences on a logarithmic, not a linear

59
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,680
scale. It’s not the amount of change. It’s
the percentage change that matters.

60
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,930
Alright. How about now we take a more in depth
look at how one of our most powerful senses

61
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:34,250
works? Vision. Your ability to see your face
in the mirror is the result of a long but

62
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,910
lightning quick sequence of events. Light
bounces off your face and then off the mirror

63
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,990
and then into your eyes, which take in all
that varied energy and transforms it into

64
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,500
neural messages that your brain processes
and organizes into what you actually see,

65
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,089
which is your face. Or if you’re looking
elsewhere, you could see a coffee cup or a

66
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:54,549
Corgi or a scary clown holding a tiny cream
pie.

67
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,379
So how do we transform light waves into meaningful
information? Well, let’s start with the

68
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:02,879
light itself. What we humans see as light
is only a small fraction of the full spectrum

69
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:08,060
of electromagnetic radiation that ranges from
gamma to radio waves. Now light has all kinds

70
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,379
of fascinating characteristics that determine
how we sense it, but for the purposes of this

71
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:17,189
topic, we’ll understand light as traveling
in waves. The wave’s wavelength and frequency

72
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:21,180
determines their hue, and their amplitude
determines their intensity or brightness.

73
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,209
For instance a short wave has a high frequency.
Our eyes register short wavelengths with high

74
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:31,289
frequencies as blueish colors while we see
long, low frequency wavelengths as reddish

75
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,760
hues. The way we register the brightness of
a color, the contrast between the orange of

76
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:38,969
a sherbet and the orange of a construction
cone has to do with the intensity or amount

77
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:44,320
of energy in a given light wave. Which as
we’ve just said is determined by its amplitude.

78
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,819
Greater amplitude means higher intensity,
means brighter color.

79
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:52,959
Someone’s just told me that sherbet doesn’t-
isn’t a word that exists. His name is Michael

80
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:59,299
Aranda and he’s a dumbhead. Did you type
it into the dictionary? Type it into Google.

81
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,370
Ask Google about sherbet. So sherbet is a
thing.

82
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,949
So after taking this light in through the
cornea and the pupil, it hits the transparent

83
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:11,580
disc behind the pupil: the lens, which focuses
the light rays into specific images, and just

84
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:15,609
as you’d expect the lens to do, it projects
these images onto the retina, the inner surface

85
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:20,150
of the eyeball that contains all the receptor
cells that begin sensing that visual information.

86
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:24,258
Now your retinas don’t receive a full image
like a movie being projected onto a screen.

87
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:28,930
It’s more like a bunch of pixel points of
light energy that millions of receptors translate

88
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,009
into neural impulses and zip back into the
brain.

89
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:36,509
These retinal receptors are called rods and
cones. Our rods detect gray scale and are

90
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:41,009
used in our peripheral vision as well as to
avoid stubbing our toes in twilight conditions

91
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:45,379
when we can’t really see in color. Our cones
detect fine detail and color. Concentrated

92
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:50,629
near the retina’s central focal point called
the fovea, cones function only in well lit

93
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:54,668
conditions, allowing you to appreciate the
intricacies of your grandma’s china pattern

94
00:06:54,668 --> 00:07:00,069
or your uncle’s sleeve tattoo. And the human
eye is terrific at seeing color. Our difference

95
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:04,889
threshold for colors is so exceptional that
the average person can distinguish a million

96
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:05,740
different hues.

97
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,918
There’s a good deal of ongoing research
around exactly how our color vision works.

98
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,829
But two theories help us explain some of what
we know. One model, called the Young-Helmholtz

99
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:18,529
trichromatic theory suggests that the retina
houses three specific color receptor cones

100
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:22,519
that register red, green and blue, and when
stimulated together, their combined power

101
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:26,859
allows the eye to register any color. Unless,
of course you’re colorblind. About one in

102
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,990
fifty people have some level of color vision
deficiency. They’re mostly dudes because

103
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,530
the genetic defect is sex linked. If you can’t
see the Crash Course logo pop out at you in

104
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:39,000
this figure, it’s likely that your red or
green cones are missing or malfunctioning

105
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,288
which means you have dichromatic instead of
trichromatic vision and can’t distinguish

106
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:45,029
between shades of red and green.

107
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:48,619
The other model for color vision, known as
the opponent-process theory, suggests that

108
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,250
we see color through processes that actually
work against each other. So some receptor

109
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:58,339
cells might be stimulated by red but inhibited
by green, while others do the opposite, and

110
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:00,698
those combinations allow us to register colors.

111
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:04,569
But back to your eyeballs. When stimulated,
the rods and cones trigger chemical changes

112
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:10,080
that spark neural signals which in turn activate
the cells behind them called bipolar cells,

113
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:15,008
whose job it is to turn on the neighboring
ganglion cells. The long axon tails of these

114
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:19,610
ganglions braid together to form the ropy
optic nerve, which is what carries the neural

115
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,939
impulses from the eyeball to the brain. That
visual information then slips through a chain

116
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:29,209
of progressively complex levels as it travels
from optic nerve, to the thalamus, and on

117
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:32,610
to the brain’s visual cortex. The visual
cortex sits at the back of the brain in the

118
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,639
occipital lobe, where the right cortex processes
input from the left eye and vice versa. This

119
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:42,668
cortex has specialized nerve cells, called
feature detectors that respond to specific

120
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:47,559
features like shapes, angles and movements.
In other words different parts of your visual

121
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:50,809
cortex are responsible for identifying different
aspects of things.

122
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:54,539
A person who can’t recognize human faces
may have no trouble picking out their set

123
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:58,329
of keys from a pile on the counter. That’s
because the brains object perception occurs

124
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,110
in a different place from its face perception.
In the case of Dr. Sacks, his condition affects

125
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,419
the region of the brain called the fusiform
gyrus, which activates in response to seeing

126
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:10,889
faces. Sacks’s face blindness is congenital,
but it may also be acquired through disease

127
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:14,600
or injury to that same region of the brain.
And some cells in a region may respond to

128
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,180
just one type of stimulus, like posture or
movement or facial expression, while other

129
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:23,349
clusters of cells weave all that separate
information together in an instant analysis

130
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:28,149
of a situation. That clown is frowning and
running at me with a tiny cream pie. I’m

131
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:30,929
putting these factors together. Maybe I should
get out of here.

132
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:35,039
This ability to process and analyze many separate
aspects of the situation at once is called

133
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,509
parallel processing. In the case of visual
processing, this means that the brain simultaneously

134
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:44,799
works on making sense of form, depth, motion
and color and this is where we enter the whole

135
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,958
world of perception which gets complicated
quickly, and can even get downright philosophical.

136
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:54,539
So we’ll be exploring that in depth next
time but for now, if you were paying attention,

137
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:58,059
you learned the difference between sensation
and perception, the different thresholds that

138
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:02,869
limit our senses, and some of the neurology
and biology and psychology of human vision.
