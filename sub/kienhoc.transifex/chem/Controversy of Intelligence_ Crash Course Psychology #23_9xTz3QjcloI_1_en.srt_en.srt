1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:06,849
Smarty pants, egg head, brainiac. You've heard
terms like these before, maybe you've even

2
00:00:06,849 --> 00:00:10,759
been on the receiving end of one of them.
But actually, defining intelligence is a lot

3
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:13,490
trickier than just coming up with new names
for smart people.

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,969
I mean, intelligence isn't like height or
weight; you can't just toss them on a scale

5
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:21,059
and give it an exact measurement. It has different
meanings for different cultures and ages and

6
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:21,858
skill sets.

7
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:26,490
So what is intelligence? It's a question that
doesn't give us a lot of answers, but it does

8
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:30,640
open a bunch of other equally important and
interesting questions.

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,579
Like, what influences it? And how can it be
assessed?

10
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:38,000
Is it a single, general ability, or does it
cover a range of aptitudes and skills and

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,409
talents?
How do things like creativity and innovation

12
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:42,939
factor in? Or genetics or environment, or
education?

13
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:45,329
And what about emotional intelligence?

14
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,929
Most agree that it's best to think of intelligence
not of a concrete thing so much as a concept,

15
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:54,250
the ability to learn from experience, solve
problems, and use knowledge to adapt to new

16
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,219
experiences.
We've often used intelligence tests, to assess

17
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:02,448
and compare mental aptitude, but these tests
have a long, complex and dark history. I mean

18
00:01:02,448 --> 00:01:04,859
there are Nazis involved so, yeah.

19
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:08,760
So as you'll see, there are reasons that intelligence
is one of the most hotly debated subjects

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,760
in psychology. It's complicated and controversial.

21
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,790
[Intro]

22
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,750
What if I'm the world's greatest Rubik's cube
solver but a terrible speller? Or a truly

23
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:31,709
gifted artist who's barely mastered long division?
Could anyone say I was intelligent or not

24
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:35,889
based on those different aptitudes, or would
it be more accurate to measure my brainpower

25
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,280
on several different scales?

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,040
Around the turn of the twentieth century,
British psychologist Charles Spearman suggested

27
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,950
that yes, we do have one comprehensive general
intelligence that underlies all of specific

28
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,290
mental abilities. He called it the G-Factor.

29
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,170
Spearman conceded that while people may have
special talents like basket weaving or saxophone

30
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:58,210
solos or doing crossword puzzles, those things
still fell under "G". And he helped develop

31
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:03,159
a statistical procedure called factor analysis
to try to determine how certain clusters of

32
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:08,228
skills might correlate with another one. Like,
say someone who tests well in spatial skills

33
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,450
might be good with numbers.

34
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:14,250
We might then refer to that cluster of skills,
that factor, as spatial-numeric reasoning.

35
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,908
But to Spearman, the G-factor was something
of an uber-factor connected to all intelligent

36
00:02:18,908 --> 00:02:24,358
behavior from architecture to healing to survival
skills, and it's why people who do well on

37
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:29,260
one kind of cognitive test tend to do well
on others. But as you can imagine, reducing

38
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:33,419
intelligence to a single numerical test score
was and is problematic.

39
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:38,598
L.L. Thurstone, an American pioneer of psychometrics
and one of Spearman's first challengers, was

40
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:43,848
not into ranking people on a single scale.
Thurstone administered 56 different tests

41
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:48,839
to his subjects then used them to identify
seven clusters of mental abilities. By this

42
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,628
system, you might turn out to be great at
like verbal comprehension but less stellar

43
00:02:52,628 --> 00:02:54,479
at something like numerical ability.

44
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,548
Sounds fair. But when researchers followed
up on his findings, they actually did see

45
00:02:57,549 --> 00:03:02,150
that high scores in one aptitude usually meant
good scores in the others, essentially backing

46
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:07,438
up some evidence for some kind of G-factor.
Even though their ideas did not often align,

47
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:11,598
Spearman and Thurstone together paved the
way for more contemporary theories on intelligence.

48
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,539
For example, American psychologist Howard
Gardner views intelligence as multiple abilities

49
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:19,679
that come in different forms. He references
instances of brain damage where one ability

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,120
may be destroyed while others stay perfectly
intact. Savants usually have some limited

51
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,049
metal abilities but one exceptional ability
when it comes to like, computing figures or

52
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:29,909
memorizing the complete works of Shakespeare.

53
00:03:29,908 --> 00:03:35,358
To Gardner, this suggests that we have multiple
intelligences beyond the G-factor. In fact,

54
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:40,200
he believes that we have eight intelligences,
ranging from our skills with numbers and words

55
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:44,298
to our ability to understand physical space
and the natural world. American psychologist

56
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:49,420
Robert Sternberg tends to agree with Gardner,
though he boils them down into three intelligences:

57
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:54,218
analytical, or problem-solving intelligence,
creative intelligence, or the ability to adapt

58
00:03:54,218 --> 00:03:57,650
to new situations, and practical intelligence
for everyday tasks.

59
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,620
Both of these models seem reasonable, too,
and Gardner and Sternberg's work has helped

60
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,849
teachers appreciate students' variety of talents.
But research has suggested that even these

61
00:04:06,848 --> 00:04:12,318
different ways to be smart are also linked
by some underlying general intelligence factor.

62
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,469
So what about other less tangible forms of
intelligence, like creativity, our ability

63
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,700
to produce ideas that are both novel and valuable?
How can a test that demands one correct answer

64
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:25,399
account for more creative solutions, so-called
"divergent thinking".

65
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:30,349
Well, traditional intelligence tests can't,
and so far, while we do have some tests that

66
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:35,230
look at creative potential, we don't have
a standardized system for quantifying creativity.

67
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,970
But Sternberg and his colleagues have identified
five main components of creativity, which

68
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,730
are useful for framing our understanding of
what creative intelligence is and how it works.

69
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,790
If you go through the list, you know who I
think is really great at almost all of them?

70
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,290
Sherlock Holmes. Hear me out.

71
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,600
First we've got expertise, or a well-developed
base of knowledge. This just means knowing

72
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,290
a lot about a lot. Whether it's arcane poisons,
jellyfish behavior, or how to recognize a

73
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,580
secret passage behind a book shelf, expertise
provides the mind with all sorts of data to

74
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:07,169
work with and combine in new ways.

75
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:11,470
Obviously Sherlock has incredible imaginative
thinking skills, too, which provide him with

76
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:16,290
the ability to see things in new ways, recognize
patterns and make connections. He loves nothing

77
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,500
more than rehashing these breadcrumb trails
for the dopey constables at the end of the

78
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:20,910
case.

79
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,730
Sternberg also thought a venturesome personality
contributes to creativity. By hanging around

80
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:29,939
opium dens and chasing thugs and generally
courting danger, Sherlock routinely seeks

81
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:34,110
new experiences, tolerates risk, and perseveres
in overcoming obstacles.

82
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,930
And everyone knows he's driven by intrinsic
motivation. I mean, he wants to help the widow

83
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,160
discover the thief and everything, but really,
Sherlock is driven by his own interest and

84
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,910
sense of challenge. He gets pleasure from
the work itself.

85
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:51,710
And finally, Sherlock benefits from a creative
environment which sparks, supports, and refines

86
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:56,169
his ideas. For so affectionately maintaining
this environment on Sherlock's behalf, we

87
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,730
largely have Dr. Watson to thank.

88
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:03,439
Sherlock was obviously an academic and creative
genius, but he was pretty weak in another

89
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:08,969
form of intelligence: the emotional kind.
Emotional intelligence, defined in 1997 by

90
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,330
psychologist Peter Salovey and John Mayer
-- no, not, not that one-- is the ability

91
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:19,209
to perceive, understand, manage, and use emotions.
I don't know about you, but I know plenty

92
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:24,379
of smart people who have a hard time processing
social information. The most brilliant mathematician

93
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:29,719
may struggle to communicate with colleagues,
neighbors, or staff at the local deli. Likewise,

94
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,040
Sherlock often annoys, offends, or even baffles
those around him.

95
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,810
Perceiving emotions means being able to recognize
them in faces, and even in music, film, and

96
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,620
stories. Understanding emotions relates to
being able to predict them and how they might

97
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,810
change. And managing emotions comes down to
knowing how to appropriately express yourself

98
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:51,250
in various situations. And finally, emotional
intelligence also means using emotions to

99
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,519
enable adaptive or creative thinking; like
knowing how to manage conflict or comfort

100
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:57,639
a grieving friend or work well with others.

101
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,449
Much like creative intelligence, emotional
intelligence can be measured to some degree

102
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:06,120
through testing, but there's no standardized
way to, like, assign a numerical value. So

103
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,110
if we can't perfectly quantify things like
creativity or emotional smarts, how did we

104
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,569
come up with a way to measure intelligence?

105
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:17,579
Well, as I mentioned earlier, it's a sordid
story. The first attempts to do it in the

106
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:22,409
western world began with English scientist
Francis Galton in the 1800s. Taking a page

107
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:27,140
from his famous cousin Charles Darwin's theories
on natural selection, Galton wondered how

108
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:32,099
that premise might extend to humans' natural
ability when it came to intelligence. He suggested

109
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,410
that our smarts have a lot to do with heredity,
so if we encouraged smart people to breed

110
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,830
with each other, we could essentially create
a master race of geniuses.

111
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:47,819
If that sounds a little sketchy, it's because
it was, like, really, really sketchy!! This

112
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:53,099
study of how to selectively and supposedly
improve the human population, especially by

113
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:58,470
encouraging breeding in some people and discouraging
it in others, is called "eugenics". A term

114
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,420
Galton himself coined, and I'll get back to,
in a minute. But around the turn of the twentieth

115
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,370
century when eugenics was taking off, the
French government mandated that all children

116
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:10,879
must attend school. Many of these kids had
never been in a classroom and teachers wanted

117
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,449
to figure out how they could identify kids
who needed extra help. Enter Alfred Binet

118
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:19,870
and Theodore Simon, two French psychologists
who were commissioned to develop a test to

119
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,199
measure a child's so-called mental age.

120
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,269
The concept of a kid's mental age is essentially
the level of performance associated with a

121
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:30,479
certain chronological age. So if six year
old Bruno tests as well as the average six

122
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,658
year old, he'd have a mental age of six.

123
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:36,870
Binet believed that his tests could measure
a child's current mental abilities, but that

124
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,969
intelligence wasn't a fixed, inborn thing.
He believed a person's capabilities could

125
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:46,670
be raised with proper attention, self-discipline
and practice. In other words, he was no eugenicist.

126
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:50,929
He was hoping that his tests would improve
children's education by identifying those

127
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:55,338
who needed extra attention. But Binet also
feared that these tests would, in the wrong

128
00:08:55,339 --> 00:09:00,860
hands, be used to do just the opposite: labeling
children as "lost causes", limiting their

129
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:06,100
opportunities. And wow, was he on to something
because that is pretty much exactly what happened.

130
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,990
German psychologist William Stern used revisions
of Binet and Simon's work to create the famous

131
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:16,120
intelligence quotient, or IQ measurement.
At the time, your IQ was simply your mental

132
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,799
age, divided by your chronological age, multiplied
by a hundred. So for example Bruno is six,

133
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:25,990
and so is his mental age, so his IQ ranks
at a hundred, but his little sister Betty

134
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:30,339
is a four year-old with a mental age of five,
so her IQ would be 125.

135
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:33,620
That formula works pretty well for measuring
kids, but it falls apart when it comes to

136
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,019
adults who don't hit measurable developmental
steps like kids do. I mean there's no real

137
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:40,959
difference between a mental age of 34 and
35.

138
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:45,469
But Stanford professor Lewis Terman started
promoting the widespread use of intelligence

139
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:50,089
tests in the early 1900s, and with his help
the US government began the world's first

140
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:54,949
massive ministration of intelligence tests,
when it assessed World War I army recruits

141
00:09:54,948 --> 00:09:56,748
and immigrants fresh off the boat.

142
00:09:56,749 --> 00:10:01,370
Unlike Binet, Terman did use these numerical
findings as a kind of label, and he thought

143
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:07,509
his tests could, as he put it: "ultimately
result in curtailing the reproduction of feeble-mindedness".

144
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:11,990
This kind of testing played right into eugenicists'
sensibilities, and soon the eugenics movement

145
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,049
in the US had a pretty good fanclub, raising
money from the Carnegie's and Rockafeller's

146
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:19,308
and with proponents working at Harvard and
Columbia and Cornell.

147
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:23,679
In the first half of the 21st century, intelligence
tests were used to enforce the sterilization

148
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:29,419
of about 60,000 people, around a third of
whom were in California. Most were poor white

149
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:33,740
women, often unwed mothers or prostitutes.
Other eugenics efforts persisted later into

150
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:38,019
the century, and there is evidence of poor
African American, Native American, or Latina

151
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:43,139
women being forcibly or covertly sterilized
in large numbers as recently as the 1970s.

152
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:46,999
But do you know who really loved their eugenics?
The Nazis.

153
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:51,709
Hitler and his cronies took the idea of intelligence
testing to even darker conclusions. The Nazis

154
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:56,359
were all about selecting against so-called
"feeble-mindedness" and other undesirable

155
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,649
traits as they sought to strengthen what they
saw as their Aryan nation. They sterilized

156
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:04,639
or simply executed hundreds of thousands of
victims based of their answers to IQ test

157
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,698
questions that were really more abut adhering
to social norms than measuring actual intelligence.

158
00:11:09,698 --> 00:11:13,859
Questions like: "Who was Bismarck?" and "What
does Christmas signify?" So you can see how

159
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,350
this terrifying history still makes some people
leery of how such tests are administered,

160
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,050
interpreted, and weighted.

161
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:23,669
Today we understand that intelligence, as
defined by all the people we've talked about

162
00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:28,628
here, does appear to be a real and measurable
phenomenon. But no one can say that they've

163
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:33,949
disentangled all of the would-be genetic,
environmental, educational, and socio-economic

164
00:11:33,948 --> 00:11:37,588
components of it. In the end, it's best to
think of intelligence as something about which

165
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:41,949
we've still got a lot to learn. And next week,
we'll talk about how we test intelligence

166
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:45,219
today and the problems we still face in doing
it.

167
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,189
Today, your intelligent mind learned about
the history of how we think about and define

168
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:54,208
different types of intelligence, what the
G-factor is, and how Sherlock Holmes is incredibly

169
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:58,409
intelligent but emotionally unintelligent.
You also learned about the history and methods

170
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:03,068
of intelligence testing, IQ scores, and how
eugenics turned to the dark side, and has

171
00:12:03,068 --> 00:12:06,049
since made even talking about intelligence
kind of controversial.
