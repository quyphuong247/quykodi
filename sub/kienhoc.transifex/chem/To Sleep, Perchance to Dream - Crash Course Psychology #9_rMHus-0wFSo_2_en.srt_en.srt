1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,080
Comedian Mike Birbiglia was having trouble
with sleep.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,650
Though not with the actual sleeping part -- one
night, while staying in a hotel, he dreamed

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:11,120
that a guided missile was on its way to his
bed, and in his dream, he jumped out the window

4
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:12,129
to escape it.

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,759
Unfortunately, he also did this not in his
dream.

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,440
From the second floor. And the window was
not open.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,490
This little episode cost him 33 stitches and
a trip to a sleep specialist.

8
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,868
Mike now sleeps in zipped-up mummy bags for
his own safety.

9
00:00:25,868 --> 00:00:31,480
The lesson here? Sleep is not some break time
when your brain, or your body, just goes dormant.

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,838
Far from it. In truth, sleep is just another
state of consciousness. And only in the past

11
00:00:35,838 --> 00:00:40,280
few decades have we begun to really plumb
its depths -- from why we sleep in the first

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,460
place, to what goes on in our brains when
we do, to what happens when we can’t sleep.

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,850
And there is a lot that science has to say
about your dreams!

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,539
Talk about weird! It’s like Sigmund Freud
meets Neil Gaiman.

15
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:54,439
So, even though it may seem like you’re
dead to the world, when you sleep, your perceptual

16
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:56,738
window remains slightly open.

17
00:00:56,738 --> 00:01:00,378
And kinda like Mike Birbiglia’s hotel room
window, a trip through it can make for a pretty

18
00:01:00,378 --> 00:01:01,288
wild ride.

19
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,789
But for your safety and enjoyment, I’m here
to guide you through this state of consciousness,

20
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:08,099
where you’ll learn more than a few things
about human mind, including your own.

21
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:15,099
And here’s hoping you won’t need any stitches
when we’re through.

22
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,689
[INTRO]

23
00:01:20,688 --> 00:01:25,419
Technically speaking, sleep is a periodic,
natural, reversible and near total loss of

24
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,359
consciousness, meaning it’s different than
hibernation, being in a coma, or in say, an

25
00:01:29,358 --> 00:01:30,218
anesthetic oblivion.

26
00:01:30,218 --> 00:01:33,809
Although we spend about a third of our lives
sleeping, and we know that it’s essential

27
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,590
to our health and survival, there still isn’t
a scientific consensus for why we do it.

28
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,810
Part of it probably has to do with simple
recuperation, allowing our neurons and other

29
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,399
cells to rest and repair themselves. Sleep
also supports growth, because that’s when

30
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:50,118
our pituitary glands release growth hormones,
which is why babies sleep all the time. Plus,

31
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:53,409
sleep has all kinds of benefits for mental
function, like improving memory, giving our

32
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:56,719
brains time to process the events of the day,
and boosting our creativity.

33
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,089
But even if we’re not quite sure of all
the reasons why we sleep, technology has given

34
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,649
us great insight into how we sleep.

35
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:08,310
And for that we can thank little Armond Aserinsky.
One night in early 1950s Chicago, eight-year-old

36
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,140
Armond was tucked into his bed by his father.
But this night, instead of getting a kiss

37
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:15,919
on the forehead, little Armond got some electrodes
taped to his face.

38
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,439
Armond’s dad was Eugene Aserinsky, a grad
student looking to test out a new electroencephalograph,

39
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,109
or EEG machine, that measures the brain’s
electrical activity.

40
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,920
That night, as his son slept peacefully, he
watched the machine go bonkers with brain

41
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,009
wave patterns, and -- after making sure that
his machine wasn’t somehow broken -- discovered

42
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:38,870
that the brain doesn’t just "power down"
during sleep, as most scientists thought.

43
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,349
Instead, he had discovered the sleep stage
we now call REM or rapid eye movement, a perplexing

44
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:47,179
period when the sleeping brain is buzzing
with activity, even though the body is in

45
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:47,900
a deep slumber.

46
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,860
Aserinsky and his colleague Nathaniel Kleitman
went on to become pioneers of sleep research.

47
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,560
Since then, sleep specialists armed with similar
technology have shown that we experience four

48
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,709
distinct stages of sleep, each defined by
unique brainwave patterns.

49
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:05,489
Say you’re just going to bed. All day your
endocrine system has been releasing “awake”

50
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:10,079
hormones like cortisol. But with nightfall
comes the release of sleepy melatonin hormones

51
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:14,700
from the pineal gland. Your brain is relaxed,
but still awake, a level of activity that

52
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:16,238
EEGs measure as alpha waves.

53
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,658
You’re feeling sleepy, your breath slows,
and suddenly you’re asleep. This exact moment

54
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:26,658
is clearly evident on an EEG reading, as those
alpha waves immediately transition to the

55
00:03:26,658 --> 00:03:32,639
irregular non-Rapid Eye Movement stage one
(NREM-1) waves. It’s in this first stage

56
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,688
of sleep you might experience hypnagogic sensations
-- those brief moments when you feel like

57
00:03:37,688 --> 00:03:39,859
you’re falling, and your body jerks, startling
you.

58
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:44,680
As you relax more deeply, you move into NREM-2
stage sleep, as your brain starts exhibiting

59
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,390
bursts of rapid brain wave activity called
sleep spindles. You’re now definitely asleep,

60
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:52,119
but you could still be easily awakened.

61
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,959
NREM-3 comes with slow rolling delta waves.
We now know that you can have brief and fragmentary

62
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,140
dreams in the first three stages of sleep,
but eventually you’ll get to the most important

63
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:08,068
stage: full REM sleep, that famous stage of
sugarplum slumber that makes eyeballs go nuts,

64
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:12,348
grants vivid visual dreams, and provided the
namesake for a certain famous rock band.

65
00:04:12,348 --> 00:04:16,639
REM sleep is kinda paradoxical. Your motor
cortex is jumping all over the place, but

66
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,449
your brainstem is blocking those messages,
leaving your muscles so relaxed that you’re

67
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:25,550
basically paralyzed. Except for your eyes.
That whole sleep cycle repeats itself every

68
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,759
90 minutes or so, transitioning back and forth
between the stages of sleep.

69
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:33,639
Obviously sleep is super important, and lack
of sleep is terrible for your health, mental

70
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,629
ability, and mood. In fact it’s a predictor
for depression, and has been linked to things

71
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:41,879
like weight gain, as your hunger-arousing
and -suppressing hormones get out of whack.

72
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:45,550
Sleep deprivation also causes immune system
suppression, and slowed reaction time which

73
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,680
is why you should not drive sleepy.

74
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,910
Of course, a bad night’s sleep here and
there is part of life, but there are a host

75
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,870
of bona fide sleep disorders out there that
can really make life pretty terrible, or in

76
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,300
Mike Birbiglia’s case, land you in the emergency
room.

77
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,379
We’ve got insomnia, which is persistent
problems of falling or staying asleep. And

78
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:05,480
kind of its opposite, narcolepsy, whose sufferers
sometimes experience brief, uncontrollable

79
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,750
attacks of overwhelming sleepiness, called
“sleep attacks.” This, as you can imagine,

80
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,790
can get in the way of all sorts of things
that you might enjoy doing, like driving,

81
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,040
eating, pole-vaulting.

82
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,670
Narcolepsy may have several different causes,
including a deficiency in the neurotransmitter

83
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:23,009
hypocretin, which helps keep you awake. But
in more rare cases, brain trauma, infection,

84
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:24,750
and disease may contribute to it as well.

85
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,980
So, that’s rare, but you probably know someone
with sleep apnea, the disorder that causes

86
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:33,910
sleepers to temporarily stop breathing, until
their decreased oxygen levels wake them up.

87
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,280
Birbiglia, meanwhile, turned out to have a
REM sleep behavior disorder, which we don’t

88
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,669
fully understand yet, but appears to be associated
with a dopamine deficiency.

89
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:45,660
Then we’ve got night terrors, which are
as terrible as they sound... spurring increased

90
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,790
heart and breathing rates, screaming, and
thrashing that’s seldom remembered upon

91
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:54,600
waking. Night terrors are most common in children
under seven, and may be spurred by stress,

92
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,120
fatigue, sleep deprivation, and sleeping in
unfamiliar surroundings. Much like sleepwalking

93
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,209
and sleeptalking, night terrors occur during
the NREM-3 stage of sleep, and are NOT the

94
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:08,319
same as nightmares, which occur, like most
dreaming, during REM sleep.

95
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,860
But oh, in REM sleep, what dreams may come...
There you are, running naked as your teeth

96
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,689
fall out, being chased down the beach by a
Matt Damon centaur. You wake up, feel around

97
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:21,250
your mouth thinking what? What? What?! WHAT?!

98
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:26,579
Welcome to your dreams, those vivid, emotional
images racing through your sleeping brain,

99
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:30,789
often providing a backdrop so bizarre that
it may seem like David Lynch, Terry Gilliam,

100
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:35,080
and Tim Burton are trying to out-weird each
other in a film festival. A really, really

101
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:40,050
long festival, considering the average person
spends about six years of their lives dreaming.

102
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,770
So yeah, sometimes you have really crazy dreams.
But mostly, your average dream usually just

103
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:48,139
sort of unpacks and reshuffles what you did
that day. For example last night I dreamt

104
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:51,360
about Tumblr, cause I spent a lot of time
on Tumblr yesterday.

105
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,180
If you played Tetris all afternoon, you might
dream of blocks falling from the sky. If something

106
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,100
traumatic happened to you, your brain might
provide you with a nightmare to help extinguish

107
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,040
your daytime fears - Thanks, brain!

108
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,770
Then again...you might be unable to stop dreaming
about the trauma, which we’ll look at in

109
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:07,459
the future when we discuss post-traumatic
stress disorder.

110
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:11,239
Our two-track minds of course allow us to
register more stimuli than we outwardly acknowledge

111
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,379
during the day, and in that way, the sounds
of car alarms or stinky dog farts that you

112
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:17,969
might not even have noticed may get incorporated
into your dream, too.

113
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,920
And that’s all interesting and weird and
sometimes a little gross, but what’s the

114
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:27,680
real purpose of dreaming? Whyyy do we do this?
Well, as you might have guessed, there’s

115
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,870
more than one idea out there…
The study of dreams is is a mix of neuroscience

116
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,699
and psychology known as oneirology. Oneiros
is the Greek for dream, and if you’re a

117
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:39,420
Neil Gaiman fan you may recognize it as one
of the Sandman’s many names. The one that

118
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,750
comes with a toga and Orpheus’s head.

119
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,279
But Sandman aside, if you want to talk dreams,
we might want to start with our old friend

120
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,219
Freud.
In his landmark 1900 book The Interpretation

121
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,570
of Dreams, Freud proposed that our dreams
offer us wish-fulfillment.

122
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:55,269
He thought a dream’s manifest content, the
stuff you remember in the morning, was a sort

123
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:59,779
of censored and symbolic version of whatever
inner conflict was really going on in that

124
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,089
dream’s unconscious, or latent, content.

125
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:06,179
Not surprisingly, the wish-fulfillment theory
lacks scientific chops and has for the most

126
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,340
part fallen out of favor -- because, really,
you can interpret a dream any way you want.

127
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:12,619
Like, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.

128
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,480
Luckily we have some other theories to consider.
The information processing theory proposes

129
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,569
that our dreams help us sort out and process
the day’s events and fix them into our memories.

130
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:26,339
This may be particularly important when it
comes to learning and remembering new information,

131
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:31,299
and some studies show that people recall new
tasks better after a good REM sleep full of

132
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,168
dreams.
But if brainwave readings show us anything,

133
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:36,860
it’s that there’s a lot going on in your
brain when you dream, and the physiological

134
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,139
function theory suggests that dreaming may
promote neural development and preserve neural

135
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:45,360
pathways by providing the brain with stimulation.
When our brains are stimulated, they expand

136
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,329
their connections more. So, babies, for example,
spend much of their sleep time dreaming, perhaps

137
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:53,438
in part to help their brain circuitry develop
more quickly.

138
00:08:53,438 --> 00:08:57,318
This is similar to the idea that dreams are
part of our cognitive development. By this

139
00:08:57,318 --> 00:09:01,938
model, dreams draw on our knowledge and understanding
of the world, mimicking reality, and engaging

140
00:09:01,938 --> 00:09:04,919
those same brain networks that light up when
we daydream.

141
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,938
And finally, there are theories that focus
on the way REM sleep triggers neural activity,

142
00:09:08,938 --> 00:09:13,659
and the idea that dreams are just sort of
accidental side-effects, the brain’s attempt

143
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:17,850
to weave a story out of a bunch of random
sights, emotions, and memories -- which is

144
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,909
how in dreamland you might actually marry
that Matt Damon centaur and give birth to

145
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:24,179
a baby with banana fingers and a raccoon tail.

146
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:27,818
For now scientists continue to debate the
function of dreams, but one thing we know

147
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:32,509
for sure is that REM sleep is vital, both
biologically and psychologically.

148
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:36,730
But, hey, you think your dreams are nut-bar?
Next week, we’re looking at other altered

149
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,079
states of consciousness, where you’ll learn
what your brain really looks like on drugs,

150
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:46,019
and whether you can actually hypnotize someone
