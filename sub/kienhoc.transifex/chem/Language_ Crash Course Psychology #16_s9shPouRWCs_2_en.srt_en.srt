1
00:00:00,139 --> 00:00:04,970
Baby Kanzi was recently adopted, and adjusting
to life in his new home.

2
00:00:04,969 --> 00:00:09,620
His mother was working with a language coach
to learn some English, and Kanzi usually came

3
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:11,969
along, though he didn’t appear to pay much
attention.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,429
But the language coach noticed that he seemed
to be picking up on how to communicate, just

5
00:00:16,428 --> 00:00:18,209
by watching his mother’s lessons.

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,160
Oddly enough, it appeared that he was picking
things up faster than his mom.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,550
For example, the phrases “you tickle”
and “tickle you” meant two different things,

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,089
and Kanzi’s mom, she was having a hard time
understanding that syntax.

9
00:00:30,088 --> 00:00:34,509
But one day Kanzi was hanging out, playing
with stuffed animals, and the coach asked

10
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:39,058
him to make the dog bite the snake. Kanzi
put the snake in the dog’s mouth, like it

11
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:41,599
was no big deal.
It was a really big deal.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,489
Because Kanzi is a bonobo.
He’s actually a language superstar, even

13
00:00:45,488 --> 00:00:51,288
among the elite research primates, like Koko
the Gorilla. Kanzi is the first ape to demonstrate

14
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:56,058
that language can be acquired spontaneously
through observation, without planned training,

15
00:00:56,058 --> 00:01:01,030
and the first to show a rudimentary understanding
of grammar, syntax, and semantics.

16
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:07,060
Again, really. big. deal. Especially because
for years humans have proclaiming that it’s

17
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,350
language that sets us apart from other animals.

18
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:10,658
But are we really alone?

19
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:14,450
Turns out, that question keeps getting more
and more complicated.

20
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,659
Technically we define language as a set of
spoken, written, or signed words and the way

21
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,140
we combine them to communicate meaning.

22
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,310
If we change that definition to include the
use of complex grammar, then maybe we are

23
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,359
alone.
But if language is simply the ability to communicate

24
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:32,859
through a meaningful sequence of symbols,
as I might do while looking for a bathroom

25
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:37,728
in Sweden, or Kanzi does when she’s asking
to roast marshmallows, well then welcome to

26
00:01:37,728 --> 00:01:42,299
the club, apes!

27
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:43,820
[INTRO]

28
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:50,819
We communicate, in part, by engaging our brains
and bodies to make sounds that let us transfer

29
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,049
thoughts from our brain to other people’s
brains.

30
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:01,549
But of course language is more than just making
air vibrate with sound. I can communicate

31
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:06,250
by moving my hands, which you might have noticed
I do pretty frequently. Or by using visual

32
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,250
symbols.
All of these forms of language allow us to

33
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,479
comprehend things we’ve never actually witnessed,
and exchange information with each other quickly

34
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:17,579
and effectively to, you know, get a job, or
be a friend, or use a metaphor. It’s hard

35
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,900
to imagine a fulfilling life without some
kind of language.

36
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,150
Humans have nearly 7,000 different languages,
and no matter how different they sound, we

37
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:30,110
can break down their basic structure in the
same way, using the same three building blocks.

38
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,950
The smallest of them are phonemes. These are
very short, distinctive sound units--like

39
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:40,229
a, t, ch, sh, f. Like stuff like that. English
uses about 40 of them.

40
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:44,859
Phonemes go together to make morphemes, which
are the smallest units that carry meaning.

41
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,810
This can be words, or parts of words, like
a prefix or suffix. For example, the word

42
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,530
SPEECH is a morpheme that contains four phoneme
sound units-- s/puh/eee/ch.

43
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,390
From there you can arrange morphemes into
your language’s grammar, or system of rules

44
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:00,539
allowing you to say the things that you want
to say!

45
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:05,650
So those 40 English phonemes give us over
100,000 morphemes that produce the more than

46
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:11,539
616,000 words in the Oxford English Dictionary,
which can then be arranged into an infinite

47
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:15,620
number of sentences, paragraphs, Wu-Tang lyrics,
or Shakespearean plays.

48
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,930
And just as the structure of language starts
small, so does how we learn language. And

49
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:25,150
we start very young.
The word infant comes from the Latin infans,

50
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,408
meaning “not speaking”-- but as early
as four months, they can recognize differences

51
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:34,688
in speech and start to read lips, matching
mouth movements with their corresponding sounds,

52
00:03:34,688 --> 00:03:38,549
like ah ee eye oh ooo.
And even at this age, you gotta watch what

53
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:42,650
you say about kids in their presence, because
this also marks the beginning of receptive

54
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,709
language, or the ability to understand what’s
being said both to, and about us.

55
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:52,049
Soon that receptive language blooms to accommodate
productive language, when instead of just

56
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:56,219
understanding other people, babies start developing
the ability to produce words.

57
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:00,549
Of course that takes a while, but in the meantime,
they get a lot of practice babbling. Beginning

58
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:05,640
at about four months they start to make all
sorts of sounds, although you may get a da-da

59
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,259
or ma-ma, babbling is NOT an imitation of
adult speech. In fact, it typically includes

60
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:14,280
sounds from many different languages, and
a stranger couldn’t tell if a kid was Italian,

61
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,170
or Kenyan, or Korean, just by the sound of
her babbling.

62
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:22,319
Similarly, deaf babies watch their parents
signing and start babbling with their hands.

63
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,449
By about ten months, that babbling morphs
into something that starts to make sense,

64
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:30,939
and ma-ma probably really means Mama.
Now, without exposure to other languages,

65
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:35,790
a child will actually lose the ability to
both hear and create particular tones and

66
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,030
sounds that aren’t part of his or her household
language.

67
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,449
So, someone who speaks English around the
house soon won’t be able to differentiate

68
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:47,639
between certain phonemes in Mandarin if they
heard them, for instance, or between aspirated

69
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,029
and non-aspirated consonants in Hindi.
By the time they’re mowing down their first

70
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:54,169
birthday cake, most kids will be entering
the one-word stage of language development.

71
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,080
They now know that sounds carry specific meanings,
and can connect the sound “dog” to that

72
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,389
furry thing across the room.
By around 18 months, their capacity for learning

73
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:06,009
new words jumps from about one a week to one
a day, and by the time they’re two, they’re

74
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:10,879
probably speaking in two-word statements.
These choppy sentences are a kind of like

75
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:16,279
telegraphic speech -- they sound like clumsy
texts or old-school telegrams, using mostly

76
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:20,449
nouns and verbs. Want juice. No pants. That
kind of stuff.

77
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:24,889
These little sentences make sense, and they
follow the rules of their language’s syntax.

78
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:29,250
For example, an English speaking child would
put an adjective before a noun, black cat,

79
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,389
while a Spanish-speaker would reverse that,
gato negro.

80
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:37,479
From there the average kid is soon uttering
longer phrases and complete sentences, refusing

81
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,460
to put pants on, and demanding more crackers.

82
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:44,389
Most humans hit these same milestones during
their language development, but there are

83
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:51,229
competing theories about how our infant babbles
turn into complex sentences, and how we acquire

84
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,200
language.
You’ll remember B.F. Skinner, the pioneering

85
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,589
behaviorist who brought us learning through
reinforcement. He believed language was a

86
00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:02,839
product of associative principles and operant
conditioning. Skinner argued that a kid learned

87
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:05,899
to associate words with meanings largely through
reinforcement.

88
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:10,839
So in the Skinner model, for example, if baby
Bruno says “mmmm” and his mother gives

89
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:15,409
him some milk, he’d find that the outcome--both
the milk and the attention-- rewarding, and

90
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:20,660
eventually work his way up to saying "milk"
through these learned associations and shaping

91
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,689
processes. It’s good to be understood, right?
But as usual, not everyone was on board with

92
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:29,519
Skinner. In particular, legendary American
linguist Noam Chomsky argued that a kid like

93
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,689
Bruno would never reach his full, complex,
sonnet-writing potential if his learning was

94
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:39,029
dependent on conditioning alone.
Chomsky instead proposed the idea of innate

95
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:44,219
learning and ubiquitous grammatical categories,
pointing out that while the world’s thousands

96
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:49,750
of languages may sound wildly diverse, they’re
actually very similar, sharing some basic

97
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,389
elements. He called this Universal Grammar.
Chomsky’s Universal Grammar posited that

98
00:06:54,389 --> 00:07:00,169
all human languages contain nouns, verbs,
and adjectives, and humans are born with an

99
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:06,060
innate ability to acquire language, and even
a genetic predisposition to learn grammatical

100
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,550
rules.

101
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,740
Rather than being linguistic blank slates,
Chomsky suggested we’re hard-wired for it

102
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,019
from day one.
In the end though, we’re still not sure

103
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:17,810
how we acquire language. However, developmental
research and studies of other species have

104
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,829
given us a sense that at least some of it
is innate, while the role of learning and

105
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:23,250
exposure is also important.

106
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,819
So if it’s true that all humans have some
innate capacity for language, where in the

107
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:31,079
brain is it sitting?
We’ve talked a lot about how function is

108
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:35,589
localized in the brain, and that’s definitely
true for some aspects of language. But while

109
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:39,619
speaking, reading, writing and even singing
all fall under the language umbrella, their

110
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,579
“locations” in the brain are a little
more complicated.

111
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:46,779
Consider aphasia, a neurological impairment
of language. People can experience lots of

112
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:50,849
different kinds of aphasia depending on whether
they’ve suffered an injury, or stroke, or

113
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:56,180
a tumor, or dementia. So, maybe they can speak
but not read, or sing but barely speak, or

114
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,550
write but not read.
The region of the brain known as Broca’s

115
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,180
area in the left frontal lobe is involved
with the production of speech. If I suffered

116
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,810
a trauma to this area, I might still comprehend
speech, but struggle to speak - although I

117
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,519
might still be able to sing, because that’s
conducted elsewhere in the brain.

118
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,899
On the other hand, if that falling coconut
struck another region, called the Wernicke’s

119
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:19,799
area, a region in the left temporal lobe involved
in the expression and comprehension of language,

120
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,650
I’d still be able to speak, but my language
wouldn’t make any sense. So you might find

121
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:28,969
me saying something like, “It was too pizza,
but I called purple brother on the television.”

122
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,950
Aphasia and other brain injuries remind us
how thinking and language are both separate

123
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,750
and intricately entwined. For instance, it’s
hard to say if “non-verbal” ideas come

124
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,210
to us first, and then we think of the words
to name them, or if instead our thoughts are

125
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:45,590
born in language, or if we’d even be unable
to even think without it.

126
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,840
And because language often helps to frame
your ideas, your thinking might actually be

127
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,370
influenced by which language you’re using.

128
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:55,679
So what are implications of this if we expand
the definition of language to include other

129
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,609
species? How might Kanzi’s ability to communicate
that he wants a marshmallow affect his thinking,

130
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,009
and how might that thinking influence his
language progression, and his identity?

131
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:08,110
If only I had the words to describe how fascinating
it all is.

132
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,750
If you understood the language I was using
today, you learned how languages are built

133
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:17,639
from phonemes, morphemes, and grammar, and
when children acquire receptive and productive

134
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:22,330
language, and pass through the babbling, one-word
and two-word phases of development. You also

135
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:27,700
learned some theories on how we acquire language,
what brain areas are involved, and how thinking

136
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,230
and language are connected.
