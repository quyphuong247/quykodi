1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,120
Even though you can't see me, you know that
I am here talking to you. And I can probably

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,499
persuade you that this container of water
and this container of water have the same

3
00:00:07,498 --> 00:00:10,369
amount of water, which they do, even though
they don't look like they do.

4
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:13,979
And you'll see I left my anglerfish behind
me. If someone were to move it without my

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,769
knowing, you'd rightly expect me to look for
it first where I originally left it.

6
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:19,719
...Nnnugh!!

7
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:24,439
You can figure out all these things because
you are far down the path of cognitive development.

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,500
Your parents will be proud. But there was
a time in your life, in all our lives, when

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,759
simple concepts like these were totally baffling.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,679
Of course, lots of things influence how your
mind and its relationship with the world grows

11
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:35,750
over time.

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,539
Both our genetics and our environment begin
to affect our development long before we're

13
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,250
even born, and they continue to influence
our learning until the day we die.

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,600
And even though we're born with nearly the
same number of brain cells we'll ever have,

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,579
our complete set of brain hardware takes years
to solidify as our neural networks grow more

16
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:53,000
complex.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,219
The study of our physical changes, cognitive,
social and emotional changes throughout our

18
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:01,789
whole lives - from prenatal to preteen to
post-retirement - is called developmental

19
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:04,849
psychology. It's how we grow into who we are.

20
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:08,858
And it begins with the growth of knowledge
itself: the process by which you mature into

21
00:01:08,858 --> 00:01:15,858
the anglerfish-tracking water-beaker-estimating
peekaboo-master that you are today.

22
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:23,829
[Intro]

23
00:01:23,828 --> 00:01:27,928
As we age, we tend to follow a sequence of
changes in behavior and appearance called

24
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:32,060
maturation. Everyone is affected differently
by their personal experience, of course, but

25
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,909
we all share inherent genetic growth tendencies.

26
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:38,850
We roll over before we sit, we sit before
stand, and we stand before we walk, and we

27
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:42,598
walk before we break dance. The same thing
applies to our cognitive development - how

28
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:47,599
we learn to think, know, remember and communicate.
And if you're gonna talk about cognitive development,

29
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,270
you gotta start with Jean Piaget, developmental
psychologist extraordinaire.

30
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:56,929
Piaget was from Switzerland where he was kind
of a wunderkind and got his PhD in zoology

31
00:01:56,929 --> 00:02:02,149
in 1918, began dabbling in Freud psychoanalysis.
After graduation, he headed to France to work

32
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:06,879
on a method for testing children's aptitudes
and abilities. While administering these tests,

33
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,609
Piaget began to notice how younger kids kept
giving wrong answers to certain questions.

34
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,890
He became fascinated by the fact that children
of a certain age consistently made particular

35
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:19,059
mistakes that older kids and adults didn't.
Like the younger kids would have a really

36
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,340
hard time understanding the idea I just showed
you, that this container has the same amount

37
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,180
of water in it as in this container. Or that
this row of coins has the same number as this

38
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:26,719
row.

39
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,620
While others might have dismissed these as
childish mistakes, Piaget theorized that it

40
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,379
was because humans go through specific stages
of cognitive development and intellectual

41
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:39,699
progression. His main game was asking 'How
does knowledge grow?'

42
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:43,919
He proposed that as we grow and struggle to
make sense of our experiences, we create schemas,

43
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,899
or mental frameworks that help interpret information.

44
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,250
Schemas are like concepts, ranging from physical
things like birds and hats and eye patches

45
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,829
to abstract ideas like friendship and betrayal.

46
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:58,709
And we're constantly striving for cognitive
equilibrium, or harmony, between our thought

47
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:02,628
processes and our environments, which are
always giving us new things to think about

48
00:03:02,628 --> 00:03:03,468
and adjust to.

49
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:07,729
Piaget proposed that we adapt to new experiences
through two processes that are closely related

50
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,869
- assimilation and accommodation.

51
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,230
When we assimilate new experiences, we interpret
them in terms of our existing schemas. So

52
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:18,679
if a toddler has never seen a deer but has
a schema for a horse, she may call the first

53
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,519
deer she sees a horsey. She wants to fit it
within her understanding.

54
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,549
But with more interactions in the world, our
minds expand to accommodate, or adjust to

55
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:31,359
new experiences. So soon enough, that kid
realizes that deer aren't just horses, and

56
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:35,280
she adjusts her schema. From there, she'll
be able to tell the difference between Bambi

57
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,998
and Black Beauty in no time.

58
00:03:36,998 --> 00:03:40,609
But our knowledge base grows in ways that
are much more complex than just those two

59
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:45,998
steps, and Piaget knew that. He went on to
devise a four-stage theory of cognitive development

60
00:03:45,998 --> 00:03:49,289
that described how we learn in different phases
of our lives.

61
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:53,739
He called stage one the sensorimotor stage,
which begins at birth and continues on to

62
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:57,968
about age two. This is the time when babies
experience the world through their senses

63
00:03:57,968 --> 00:04:02,218
and actions. Touching and grabbing and looking
and hearing. And putting things in their mouth.

64
00:04:02,218 --> 00:04:05,930
From what I can tell, mostly just putting
things in their mouth.

65
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,730
Younger babies may get scared around strangers,
seem to live only in the present, and have

66
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:14,669
to see something to know it exists. This makes
them very easy to trick, if you're into that

67
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:17,759
- I mean if you have any experience with babies,
just think about this: toss a blanket over

68
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,639
a six-month-old's pacifier and they think
it vanished.

69
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,310
They lack object permanence, the awareness
that things still exist when they're out of

70
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,439
sight. And yet, we develop so quickly that
just a month or two later that baby already

71
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:33,050
understands better that objects and people
don't disappear just because they're hidden.

72
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,460
Object permanence, in Piaget's view, was one
of the major achievements of the sensorimotor

73
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:37,680
stage.

74
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,170
The second of Piaget's phases of development
is the 'preoperational stage' and he believed

75
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:46,110
it began around age two, and carried on through
age six or seven. The thing about kids of

76
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:51,139
this age is that it's all about them. The
preoperational stage is characterized by 'egocentrism'

77
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:54,159
which drives most of what a child thinks and
says.

78
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,880
Kids have a hard time imagining another person's
point of view, so much so that when I was

79
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:01,329
a kid, if you asked me if I had a brother,
I'd say, 'sure, John', but if you asked me

80
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:04,709
if John had a brother I'd say, 'Nah, I don't
think so.'

81
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:08,529
Egocentrism of course never fully disappears,
even in adults who understand how the whole

82
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:09,829
sibling thing works.

83
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:13,539
The preoperational stage is also marked by
a child's ability to mentally represent objects

84
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,620
and events with words and images and pretend
plays in their imagination. They're big into

85
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,629
animism now, and believe their favorite bunny,
batman or stuffed anglerfish has feelings

86
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:27,740
and opinions and possibly the intent to kiss
or kill you when you're asleep - depending

87
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,019
on how they're feeling.

88
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:30,459
Still plenty of kinks to work out.

89
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:34,469
Piaget suggests that early in this stage,
kids don't yet understand the concept of conservation

90
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,940
- like how 500 milliliters is the same as
500 milliliters, no matter what container

91
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:39,329
it's in.

92
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:43,490
They can also struggle with the notion of
reversibility. It's hard for them to mentally

93
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:48,400
reverse the process by which a ball of clay
smashed flat can be rolled back into a ball.

94
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,079
It's a concept that takes some time to understand.

95
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:55,180
And these challenges both have to do with
'Centration' - a child's tendency to fixate

96
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,939
on just one aspect of a problem or object
- like the shape of the container or the clay.

97
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:03,810
But during the second half of stage two, things
begin to blossom. Kids start forming their

98
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:08,269
theory of mind or ability to understand other
people's feelings, thoughts and perceptions-

99
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:12,409
as well as their own- and also how to predict
behavior... like remember when my anglerfish

100
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,460
got moved when I wasn't looking? A child at
this stage will begin to realize that while

101
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:20,659
she knows that the fish is in a new place,
I don't know it was moved, so when I start

102
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,330
to look for it, she'll expect me to look where
it originally was and not where it was moved

103
00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:26,959
to.

104
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,269
These new people skills have all kinds of
awesome applications from trying to convince

105
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:36,560
your parents to "PLEASE GIVE ME THAT EXTRA
COOKIE I SO DESPERATELY NEED!" to showing

106
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,220
empathy, which is better - and offering comfort
to others when they seem sad.

107
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,990
Piaget called the third stage of development
- beginning around age six or seven and lasting

108
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:49,189
until eleven or twelve - the 'Concrete Operational
Stage'. Kids are starting to think logically

109
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:53,709
about concrete events that they've actually
experienced. And unlike children in the earlier

110
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:57,779
phase, getting hung up on issues of centration,
kids in this stage experience 'decentration',

111
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:01,579
and become able to see beyond just one aspect
of an object or problem.

112
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:06,649
So now, problems with reversibility and conservation
just cease to be problems. And the last of

113
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:11,799
Piaget's four stages is the 'Formal Operational
Stage' which starts at about twelve and carries

114
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,460
us through the rest of our lives. By now,
our reasoning is expanding to include more

115
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:19,599
abstract thinking, problem solving and hypothetical
questions.

116
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,930
Now Piaget's four-stage model has been criticized
for over-simplifying things and for being

117
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,120
too rigid in how it classifies certain abilities
by age. Today, for example, researchers have

118
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,579
detected these phases at earlier ages than
Piaget ever did - sometimes way earlier - like

119
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:36,159
some types of object permanence have been
observed in three-month-olds.

120
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,800
Psychologists also see development as more
of a continuous process rather than a series

121
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,780
of stepping stones. But even Piaget understood
that his stages weren't as fixed as he made

122
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:44,939
them sound.

123
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:49,810
And he wasn't the only guy on the block talking
about development. For instance, his contemporary,

124
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,829
Belarussian psychologist Lev Vygotsky, had
some ideas of his own. While Piaget focused

125
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:58,189
on how a kid's mind grows by interacting with
his physical environment, Vygotsky emphasized

126
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:02,649
how early development occurs through parental
instruction and interaction with social environments.

127
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:07,549
He believed less in set stages and more in
the idea that care-giver adults provide a

128
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:12,490
sort of scaffolding, that helps children climb
to higher levels of thinking and learning.

129
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,860
Vgotsky put a lot of emphasis on language
as a way of assigning meaning to things, and

130
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,270
he also suggested that the ways kids develop
might actually vary across cultures.

131
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:25,969
In the end, there's room for lots of different
theories here, but perhaps Piaget's greatest

132
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,860
achievement was developing theoretical depth
in the concept that kids actually think very

133
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,259
differently than adults.

134
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:36,549
This fact has helped a lot of parents and
teachers, and his work spurred a new era of

135
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:41,329
research in the field. While Piaget wasn't
the only developmentalist, or even the first,

136
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,180
he's definitely one of the most influential,
and remains relevant to this day.

137
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:50,389
As the brain and mind develop in children,
so too do their social, emotional, and moral

138
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:55,179
behavior. How a child is raised and cared
for can have a profound impact on their personality

139
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:58,339
later in life, which is something we'll look
at next week.

140
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,889
This week, though, you learned how we use
schemas, assimilation, and accommodation to

141
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:07,049
make sense of the world around us, and about
Piaget's four-stage theory of cognitive development,

142
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:12,399
including sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete
operational, and formal operational periods,

143
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,459
and about Vgotsky's theory of scaffolding.
