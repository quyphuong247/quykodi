1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,960
So far in our exploration of how the mind grows,

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,960
we've talked about a lot of different philosophies and models and ways of looking at things.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,160
But here's a surprisingly useful tool for understanding developmental psychology:

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,000
The Breakfast Club. This video, by the way, will contain Breakfast Club spoilers.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,699
That classic 80s movie about a band of teenagers 

6
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,419
stuck in detention one fateful Saturday morning.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,980
Do they do Saturday detentions anymore?

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,240
That was never a "thing" at my school.

9
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:28,539
That was crazy, the idea that kids would come in on a weekend for detention.

10
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:32,740
You got the hoodlum, the jock, the nerd, the princess, and the so-called basketcase,

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,660
And at first, they're all salty and standoffish with each other.

12
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:39,139
Because you know, let's face it, American high schools are sort of a breeding ground for that kind of thing.

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,299
But as the day progresses, they start to open up and share things

14
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:45,179
and have a little fun by way of a dance montage.

15
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,039
And at some point they each kind of crack, revealing something very important

16
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,759
 about adolescence in the process, which is -

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,140
The struggle between the need to stand out, and the need to belong.

18
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,960
All these kids feel tremendous pressure to maintain their image in their particular group

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,439
in part because there's just some security in belonging to a group,

20
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:04,700
even if that group gets picked on by another group.

21
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,340
And so they wear the corresponding diamond earrings,

22
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,620
combat boots, lettermans jackets, and spectacles, and act how their roles dictate.

23
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,620
But the thing is, none of those kids are satisfied with their outward identities.

24
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,840
Instead, they're all stuck in the classic teenage struggle,

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,340
one that German psychoanalyst Erik Erikson -

26
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,340
yes, his name is actually Erik Erikson -

27
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,600
called the crisis between identity and role confusion.

28
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:29,819
In other words, their newly-forming identities were at odds 

29
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:34,259
with other people's expectations of what roles they should play, hence the confusion.

30
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,719
The past couple weeks, we've been talking about childhood as 

31
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,599
a crucial period of growth, learning, and change, and it definitely is,

32
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:43,280
but anyone who's ever seen a John Hughes movie knows 

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,780
that there's way more to growing up than just that.

34
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,780
And I got some news for you -

35
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,620
from adolescence into adulthood and into old age,

36
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:54,000
the drama of your personal psychological development never ceases.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,579
Never! So get used to it.

38
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:06,099
[INTRO]

39
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:10,019
Today, most psychologists view our psychological development as a lifelong process

40
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,240
from infant, to adolescent, to adult,

41
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,080
 to card-carrying senior citizen, people keep right on changing.

42
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,020
Just as Piaget gave us a helpful framework for thinking about early development,

43
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,900
other scholars have given us ideas about how we develop 

44
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,180
through the rest of our lives, particularly Erik Erikson.

45
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,120
Like many others, Erikson believed our personalities develop in a predetermined order,

46
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,200
which he outlined in an eight-stage model.

47
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:35,280
And each stage, from infancy to old age, is defined by

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,379
its own predominant issue or crisis.

49
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:41,439
If it freaks you out to think that you will always be dealing with a crisis 

50
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,280
at every stage of your life, we can just call them "issues."

51
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,659
Since we already talked a lot about early childhood development,

52
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:49,060
I'm gonna skip ahead to the teenage meat of it.

53
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,740
But you can consult this table to learn about the rest.

54
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,460
Erikson defined the adolescent years, or "Stage 5,"

55
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,400
as starting in our teens, and extending for some as far as our early twenties.

56
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,939
And as The Breakfast Club so artfully depicted,

57
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:04,460
its main crisis is the one of identity vs. role confusion.

58
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,320
Teen years are marked by lots of physical changes

59
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,079
in the body and brain and sex hormones, along with growing independence, 

60
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,580
but also a real need to belong to something.

61
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,500
This often angsty time is when teens reexamine their identities, 

62
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,979
figuring out how to both blend in and how to stand out,

63
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:23,139
often by trying on different roles.

64
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:25,319
Maybe they're experimenting with punk rock,

65
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,680
or hockey, or theater, or ancient philosophy.

66
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,980
Maybe sophomore year they're preppy. Junior year they've got green hair.

67
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:34,299
Hopefully a person comes out of this stage with a reintegrated sense of self,

68
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,380
but this stage can be particularly confusing as I'm sure anybody watching this video can attest to.

69
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:42,879
But of course, that's not the last crisis - sorry, "issue."

70
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,359
Erikson believed that young adulthood, which in his view,

71
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,600
started in a person's 20s and ended as late as the early 40s,

72
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,439
was marked by another struggle, one between intimacy and isolation.

73
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:55,960
By this stage in life, most of us have begun exploring intimate relationships,

74
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,420
whether that's with a steady sweetheart, or just an active OkCupid profile.

75
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:02,579
A good relationship here can lead to feelings of safety and caring and commitment,

76
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,219
while a lack of intimacy can lead to loneliness and isolation and depression.

77
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:10,300
Recently, a number of psychologists have begun to refer to the first few years of this stage as 

78
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,060
emerging adulthood, and some suggest that it warrants its own classification

79
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,079
distinct from adolescence or full adulthood.

80
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,819
And at least in modern western culture, many people in this stage

81
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:22,639
do feel like they're stuck in a sort of in-between time.

82
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,479
They know that they've pulled through all that high school stuff, but they're still pretty tied to their families.

83
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,540
In 2011, the U.S. Census found that 65% of people under 24 still live with their parents.

84
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,360
Just a reminder of how things like economic factors can weigh on development.

85
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,520
For Erikson, after young adulthood came the middle adulthood of our 40s to 60s.

86
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:44,799
This stage, Stage 7, highlights our tendency toward either generativity or stagnation.

87
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,319
By now, many people have established jobs or careers or perhaps families of their own.

88
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:52,259
We better understand the bigger picture of life and contribute to society

89
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,399
 through productive, or generative, activities

90
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,819
like work, community involvement, raising kids, paying taxes, all that grown-up stuff.

91
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:02,339
The lack of those things, an overall boredom or absence of purpose,

92
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:05,560
can make Stage 7-ers feel stagnant and unproductive,

93
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,100
hence the often cliched, but really real and potentially painful, mid-life crisis.

94
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,640
And finally, at the end, comes Stage 8.

95
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,779
In our late adulthood, from 65 and up, we often struggle with integrity vs. despair.

96
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:21,000
Maybe you've hung out with a grandparent or some other senior and heard them contemplating 

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,040
their lives and accomplishments and reminiscing about how cheap a milkshake used to be.

98
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,520
Well, if their overall vibe is positive,

99
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,740
they've probably developed a sense of integrity and completeness,

100
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,100
meaning they're pretty satisfied with a life well lived.

101
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,680
The flip side of that is looking back on life and feeling guilt and regret, and that kind of

102
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,240
retrospective disappointment can ruin old age with depression and feelings of hopelessness.

103
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,040
Again, Erikson's model isn't really a perfect contemporary one,

104
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,319
but it gave us an early idea of conflict and growth over our whole lives.

105
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,939
His ideas have been developed further and even challenged by other scholars,

106
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:57,199
but like Piaget, he remains a crucial figure to know in Western psychology.

107
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,920
So Erikson tackled our progressive psychosocial development,

108
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,540
but what exactly happens to our bodies and brains after we hit adulthood

109
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,740
and keep racking up the birthday cake candles?

110
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,900
It's hard to generalize these stages of adulthood because 

111
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:10,879
we don't really hit yearly milestones like we did when we were kids,

112
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,120
and adult lifestyles can vary a whole lot. I mean, in a lot of ways,

113
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,139
70-year-old Mick Jagger's still living a younger lifestyle than a lot of 20-somethings I know.

114
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:21,620
But despite all our differences, many of our life courses do have some similarities --

115
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,980
physically, cognitively, and socially.

116
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,960
First, there are, yes, physical changes:

117
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:29,180
the slow decline of reaction time, muscle tone, and strength,

118
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,579
cardiac output, sex hormone production, 

119
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:34,039
and sharpness of senses like hearing and sight.

120
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,360
For most of us, bifocals are inevitable, and perhaps hearing aids as well.

121
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,780
None of this is to say that a jacked 50-year-old couldn't beat a lazy 20-year-old on a 100-meter dash,

122
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:46,079
because, of course, how well you take care of your body counts for a lot.

123
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,359
But still, you can't stop, let alone reverse the process of aging.

124
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,139
The good news is our intelligence remains pretty stable throughout adulthood.

125
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:56,860
Although some people might feel that their wits get a bit fuzzy with age,

126
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,740
research suggests that while one kind of intelligence decreases after adolescence,

127
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,660
another kind keeps increasing throughout your lifetime.

128
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,400
Psychologists Raymond Cattell and John Horn were the first to develop the concepts of

129
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:10,039
fluid and crystallized intelligence, suggesting that

130
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,980
intelligence itself is made up of different abilities that work together.

131
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,600
Fluid intelligence deals with your ability to solve problems 

132
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,420
independent of your personal experience and education.

133
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,000
It's typically associated with thinking both quickly and abstractly,

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,399
like teasing out the logic of a puzzle, rather than

135
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:28,019
remembering how to find the cosine of an angle.

136
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:32,299
So relatively inexperienced teens often show high fluid intelligence.

137
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,280
The bummer is it peaks in adolescence, 

138
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,239
then typically starts its slow decline in the 30s...

139
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,280
So I'm experiencing that now...

140
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:43,359
Crystallized intelligence, on the other hand, is just what it sounds like:

141
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,420
knowledge that's based on facts, solidified by past experiences and prior learning.

142
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,420
This type of experiential intelligence gets stronger with age,

143
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,280
as we continue to take in new knowledge and understanding,

144
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,179
and it's part of why grandmas are so good at crossword puzzles!

145
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,379
Both fluid and crystallized intelligence are equally important on any given day,

146
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:04,040
and ideally, they work together to get the job of thinking done.

147
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,720
So in the end, some of our thinking gets rusty with age, but some of it keeps getting better.

148
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,900
Of course, there are exceptions.

149
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:13,939
While most people who live into their 90s are still pretty sharp, 

150
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:18,660
some will experience a substantial loss of brain cells and suffer serious consequences.

151
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,560
Brain tumors, small strokes, or continued alcohol dependence 

152
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,899
can all progressively damage the brain, increasing the risk of dementia.

153
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:28,639
Dementia isn't a specific disease, but rather a set of symptoms related to 

154
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,460
impaired thinking, memory loss, confusion, and potential changes in personality

155
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,580
that become severe enough to interfere with regular functioning.

156
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,379
Alzheimer's disease is a form of progressive, irreversible dementia.

157
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:43,759
First, memory declines, then reasoning, and then eventually basic physiological functions

158
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,419
as vital brain neurons continue to deteriorate.

159
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:49,879
It strikes about 3% of the world's population before age 75,

160
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:53,480
although from there, the rate roughly doubles every five years.

161
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,560
But again, not all dementia is related to Alzheimer's disease, nor is it as extreme.

162
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:00,679
And while the risk of dementia certainly increases in older adults,

163
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:04,579
it's important to remember that it is not part of normal, healthy aging.

164
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,500
Some memory changes are normal, but most memories should remain intact.

165
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,240
In the end, we still have a lot to learn about the aging process.

166
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,720
As our lifespans continue to get longer, we might need to

167
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,720
 tweak what we think we know about its effects on human psychology.

168
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,980
In some ways, you might say that this is psychology's next frontier.

169
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,899
By the time we figure out what that looks like, the cast of The Breakfast Club might just be 

170
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:25,759
 ready for a reunion... and they'd better make a movie about it.

171
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,259
Today, your developing brain learned about 

172
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:33,120
Erikson's eight stages of progressive psychosocial development and their accompanying issues.

173
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,179
You also learned about emerging adulthood,

174
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:37,859
the differences between fluid and crystalline intelligence,

175
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,980
and some facts about dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

176
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,300
