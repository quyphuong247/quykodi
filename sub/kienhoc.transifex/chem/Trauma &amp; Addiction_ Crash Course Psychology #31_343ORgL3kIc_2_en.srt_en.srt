1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,240
All right, so you might have read "The Hobbit"
or "The Lord of the Rings," you have probably

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,700
seen them, you've definitely heard of them.
But not everyone knows the story of their

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:13,589
author, J.R.R. Tolkien. Tolkien was an English
World War One veteran. A reluctant solider,

4
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:18,469
he joined up with a sense of duty and he lived
through the bloody battle of Somme suffering

5
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:22,259
tremendous shock, guilt, and loss during and
after the war.

6
00:00:22,259 --> 00:00:27,429
It took Tolkien years to processes his experiences.
To help him do it he turned to writing fiction

7
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:33,039
and in time he constructed a world that helped
him and all of us better understand war, human

8
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,320
nature, loss, and growth. His novels were
the bi-product of trauma and they're among

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,980
the more beautiful reminders of how it can
affect us.

10
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:44,159
Most of us will experience some kind of traumatic
event in our lives and most of us will exhibit

11
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:49,009
some kind of stress related behavior because
of it, these symptoms usually fade but for

12
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:53,479
some those reactions can linger and start
of disrupt their lives or the lives of those

13
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:57,649
around them. These reactions can develop into
full blown psychological disorders including

14
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:01,869
post-traumatic stress disorder and, in an effort
to cope, sometimes addiction, but it doesn't

15
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:03,619
always have to be that way.

16
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:06,939
Ultimately, Tolkien was able to harness the
effect of his trauma and shape them into something

17
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:12,460
important and to reclaim is own life because there
is such a thing as post-traumatic growth, too.

18
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:17,140
As it does with many other things psychology
approaches trauma related disorders with different

19
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,260
perspectives, but they all tend to ask the
same questions.

20
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,890
How do you identify and diagnose these disorders?
And how do you treat them, so that the patients

21
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,510
can recover? -- With the understanding that
they might never be the same as they were

22
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,590
before the trauma, but they can still be healthy
and happy.

23
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,770
In a way, psychology helps patients ask themselves,
what Tolkien asks his readers, and what Frodo

24
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:41,340
asks when he is finally safe back in the shire:
"How do you pick up the threads of an old

25
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,600
life? How to go on, when in your heart, you
begin to understand that there is no going back."

26
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:02,579
It could be September 11 or a serious car
accident or a natural disaster or a violent

27
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:07,209
crime that you survived but are still haunted
by. Trauma comes in many different forms and

28
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:09,079
sometimes it can stick with you.

29
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:15,730
When it manifests as nightmares, flashbacks,
avoidance, fear, guilt, anxiety, rage, insomnia,

30
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:20,310
and begins to interfere with your ability
to function it can come to be known as post-traumatic

31
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,229
stress disorder or PTSD.

32
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:26,919
It was once call "shell shock" a term used
to describe the condition of veterans, like

33
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:31,669
Tolkien in World War One but PTSD isn't limited
to veterans. It's defined as a psychological

34
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:36,389
disorder generated by either witnessing or
experiencing a traumatic event. Its symptoms

35
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:40,250
are classified into four major clusters in
the DSM V.

36
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,879
One of these clusters involves re-living the
event through intrusive memories, nightmares,

37
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,199
or flashbacks. The second involves avoiding
situations you associate with the event, while

38
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:54,959
the third generally describes excessive physiological
arousal like heart pounding, muscle tension,

39
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,509
anxiety or irritability, and major problems
sleeping or concentrating. And finally we

40
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:05,139
have the fourth major symptom cluster: pervasive
negative changes in emotions and belief, like

41
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:10,579
feelings in excessive guilt, fear, or shame -- or no
longer getting enjoyment out of what you used to.

42
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,469
PTSD patients may also experience numbing,
or periods of feeling emotionless or emotionally

43
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:21,419
"flat" and dissociation, feeling as if situations
aren't real or are surreal, feeling like time

44
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:23,929
has slowed down or sped up, or even blacking
out.

45
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,730
We have been discussing how anxiety or mood
disorders can affect a person's ability to

46
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:32,159
function and how that impairment itself leads
to more suffering and dysfunction.

47
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,739
When any of these disorders is left untreated
suffers may start to feel desperate to find

48
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:41,200
some way to cope and one way may be substance
abuse. Unfortunately, addiction and trauma

49
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,699
can go hand in hand and it can be hard to
recover from one without also dealing with

50
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:48,479
the other. According to the US department
of Veteran's Affairs more than 2 in 10 veterans

51
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,189
with PTSD also struggle with substance abuse
problems and 1 in every 3 vets seeking

52
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:57,859
treatment for substance abuse also have PTSD.
And across many studies, between a third to

53
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,260
a half of women in treatment for substance
abuse have experienced rape or sexual assault.

54
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:07,030
For a long time most psychologists understood
PTSD through the lens of fear conditioning

55
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,860
or the unshakable memory of being in mortal
danger and the learned responses that stem

56
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,680
from that memory. But clinicians have also
begun to recognize that for some the disorder

57
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,129
can also be a kind of moral injury, widening
the focus to include hauntings not just of

58
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:26,250
violence done to a person but also what that
person did or did not do to others.

59
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,370
Brandon was a combat drone operator in the
air force he enlisted at 21 years old and

60
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,610
spent 6 years sitting in a bunker in the American
South-West watching Iraq and Afghanistan from

61
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,780
surveillance drones.

62
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:42,439
He watched soldiers die and people get executed.
He also watched kids play, people get married,

63
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:47,180
goats grazing -- and when the time came he
ordered hell fire missiles to strike military

64
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,370
targets or people who had no idea they where
even being watched.

65
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,560
Although he was half a world away from combat,
he ultimately suffered the psychological trauma

66
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,899
felt by many on the ground soldiers. He was
diagnosed with PTSD. Brandon suffers no fears

67
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:06,508
for his own safety, but still experiences
the same intrusive memories, nightmares, depression,

68
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:11,629
anxiety, and substance abuse of many emotionally
traumatized combat soldiers. So do a lot of

69
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:12,529
other drone operators.

70
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:18,289
But why do some victims or trauma suffer from
PTSD while others seem able to move on?

71
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,710
Well, its psychology so the risk factors are
complicated. Some findings suggest that there

72
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:26,680
may be genetic predispositions making some
people more vulnerable than others. We also

73
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,800
know that context and environment matter,
for instance, someone who has experienced

74
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,160
childhood abuse might feel on the one hand
more ready to deal with difficult and traumatic

75
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,540
experiences. But on the other hand they might
be more likely to default to the suppression

76
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,509
and avoidance in which PTSD suffers frequently
engage, which as we've discussed in previous

77
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,889
episodes often makes psychiatric symptoms
worsen over time.

78
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:52,259
As far as whats going on in the brain, PTSD
shares some similarities with anxiety disorders.

79
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:56,538
For example the brains limbic system may flood
the body with waves of stress hormones like

80
00:05:56,538 --> 00:06:01,009
cortisol every time images of the traumatic
event bubble up uninvited into consciousness.

81
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:05,310
And we've already talked a lot about how the
amygdala and hippocampus are involved in those

82
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,430
classic fight or flight reactions, which when
prolonged can be really rough on the body.

83
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,660
In fact, neuroimaging suggests that trauma
-- or the chemical processes set into motion

84
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,210
by trauma -- might actually damage and shrink
the hippocampus. Since this region is also

85
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:23,680
associated with how we consolidate memories,
this might explain how memories associated

86
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,680
with trauma could fail to be filed away as
long-term memories and instead remain vivid

87
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,150
and fresh through flashbacks and nightmares.

88
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:35,459
If there's any silver lining to all of this,
it's that some people may actually experience

89
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:40,120
positive change after a trauma. Treatment
and social support help some suffers achieve

90
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,199
post-traumatic growth, positive psychological
changes resulting from the struggle with challenging

91
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,270
circumstances and life crises.

92
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:52,209
That's in part what Tolkien did. Though he
suffered great trauma and loss on the battlefield,

93
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:58,549
he was eventually able to use those experiences
to drive those powerful, allegorical stories. Stories

94
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,960
that helped not just himself, but many readers
of all ages around the world.

95
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,549
It seems that while whatever doesn't kill
you might not necessarily make you stronger,

96
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,030
sometimes it really does.

97
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:13,809
But suffering can feed on itself. Many victims
of trauma try to cope through whats colloquially

98
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,910
called self-medicating and some can end up
with substance abuse or dependence issues.

99
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,699
Psychologists define addiction or dependence
as compulsive, excessive, and difficult-to-control

100
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:29,120
substance use, or other, initially pleasurable
behavior that beings to interfere with ordinary

101
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,379
life, work, health, or relationships.

102
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:36,100
This could mean over-consuming drugs or alcohol,
or compulsively gambling, eating, shopping,

103
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,569
exercising, or having sex. People with addictions
may not even realize that they have lost control

104
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:42,369
of their behavior for some time.

105
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:47,240
Addiction can refer to a physical dependence,
a physiological need for a drug, that reveals

106
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:52,168
itself through terrible withdrawal symptoms
if the use stops or reduces. Or psychological

107
00:07:52,168 --> 00:07:56,500
dependence, the need to use that drug, or
complete that activity in order to relieve

108
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,579
negative emotions.

109
00:07:57,579 --> 00:08:02,478
People with addiction can sometimes be stigmatized
as pleasure-bound hedonists who have no self-control,

110
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:07,228
but people often compulsively use substances
or do things in reaction to stress and other

111
00:08:07,228 --> 00:08:11,949
psychological problems. For various reasons
they have been prevented from coping in other

112
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,169
ways or maybe they just never learned how.

113
00:08:14,168 --> 00:08:19,219
So in this way addiction itself is often secondary
to the more complicated matter of how a person

114
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:24,720
deals with stress and difficult emotions, or what
kinds of stressful situations they've survived.

115
00:08:24,728 --> 00:08:29,839
Few will dispute that much of what makes addiction
possible is chemistry, but people are different

116
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,749
-- from their life experiences to their biological
sensitivities. So people respond in different

117
00:08:34,749 --> 00:08:39,259
way to different drugs and behaviors. Many
people can drink casually or gamble once in

118
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:42,509
a while without losing control. Others simply
can't.

119
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:46,350
People in recovery from addiction may also
have different needs. Some will need to be

120
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:51,209
completely sober and never again touch that
drug or do that thing. While others may in

121
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:55,058
time be able to regain enough control to use
again in moderation.

122
00:08:55,058 --> 00:08:59,278
Likewise, some folks can kick the habit on
their own while others do better with or need

123
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:01,799
support from professionals or support groups.

124
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:06,218
Researchers and groups like Alcoholics Anonymous
debate whether addiction is a mental illness

125
00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:10,749
-- like a "software problem" related to thoughts, and
behaviors, and feelings -- or a physical disease

126
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:15,028
-- a "hard wire problem" related to biology
and genetics -- or both, and even whether

127
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:17,369
addiction and dependence are the same thing.

128
00:09:17,369 --> 00:09:21,319
Either way it can be hard to recover from
an addiction if you don't get the underlying

129
00:09:21,318 --> 00:09:26,058
problem treated. But some people believe that
you can't treat the underlying problem without

130
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:28,419
first getting the addiction out of the way.

131
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:32,778
While this controversy too continues, many
are moving toward a model of treating both

132
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:37,049
at at the same time. The so-called Dual Diagnosis
Model of treatment.

133
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:40,938
Addiction that's rooted in deeper psychological
issues -- especially in emotional trauma like

134
00:09:40,938 --> 00:09:45,389
PTSD -- often require some version of dual
treatment to untangle both issues.

135
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:50,369
The good news is while PTSD and substance
dependence may be distressing and complex,

136
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:53,999
people can begin to heal given the chance
and the resources.

137
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:59,379
We're amazingly resilient creatures. When nurtured with
the proper support and practice, we can overcome a lot.

138
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:04,249
Today we talked about the causes and symptoms
of PTSD and how trauma can affect the brain.

139
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:08,600
We also looked at addiction, physical and
psychological dependence, the relationship

140
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,639
between trauma and addiction, and why they
can require dual treatment, and we touched on

141
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:16,938
post-traumatic growth with the wisdom of Frodo
Baggins.
