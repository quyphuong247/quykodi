1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,140
Lemme get your mind right about hypnosis.

2
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:06,910
First of all, it’s a real thing -- but it’s
probably not what you think it is.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,570
All kinds of hypnosis-esque practices have
been around for centuries, but the Western

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,958
version of it -- including the kind that you
probably associate with people being made

5
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:19,550
to cluck like chickens on stage -- cropped
up around the 18th century, that’s when

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:24,399
German physician Franz Mesmer started treating
all manner of medical problems by putting

7
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:30,029
patients into a trance-like state, during
which he claimed to align their “internal

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,808
magnetic forces,” which he called “animal
magnetism.”

9
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:39,539
And many of these mesmerized patients did
feel better, but not because of any magnetism

10
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:44,329
or whatever. Mesmer was inadvertently using
the healing power of suggestion.

11
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:48,289
In addition to his magnetic quackery, other
physicians didn’t appreciate Mesmer’s

12
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:53,698
kitschy penchant for wearing capes and playing
ethereal music on a glass harmonica, and eventually

13
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:54,689
he was discredited.

14
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:58,878
So were his patients just gullible idiots,
or was there something else going on?

15
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:03,738
Well, we’ve previously defined consciousness
as our awareness of ourselves and our environment,

16
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:08,729
and consciousness is at work pretty much whenever
we’re awake, but also while we’re asleep

17
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,350
and dreaming.

18
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:13,429
So hypnosis is a good example of an altered
state of consciousness -- when you’re fully

19
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:18,010
conscious in the clinical sense, but also
not in what you’d consider a normal waking

20
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:22,670
state. As a person who considers himself only
the product of one of several states of consciousness,

21
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,500
this one that I am currently in right now,
it’s worth pointing out how TREMENDOUSLY

22
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,709
WEIRD THIS IS! My brain has these other gears
that it occasionally drops into during which,

23
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:36,879
in a sense, I become not me any more.
Altered states can also include things like

24
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,959
hallucinations, and the effects of psychoactive
drugs. But these states aren’t as uncommon

25
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,829
as you might think. In fact, you’ve probably
experienced an altered state yourself… even

26
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:49,179
if you’ve never taken an illicit drug or
been to a cheesy dinner-theater where the

27
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:56,180
main act wore a glittering turban.
[INTRO]

28
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:04,739
So, personal opinions of Mesmer aside, here
are some facts and fallacies worth knowing

29
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:05,759
about hypnosis.

30
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,218
First off, let’s define hypnosis simply
as a calm, trance-like state during which

31
00:02:10,218 --> 00:02:14,098
you tend to have heightened concentration
and focus, and in which you’re typically

32
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:17,149
more open to suggestion.
The phenomenon has been observed in lots of

33
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,188
empirically rigorous studies, and it’s been
used effectively in treatments for stress

34
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:23,519
and anxiety, weight loss, and chronic pain.

35
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,739
BUT! It’s important to understand that even
though you’re more open to suggestion when

36
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:31,069
hypnotized, you do NOT lose control over your
behavior.

37
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:35,298
So, contrary to what you might see in The
Manchurian Candidate or Zoolander, hypnosis

38
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:39,150
can’t make you act totally against your
will and, say, jump off a building, rob a

39
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,450
donut shop, or commit a murder most foul.

40
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:46,348
Nor is hypnosis a reliable way to enhance
the recall of deeply buried memories. We don’t

41
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:50,858
file away every single one of our experiences.
We only permanently store some of them, and

42
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:54,670
even they tend to mutate over time. We’ll
be talking all about memory in an upcoming

43
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:57,218
lesson.
Finally, only about 20 percent of us are thought

44
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:02,340
to be highly hypnotizable. Those are the folks
whom a hypnotist could get to smile at the

45
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,459
smell of sour milk just by suggesting it was
rosewater.

46
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,729
And even though we know hypnosis can increase
your suggestibility, there’s still some

47
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:14,908
disagreement about what exactly constitutes
a hypnotic state, or how it’s achieved.

48
00:03:14,908 --> 00:03:19,019
Remember, just because we observe a phenomenon
doesn’t mean that we have a clue about its

49
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,370
mechanisms of action, or whether it works
the way we think it works.

50
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:27,459
One popular theory looks at hypnosis as phenomenon
of social influence. This camp suggests that,

51
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:31,919
like actors caught up in an intense role,
hypnotized subjects may begin to feel and

52
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,260
act like “good hypnotic subjects” if they
just trust their hypnotist to sort of act

53
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:39,679
like a director and focus their attention.
Other researchers suggest that it has more

54
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,700
to do with a special dual-processing state
of split-consciousness called dissociation.

55
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:48,979
Dissociation is a sort of detachment from
your surroundings, which can range from mild

56
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:52,658
spacing out all the way up to a total loss
of your sense of yourself. It’s something

57
00:03:52,658 --> 00:03:57,048
we all do to some degree or another, and we’re
often quite aware that we’re doing it. It’s

58
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:00,579
not hard to think of instances where dissociation
might even help us, like when we’re faced

59
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:05,019
with a dangerous situation that requires quick,
reflexive action and not a ton of focus on

60
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:08,769
our own thoughts and feelings.
In this way, hypnosis may ease pain, not by

61
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:13,569
magically blocking pain receptors, but by
helping us selectively not attend to that

62
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:18,589
pain. Clinicians can do this by basically
guiding the patient into a very relaxed, but

63
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:23,228
voluntary state, sort of spaced-out, and then
further guiding them through a series of positive

64
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:27,050
thoughts and suggestions.
So, in legitimate clinical hypnosis, people

65
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,960
aren’t being made to dissociate. Instead,
think of them as being asked to dissociate

66
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:36,209
- and some people are better at this than
others, which is essentially what being “highly

67
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,709
hypnotizable” means.
So, clearly there’s a lot going on in our

68
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:44,180
two-track brains at any given time, and hypnosis
-- as researchers understand it -- seems to

69
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:49,340
help us tap into some of that adaptive dissociative
capacity that we all seem to have.

70
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:52,250
But say you’re not so into the idea of someone
feeding you suggestions.

71
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,430
Probably the most classic way to voluntarily
enter an altered state of consciousness is

72
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,439
by using drugs.

73
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,228
Most of us have used some kind of legal drug…
your morning coffee, a beer at lunch, some

74
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:05,769
Tylenol PM to put you the bed… and lots
and lots of folks responsibly use prescription

75
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:07,378
and nonprescription drugs.

76
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:11,669
But of course, some people develop problems.
The more you use a substance, legal or illegal,

77
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:16,639
the less you feel its effects as your tolerance
grows. And soon enough, a two-beer buzz turns

78
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,550
into a four-beer buzz or a case-of-beer buzz.
That’s your brain chemistry adapting to

79
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,978
offset the drug effect in a process called
neuroadaptation.

80
00:05:24,978 --> 00:05:28,969
Keep on that road and soon you’ll risk a
physical and/or psychological addiction to

81
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,150
the substance you choose, or the substance
that chose you. And that’s not even to mention

82
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:37,878
serious physiological and neurological damage,
as happens with severe and long-term alcohol

83
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,810
abuse.
We’ll be delving more deeply into the science

84
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,110
of addiction in an upcoming episode, but for
now, let’s take a look at some of these

85
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,970
drug families and how they jack you up, knock
you out, make you do dumb things, see imaginary

86
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:53,509
stuff, and generally alter your consciousness.
Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances

87
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:58,810
that alter your mood and perception. They’re
the ones that go right to your brain’s synapses,

88
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,319
mimicking the functions of neurotransmitters.
They also work by tapping into the psychological

89
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:07,990
component - in other words, the user’s expectations
about what substance use might mean. Like

90
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,829
if you really believe that drinking tequila
makes you more aggressive, and I give you

91
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:16,240
a virgin margarita, your mere expectation
of getting all surly and aggro may actually

92
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,379
lead you to punch someone in the neck. That’s
also called the placebo effect.

93
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:24,979
Whether smoked, snorted, ingested, or injected,
we’ll put all of them into three general

94
00:06:24,978 --> 00:06:30,589
categories: depressants, stimulants, and hallucinogens.
Depressants, like alcohol, tranquilizers,

95
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:35,609
and opiates, do exactly what you’d expect--they
bring the mellow, slow body functions, and

96
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,520
suppress neural activity.
Historically, the world’s favorite depressant

97
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:43,490
is alcohol. Beat writer William S. Burroughs
even called it “our national drug.” A

98
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,658
little bit of hooch may get the party started,
but not because it’s stimulating anyone.

99
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:52,829
Rather, it’s acting as a disinhibitor, impairing
your brain’s judgement areas, while reducing

100
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,628
your self-awareness and self-control.

101
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:59,539
And then because alcohol disrupts memory formations
you may wake up wondering where one of your

102
00:06:59,538 --> 00:07:03,378
eyebrows went.
Similar to booze, tranquilizers, or barbiturates,

103
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:07,930
depress nervous system activity and may be
prescribed to ease anxiety or insomnia, though

104
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:13,360
high doses can negatively affect memory and
judgement. And really high doses, or bad interactions

105
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,158
with other substances like alcohol, can kill
you.

106
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:20,918
Opiates, like poppy-flower superstar opium
and its derivatives morphine and heroin, work

107
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:25,788
in a similar way, depressing neural activity
and enveloping the brain in a fog of no-pain

108
00:07:25,788 --> 00:07:29,529
bliss. The thing is, if a brain keeps getting
flooded with outside opiates, it will eventually

109
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:33,628
stop brewing its own natural pain killing
neurotransmitters, endorphins. The resulting

110
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:37,979
withdrawal is particularly nasty.
Stimulants, obviously, excite rather than

111
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:43,128
suppress neural activity, and speed up body
functions, bringing up your energy, self-confidence,

112
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:47,060
and changing your mood. On the legal end of
the spectrum here, we’ve got caffeine, nicotine,

113
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,569
and prescription amphetamines, building up
to the more serious illegal stuff like street

114
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:56,580
amphetamines, meth, Ecstasy, and cocaine.
And you know who loved his coke? Freud. He

115
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:01,430
loved i—t so much—it cheered him up when
we was feeling down, opened up his mind, and

116
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:06,329
turned him into chatty Kathy. He even wrote
his first big publication, “Über Coca”

117
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:11,209
in 1884 about it. During his famous coke years
in his late 20s and 30s, he believed that

118
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:15,468
the drug was a viable cure for morphine addiction.
Which… not so much.

119
00:08:15,468 --> 00:08:20,788
Luckily he gave his nose a rest and finally
dropped the habit by his 40s to focus full-time

120
00:08:20,788 --> 00:08:24,310
on his cigar addiction. Which is the thing
that ultimately killed him.

121
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,949
Cocaine hits the bloodstream in a flash of
energetic euphoria that quickly taxes the

122
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:33,379
brain’s supply of dopamine, serotonin, and
norepinephrine. Methamphetamine also triggers

123
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:37,309
the release of dopamine. You’ll remember
from our lesson on neurotransmitters how these

124
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:41,899
chemical messengers affect our moods, emotions,
attention, and alertness. So when those neurotransmitters

125
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:46,078
are excessively activated, they can become
temporarily depleted, which is what causes

126
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:49,439
that agitated, depressive crash that users
often feel.

127
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,089
If you drink coffee every morning, and then
you skip a day, you’ll likely be tired and

128
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:58,220
cranky with a pounding headache. Now multiply
that awful feeling by like thousands and you’ll

129
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,639
see why people with coke and meth addictions
might keep chasing that high while their bodies

130
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:05,909
and lives fall apart around them.
In addition to depressants and stimulants,

131
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:10,299
we’ve got hallucinogens, which come in a
variety of plant and fungal forms, as well

132
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:16,129
as synthetic forms like LSD or lysergic acid
diethylamide. Also called psychedelics, these

133
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:20,850
drugs distort perceptions and evoke sensory
images in the absence of actual sensory input.

134
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,790
Which means you could end up seeing, hearing,
smelling, or feeling things that are not real.

135
00:09:24,789 --> 00:09:28,559
This could be quite nice, if you’re like,
petting baby dolphins or something, but it

136
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,189
could also be panic-inducing and generally
messed up, if you think you’ve got a bunch

137
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:36,260
of centipedes crawling under your skin.
The thing is, there are lots of ways to involuntarily

138
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:41,059
hallucinate without the use of drugs. Seizures,
brain injuries, diseases, sensory deprivation,

139
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:46,319
fever, stress, or even extreme grief or depression
can all cause neurological disturbances that

140
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,810
spur hallucinations of one kind or another.
Many healthy people have reported experiencing

141
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:55,859
vivid auditory hallucinations when in emergencies,
like, you broke your knee skiing and you wanted

142
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,550
to just fall asleep forever in that blanket
of soft snow, but a strong, seemingly audible

143
00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:05,559
voice ordered you to KEEP MOVING.
And bizarrely, it isn’t uncommon for people

144
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:10,489
who lose the use of one sense—like vision
or smell--to perceive sights and odors they

145
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:16,459
are no longer capable of sensing as their
brains pull from old memories to produce hallucinations

146
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:20,768
as a way to compensate for that loss.
All this just goes to show that whether you’re

147
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:24,389
a psychologist, neuroscientist, or philosopher,
our various states of consciousness provide

148
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:30,769
a rich, complex world of inquiry to contemplate,
showing yet again, just what a messy and marvelous

149
