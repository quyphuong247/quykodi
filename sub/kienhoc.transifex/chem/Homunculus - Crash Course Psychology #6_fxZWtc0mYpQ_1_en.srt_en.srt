1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,900
Homunculus! If you've heard that word, it
probably wasn't in the context of psychology.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,900
A monster in Dungeons and Dragons, a song
by They Might Be Giants, the bad guys in Fullmetal

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,888
Alchemist, a novel by James Blaylock. It's
Latin for 'little man' and in psychology,

4
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:17,879
it refers to a kind of sensory map of the
human body, a depiction of what we'd look

5
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,739
like if each of our parts grew in proportion
to how much we sense with them.

6
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:22,419
Witness!

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,300
Look at this dude. His ham hands could rip
off a car door. I mean, if he could lift them,

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:27,609
which he couldn't.

9
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:30,259
Is this what we're supposed to look like on
the inside?

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,340
This freaky thing illustrates the weighted
significance of our sensory receptors. His

11
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,980
disproportional hands are monstrous, for example,
because we primarily touch the world with

12
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:44,129
our hands, not our elbows, so our hands are
extremely sensitive. His mouth, meanwhile,

13
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,219
is huge because we also have a ton of sensory
receptors in our tongues and lips. It's what

14
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:51,558
we use for tasting food and for sucking face.

15
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:55,509
As we continue our exploration of how we both
sense and perceive the world, the Homunculus,

16
00:00:55,509 --> 00:00:59,409
while kind of freaky, is actually a pretty
attractive model for understanding how our

17
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:03,599
bodies interact with the environment. How
we smell it with our outsized nose, taste

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,250
it with our ridiculous Mick Jagger lips, and
touch it with our enormous Donkey Kong hands.

19
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:15,250
So join me, as we get to know the hideous
little creature within you.

20
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:22,319
[Intro]

21
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,149
Last week we talked about the difference between
sensation and perception: how sensation is

22
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,430
the process by which our senses and brain
receive information from the outer world,

23
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,820
while perception is how we organize and interpret
that information and give it meaning.

24
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:39,819
Like, right now, my sense of hearing is letting
me detect sounds, while my brain is processing

25
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:44,599
and interpreting them, allowing me to identify
and perceive the individual sounds and determine

26
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:48,609
if they're coming from the radio, or outside
or right behind me.

27
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:52,810
Sound moves in waves that vibrate through
a medium, like air. And although they function

28
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:57,240
differently that waves of electromagnetic
radiation, including what we think of as light,

29
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,989
sound waves also can vary in shape. Short
waves have a high frequency and a high pitch,

30
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:07,048
like a plucky violin. Long waves have a low
frequency and pitch, like a mournful cello.

31
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,000
Wave height, or amplitude, determine a sound's
loudness, which we typically measure in decibels.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,759
And just as light waves become electrical
impulses that we register with our sight,

33
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,560
so too do our ears turn vibrating air into
signals that our brains can decipher.

34
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,000
While the human ear might not be as elegant
as the jackrabbit's, or as wild as the long-eared

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,949
bat's, it's actually a pretty incredible organ.
Or, organs, since we have two of them, which

36
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:34,310
helps give us directional stereophonic hearing.
That's the 3D type of hearing we couldn't

37
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,939
experience if we had just one big, freaky
ear in the middle of our foreheads.

38
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:42,459
Your outer ear, the part that you can see
and pierce and tug on, collects sound waves

39
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:46,770
and funnels through the ear canal and into
the middle ear, where they cause your eardrum

40
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,159
to vibrate. From there, sound vibrations are
amplified by the so-called 'ossicle bones',

41
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:55,430
which also happen to be the most awesomely
named bones in your body: the stirrup, the

42
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,920
hammer and the anvil. From here, those physical
vibrations travel to the inner ear, where

43
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,768
they bump into the snail-shaped cochlea, and
its surrounding fluids get jostled around,

44
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:09,989
causing some of your 16,000 tiny cochlear
hair cells to bend. This motion triggers neighbouring

45
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:14,330
nerve cells that convert that physical energy
into electrical impulses zipping up the auditory

46
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:19,440
nerve into the auditory cortex, where the
brain is like 'Oh, songbirds!', or 'Elvis!',

47
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,489
or 'Vengeance!', or whatever.
And you know what goes great with a little

48
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:25,378
bit of rockabilly, or revenge? A nice meal.

49
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:30,518
One of the greatest joys in life is enjoying
flavors; whether you prefer casserole or caviar,

50
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,390
we all get our tasting done in the same way,
starting with our taste buds. Each of our

51
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:38,628
thousands of taste buds contains a sort of
pocket-like pore that contains fifty to a

52
00:03:38,628 --> 00:03:43,719
hundred hair-like taste receptor cells that
read food molecules and report back to the

53
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:47,658
brain. "That chip is salty, that lemon is
sour." Now, everybody used to think that our

54
00:03:47,658 --> 00:03:52,519
tongues just detected four distinct tastes:
sweet, salty, sour and bitter. And you've

55
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,969
probably seen the version of this bogus taste
map, which incorrectly assigns certain tastes

56
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:02,340
to certain parts of your tongue. But we now
recognize a fifth flavour: the savoury, meaty,

57
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,128
MSG-y taste, for which there is no English
word, it's known as 'umami'.

58
00:04:07,128 --> 00:04:11,699
But taste is nothing without smell. Plug your
nose, and a bite of cold bacon is just a mouthful

59
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:16,998
of salt. This is a prime example of sensory
interaction; the principle that one sense

60
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:17,939
can influence another.

61
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:21,379
I'll get back to smell in just a bit, but
I want to take a moment to talk about what

62
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:24,449
happens when those sensory interactions get
messy.

63
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:26,300
Let us take a little questionnaire, shall
we?

64
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,348
Do certain words trigger a strong, specific
taste in your mouth? Like, does the word 'kitten'

65
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:32,829
taste like candy canes?

66
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:38,318
Has hearing a sound ever made you see a color?
Like does Prince's voice singing Purple Rain

67
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,249
actually cause the colour purple to flash
before your eyes?

68
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:44,520
Do you ever feel like you're being touched
when you smell something?

69
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:48,799
Like does the smell of lilies give you the
sensation of touching a cold, metal surface?

70
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,249
Most of you said no to all of those questions,
but at least one of you out there answered

71
00:04:54,249 --> 00:05:00,039
yes. And more likely than not, that person
has synesthesia, a rare and fascinating neurological

72
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:03,688
condition where two or more senses get wrapped
together.

73
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:08,499
This kind of sensory mix up is involuntary,
and it's experienced without forethought in

74
00:05:08,499 --> 00:05:13,800
a durable and consistent way. Like, the number
seven is always going to taste like coffee,

75
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,908
and it's never going to switch to tomato juice.

76
00:05:15,908 --> 00:05:19,848
And we're still not sure what causes this
phenomenon. One idea suggests that the rogue

77
00:05:19,848 --> 00:05:23,860
development of new neural connections may
override normal boundaries that typically

78
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,869
separate the senses. Another theory suggests
that all babies are born with synesthesia

79
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:32,240
and experience mixed sense until the brain
matures and creates separate sense channels,

80
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,399
unless they don't, in which case you grow
up to be a synesthete. Yet another theory

81
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,769
links the condition to wonky neurochemistry,
in which the neurotransmitters associated

82
00:05:40,769 --> 00:05:44,258
with one function turn up way over in a different
part of the brain.

83
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:48,430
Just another example of how the mind is still
extremely mysterious.

84
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:53,110
So, back to the comparatively boring topic
of smells that only smell... unlike our wave

85
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:58,129
detecting senses of sight and hearing, out
taste and smell are chemical senses. We differentiate

86
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:03,149
the smells of spring lilacs, grilled cheese,
and gasoline when airborne molecules travel

87
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:08,699
up the nose and reach the five to ten million
receptor cells at the top of each nasal cavity;

88
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,088
and yes, that means when you smell poop, there's
poop particles in your nose.

89
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:16,778
These receptors send information to the brain's
olfactory bulb, then zips it on to the primary

90
00:06:16,778 --> 00:06:21,360
smell cortex and parts of the limbic system
responsible for emotion and memory. Unlike

91
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,288
our five different taste receptors or two
types of retinal receptors, we don't have

92
00:06:25,288 --> 00:06:30,938
specifically differentiated smell receptors,
rather, odour receptors come together in different

93
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:31,189
combinations.

94
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:34,649
So, just like pressing different keys on your
keyboard can allow you to form tons of different

95
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:38,598
words, so too can these distinct combinations
of activated smell receptors communicate some

96
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,618
ten thousand unique smells.

97
00:06:40,619 --> 00:06:45,189
But, how we feel about a smell, and our perception
of it, is often tangled up in our experiences

98
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:49,968
with that scent. If our beloved grandma baked
gingerbread every time we visited, those memories

99
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:54,800
may make you partial to the smell of gingerbread.
Even if we can't immediately name the odor,

100
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,679
our brains are amazing at storing and recognizing
old scents by their associations. Which is

101
00:06:59,678 --> 00:07:03,718
why you may suddenly feel happy when you walk
into a bakery, even before you realize you're

102
00:07:03,718 --> 00:07:04,740
thinking of your grandma.

103
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,300
The emotional power of smell partly has to
with how our sense circuitry connects to the

104
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:14,098
brain's limbic system, right next to our emotional
registry, the amygdala, and our memory keeper,

105
00:07:14,098 --> 00:07:18,558
the hippocampus. That's why scents can be
so intimately tied with our feelings and memories.

106
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:22,338
And how a whiff of Nag Champa can immediately
transport to back to eating chips in your

107
00:07:22,338 --> 00:07:23,559
freshman dorm room.

108
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:27,629
Smelling, hearing, tasting, seeing: all fantastic,
but if there's one thing that popular music

109
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:31,968
taught us, besides a bunch of really terrible
relationship advice, it's that when it comes

110
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:36,740
to our senses, we're all about touching. We've
got songs about magic touches and golden touches,

111
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,369
invisible and human touches. Songs about touching
ourselves, touching me, touching you, and

112
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:42,649
even what you can't touch.

113
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:46,678
Touch is extremely important, especially during
early development. Baby monkeys that are allowed

114
00:07:46,678 --> 00:07:51,428
to see, hear and smell, but not touch their
mamas become extremely distraught. That's

115
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:55,628
just a mean experiment. Premature human babies
gain weight faster if they're held and massaged,

116
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:58,838
and some studies indicated that children that
didn't receive enough physical attention as

117
00:07:58,838 --> 00:08:03,059
infants are at higher risk for emotional,
behavioral, and social problems as they grow.

118
00:08:03,059 --> 00:08:07,389
Your sense of touch is actually a combination
of four distinct skin sensations: pressure,

119
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:12,348
warmth, cold, and pain. If you touch various
spots of your skin with something soft like

120
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:16,978
this anglerfish, you'll feel that you sense
different amounts of softness on different

121
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:20,519
parts of your body... just put that up there...

122
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:24,758
The same goes for a warm mug, or an ice cube,
or a needle point. You'll sense that some

123
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:29,819
spots are more or less sensitive to each of
the four distinct sensations. Other skin sensations,

124
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:33,930
like tickles, itches, and the experience of
wetness, are just variations on those four

125
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:34,948
different sensations.

126
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:39,559
Ultimately, your sense of touch joins forces
with sensors in your bones, joints, and tendons

127
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:44,138
to provide your personal kinesthesis: the
way that body senses its own movement and

128
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:48,730
positioning. You use your kinesthetic sense
whenever you walk, dance, swim, or hula hoop.

129
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,810
It's what the cops are testing drunk people
for when they ask them to touch their noses

130
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:56,039
with their eyes closed. This sense allows
you to detect changes in the position of your

131
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,899
body without relying on other senses, which
is why you can still cha-cha, backstroke,

132
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:02,958
and hula hoop with your eyes closed and your
ears plugged.

133
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,948
The partner sense to your kinesthesis is your
vestibular sense, which monitors your head's

134
00:09:06,948 --> 00:09:11,549
position and your balance. This sense of equilibrium
is ruled by the pretzel-shaped, semicircular

135
00:09:11,549 --> 00:09:15,698
canals and the fluid-filled vestibular sacs
that connect those canals to the cochlea in

136
00:09:15,698 --> 00:09:20,120
your inner ear. So, if you spin around a bunch
and suddenly stop, it'll take a minute for

137
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,389
that inner ear fluid to return to normal,
which is what makes you feel dizzy. That moving

138
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:28,120
fluid is actually fooling your brain into
thinking your body is still spinning. It's

139
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,589
a good example of how even our normal functioning
senses can fool us. Understanding exactly

140
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:36,589
how we get fooled helps us understand how
our sensual perception system works, which

141
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:38,920
is exactly what we're going to be talking
about next time.

142
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:43,000
For now, hopefully you realized that your
homunculus is actually kinda beautiful, in

143
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,539
its own way, because you learned how your
sense of hearing, taste, smell, and touch

144
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:47,789
work.

145
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,180
And thanks for watching, especially to all
our Subbable Subscribers, who make this whole

146
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:55,088
channel possible. If you'd like to sponsor
an episode of Crash Course: Psychology, get

147
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:59,480
a copy of one of our Rorschach prints, and
even be animated into an upcoming episode,

148
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,430
just go to subbable.com/crashcourse.

00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:04,989
This episode was written by Kathleen Yale,
edited by Blake de Pastino and myself, and
