1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,520
When Lauren was fifteen years old, her family
moved across the country and she started going

2
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:09,699
to a new school. Already shy, Lauren suffered
from low self-confidence and had a hard time

3
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:14,408
transitioning; nothing felt right and soon
her changing body became a source of insecurity.

4
00:00:14,409 --> 00:00:19,250
Eventually, she began thinking that maybe
if she lost weight and focused on fitness,

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,179
she'd make more friends and feel better about
herself and life would get better. Soon she

6
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:27,589
became obsessed with dieting and it quickly
spiraled into her subsisting only on rice

7
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:29,960
cakes and apples and candy corn and celery.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,210
She like this new feeling of control every
time she stood on the scale and saw a lower

9
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,730
number. She was achieving something, and that made
her feel good. Soon, she thought of nothing else.

10
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:44,659
But what Lauren couldn't see was that she
was no longer healthy. Even when her hair

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,850
started falling out and her skin grew dry and cracked,
and when she could never get warm.

12
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,899
When she looked in the mirror, she still saw
a chubby girl.

13
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:58,058
Her family, though, did notice, and yet, at a visit
to the doctor, she was just told to eat more.

14
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:58,859
She didn't.

15
00:00:58,869 --> 00:01:04,659
One day while jogging, she had a heart attack
and collapsed. As a teenager, she was 5'7"

16
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:08,799
and weighed eighty-two pounds. Lauren was
finally admitted to a psychiatric hospital

17
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:13,430
where she was treated for anorexia nervosa.
She was put on bed rest, saw a therapist twice

18
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,580
a week, joined a support group and slowly
began eating small amounts of food again.

19
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:21,189
Her recovery was slow but, with the support
of her family and doctors, she was released

20
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:25,500
eight months later. Though Lauren suffered a few
relapses over the years, she is now healthy.

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,438
Ultimately, she was lucky. Anorexia, bulimia, and other
eating and body dysmorphic disorders can kill.

22
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,438
Eating disorders are among the deadliest psychological
disorders, with some of the highest rates

23
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,829
of death directly attributable to the illness.
They slowly ruin the body, but, in order for

24
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:44,079
these conditions to be recognized and treated
successfully, they have to be understood as

25
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,079
disorders of the mind.

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,000
Here's some scary figures: According to the
National Eating Disorder Association, forty-two

27
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:04,769
percent of first to third grade girls want
to be thinner; eighty-one percent of ten year

28
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:09,389
olds are afraid of being fat; over half of
teenage girls and nearly a third of teenage

29
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:14,689
boys have used troubling weight control methods
like fasting, skipping meals, smoking, vomiting,

30
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:15,909
or taking laxatives.

31
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:19,579
The rate of new cases of eating disorders
in Western culture has been increasing since

32
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,980
the 1950's, and today in the US, an estimated
twenty million women and ten million men have

33
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:29,068
suffered from a clinically significant eating
disorder at some point in their lives.

34
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:33,199
But get this straight: we're not talking about
fad diets or lifestyle choices spurred by

35
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:38,899
vanity. Eating disorders are psychological
illnesses that often come with serious consequences.

36
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,439
These disorders tend to fall into three main categories:
anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating disorders.

37
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:48,780
Those suffering from anorexia nervosa, most
often adolescent females, essentially maintain

38
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,568
a starving diet and, eventually, and abnormally
low body weight. As in Lauren's case, anorexia

39
00:02:54,568 --> 00:02:58,759
can begin as a diet that quickly spirals out
of control as a person becomes obsessed with

40
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:02,189
continued weight loss, all while still feeling
overweight.

41
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:06,829
Our old friend, the DSM V, actually delineates
two sub types of the disorder. The first involves

42
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:11,660
restriction, which usually consists of an
extremely low-calorie diet, excessive exercise,

43
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:16,400
or purging, like vomiting or the use of laxatives.
The second type is the binge/purge sub type,

44
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,890
which involves episodes of binge eating combined
with the restriction behavior.

45
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:23,479
As you can easily imagine, the physiological
effects of this psychological condition can

46
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:27,518
be devastating. As the body is denied crucial
nutrients, it slows down to conserve what

47
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,069
little energy it has, often resulting in abnormally
slow heart rate, loss of bone density, fatigue,

48
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:37,949
muscle weakness, hair loss, severe dehydration,
and an extremely low body mass index.

49
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:42,738
And it's that low body mass that's the defining
characteristic of anorexia nervosa - a refusal

50
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:47,439
to maintain a weight at or above what would
normally be considered minimally healthy.

51
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,859
If this condition persists, of course, it
can be deadly, which is why anorexia has what's

52
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,569
often estimated to be the highest mortality
rate of any psychiatric disorder.

53
00:03:56,568 --> 00:04:00,000
That might surprise you, given the host of
troubling disorders we've already covered

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,340
here on Crash Course Psychology, but mortality
rates associated with, say, major depression

55
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:10,170
or PTSD or schizophrenia tend to be the result
of secondary behavior, like suicide. But with

56
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:14,449
anorexia, the mortality rate is especially
high because people can die as a direct result

57
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:17,430
of extreme weight loss and physiological damage.

58
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,028
Another common eating disorder is bulimia
nervosa.

59
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:24,218
While anorexia is characterized primarily
by the refusal to maintain a minimal body

60
00:04:24,218 --> 00:04:28,819
weight, bulimia is not. People with bulimia
tend to maintain an apparently normal, or

61
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:33,110
at least minimally healthy, body weight, but
alternate between binge eating, followed by

62
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,699
fasting or purging, often by vomiting or using
laxatives.

63
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:42,249
A bulimic body may not be as obviously underweight
as an anorexic one, but that addictive cycle

64
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:47,949
of binging and purging can seriously damage
the whole digestive system, leading to irregular

65
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:51,999
heartbeat, inflammation of the esophagus and
mouth, tooth decay and staining, irregular

66
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:56,259
bowel movements, peptic ulcers, pancreatitis,
and other organ damage.

67
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:59,430
Sometimes the two diagnoses can be difficult
to discern, especially because someone may

68
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,939
shift back and forth between anorexic diagnostic
features and bulimic diagnostic features.

69
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:08,479
The DSM V recently added a third category
called binge-eating disorder, which is marked

70
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:14,618
by significant binge-eating, followed by emotional
distress, feelings of lack of control, disgust,

71
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:17,259
or guilt, but without purging or fasting.

72
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:21,788
Although sometimes triggered by stress or
a need for, or lack of, control, the presence

73
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:26,918
of an eating disorder is not a tell-tale sign
of childhood sexual abuse, as was once commonly

74
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:30,549
thought. Instead, these disorders are often
predictive indicators of a person's feelings

75
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:36,610
of low self-worth, need to be perfect, falling short of
expectations, and concern with others perceptions.

76
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,860
Although the prevalence of bulimia and binge-eating
is similar among ethnic groups in the United

77
00:05:40,869 --> 00:05:46,139
States, anorexia is is much more common among
white women, often of higher socioeconomic status.

78
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,499
But the prevalence of these disorders is rising
in males, too. Today, between ten and twenty

79
00:05:50,499 --> 00:05:55,249
percent of people diagnosed with eating disorders
are men who feel the same pressure to attain

80
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:58,849
what they imagine is physical perfection,
and that's worth noting.

81
00:05:58,848 --> 00:06:03,308
These disorders have strong cultural and gender
components; the so-called "ideal standard

82
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:09,099
of beauty" varies wildly across cultures and
time, and thinness is far from a universal

83
00:06:09,098 --> 00:06:12,558
desire, especially in countries where malnutrition
and starvation are problems.

84
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:17,210
But in the Western world, and increasingly
in other countries, thinness is a common pursuit.

85
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:22,428
And being bombarded with images of unrealistically
slender models and jacked celebrities has

86
00:06:22,428 --> 00:06:27,299
increased many people's dissatisfaction, or
even shame and disgust, with their own bodies.

87
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,270
These are all attitudes that can contribute
to eating disorders.

88
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:35,019
Some people have even had plastic surgery to
look more like Beyonce, or J-Lo, or...Barbie.

89
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:39,479
When taken to extremes, this kind of behavior starts
inching into the realm of body dysmorphic disorder.

90
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,520
Body dysmorphic disorder is another psychological
illness, one that centers on a person's obsession

91
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:47,908
with physical flaws - either minor or just
imagined. Those suffering from this disorder

92
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:52,788
often obsess over their appearance, often
staring into mirrors for hours, and feel distressed

93
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,740
or ashamed by what they see.

94
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,069
Although it's often lumped in with the eating
disorders, our growing understanding of body

95
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:02,729
dysmorphia suggests that it actually shares
some traits with obsessive-compulsive disorder,

96
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:07,459
particularly the obsession with some imagined
bodily perfection and the compulsion to check

97
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,509
oneself over and over to discern perceived
flaws.

98
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:15,999
Not surprisingly, BDD and OCD may share some
similar neurophysiological features, although

99
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:17,459
that's still being researched.

100
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:22,110
People suffering from BDD may exercise excessively,
groom themselves excessively, or seek out

101
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,408
extreme cosmetic procedures, but, unless treated,
they usually remain critical and unsatisfied

102
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:31,569
with their looks, to the point of fearing
that they have a deformity.

103
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:36,039
People with BDD may suffer from anxiety and
depression, start avoiding social situations,

104
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:40,068
and stay home for fear that others will notice
and judge their appearance negatively.

105
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:43,740
Obviously, this causes a lot of emotional
distress and dysfunction. Some bodybuilders

106
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,929
suffer from a particular type of BDD called
muscle dysmorphia, sort of the opposite of

107
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:52,348
anorexia, where they become obsessed with
the notion that they aren't muscular enough,

108
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:54,498
even if they're ripping shirts like the Hulk.

109
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:58,899
And again, this isn't mere vanity; people
suffering from body dysmorphia disorder look

110
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:03,709
in the mirror and often see a distorted, even
grotesque, image in their reflection.

111
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:05,718
So, how do these disorders come about?

112
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:08,329
Well, to be honest, we still have a lot of
dots to connect.

113
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:11,800
Neurologically, there are a few compelling
clues. In the case of eating disorders, for

114
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,728
example, research has long suggested that
neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine

115
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:16,678
may play a role.

116
00:08:16,678 --> 00:08:21,088
Dopamine is involved in regions of the brain
connected to hunger and eating, like the hypothalamus

117
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:24,988
and nucleus accumbens, and some research has
found that binge eating appears to alter the

118
00:08:24,988 --> 00:08:28,908
regulation of dopamine production in a way
that can reinforce further binging.

119
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:32,549
The result is a neurological pattern that
can resemble drug addiction, although the

120
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:34,929
addiction comparison is still pretty controversial.

121
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:38,429
Genetics appear to play a role, too, as there
seems to be increased risk among genetic relatives

122
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:40,309
with eating disorders as compared to controls.

123
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:44,679
But a lot of attention is also being paid
to environmental and familial factors, particularly

124
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:49,370
the behavioral modeling and learning processes
that shape how we think about ourselves and

125
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,940
our bodies. Specifically, children who grow
up observing problematic or unhealthy eating

126
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,620
behavior in parents may be at higher risk
for developing an eating disorder. And explicitly

127
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,789
learning unreasonable or unhealthy values
about your weight or your shape from your

128
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:06,620
family, and definitely from your peers, can
have a powerful effect.

129
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,279
Eating and body dysmorphic disorders are serious
business, but they are treatable --

130
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,759
and perhaps even preventable.

131
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:16,429
If cultural learning contributes to how we
eat and how we want to look, then maybe education

132
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:20,878
can help increase our acceptance of our own
appearance, and be more accepting of others.

133
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,190
Today, you learned about the symptoms and
sub types of anorexia, bulimia, and binge-eating

134
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,910
disorder, as well as various types of body
dysmorphic disorder, and some of the physiological

135
00:09:29,909 --> 00:09:31,860
and environmental roots of these conditions.
