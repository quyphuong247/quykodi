1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,310
It was midnight when Bernice got off work.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,478
She was exhausted after a long and terrible
day, and just wanted to get home to a hot

3
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:10,370
bath. She was driving down the street, flipping
through radio stations, when she pulled up

4
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:14,869
to a stop sign, and saw something weird.
A shadowy figure ran up to an idling fruit

5
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:19,449
truck, pushed the delivery man down, grabbed
a crate of bananas, and ran off around the

6
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:21,250
corner.
Bernice was pretty shaken up, but she made

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,280
sure the driver was okay, and then called
the police, describing the thief as a pale,

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,890
lanky man, wearing a dark jacket and a baseball
cap. She gave the cops her information, and

9
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,509
then she went home.
A couple days later the police asked her to

10
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:37,439
come down to the station to identify a potential
thief--a guy who more or less matched her

11
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,409
description, and was found eating a banana
early that morning, near the scene of the

12
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:43,898
crime.
Although the guy professed innocence, Bernice

13
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:47,640
said it was him, and they locked him up.
But at the trial, the defense called a memory

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,079
expert to the stand, and soon after that,
the suspect walked.

15
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:54,268
Today’s lesson may not quite make you an
expert worthy of the witness stand, but by

16
00:00:54,268 --> 00:00:58,079
the time we’re done, you’ll understand
a lot more about how we retrieve memories

17
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:05,079
we think we’ve stored, and why the accused
banana thief was set free.

18
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,900
[INTRO]

19
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:15,650
We’re all constantly retrieving memories
throughout the day-- you’re remembering

20
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,630
where you parked your car, or if you fed the
cat, or called your mom ‘cause it’s her

21
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:21,299
birthday.
You’ll remember from last week that while

22
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,560
our implicit memories--like how to talk and
ride a bike--are dealt with on a mostly automatic

23
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,129
and non-conscious level, our explicit memories--the
chronicles of our personal experiences and

24
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:34,849
general knowledge -- often require conscious,
effortful work.

25
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:40,579
Bernice had to notice, encode, store, and
later consciously retrieve details about the

26
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:44,980
crime she witnessed--what color was the guy’s
jacket, what did he look like, what did he

27
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,859
steal, and where did he run?
It takes a lot of work to retrieve memories

28
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:52,250
from long-term storage, and the truth is,
a lot can go wrong along the way.

29
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:57,170
In order to understand all of the many fascinating
ways you forget things, we need to talk more

30
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,769
about how we remember.
Our memories are not like books in the library

31
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:05,989
of your mind. You don’t just pluck a neatly-packaged
memory -- about where you left your phone

32
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:09,758
or the hair color of a fruit thief.
Instead your memories are more like the spider

33
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,649
webs in the dank catacombs of your mind--a
series of interconnected associations that

34
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,930
link all sorts of diverse things, as bits
of information get stuck to other bits of

35
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,998
information.
Like, maybe Bernice remembers that the night

36
00:02:21,998 --> 00:02:25,709
of the crime was chilly with a full moon,
and that Beyonce was on the radio, and the

37
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:28,878
fruit truck had plates from California, which
is where her grandfather lives.

38
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,608
All those bits of information in the web of
memory--the weather, the song, the plates--can

39
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:38,950
serve as retrieval cues, kind of like a trail
of breadcrumbs leading back to a particular

40
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:40,998
memory.
The more retrieval cues you inadvertently,

41
00:02:40,998 --> 00:02:44,718
or intentionally, build along the way, the
better you can backtrack and find the memory

42
00:02:44,718 --> 00:02:48,138
you’re looking for.
This way of activating associations non-consciously

43
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:52,879
is called priming, sometimes called “memoryless
memory”. It’s how “invisible memories”

44
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,199
that you didn’t know you had can awaken
old associations.

45
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:00,188
Priming is how you often jog your memory.
This kind of recall is sometimes referred

46
00:03:00,188 --> 00:03:03,828
to as context-dependent memory.
Say you’re reading in bed, and you want

47
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:06,829
to underline a quote, but you don’t have
a pen. You get up and go into the other room

48
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:10,209
to find your special light-up Hello Kitty
pen, but you get distracted and suddenly you

49
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:14,370
find yourself in the kitchen; you’re like
“Why? Why, mind? Why am I in the kitchen?

50
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,989
What is here? Why am- there was a rea- and
I don’t know but I’m here now and agh!”

51
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:23,259
It’s only when you retrace your steps and
return to bed, to the initial context where

52
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:27,340
you read that quote and encoded that first
thought of wanting that pen, that the memory

53
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,389
comes back. And then you’re like ‘oh,
I need to go get the pen. Ugh’

54
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:36,669
If some memories are context-dependent, others
are state-dependent, and also mood-congruent.

55
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:40,489
This just means that our states and our emotions
can also serve as retrieval cues.

56
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:44,188
If I had a throbbing headache and a super
bad day, I’m more likely to start recalling

57
00:03:44,188 --> 00:03:48,878
bad memories, because I’m priming negative
associations. But of course if I’m relaxed

58
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,608
and jolly, I’m prone to remember happy times,
which are prolonging my good mood.

59
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:57,090
Another funny memory-retrieval quirk speaks
not to our location or emotions, but to the

60
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,950
order in which we receive new information.
So, say you make a grocery list in the morning,

61
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,548
but a few hours later, you’re at the store,
you realize you left it at home.

62
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:08,409
You’d be more likely to recall the first
items on the list--bananas and bread--and

63
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:12,388
the last items--pickles and cheese--than anything
in the middle. This is known as the serial

64
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:15,819
position effect. This might be because the
early words benefitted from what’s known

65
00:04:15,818 --> 00:04:20,139
as the primacy effect, and made it into your
long-term memory because they were rehearsed

66
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:24,569
more. Meanwhile, the last words lingered in
the working memory through the recency effect.

67
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:28,819
But those poor middle words, they didn’t
benefit from either effect and therefore escaped

68
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:34,129
your brain, which is why you now have no toilet
paper, dog food, toothpaste, or cookies. Who

69
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:37,720
forgets cookies?
But even with all these tricks and associations,

70
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,849
things still go wrong--memory can fail or
become distorted, and of course we forget

71
00:04:42,848 --> 00:04:45,569
things.
Forgetfulness can be as minor as those frustrating

72
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:48,699
moments where you’re like ‘Ah, it’s
on the tip of my tongue. It’s the guy, the

73
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:53,900
guy’s got hair, and a face, and, like, shoulders.’
Or as major as Clive Wearing, whose neurological

74
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:57,929
damage made it impossible for him to recall
the past or create new memories.

75
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,848
Of course, we all forget things, and typically
we do it in one of three different ways: We

76
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:08,370
fail to encode it, we fail to retrieve it,
or we experience what psychologists call storage

77
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,590
decay.
Sometimes forgetting something just means

78
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:14,079
it never really got through your encoding
process in the first place. I mean, think

79
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,529
of all the stuff that’s going around you
at any given moment. We only actually notice

80
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:21,788
a fraction of what we sense, and we can only
consciously hold so many bits of information

81
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:26,509
in our minds at any given time, so what we
fail to notice, we tend to not encode, and

82
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:30,658
thus don't remember.
Bernice noticed a dark jacket, Beyonce, and

83
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:34,598
bananas, but she didn’t encode much about
the driver, or the color of the thief’s

84
00:05:34,598 --> 00:05:36,978
shoes.
Then again, even memories that have been encoded

85
00:05:36,978 --> 00:05:41,478
are still vulnerable to storage decay, or
natural forgetting over time.

86
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:44,579
Interestingly, even though we can forget things
pretty quickly, the amount of data that we

87
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:48,168
forget can actually levels off after a while.
This means that Bernice would have forgotten

88
00:05:48,168 --> 00:05:51,689
about half of what she first noticed from
the crime scene a couple days later, but what

89
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:55,740
she still remembered, she’d likely hang
on to, because the rate at which we forget

90
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,069
tends to plateau.
A lot of times forgetting doesn’t mean our

91
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:03,330
memory just faded to black, it means we can’t
call it up on demand because of retrieval

92
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,859
failure.
We all know the common tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon

93
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:10,620
where you feel like you know the name of that
weird-looking hard-backed animal that rolls

94
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,610
up into ball. It’s kind of cute and weird
and I think they get leprosy or something…what

95
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:20,110
is it?! This is where retrieval cues can come
in handy. If I say is starts with the letter

96
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,960
A, you may suddenly unlock the information--Armadillo!

97
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:25,538
Sometimes these retrieval problems stem from
interference from other memories getting in

98
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:29,649
the way, essentially cluttering the brain.
Sometimes, old stuff that you’ve learned

99
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:32,788
keeps you from recalling new stuff -- like,
if you change one of your passwords, but keep

100
00:06:32,788 --> 00:06:37,598
recalling your old one every time you try
to log in. That’s called proactive, or forward-acting,

101
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:41,110
interference.
The flip side is retroactive, or backward-acting,

102
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,379
interference, which happens when new learning
gets in the way of recalling old information,

103
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:48,908
like if you start studying Spanish, it may
interfere with the French that you’ve already

104
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,579
learned.
There’s a lot of reconstruction and inferring

105
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:55,359
involved when you try to flesh out a memory,
and every time you replay it in your mind,

106
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,009
or relate it to a friend, it changes, just
a little. So in a way, we’re all sort of

107
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:05,090
perpetually re-writing our pasts.
While this is an inevitable part of human

108
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:09,158
nature, it can prove dangerous at times.
Misleading information can get incorporated

109
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:12,360
into a memory, and twist the truth - and yes
there is an effect for this; it’s called

110
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,800
the misinformation effect.
American psychologist and memory expert Elizabeth

111
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,718
Loftus has spent decades showing how eyewitnesses
inadvertently tweak and reconstruct their

112
00:07:20,718 --> 00:07:24,949
memories after accidents or crimes.
In one experiment, two groups watched a film

113
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:29,400
of a car accident. Those asked how fast the
cars were going when they smashed into each

114
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:33,948
other estimated much higher speeds than those
who were asked about the cars hitting each

115
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:36,840
other.
Smash is the leading word that essentially

116
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:41,418
altered the witnesses’ memories -- so much
so that a week later, when both groups were

117
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:46,019
asked if they saw any broken glass, those
who heard the word smash were twice as likely

118
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:50,149
to report seeing bits of glass, when in fact,
the original film didn’t show any.

119
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:54,288
In Bernice’s case, chances are her memory
of the robbery would be altered if the prosecution

120
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:57,310
said the thief assaulted, rather than pushed
the driver.

121
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,098
This sort of interfering or misleading information
may also manifest itself as source misattribution,

122
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:05,478
like when we forget or misrecall the source
of a memory.

123
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:09,468
In the case of Bernice, when she saw the suspect
in the courtroom, she thought she recognized

124
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:13,168
him from the night of the crime, when in reality,
he’d just served her coffee earlier that

125
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:14,990
day.
But her memory of the event had probably already

126
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,579
been tweaked several times before she even
made it into the courtroom. Like she re-lived

127
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:23,459
the tale multiple times, in her own mind or
when she told other people about it, and every

128
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:27,888
time she introduced errors, filling in memory
gaps with reasonable guesses.

129
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:31,870
Not only that, but we know Bernice was already
tired and stressed when she witnessed the

130
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:36,679
event, and we know our emotions can influence
both what we remember and what we forget.

131
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:41,429
Because memory is both a reconstruction and
a reproduction of past events, we can’t

132
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:45,379
ever really be sure if a memory is real just
because it feels real.

133
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:49,338
Elizabeth Loftus knows this. She’s frequently
called in to testify against the accuracy

134
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:53,459
of eyewitnesses. In fact, of all the U.S.
prisoners who have been exonerated based on

135
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:58,528
DNA evidence presented by Innocence Project,
a non-profit legal group, 75 percent of them

136
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:03,039
were convicted by mistaken eyewitnesses. That
is a lot of innocent people.

137
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,289
Bernice meant well of course, she’s an honest
enough lady, but all these factors--the emotion,

138
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:11,110
the retelling, the suggestions of outside
sources-- combined with the darkness, the

139
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:16,419
quick glimpse, the passing of time, maybe
even the Beyonce, ended up leading to a mistake

140
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:20,009
in the thief’s identification.
Turns out the human memory is actually a very

141
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:24,588
fragile thing. We’re all largely the product
of the stories that we tell ourselves.

142
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:28,950
If you haven’t forgotten already, today
you learned about how our memories are stored

143
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:34,259
in webs of association, aided by retrieval
cues and priming, and influenced by context

144
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:39,909
and mood. You also learned how we forget information,
how our memories are susceptible to interference

145
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:45,240
and misinformation, and why eyewitnesses are
often not as reliable as you might think.
