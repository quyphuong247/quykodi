1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,339
In the early 1800's, German physician, Franz
Joseph Gall spent a lot of time running his

2
00:00:05,349 --> 00:00:10,980
fingers over the scalps of strangers. He wasn't
a hairdresser, he wasn't a masseuse, he wasn't

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,920
just like a big fan of heads. He was a phrenologist,
he was the first phrenologist. Gall believed

4
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:20,850
that a persons personality was linked to their
skull morphology, that its bumps and ridges

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,970
indicated aspects of their character. Amazingly
this "science" actually caught on, was widely

6
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:30,349
practiced for decades, and Gall became something
of a celebrity.

7
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:35,020
Well, with a head like his, one can see how
he might have been a little bit fixated with

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,940
skull shape.

9
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:39,570
Eventually, phrenology was dismissed as a
cult pseudoscience because it turns out your

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,759
cranial contours tell us exactly nothing about
what's happening inside the brain.

11
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,579
And yet! Gall was actually on to something
big, something that we knew nothing about.

12
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,109
Remember, at this point we were just starting
to get consensus that the brain was the source

13
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:57,280
of self and not like the soul or the heart
or whatever. His lasting and correct proposition

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,308
was that different parts of the brain control
specific aspects of our behavior.

15
00:01:01,308 --> 00:01:05,308
Like we talked about last time, there is a
strong link between biological activity and

16
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:09,319
psychological events. But in addition to the
interplay of chemicals like neurotransmitters

17
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:14,419
and hormones, a lot of this has to do with
that localized parts of the brain have specific

18
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,609
functions, like vision, movement, memory,
speech, and even facial recognition. Function,

19
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:20,819
in other words, is localized.

20
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:23,349
If you could stimulate different parts of
my brain in any way you wanted to– and if

21
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:27,478
you ask me nicely, I just might let you–
you could control my movements, my memories,

22
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:32,030
and even my personality. Poke my brain over
here and my arm would twitch, poke here and

23
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,368
I'd remember my first kiss, do it up her and
suddenly I'd be filled with a tremendous Hulk-like

24
00:01:36,368 --> 00:01:36,879
rage!

25
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:42,478
This is the link between the brain, that physical
hunk of gunk between the ears, and the mind,

26
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,900
the thing that is us, our consciousness, our
behavior, our decisions, our memories, our

27
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,520
selves. Some neuroscientists like to say that
the mind is what the brain does, so one of

28
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:57,789
the driving questions of psychology and, like,
the human experiment is "How do our brains'

29
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:02,700
functions tie to the behavior of the mind?"
And you can't even ask the right questions,

30
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,799
let alone get at some of the answers, until
you get to know the brain.

31
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:12,230
[Intro]

32
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:19,028
You might have a passing familiarity with
your nervous system, like, "The brain bone

33
00:02:19,028 --> 00:02:23,549
is connected to the spinal cord bone, and
the spinal cord bone is connected to the motoneuron

34
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:27,590
bone." That's your central nervous system,
and there aren't actually any bones. Your

35
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,039
central nervous system, or just CNS, is what
makes your bodies big decisions. This system

36
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:35,739
is the command center, and if you mess with
it, things are gonna get weird. There's also

37
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:39,930
the peripheral nervous system, which is composed
of scout-like sensory neurons that gather

38
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,909
information and report it back to the central
nervous system.

39
00:02:42,908 --> 00:02:47,519
To get a handle on just how physical the roots
of your mind and personality are, how concretely

40
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,658
your nervous system makes you you, let me
tell you a story. The curious case of Phineas

41
00:02:52,658 --> 00:02:58,138
Gage. In 1848, a genial chap named Phineas
Gage was working on the railroad, tamping

42
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:02,769
gunpowder into a blasting hole with an iron
rod, but the gunpowder ignited.The resulting

43
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:07,528
explosion caused the rod to shoot like a bullet
up through his left cheek and out of the top

44
00:03:07,528 --> 00:03:12,668
of his head. There's brain in between those
two places, by the way. Amazingly, he stood

45
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:17,379
up after the accident, and walked over to
a cart, described what had happened, and then

46
00:03:17,378 --> 00:03:20,358
they drove him back to his house, all while
he was conscious.

47
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:25,260
So the doctor came to examine him, and refused
to believe that a rod had in fact passed through

48
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:31,378
his head, understandably. Until Phineas started
coughing and an amount of brain that the doctor

49
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:37,388
described as a teacup-ful fell out of his
head, and the doctor had to accept indeed

50
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:41,838
what had happened. After a few months of convalescing,
he was pretty much healed up and moving around

51
00:03:41,838 --> 00:03:47,228
like he used to. But his friends were saying
that Phineas was no longer like himself. Yes

52
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:52,019
he had his memories and his mental abilities,
and he walked and talked and looked the same,

53
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:57,709
minus an eyeball, whereas the old Phineas
was mild-mannered and soft-spoken, the post-spike-to-the-brain

54
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:03,229
Phineas was surly and mean-spirited and vulgar.
People started to describe him as "no longer

55
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:04,019
Gage."

56
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,389
Phineas moved away from America, the scientific
establishment lost contact with him and 12

57
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:13,419
years later, after a series of seizures he
died at the age of 36. Phineas is a great,

58
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:17,370
if extreme, example of how function is localized
in the brain and how physical and biological

59
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,680
factors can be reflected in psychological
ways. Of course he is also an excellent example

60
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,019
of how individual studies are not particularly
useful, especially since we have very little

61
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:30,639
data on what Phineas was actually like before
or even after his accident. Most accounts

62
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,379
are from the months directly after the accident,
and many of them conflict. It's completely

63
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:38,340
possible that he continued to heal and lived
his remaining years as a happy and productive

64
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:38,788
citizen.

65
00:04:38,788 --> 00:04:42,680
Intro-psychology texts often paint the simple
picture of Phineas just so we can have a clear

66
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,598
example of the moment when physicians realized
that messing with the brain was messing with

67
00:04:46,598 --> 00:04:51,240
the mind, but it is of course all much more
complicated and Phineas was an actual, real

68
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,009
life person, I feel that we should give him
the nuance and mystery that he deserves.

69
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:58,870
Now you might have heard that we only used
about 10 percent of our brains, and oh if

70
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,098
that were true, Phineas would lose a quarter
of his and he'd be just fine. And if we could

71
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:07,490
just harness the rest of that gray mush, we'd
be able to mind read and levitate and get

72
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,430
all Professor X. It's an exciting thought,
as exciting as the idea that I can tell what

73
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,319
kind of tea you like by feeling the bumps
on your head. It is also exactly as wrong.

74
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:19,379
After watching an hour or so of reality TV,
you'd be forgiven for thinking that some people

75
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:23,860
are only working at 10 percent brain capacity.
But in actual reality, brain scans show that

76
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,900
nearly every region of the brain lights up
during even simple tasks like walking and

77
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:32,339
talking. Not only that, but the brain itself
requires 20 percent of all the body's energy,

78
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:36,209
and it would make little evolutionary sense
to throw much energy away at something that

79
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:37,158
is only minimally active.

80
00:05:37,158 --> 00:05:41,779
As animals, our capabilities have developed
in part from our brain structures. We're actually

81
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:45,959
able to trace our evolutionary history as
we come to understand these structures. Less

82
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:50,728
complex animals have simpler brains designed
for basic functioning and survival: rest,

83
00:05:50,728 --> 00:05:55,310
breathe, eat. Whereas more complex animals
like many mammals possess brains that feel,

84
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:59,819
remember, reason, and predict. These animals
don't have all new systems. They have new

85
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:03,749
brain systems built upon old brain systems.
The brain is kind of like a set of Russian

86
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:08,639
nesting dolls. The outermost wooden doll is
the newest, most detailed and most complex,

87
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,490
but as you go deeper, the dolls become older
and smaller, and simpler, and more generic.

88
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,030
The innermost wooden doll is the oldest, most
basic. It's like a fossil in your head.

89
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:22,359
This inner core of the brain, sometimes called
the "old brain" still performs for us much

90
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,389
as it did for our early evolutionary ancestors.
It's anchored by the brainstem, the most ancient

91
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:32,468
and central core of the brain where the spinal
brain enters the skull. Above it, at the base

92
00:06:32,468 --> 00:06:36,839
of the skull, is the medulla. Here, old brain
functions happen automatically without any

93
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:40,288
conscious effort: the beating of hearts, the
breathing of lungs, that sort of thing. The

94
00:06:40,288 --> 00:06:45,269
pons is perched on the medulla, and it helps
coordinate movement. Above the pons, at the

95
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:50,139
top of the brainstem, is the thalamus, a pair
of egg-shaped structures that take in sensory

96
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:54,098
information related to seeing, hearing, touching,
and tasting. The reticular formation is a

97
00:06:54,098 --> 00:06:58,819
finger-shaped nerve network inside the brain
stem that's essential for arousal, which isn't

98
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:03,060
necessarily what you feel upon seeing a particularly
nice-looking human, but instead refers to

99
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,728
things like sleeping and walking and pain
perception; other important functions. The

100
00:07:06,728 --> 00:07:10,300
baseball-sized cerebellum, or "little brain",
swells from the bottom of the brain stem and

101
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,689
is responsible for non-verbal learning and
memory, the perception of time, and modulating

102
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:19,990
motions, it controls voluntary movement like
your sweet dance moves, but it also gets impaired

103
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,960
easily under the influence of alcohol, hence
the term "tipsy".

104
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:27,158
So the old brain systems keep our body's basic
functions running smoothly; the sort of stuff

105
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:31,759
any animal might need. This is pretty much
where the brain stops for reptiles.

106
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,389
For higher functions, we look to the limbic
system. This includes the amygdala, hypothalamus,

107
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:40,400
and hippocampus. Sort of a border region of
the brain separating the old brain and the

108
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,138
newer, higher cerebral areas. The amygdala
consists of two lima bean-sized clusters of

109
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:50,360
neurons and is responsible for memory consolidation
as well as both our greatest fear and hottest

110
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,408
aggression. Stimulate one area of the amygdala,
and a docile family dog suddenly morphs into

111
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:57,808
a blood thirsty Cujo. Shift that electrode
over just a tiny bit and that dog will be

112
00:07:57,809 --> 00:08:02,789
cowering at butterfly shadow puppets. The
hypothalamus keeps your whole body steady,

113
00:08:02,788 --> 00:08:07,248
regulating body temperatures, circadian rhythms,
and hunger, also helps govern the endocrine

114
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:10,430
system, especially the pituitary gland. You
should also thank your hypothalamus for allowing

115
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,840
you to feel pleasure and reward. Rats implanted
with electrodes in the reward center of their

116
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:19,688
hypothalamuses and given ways to self stimulate
those areas will essentially reward themselves

117
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:25,430
until they collapse or die. So, use with caution.
The final part of the limbic system is the

118
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:30,038
hippocampus, central to learning and memory,
and if it's damaged, a person may lose their

119
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:32,038
ability to retain new facts and memories.

120
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:35,740
Now above all of this is the most advanced
stuff - the stuff that you think of when you

121
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,198
think of the brain - the grey matter. The
two hemispheres of your cerebrum make up about

122
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:44,500
eighty-five percent of your brain weight,
and oversee your ability to think, speak,

123
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,299
and perceive. The left and right hemispheres
govern and regulate different functions, giving

124
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:53,309
us a split brain, connected by a structure
called the corpus callosum. So, for instance,

125
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:56,929
language production is controlled largely
by the left hemisphere, while certain creative

126
00:08:56,929 --> 00:09:01,039
functions are controlled by the right. Though
this has nothing to do with handedness or

127
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,698
people having dominant sides of their brain
being more analytical or creative or whatever

128
00:09:05,698 --> 00:09:10,389
- that's part of what we call pop psychology:
a behavioral disorder in which journalists

129
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:14,750
and arm chair psychologists use research showing
beautiful, detailed, intimately connected

130
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:19,639
complexities of your brain to sell newspapers
or reinforce previously held beliefs.

131
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:24,370
Yes, some tasks are distributed to one side,
but the sides are deeply and constantly connected;

132
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,909
a statement as general as "artistic people
use their right brains" is as useless as saying

133
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:31,698
"artistic people have particularly bumpy heads".

134
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:35,620
Finally, covering the left and right hemispheres,
we have the cerebral cortex, a thin layer

135
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:40,778
of over twenty billion interconnected neurons.
But let's not forget the unsung heroes of

136
00:09:40,778 --> 00:09:45,429
your nervous system: the billions of non-neuron
glial cells, which provide a spider web of

137
00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:49,239
support that surround, insulate, and nourish
the cerebral neurons.

138
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,698
You've probably seen enough brain diagrams
to know that the cerebral cortex's left and

139
00:09:52,698 --> 00:09:58,198
right sides are subdivided into four lobes:
the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal,

140
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:03,179
all separated by especially prominent folds,
or fissures. Each lobe does indeed have its

141
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:06,258
own set of duties, and would have made Franz
Gall proud.

142
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:09,909
The frontal lobes, just behind your forehead,
are involved in speaking, planning, judging,

143
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:14,259
abstract thinking, and as the tale of Phineas
Gage reminds us, aspects of personality. The

144
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:18,720
parietal lobes receive and process your sense
of touch and body position. At the back of

145
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,740
your head, the occipital lobes receive information
related to sight. And the temporal lobes just

146
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,139
above your ears process sound, including speech
comprehension.

147
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:30,079
Remember that each hemisphere controls the
opposite side of the body, so my left temporal

148
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,689
lobe processes sounds heard through my right
ear. And within these lobes there are still

149
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,709
more regions that have specialized functions.
Your motor cortex at the rear of your frontal

150
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:41,989
lobes, for example, controls voluntary movements
and sends messages from the brain out to the

151
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,750
body like "pet that dog!" or "pick up that
mug", while your somatosensory cortex right

152
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:50,149
behind it processes incoming sensations like
"Oooooh, that doggie is soft!" or "Gah, the

153
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:50,860
mug is hot!"

154
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,669
The rest of your grey matter is made up of
association areas that are related to higher

155
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:58,969
mental functions like remembering, thinking,
learning, and speaking. But the thing about

156
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:03,860
association areas is that unlike your sensory
or motor cortex, you couldn't just poke one

157
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,778
and create a neat response. Association areas
are more subtle; they deal with things like

158
00:11:07,778 --> 00:11:12,208
interpreting and integrating sensory input
and linking up with memories. And they prevail

159
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:17,028
throughout all four lobes, so brain damage
to different areas will cause very different

160
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:17,409
results.

161
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:22,448
A lesion on a specific part of the temporal
lobe may destroy a person's ability to recognize

162
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:27,799
faces; traumatic memories or overactive hormones
can profoundly affect our behavior and emotions

163
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:32,599
- all of which remind us how fundamentally
biology and psychology are intertwined. And

164
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,889
there are few more fascinating examples of
this than how we sense and perceive the world

165
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:39,379
around us, so that's where we're gonna pick
up next week.

166
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:42,970
For now, if you were paying attention, you
learned the basics of the central nervous

167
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:48,649
system, specifically the brain, which can
be understood in terms of old or of more evolutionary

168
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:53,589
ancestral structures, along with the limbic
system, and new structures, which include

169
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:55,800
lobes, cortices, and association areas.

170
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,490
