1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,719
It's perhaps the most stigmatized and misunderstood
psychological disorder of them all, even among

2
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:09,239
psychologists. Maybe because it's pretty rare,
affecting about 1% of the population, schizophrenia

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:15,620
causes more anxiety in the media, in the public, and
even in doctors' offices than any other mental illness.

4
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:20,160
As a result, its sufferers have often been
shunned, abused, or locked up. And among the

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,198
many fallacies that surround the disorder
is simply what it means. The word "schizophrenia"

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,839
literally means "split mind" but contrary
to popular belief, the condition has nothing

7
00:00:29,838 --> 00:00:33,189
to do with a split in personality or multiple
personalities.

8
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:38,500
The term refers instead to what's sometimes
called a "split from reality." Multiple Personality

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,780
Disorder, now known as Dissociative Identity
Disorder, is a totally different type of condition,

10
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,420
a kind of dissociative disorder. And these
too, are shrouded in misconceptions, partly

11
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,030
because they were the subject of, probably,
the greatest psychological hoax of all time.

12
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,260
While many of us can relate on some level
to the emotional swings, nervousness, and

13
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:01,719
compulsions that come with mood and anxiety
disorders, it can be a lot harder for those

14
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:05,908
without direct experience to relate to the
symptoms of schizophrenia and dissociation.

15
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,549
Unfortunately we tend to fear and avoid what
we don't understand in each other, whether

16
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:14,009
it's a friend of family member or just some
stranger on the bus. But thankfully part of

17
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:18,340
the psychologist's job is to demystify the
things that can happen in our heads, and as is

18
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,920
often the case, understanding may be the key
to compassion.

19
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,859
Schizophrenia is a chronic condition that
usually surfaces for men in their early to

20
00:01:35,868 --> 00:01:40,450
mid-20s, and for women in their late 20s.
For some the disorder comes on gradually,

21
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:45,100
but for others it could arise more suddenly,
perhaps triggered by stress or trauma, although

22
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:47,718
no event can actually cause the disorder.

23
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:52,059
Once thought of as a single discrete condition,
schizophrenia is now included in the DSM-5

24
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,978
as a point on a spectrum of disorders that
vary in how they're expressed and how long

25
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,439
they last, but they share similar symptoms.

26
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,859
Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders are currently
thought of as characterized by disorganized

27
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:08,639
thinking; emotions and behaviors that are
often incongruent with their situations; and

28
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,989
disturbed perceptions, including delusions
and hallucinations.

29
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:16,140
They all involve a kind of loss of contact
with reality on some level. The resulting

30
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:20,689
behaviors and mental states associated with
this break from reality are generally called

31
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:23,919
"psychotic symptoms" and they usually impair
the ability to function.

32
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:28,750
When someone's experiencing psychotic symptoms,
their thinking and speech can become disorganized,

33
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,060
rambling and fragmented. This tendency to
pick up one train of thought and suddenly

34
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,670
switch to another and then another can make
communication painfully difficult.

35
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:41,780
People exhibiting these symptoms can also
suffer a breakdown in selective attention,

36
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,219
losing the ability to focus on one thing while
filtering others out.

37
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:49,650
In extreme cases, speech may become so fragmented
it becomes little more than a string of meaningless

38
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,780
words, a condition given a name that sounds
like its own kind of non sequitur, "word salad."

39
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,640
Classic schizophrenia is also often marked
by delusions or false beliefs not based in

40
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:04,419
reality. These delusions can be rooted in
ideas of grandeur like "I'm the queen of England!"

41
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:09,229
or "I won an Olympic gold medal for the luge!"
Or they can become narratives of persecution

42
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:13,149
and paranoia, believing your thoughts and
actions are being controlled by an outside

43
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,569
force or that you're being spied on or followed
or that you're on the verge of a major catastrophe.

44
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:22,049
And there are some complicated variations
on these delusions, like feeling that you've

45
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:28,189
died or don't exist anymore or that someone is madly in
love with you or that you're infested with parasites.

46
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:32,409
Delusions of one kind of another strike as
many as four out of five people with schizophrenia.

47
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:37,609
While some delusions can seem fairly logical,
they can also be severe and bizarre and frightening.

48
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,640
Unfortunately maybe the most memorable examples
of people suffering from severe delusions

49
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,159
come from serial killers and yeah, while Son
of Sam did claim that he was taking orders

50
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,490
from his neighbor's dog, that kind of stuff
is in the tiny, tiny, tiny minority.

51
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,890
Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys and Syd Barrett
of Pink Floyd both suffered psychotic symptoms.

52
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:58,059
And then of course there's John Nash, the
Nobel Prize winning American mathematician

53
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,210
and subject of the movie "A Beautiful Mind."

54
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,580
Through proper treatment, some people with
schizophrenia have not only learned to live

55
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,520
with their illness but also made fantastic
creative contributions to the world.

56
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,500
Maybe people with schizophrenia also suffer
from perceptual disturbances, or sensory experiences

57
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,430
that come without any apparent sensory stimulation,
like hallucinations. This is when a person

58
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:22,959
sees or hears something that isn't there, often lacking
the ability to understand what is real and what isn't.

59
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,159
Auditory hallucinations, or hearing voices,
are the most common form, and these voices

60
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,130
are often abusive. It's as if you're inner
monologue, that conversation that you have

61
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:34,420
with yourself or the random things that float
through your head, were somehow coming from

62
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,530
outside of you. It's as if you couldn't sort
out whether the voices in your mind were internal

63
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:41,319
and self-generated, or external and other-generated.

64
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,569
To me, it sounds terrifying.

65
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:48,540
Other common symptoms include disorganized,
abnormal, or incongruent behavior and emotions.

66
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,800
This could mean laughing when recalling a
loved one's death or crying while others are

67
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,759
laughing. Acting like a goofy child one minute, then
becoming unpredictably angry or agitated the next.

68
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,240
Movements may become inappropriate and compulsive,
like continually rocking back and forth or

69
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,189
remaining motionless for hours.

70
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:08,180
Broadly, most psychotic symptoms fall into
three general categories traditionally used

71
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:13,069
by psychologists: positive, negative, and
disorganized symptoms.

72
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:16,668
Positive symptoms are not what they sound
like. They're the type that add something

73
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:21,409
to the experience of the patient. Like, for
example, hallucinations or inappropriate laughter

74
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,389
or tears or delusional thoughts.

75
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:27,840
Negative symptoms refer to those that subtract
from normal behavior, like a reduced ability

76
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,829
to function, neglect of personal hygiene,
lack of emotion, toneless voice, expressionless

77
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:35,569
face, or withdrawal from family and friends.

78
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:40,418
Finally, disorganized symptoms are those jumbles
of thought or speech that could include word

79
00:05:40,418 --> 00:05:43,519
salad and other problems with attention and
organization.

80
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,029
Symptoms like these are useful in diagnosing
a disorder on the schizophrenia spectrum,

81
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:51,739
but there's a physiological component too.
Like many of the disorders we've talked about,

82
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,610
schizophrenia has been associated with a number
of brain abnormalities.

83
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,000
Post mortem research on schizophrenia patients
has found that many have extra receptors for

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,259
dopamine, a neurotransmitter involved in emotion
regulation and the brain's pleasure and reward centers.

85
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:08,859
Some researchers think that overly responsive
dopamine systems might magnify brain activity

86
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,639
in some way, perhaps creating hallucinations
and other so-called positive symptoms as the

87
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,160
brain loses its capacity to tell the difference
between internal and external stimuli.

88
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,570
For this reason, dopamine blocking drugs are
often used as anti-psychotic medications in

89
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:26,370
treatment. Modern neuroimaging studies also
show that some people with schizophrenia have

90
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,129
abnormal brain activity in several different
parts of the brain.

91
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:33,550
One study noted that when patients were hallucinating,
for example, there was unusually high activity

92
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,550
in the thalamus, which is involved in filtering
incoming sensory signals. Another study noted

93
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:43,040
that patients with paranoid symptoms showed
over-activity in the fear processing amygdala.

94
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,350
So, schizophrenia seems to involve not just
problems with one part of the brain, but abnormalities

95
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,750
in several areas and their interconnections.

96
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,290
But what might be causing these abnormalities?

97
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,280
Earlier I mentioned how a stressful event
might trigger psychotic symptoms for the first

98
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,330
time, even though it can't actually create
the disorder. Psychologists call this the

99
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:02,169
"diathesis-stress model."

100
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:05,539
This way of thinking involves a combination
of biological and genetic vulnerabilities

101
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:10,778
-- diathesis -- and environmental stressors
-- stress -- that both contribute to the onset

102
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:14,239
of schizophrenia. This model helps explain
why some people with genetic vulnerability

103
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,600
might not always develop schizophrenia and
why the rates of schizophrenia tend to be

104
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,030
higher with some degree of poverty or socioeconomic
stress.

105
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:26,109
And it seems too that there is some kind of
genetic predisposition for the disorder. The

106
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,189
one-in-a-hundred odds of developing schizophrenia
jumped to nearly one in ten if you have a

107
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:34,879
parent or sibling with the disorder, with
about 50/50 odds if that sibling is an identical

108
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,509
twin, even if those twins were raised apart.

109
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:42,939
One recent landmark seven year study looked
at genetic samples across 35 countries, examining

110
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:48,350
more than 35,000 people with schizophrenia,
and another 110,000 without the disorder.

111
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:53,090
The study identified more than 100 genes that
may increase the risk of schizophrenia. As

112
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:56,978
expected, some of these genes involve dopamine
regulation, but others are related to immune

113
00:07:56,978 --> 00:08:02,019
system functioning. Researchers continue to
tease out what is exactly going on here, but

114
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:05,459
many are hopeful that these new findings will
lead to better treatment.

115
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:10,258
Clearly, schizophrenia is a challenging disorder
to live with and one that's hard for outsiders

116
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:15,439
to understand, but maybe even more rare and
more elusive are the dissociative disorders.

117
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,389
These are disorders of consciousness, called
dissociative because they're marked by an

118
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:23,530
interruption in conscious awareness. Patients
can become separated from the thoughts or

119
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:27,939
feelings that they used to have, which can
result in a sudden loss of memory or even

120
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:29,228
change in identity.

121
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:33,819
Now, we might all experience minor dissociation
at times, like maybe the sense that you're

122
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,469
watching yourself from above, as in a movie,
or like you're driving home and get so zoned

123
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:42,169
out that suddenly you find yourself in front
of Taco Bell thinking, like, "How did I get here?"

124
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:46,278
Those things would generally fall into the
normal range of dissociation, but most of

125
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:48,580
us don't develop different personalities.

126
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,480
Dissociative disorders come in several different
forms, but the most infamous of the bunch

127
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,960
is probably Dissociative Identity Disorder.
This has long been known as Multiple Personality

128
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,879
Disorder and, yes, it is a thing. It's a rare
and flashy disorder in which a person exhibits

129
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:06,830
two or more distinct and alternating identities
and the best known case was that of Shirley

130
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:11,750
Mason, whose story was famously rendered in
the 1973 best seller "Sybil" and later in

131
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,169
a popular mini-series.

132
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:17,360
The book was marketed as the true story of
a woman who suffered great childhood trauma

133
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,190
and ended up with 16 different personalities,
ranging from Vicky, a selfish French Woman,

134
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,350
to handyman Syd, to the religious and critical
Clara.

135
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:31,690
The book became a craze and within a few years
reported cases of multiple personality skyrocketed

136
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,010
from scarcely 100 to nearly 40,000.

137
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:38,580
Many believe the book was essentially
responsible for creating a new psychiatric

138
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,960
diagnosis. It turns out though, Sybil's story
was a big fat lie.

139
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,860
Yes, Shirley Mason was a real person and one
with a troubled, traumatic past and a number

140
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,539
of psychological issues. As a student in New
York in the 1950s she started seeing a therapist

141
00:09:52,539 --> 00:09:56,909
named Connie Wilbur and taking some heavy
medications. And somewhere in there, maybe

142
00:09:56,909 --> 00:10:01,579
because she was coaxed, or maybe because she
wanted more attention, Shirley started expressing

143
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,680
different personalities.

144
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:07,929
Dr. Wilbur built a career and a book deal
out of her star patient, even after Shirley

145
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:10,539
confessed that her split personality was a
ruse.

146
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:15,169
The Sybil case is a powerful reminder that
we really don't understand dissociative disorders

147
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:20,299
very well or even know if they're always real.
Indeed, some people question if Dissociative

148
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:23,219
Identity Disorder is an actual disorder at
all.

149
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,240
But some studies have shown distinct body
and brain states that seem to appear in different

150
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,669
identities, things like one personality being
right handed while the other is left handed,

151
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:37,958
or different personalities having variations in their eye
sight that ophthalmologists could actually detect.

152
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:42,759
In these cases, dissociations of identity
may be in response to stress or anxiety, a

153
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,490
sort of extreme coping mechanism.

154
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,600
Either way, the debate and the research continue.

155
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,920
Today we talked about the major symptoms associated
with the schizophrenia spectrum disorders, including

156
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:56,549
disorganized thinking, inappropriate emotions
and behaviors, and disturbed perceptions.

157
00:10:56,549 --> 00:11:00,620
We also discussed brain activity associated
with these disorders and talked about their

158
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,360
possible origins including the diathesis stress
model.

159
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:10,320
You also learned about dissociative disorders,
and Dissociative Identity Disorder in particular,

160
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,360
and the scandal that was the Sybil case.

161
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,050
