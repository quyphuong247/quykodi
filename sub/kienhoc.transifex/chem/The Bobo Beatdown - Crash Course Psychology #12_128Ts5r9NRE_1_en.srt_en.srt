1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:04,940
It’s 1961. You’re wandering around Stanford
University, looking for a sandwich or something

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:09,719
when you happen to walk by a particular room
in a particular lab, and see something a little

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:16,719
unnerving. Namely, you find a woman punching
an inflatable clown named Bobo in the neck.

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:23,669
Over and over in its neck. This was the lab
of legendary psychologist Albert Bandura,

5
00:00:23,669 --> 00:00:28,528
and in 1961 he was studying one of the most
important phenomena in psychology.

6
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:34,409
See, while the woman was throttling that big
inflatable clown, there was a child watching

7
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:39,500
her. And after about ten minutes of observing
this clown-beating display, the kid was taken

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,899
to a room full of fun toys, which were soon
taken away, and then the frustrated kid was

9
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:50,119
left alone with Bobo, and Bandura watched
what happened. And yeah, what happened was

10
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:53,619
kind of scary. Kids who watched the woman
beating the clown were much more likely to

11
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:58,119
mimic her aggression -- kicking, punching,
throwing, even attempting to maul Bobo with

12
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:02,649
a hammer. But other children who saw an adult
playing nicely with the doll, or just ignoring

13
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:05,459
it, didn’t respond the same way in their
frustration.

14
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,579
Bandura’s results may seem predictable now,
but in those days, they challenged the dominant

15
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:13,759
behaviorist views that we talked about last
week -- the views that learning is solely

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,439
about conditioning and association, rewards
and punishments. Bandura’s research focused

17
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:22,739
on how learning can occur through observing
and imitating someone else’s behavior. And

18
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:27,560
if that seems obvious to you, you have Bandura
to thank for that. His research hastened the

19
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,250
evolution of 20th century experimental psychology
from pure behaviorism into what we now know

20
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,200
as social-cognitive learning. While it was
closely related to behaviorism, the social-cognitive

21
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,950
models added profoundly new dimensions to
what Skinner and Watson and Pavlov had observed

22
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,640
in our feathered and furry friends. In other
words, it showed us that -- just as there’s

23
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:51,920
more than one way to beat up a clown -- there’s
way more than one way to learn.

24
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,390
[INTRO]

25
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:02,140
Last week we talked about the differences
between classical and operant conditioning

26
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,049
in associative learning -- the kind of learning
that comes from connecting different events

27
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:10,079
and stimuli. In classical conditioning, this
means associating a stimulus with some kind

28
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:15,489
of involuntary response -- the whole dog slobbering
at the sound of a bell phenomenon -- whereas

29
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:20,539
operant conditioning makes associations between
stimulus and a voluntary behavior -- like

30
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:24,209
the rat pressing a lever to get delicious
snacks, or jumping out of a cage to escape

31
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:25,150
an electrical shock.

32
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,908
And that’s all well and good, but if learning
is the process of acquiring and retaining

33
00:02:28,908 --> 00:02:33,789
new behavior and information, then Bandura’s
experiments showed us that conditioning with

34
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:37,998
external rewards, punishments, or other stimuli
isn’t the only way to do it. It’s hard

35
00:02:37,998 --> 00:02:43,438
to deny that pretty much all animals are capable
of learning certain things by association,

36
00:02:43,438 --> 00:02:47,918
but critics of behaviorists like Pavlov, Watson,
and Skinner had a problem with their assertions

37
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,669
that, when it came to learning, it didn’t
matter much whether you’re training rats,

38
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:55,249
pigeons, or people--it’s all the same. Because,
lots of research has demonstrated that an

39
00:02:55,248 --> 00:02:58,688
animal’s capacity for conditioning is actually
limited by its biology.

40
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:03,748
Consider this scenario: Say I get a raging
case of food poisoning after eating my head-weight

41
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:08,489
in raw oysters with my friend Bernice. I’m
probably not going to want to touch oysters

42
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:13,980
again for a long, long time, because I associate
their smell and taste with the smell and taste

43
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:18,179
they made when I was — when they were coming
back out, is what I’m trying to say. But,

44
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,090
that doesn’t mean that the sight of Bernice,
or the sound of the sea shanties they were

45
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,348
playing at the restaurant would make me barf,
because humans are, by our very nature, more

46
00:03:25,348 --> 00:03:30,128
taste averse than we are sight or sound averse.
On the other hand, sight-oriented animals,

47
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:34,789
like birds, may be biologically predisposed
to avoid tainted food by sight, since that’s

48
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:38,558
how they hunt and forage. And presumably they
go to restaurants that play better music.

49
00:03:38,558 --> 00:03:42,188
Anyway, all of this tells us that species
can more easily learn associations that help

50
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:46,998
them thrive or survive, and that not all associations
are learned equally. It’s a lot easier to

51
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:51,039
teach a pigeon to peck an X on the ground
to obtain a food reward than it is get it

52
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,818
to flap its wings to get that same reward,
because pecking is a natural foraging behavior

53
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:59,158
for a pigeon. In the same way, it would be
much harder for the bird to learn to peck

54
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:03,578
that X to avoid a shock, rather than to flap
its wings to avoid the shock, because flying

55
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:06,338
away from danger is what pigeons naturally
do.

56
00:04:06,338 --> 00:04:10,479
Learned associations are even more complicated
in humans of course, because what we learn

57
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:15,188
doesn’t only influence our behavior, it
also shapes our attitudes. Our cognition -- that

58
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:20,038
is, our thoughts, perspectives, and expectations
-- is important for learning, as is our social

59
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:24,628
context, as Bandura figured out. So, Pavlov-style
conditioning experiments that ignore those

60
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:28,539
social-cognitive elements can really run into
trouble. For example, someone under treatment

61
00:04:28,538 --> 00:04:32,839
for an alcohol addiction may be given booze
laced with a nauseating drug. According to

62
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:37,369
the pure classical conditioning model, that
person would then equate booze with feeling

63
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:37,899
nasty.

64
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:42,120
But the brain can override this association
if it’s aware that it’s the added drug,

65
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,288
and not the alcohol, is the thing that’s
causing the illness. Sometimes we can think

66
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:51,050
our way out of intended associations. And
by the same token, a person’s social context

67
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:55,060
- like, their friends, family traditions,
or life stressors - can reinforce something

68
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,860
like alcohol consumption more than the nauseating
pill could ever punish it.

69
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,949
Plus, we also do a lot of latent learning,
like without even knowing it. Have you ever

70
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:07,009
been walking around a new city, someone stops
you to ask directions, and you surprise yourself

71
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:10,288
by actually being able to tell that tourist
how to get to the park? That’s because we’re

72
00:05:10,288 --> 00:05:14,579
constantly developing cognitive maps, or mental
representations of our surroundings, without

73
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:19,258
explicitly telling ourselves to do it. We’ve
all seen the experiments with in mazes: Well,

74
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,979
those show us that even rats develop these
cognitive maps, figuring out how to get around,

75
00:05:23,978 --> 00:05:28,008
even if there’s no reward at the end. And
days later, when they finally do get food

76
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:32,560
at the end of the maze, they quickly demonstrate
all that earlier latent learning by scuttling

77
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,728
through the maze as fast, or faster, than
rats that had been rewarded all along.

78
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:41,818
So, learning isn’t just about associating
a response with a consequence. There’s thinking

79
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:45,370
happening, too. And this kind of thinking
is also a big part of observational learning,

80
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,120
which is basically learning by watching other
people, or being influenced by them in other

81
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,240
ways. Because, you don’t need direct experience
to learn. You can just pick up stuff up through

82
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,439
modeling -- not like modeling on the catwalk,
I just mean observing and imitating specific

83
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:58,810
behaviors.

84
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,430
Rats, crows, pigeons, primates, and other
animals learn through imitation. Chimps learn

85
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:08,139
how to use sticks to fish ants out of a nest
this way. One study found rhesus macaques

86
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:13,228
were usually slow to make up after a fight
unless they grew up watching more forgiving

87
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:17,098
older macaques, in which case they tended
to make up more quickly. Of course we humans

88
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:21,949
learn A LOT from modeling -- I mean, most
of our popular culture is based on it: new

89
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:25,889
slang, skinny jeans, foodie trends, pixie
cuts -- they’re all racing around the globe

90
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:30,389
through observation and imitation. So it makes
a lot of sense that social observation shapes

91
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,918
behavior, especially in children.

92
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,399
Which brings us back to Bobo. Again, the fact
that we learn by imitating, even when we don’t

93
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,269
mean to, seems pretty intuitive, but until
Bandura’s famous experiment, it hadn’t

94
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:44,049
been studied in a scientific way. I mean,
these kids started abusing Bobo not just with

95
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:49,218
little toddler punches, but with hostile language
and even using things, like toy guns, that

96
00:06:49,218 --> 00:06:54,060
they previously had no interest in -- and
all because they saw aggressive modeling in

97
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,079
action. And since Bandura’s time, technology
has allowed us to peer even deeper into this

98
00:06:59,079 --> 00:06:59,680
dynamic.

99
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,280
Neuroimaging in humans, for instance, has
shown that when an individual watches someone

100
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:08,339
else, especially someone whom they relate
to, receive an award or score a goal or something,

101
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:12,918
their own brain’s reward systems light up
vicariously. Italian researchers found this

102
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:17,748
out pretty much by accident in the early 1990s:
They were studying signals from key regions

103
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:22,060
in a lab monkey’s brain that were associated
with planning and doing. Their brain-monitoring

104
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,468
device buzzed softly when the monkey did something
like pick up a piece of fruit and eat it.

105
00:07:26,468 --> 00:07:30,918
But one hot day, a researcher came back from
lunch licking an ice cream cone, and suddenly

106
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:36,060
heard the animal’s brain monitor buzz -- the
monkey was watching him, and his brain worked

107
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,538
as if it was actually doing the licking.

108
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:42,228
Many scientists suspect that this is the work
of a previously unknown type of brain cell

109
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:47,209
called mirror neurons, which fire when a subject
both performs an action, and when they observe

110
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:50,609
someone else doing it. Mirror neuron research
is still relatively new, and we’re still

111
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:55,468
figuring them out, but combined with Bandura’s
earlier work, it’s revealing a strong connection

112
00:07:55,468 --> 00:08:01,240
between observation, imitation, and learning.
So the takeaway here is: Models are important!

113
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,499
And not just Gisele and Antonio Sabato Junior.
You can, if you want, observe and imitate

114
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:11,240
them; I’m just saying that observational,
social learning starts really early, and parental

115
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,639
figures are powerful role models.

116
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:18,069
Positive, supportive, and loving models usually
prompt similar behavior in others, just as

117
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:22,259
negative, aggressive modeling can spark antisocial
effects. And, as we’ll talk about later,

118
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:27,319
what we see and feel and learn as children
is not easily displaced when we’re adults.

119
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:31,620
Literary giant George Bernard Shaw wrote,
“Imitation is not just the sincerest form

120
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,649
of flattery - it's the sincerest form of learning.”
And British statesman Lord Chesterfield once

121
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:41,350
said, “We are, in truth, more than half
what we are by imitation.” Even if these

122
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:45,820
ideas were only half-true, they’d still
be a powerful lesson on who you choose to

123
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,450
spend your time with, and how you choose to
act.

124
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,470
If you learned anything by watching me today,
hopefully it involved the limitations of classical

125
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,590
and operant conditioning, the basics of cognitive,
observational, and social learning, a look

126
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,610
at mirror neurons, and how to beat up a Bobo
doll.
