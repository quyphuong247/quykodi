1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,120
People have been having sex and writing songs
about it and carving statues of it and changing

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,570
fashion for it since the dawn of humanity,
but it wasn't until fairly recently in the

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,669
1940s that serious Western scientific study
of sex began. And by most accounts you can

4
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:17,530
thank one guy for that: Alfred Kinsey.

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:23,050
Kinsey was born in 1894 in New Jersey, to
poor strict Methodist parents. He studied

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,789
etymology in college, graduated with degrees
in biology and psychology before heading to

7
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:33,589
Harvard. His doctoral thesis was on the genealogy
of Gall wasps, a subject he tackled with intensity;

8
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,590
meticulously collecting over five million
samples, measuring hundreds of thousands of

9
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,180
specimens.

10
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:43,149
And wasps are interesting and everything,
but Kinsey's interests drifted toward human

11
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:49,289
sexuality and his research in Indiana University
paved the way for decades of study into sex.

12
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,320
He surveyed thousands of men and women about
their sexual habits and histories, and found

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,899
all sorts of interesting things related to
sexual preferences, masturbation, orgasms,

14
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,799
and pre-marital sex. He established the "Kinsey
scale" indicating degrees of sexual orientation)

15
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,548
and went on to write the seminal texts on
sexual behavior in the human male and female

16
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:08,650
respectively.

17
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,040
Like many researchers of human behavior, Kinsey
and his colleagues were - and in some ways

18
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,950
still are - pretty controversial. But he definitely
succeeded in two very important tasks. One:

19
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,500
he was an early adopter of a scientific approach
to studying sex, and two: he showed that the

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:29,030
popular perception of what people do and don't
do sexually, versus what people actually do

21
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,868
and feel, was often very different.

22
00:01:31,868 --> 00:01:36,379
Since then we've seen innumerable sex-related
studies examining the physiological and psychological

23
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:38,280
and social elements of sex.

24
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,250
And, there's a whole lot of lingering misinformation
and judging morality swirling around the subject

25
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:48,129
of sex. It can be a tricky topic for sure
but we are here to clear some things up. It's

26
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:55,129
the entire purpose of life so there's no reason
to blush.

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:04,489
So. Sex.

28
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:10,019
That one little word has complicated so many
lives. The desire for or lack of sex has spawned

29
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,790
poetry and made babies and transmitted diseases
and cost money and driven people batty and

30
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:17,179
kept late-night cable in business.

31
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,620
Even the word itself can mean many different
things.

32
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,000
First we've got the verb kind of sex, the
physical process of engaging in sexual acts

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,259
and intercourse, which, probably I don't need
to describe to you.

34
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:30,729
Then we've got the biological definition,
having to do with the anatomical parts that

35
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:35,689
go with the designations of male or female
or intersex - those who were born with the

36
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:38,859
reproductive parts that don't fall into the
predominant definitions of male or female.

37
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,420
And these are quite separate from gender,
or an individual's sense of identifying as

38
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:48,009
male or female or another gender identity
regardless of how that corresponds with their

39
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:52,399
actual reproductive plumbing. For transgender
people, for instance, gender identity typically

40
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,209
doesn't match biological sex.

41
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:58,659
And remember that gender identity is completely
different from sexual orientation, which we'll

42
00:02:58,659 --> 00:02:59,799
talk about in a minute.

43
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,580
So beyond definitions, we have the physiological
and psychological aspects of sex.

44
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,569
Let's start with the physiological, and with
that, Masters and Johnson.

45
00:03:08,568 --> 00:03:13,429
In the late 1950's and 60's, American gynecologists
Williams Masters, and his collaborator and

46
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:18,019
future wife, sexologist Virginia Johnson,
did something no researchers had ever done

47
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:23,989
before. They invited nearly 700 male and female
volunteers, many of them sex workers, to come

48
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:27,750
into their lab and get it on, either alone
or with their partners.

49
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,949
Their aim? To record the body's physiological
response to sex. This involved wearing a whole

50
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:38,459
lot of wires and heart monitors and such,
and is probably about as sexy as it sounds.

51
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,408
All the volunteers had to be willing and able
to show arousal and be capable of orgasm.

52
00:03:42,408 --> 00:03:47,939
And over the years, Masters and Johnson recorded
more than ten thousand "sexual cycles". The

53
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:52,719
main thing they documented was that a complete
sexual response cycle involved four distinct

54
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:58,919
stages - excitement, plateau, orgasm, and
resolution - which Masters and Johnson maintained

55
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,979
happened in a linear way, one after the other.

56
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:06,329
In the excitement phase, things are gettin'
goin', blood is rushing to all the necessary

57
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,830
places, genital areas are becoming engorged
and secreting lubricant. Next comes the plateau

58
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,080
phase. Pulse, blood pressure, and breathing
rates keep increasing and genitals are becoming

59
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:20,658
fully engorged. The penis is often secreting
pre-ejaculate as vaginal secretions increase

60
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:26,188
until the big event orgasm during which muscles
all over the body contract and breathing and

61
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:27,979
pulse rates hit their peak.

62
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:32,490
Of course, a biological male orgasm typically
releases sperm that may lead to fertilization,

63
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,579
depending on the situation, but female arousal
and orgasm also help facilitate conception,

64
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:41,848
again depending on the situation as those
muscle contractions and lubrication help draw

65
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,748
up and retain sperm in the uterus.

66
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:48,300
Finally, the body comes back down to its normal
state of affairs during the resolution phase.

67
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,759
It's during this phase that biosex males enter
a refractory period during which they're unable

68
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,669
to orgasm again for a few minutes to a day
or more whereas biological females refractory

69
00:04:57,668 --> 00:04:59,668
period is very short in comparison.

70
00:04:59,668 --> 00:05:04,109
While the four stage model of sexual response
is still taught today, some have criticized

71
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:09,059
both its rigid linear setup, arguing that
things don't always work so tidily in the

72
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:13,360
bedroom, and it's insistence in including
orgasm which doesn't happen for everyone all

73
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,800
the time. Others also question the model's
clinical focus on only physiological factors

74
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,889
arguing the cultural attitudes, psychological
and relationship factors, and other external

75
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:26,098
details should also be considered when looking
at sexual response.

76
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:30,139
I'll get back to that in a minute, but before
we move on to the psychology of sex, we got

77
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:31,119
to talk about hormones.

78
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:35,509
You remember hormones, those chemical messengers
brewed up by the endocrine system that travel

79
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:39,759
through the bloodstream and regulate all sorts
of physiological and behavioral activities

80
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,689
from growth to digestion to sleep to sex.

81
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:47,468
Our sex hormones serve two major purposes.
One, they direct the physical development

82
00:05:47,468 --> 00:05:52,528
of biological sex characteristics, and two,
they help activate sexual behavior.

83
00:05:52,528 --> 00:05:56,558
Estrogens like estradiol contribute to female
sex characteristics and are secreted in greater

84
00:05:56,559 --> 00:06:01,219
amounts by females than males and while all
humans make testosterone, it's the predominate

85
00:06:01,218 --> 00:06:05,899
sex hormone for males, stimulating the growth
and development of male sex characteristics.

86
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:11,149
Now most female mammals become sexually receptive
when their estrogens peak during ovulation,

87
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:15,968
but it doesn't really work that way for humans.
Our hormones are more loosely related to sexual

88
00:06:15,968 --> 00:06:20,748
behavior, although studies have found that
in general female's sexual desire spikes slightly

89
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:26,369
around ovulation, when woman are most fertile
and males can also be affected by this spike,

90
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:29,669
responding with higher levels of testosterone
when ovulating women are around.

91
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:35,068
But these short term changes hardly compare
to the larger more major hormonal shifts that

92
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:36,559
occur throughout a life time.

93
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:40,770
Puberty, for one, tends to get everyone a
lot more hot and bothered and interested in

94
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:46,278
dating and gazing at posters of their favorite
celebrity crushes and later in life, as sex

95
00:06:46,278 --> 00:06:50,610
hormone production normally decreases, our
amorous urges and endeavors tend to decrease

96
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,569
as well.

97
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:56,639
Age affects our libido. But in the end you
might think of sex hormones as fuel for your

98
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,009
sexual engine, and while an engine can't run
on a totally empty tank, it also won't run

99
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:06,800
any better or worse on a full tank versus
a half tank. We need our sex hormones, but

100
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,778
we also need the right psychological stimuli
to turn us on and keep us going sexually.

101
00:07:12,778 --> 00:07:18,019
So, finally, let's look at some of these psychological
aspects of sex. First, there are the very

102
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:23,088
important social and cultural influences.
Things like your families, your societies,

103
00:07:23,088 --> 00:07:27,240
your religions, and your personal values.
Does your community view sex merely as the

104
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,860
means for reproduction or can it be fun too?
What are the views on premarital sex, and

105
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,718
homosexuality, showing some skin or kissing
in public?

106
00:07:34,718 --> 00:07:38,968
Then there are the influences of external
stimuli. In western society, we're constantly

107
00:07:38,968 --> 00:07:44,748
bombarded with sexually charged content from
movies and TV to advertisements, R&B slow

108
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:49,439
jams, and Victoria Secret catalogs. And constantly
looking at images of things that you find

109
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,349
extremely attractive can lead to folks viewing
more average people, even their own partners,

110
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,610
as being less attractive.

111
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:01,038
But our sexual desire is also fueled by internal
stimuli. Our imagination and memories and

112
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,449
fantasies. According to plenty of studies,
at least 95% of people fantasize about sex

113
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:08,399
at some point. The thing you need to keep
in mind is that none of these factors work

114
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:13,149
independently of each other. How we respond
to both external and internal stimuli can

115
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:18,338
be really heavily influenced by social and
cultural factors, and that is where a lot

116
00:08:18,338 --> 00:08:22,709
of the thinking and studying of sex has gotten
really complicated.

117
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:27,610
Human judgment and morality is often entangled
with sex and desire and sadly, a lot of people

118
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:32,349
have been made to feel miserable for liking
certain things or being attracted to certain

119
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:36,289
people. There's also just been a lot of misinformation
out there. For ages, a lot of folks believed

120
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:41,809
that masturbation could make you go blind,
become mentally ill, or kill the neighborhood

121
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:43,559
kittens. It doesn't do that.

122
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:48,239
And as I know, you're thinking right now one
area of sexuality has been needlessly associated

123
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,519
with conflict, fear, and shame in many cultures
is sexual orientation.

124
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:56,310
For our purposes, sexual orientation can be
defined as a relatively enduring physical

125
00:08:56,309 --> 00:09:00,059
or romantic attraction to another person.
Heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual are

126
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:04,559
all types of sexual orientation. And although
the field once stigmatized non-heterosexual

127
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:10,159
orientations, we now know that homosexuality
and bisexuality are in no way related to mental

128
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:10,519
health.

129
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:14,149
Psychologists are also beginning to look more
in depth at other sexual orientations. For

130
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:19,850
instance, Asexuality or nonsexuality, where
no sexual attraction of any kind is experienced.

131
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:25,528
In any case, whether a culture itself is friendly
to or tyrannical against any of these orientations,

132
00:09:25,528 --> 00:09:30,519
all types prevail. Sexual orientation is neither
chosen nor changed.

133
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:34,730
So, what might cause these differences? Hopefully
you already know this but it's worth repeating.

134
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,909
There's no evidence that sexual orientation
is determined by things like dominating mother

135
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:43,899
or passive father or sex hormone levels in
your adult body or your history of childhood

136
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:47,690
abuse or whether your parents were gay or
straight. In other words, decades of research

137
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,310
have led most researchers to believed that
once you're born, there are no clear environmental

138
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:55,159
factors that influence your sexual orientation.

139
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:59,370
And there's been a lot of research into possible
biological components of sexual orientation,

140
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:04,990
like genetics, brain anatomy, prenatal conditions,
or other things. It's also important to know

141
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:09,669
that we're far from understanding sexual orientation
on a purely biological level. If anything,

142
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:13,708
the evidence we've got simply strengthens
the idea that sexual orientation isn't choice,

143
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:17,318
but rather a naturally varying occurrence
among human beings, like height.

144
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:17,669
So.

145
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:22,078
After all this talk about sex, perhaps you're
wondering why we do it at all. I mean, it

146
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:27,028
feels good obviously. But the biggest function
of sex goes beyond pure pleasure. In fact,

147
00:10:27,028 --> 00:10:31,438
sexual intimacy serves many of life's most
basic purposes: some times procreation, but

148
00:10:31,438 --> 00:10:36,250
also stress reduction, maintaining healthy
relationships, social bonding, and the expression

149
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,879
of love, and overall fulfillment.

150
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:42,420
People say he brain is the most significant
sex organ for a reason. And intimacy is often

151
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:43,458
its own reward.

152
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:47,609
Today, you learned about Alfred Kinsey's ground
breaking sex surveys, the differences between

153
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:52,829
how we define biological sex and gender identity,
and about Masters and Johnson's four-part
