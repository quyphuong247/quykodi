1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,740
I can be smooth and charming and slick. I
can make a very confident impression and

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,780
it's hard to leave me at a loss for words.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,120
Sometimes I find myself fantasizing about
unlimited success and power, and beauty.

4
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:16,390
I have repeatedly used deceit to cheat, con,
or defraud others for my personal gain. To

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,399
be honest, I don't have much concern for the
feelings of other people, or their suffering.

6
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:22,689
Doesn't sound like the Hank you know, does
it?

7
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,399
These are all statements from the Self-Assessment
measure for Personality Disorders, that lets

8
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:31,199
patients describe themselves, ranking each statement
in terms of how accurate they think it is.

9
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,100
To be honest, you can't rely too much on this
kind of self-reporting to assess what we are

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,500
talking about today because while some people
who are over-confident or obsessed with power

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,579
or downright deceitful might tell you that
they are, there is a certain subset that won't.

12
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,670
Many of the disorders that we have talked
about so far are considered, "ego-dystonic"

13
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:52,899
meaning that people who have them are aware
that they have a problem and tend to be

14
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:54,339
distressed by their symptoms.

15
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,020
Like a person with Bipolar Disorder or OCD
generally knows that they have a psychological

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,430
condition and they don't like what it does
to them.

17
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:05,109
But some disorders are trickier then that.
They are "ego-syntonic," the person experiencing

18
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:09,489
them doesn't necessarily think that they have
a problem and sometimes, they think the problem

19
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:10,649
is with everyone else.

20
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,400
Personality disorders fall into this category.
These are psychological disorders marked by

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,640
inflexible, disruptive, and enduring behavior
patterns that impair social and other functioning

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,299
-- whether the sufferer recognizes that or not.

23
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:26,710
Unlike many other conditions that we've talked
about, personality disorders are often considered

24
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:31,129
to be chronic and enduring syndromes that
create noticeable problems in life.

25
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:34,039
And as you can tell from these self assessment
statements, they can range from relatively

26
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,549
harmless displays of narcissism, to a true
and troubling lack of empathy for other people.

27
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,220
Not only can personality disorders be difficult
to diagnose and understand, they can also

28
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:46,899
be downright scary. Most of the extreme and
severe disorders go by names that you probably

29
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:54,019
recognize: psychopathy and sociopathy. I'm talking,
like, serial killers here, mob bosses, Vlad the Impaler.

30
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,560
Cultures have been studying human personality
characteristics for thousands of years, but

31
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:11,799
the concept of personality disorders is a
much newer idea.

32
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,569
Much of our modern classifications of these
disorders are based on the work of German

33
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:19,369
psychiatrist, Kurt Schneider, who was one
of the earliest researchers into what was

34
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,140
then known as psychopathy and published a
treatise on the study in 1923.

35
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:29,729
Today, the DSM 5 contains ten distinct personality
disorder diagnoses, grouped into three clusters.

36
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:34,929
The first cluster, cluster A, includes what
are often labeled simply as "odd" or "eccentric"

37
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,019
personality characteristics. For example,
someone with paranoid personality disorder

38
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:43,730
may feel a pervasive distrust of others and
be constantly guarded and suspicious while

39
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:47,949
a person with a schizoid personality disorder
would seem overly aloof and indifferent, showing

40
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:50,939
no interest in relationships and few emotional
responses.

41
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:56,098
Cluster B encompasses dramatic emotional or
impulsive personality characteristics. For

42
00:02:56,098 --> 00:03:00,399
example, a narcissistic personality can display
a selfish grandiose sense of self-importance

43
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,379
and entitlement. Meanwhile, a histrionic personality
might seem like they're acting a part to get

44
00:03:05,378 --> 00:03:10,239
attention, even putting themselves at risk
with dramatic, dangerous, and even suicidal

45
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,480
gestures. The behavior of Cluster B can be
truly self-destructive and frightening, and

46
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,179
these disorders are often associated with
frequent hospitalization.

47
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,950
Finally, Cluster C encompasses anxious, fearful,
or avoidant personality traits. For example,

48
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:25,810
those with avoidant and dependent personality
disorders often avoid meeting new people or

49
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,158
taking risks and show a lack of confidence,
an excessive need to be taken care of, and

50
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:34,150
a tremendous fear of being abandoned. Now,
in the past, and, to a great extent, today,

51
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,459
some of these categories have been controversial.
Many researchers argue that some of these

52
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:41,998
conditions overlap with each other so much
that it can be impossible to tease them apart.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,099
Narcissistic personality disorder, for example,
has many traits that resemble histrionic personality

54
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:50,840
disorder. And because of this gray area, the
most commonly diagnosed personality disorder

55
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,110
is actually personality disorder not otherwise
specified or PDNOS. The prevalence of this

56
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,640
diagnosis suggests that while clinicians can
identify a personality disorder in a patient,

57
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,899
figuring out the details of the condition
can be messy and difficult.

58
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,870
One proposed alternative for diagnosing these
disorders is the Dimensional Model, which,

59
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,870
in essence, gets rid of discrete disorders
and replaces them with a range of personality

60
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,108
traits or symptoms, rating each person on
each dimension. So the Dimensional Model would

61
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:22,029
assess a patient not with the aim of diagnosing
one disorder or another, but instead, simply

62
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:26,679
finding out that they rank high on say, narcissism
and avoidance. It's a work in progress, so

63
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,000
with another generation, the clinical definition of
"personality disorder" may evolve pretty radically.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,779
One of the best-studied personality disorders
right now is Borderline Personality Disorder,

65
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:40,329
or BPD. Borderline makes it sounds like patients
are like, pretty close to being healthy, but

66
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:45,889
not quite, but that is not at all the case.
BPD sufferers have often learned to use dysfunctional,

67
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:50,810
unhealthy ways to get their basic psychological
needs met, like love and validation, by using

68
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,550
things like outbursts of rage, or on the other
end of the spectrum, self-injury behaviors

69
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:01,150
like cutting or worse. People with BPD were
once commonly maligned by clinicians as 'difficult'

70
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:06,429
or 'attention-seeking', but we now understand
BPD as a complicated set of learned behaviors

71
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:11,050
and emotional responses to traumatic or neglectful
environments, particularly in childhood. In

72
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,520
a sense, people with this disorder learn that
rage or self-harm helped them cope with traumatic

73
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:20,439
situations, but as a result, they also end
up using them in non-traumatic situations.

74
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:24,680
Although challenging for patients and clinicians
alike, the good news is that some psychotherapies

75
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:28,870
have helped even the most severely suffering,
repeatedly hospitalized BPD patients.

76
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,399
But probably the most famous well-established,
and frankly, troubling personality disorder

77
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:37,979
is Antisocial Personality Disorder. Now, you've heard
of this before, but maybe by one of its now

78
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:43,319
somewhat out of vogue synonyms, "psychopathy"
or "sociopathy." People with Antisocial Personality

79
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,659
Disorder, usually men, exhibit a lack of conscience
for wrongdoing, even towards friends and family

80
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,490
members. Their destructive behavior surfaces
in childhood or adolescence, beginning with

81
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,829
excessive lying, fighting, stealing, violence,
or manipulation. As adults, people with this

82
00:05:56,829 --> 00:06:01,068
disorder are thought to generally end up in
one of two situations: either they are unable

83
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:05,819
to keep a job and engage in violent criminal
or similarly dysfunctional behavior; or they

84
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:11,180
become clever, charming con-artists, or ruthless
executives who make their way to positions

85
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,449
of power. Tony Soprano would have qualified
for a diagnosis, even if he wasn't nearly

86
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:20,300
as bad as, say, serial killer Ted Bundy or
Vlad the Impaler, the infamous 15th century

87
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,430
Romanian prince who personally watched about
100,000 people get impaled or have the skin

88
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,810
of their feet licked off by goats.

89
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,839
Yeah. That happened.

90
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,179
Despite this classic remorselessness, lack
of empathy, and sometimes criminal behavior,

91
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,918
criminality is not always a component of antisocial
behavior. Certainly many people with criminal

92
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:44,258
records don't fit that psychopathic profile.
Most show remorse, love, and concern for friends

93
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:48,710
and family. But still, although anti-social
personalities make up just about 1% of the

94
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:54,038
general population, they were estimated in one study
to constitute about 16% of the incarcerated population.

95
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:58,769
So, how might someone end up with such a disturbing
disorder? Well, as you might expect, the causes

96
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:04,229
are probably a tangled combination of biological and
psychological threads, both genetic and environmental.

97
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:08,500
Although no one has found a single genetic
predictor of Antisocial Personality Disorder,

98
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:13,300
twin and adoption studies do show that relatives
of those with psychopathic features do have

99
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,610
a higher likelihood of engaging in psychopathic
behavior themselves. And early signs are sometimes

100
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:22,848
detected as young as age three or four, often
as an impairment in fear conditioning, in

101
00:07:22,848 --> 00:07:26,949
other words, lower than normal response to
things that typically startle or frighten

102
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:30,669
children like loud and unpleasant noises.
Most kids only need to get burned by a hot

103
00:07:30,668 --> 00:07:34,379
dish once to know to stay away, but kids who
end up displaying Antisocial Personalities

104
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:39,100
as adults don't necessarily connect or care about
the learned consequences when they're little.

105
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,560
From there, like we've seen in other disorders,
genetic and biological influences can intersect

106
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:48,080
with an abusive or neglectful environment
to help wire the personality in a peculiar

107
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,389
and damaged way. While the vast majority of
traumatized people don't grow up to be killers

108
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:57,980
or con-artists, genes do seem to predispose some
people to be more sensitive to abuse or trauma.

109
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,580
Meanwhile, studies exploring the neural basis
of Antisocial Disorder have revealed that

110
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:06,568
when shown evocative photographs, like a child
being hit or a woman with a knife at her throat,

111
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:11,539
those with psychopathic personality features
showed little change in heart rate and perspiration,

112
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:12,829
as compared to control groups.

113
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:16,918
And the classic antisocial lack of impulse
control and other symptoms have also been

114
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:21,049
linked to deficits in certain brain structures.
One study compared PET scans from 41 people

115
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,699
convicted of murder to those of non-criminals
and found that the convicted killers had greatly

116
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:30,220
reduced activity in the frontal lobe, an area
associated with impulse control and keeping

117
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:35,240
aggressive behavior in check. In fact, violent
repeat offenders had as much as 11% less frontal

118
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,330
lobe tissue than the average brain. Their
brains also responded less to facial displays

119
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:43,908
of stress or anguish, something that's also
observed in childhood, so it's possible that

120
00:08:43,908 --> 00:08:48,480
some antisocial personalities lack empathy
because they simply don't or can't register

121
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,289
others' feelings. Research has also suggested
an overly reactive dopamine reward system,

122
00:08:53,289 --> 00:08:57,269
suggesting that the drive to act on an impulse
to gain stimulation or short-term rewards

123
00:08:57,269 --> 00:09:01,139
regardless of the consequences may be more
intense than the average person's.

124
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:06,000
As we mentioned before, because personality
disorders are pretty much egosyntonic by definition,

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,480
people don't often acknowledge that they have
a problem or a need for treatment - and in

126
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,470
the case of Antisocial Personality Disorder,
even if they did, there aren't many specific

127
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,830
treatments available, at least not for adults.

128
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:21,259
But there are some promising interventions
for kids and adolescents whose minds and brains

129
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:25,120
are more plastic and adaptable. In this way,
the best way to treat Antisocial Personality

130
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,940
Disorder may be in trying to prevent it. According
to American psychiatrist Donald W. Black,

131
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,040
among others, many kids diagnosed with Conduct
Disorder, the diagnostic precursor to Antisocial

132
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,559
Disorder, are at high-risk for developing
Antisocial Personalities as adults. But by

133
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:44,329
identifying warning signs early on and by
working with these kids and families to correct

134
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:48,670
their behavior and remove negative influences,
some of that impulse fearlessness could be

135
00:09:48,669 --> 00:09:52,759
channeled into healthier directions, like
to reward promoting athleticism, or a spirit

136
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,169
of adventure. It's important to remember that
Antisocial Personality Disorder is only one

137
00:09:56,169 --> 00:10:00,769
type of personality disorder. This is a diverse
family of psychological conditions determined

138
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:06,110
by many different factors and we're still
in the early stages of diagnosing and understanding

139
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,600
the mechanisms behind them.

140
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,459
Today, you learned about personality disorders
and the difference between ego-dystonic and

141
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:15,489
ego-syntonic disorders. We looked at the three
clusters of personality disorder, according

142
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:20,379
to the DSM V, and how personality disorder
symptoms often overlap. We also took a look

143
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:25,919
at Borderline and Antisocial Personality Disorders,
including their potential bio-psycho-social roots.
