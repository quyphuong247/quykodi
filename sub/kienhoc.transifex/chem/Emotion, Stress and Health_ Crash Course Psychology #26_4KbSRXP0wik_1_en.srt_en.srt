1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,899
Did you know that astronauts in space

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,200
have a hard time communicating without words

3
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:05,099
because their weightless bodily fluids make

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,300
their faces all puffy and hard to read?

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,000
Have you heard that Botox can actually

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,500
improve your mood, and not by smoothing wrinkles but 

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,500
actually by easing depression?

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,599
Or that this "come here" gesture is

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,199
common in the US but is considered so rude in the 

10
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,500
Philippines that it could actually get you arrested.

11
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,500
Yeah. All true!

12
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,500
Emotions and the ways we express them

13
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,500
are strange and powerful things.

14
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,500
And emotions aren't just ephemeral psychological 

15
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,500
phenomena, they affect our bodies and our health.

16
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,000
Because so many emotions have a certain

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,500
contagious quality, our feelings and the behaviors

18
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,500
they drive also affect the minds, and bodies,

19
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,500
and health of those around us.

20
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,500
This is true whether your emotions of the moment

21
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,170
are of the feel-good variety.

22
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,500
Or not.

23
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,399
The powers of both positivity and negativity are

24
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:47,000
stronger than you may know.

25
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:48,500
Lots of studies have shown that people with a positive

26
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,000
outlook on life tend to live longer, more fulfilling lives

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,500
than their mean and grumpy neighbors.

28
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,500
Fear, anger, and other more difficult emotions

29
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,500
and how we handle them are pretty closely

30
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,500
related to this thing called stress.

31
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:02,500
And stress is so powerful that it can straight up kill you

32
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,000
in any number of ways, given the right opportunity.

33
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,500
For better or worse we spend a lot of our lives

34
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,500
swirling around like leaves on the winds of

35
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,000
competing emotions. Before we can hope to harness

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,500
these feelings, we first have to understand them. 

37
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:25,299
[Intro]

38
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:27,000
What do you think this person is feeling? 

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
How about him?

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,799
And her?

41
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,500
What about this one?

42
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,000
It's not really hard to tell, is it?

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,500
Most of us are better than we think at

44
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,500
reading non-verbal cues and subtle expressions.

45
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
The understanding among some, but not all, 

46
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,500
psychologists, like emotion expert Paul Ekman,

47
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,500
is that facial expressions are culturally universal.

48
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,500
So a Greek, Britain, American, Samoan, or Nigerian 

49
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,500
would all be able to discern the same basic emotions;

50
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,500
happiness, sadness, disgust, anger, fear, and surprise,

51
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,500
just by looking at your face.

52
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
And our expressions don't just communicate emotions.

53
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,500
According to the Facial Feedback Hypothesis,

54
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,000
they can help regulate our emotions, too.

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,319
The act of smiling broadly, even if you aren't happy,

56
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:06,500
can actually lift your mood just as scowling can lower it.

57
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,500
This is how, bizarrely enough, a recent randomized 

58
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,000
controlled clinical trial suggested that a little Botox 

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
injection in the forehead might actually lessen

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,800
depression.

61
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,500
'Cause it's apparently hard to feel down if your

62
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,000
frowny muscles are frozen.

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Of course whether your face is paralyzed or not, some

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,500
people are better at reading your emotions than others.

65
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,000
For example, introverts are usually better at interpreting

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,500
people's feelings, while extroverts are often better at

67
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,500
expressing them.

68
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
And you've probably heard embarrassing stories or even

69
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,000
experienced first-hand how different cultures express 

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,500
emotions through particular gestures that are far from universal.

71
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,000
For example, in the United States, this is a peace sign,

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
but you don't want to flip it around in the UK.

73
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,500
And the iconic thumbs up gesture means "good job" in

74
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
many cultures, but if you toss that thumb around in 

75
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Greece, well let's just say you won't make any new 

76
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,000
friends.

77
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,694
But of course emotions involve a lot more than making faces

78
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:54,694
and hand gestures, they're also about our

79
00:02:54,694 --> 00:02:57,500
conscious experience of what we're feeling.

80
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,000
So how do we actually feel all these feels, and how

81
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
many different emotions are there?

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Back in the 1970s, American psychologist Carol Izard

83
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,500
identified ten distinct basic human emotions present

84
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,000
from infancy on. 

85
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
They are: joy, surprise, sadness,  anger, disgust, 

86
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
contempt, shame, fear, guilt, and interest or excitement.

87
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Others have since suggested that "pride" should be

88
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,500
added to that list, and still others believe that love should 

89
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,000
be classified as a basic emotion as well, but Izard has

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
argued that these and other emotions are just familiar

91
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
combinations of the classic ten.

92
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Today, some psychologists describe our emotional 

93
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,400
experience as using a 2-dimensional model.

94
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,500
The idea there is that any of the emotions you might feel

95
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,500
while, like, reading Harry Potter or something are 

96
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,500
expressed on a spectrum, and as a combination of

97
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
valence, roughly speaking "good" or "bad", and 

98
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,500
arousal--excited or not excited, basically.

99
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,000
So if you're feeling both really excited and super 

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,500
positive when Harry finally bested Voldemort, 

101
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,500
you could say you were elated. On the other hand,

102
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
if you're at that part in Deathly Hallows when Harry, Ron

103
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,000
and Hermoine are just sort of wandering around on the 

104
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,500
lam in a heavy mood, maybe your emotions fell more on

105
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,000
the opposite side of the spectrum.

106
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
In this instance, feeling depressed might be a 

107
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
combination of negative emotion and lack of excitement.

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,500
So potentially every emotion can fall in degrees on this 

109
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,000
2-dimensional scale. Like being terrified means you're

110
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,500
more frightened than if you're just scared, just as being 

111
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,500
enraged is a more extreme form of anger than simply

112
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,000
being mad. These polarities--positive versus negative, 

113
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
high arousal versus low arousal--affect our psychological 

114
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
states, and therefore our bodies as well. Because, you'll

115
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
remember that what is psychological is ultimately 

116
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
biological. And when it comes to the physical effects of 

117
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
our emotions, it pretty much goes the way you might

118
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
expect. Happiness is helpful while chronic anger or 

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,500
depression makes us vulnerable to all kinds of problems

120
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,800
with health and well-being. The good news is that if

121
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,000
we're angry or sad, we often over-estimate the duration

122
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,500
of our bad moods and under-estimate our capacity

123
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
to adapt and bounce back from traumas, 

124
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,500
even if things feel hopeless, depressing, or stressful

125
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,199
in the thick of it.

126
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,000
And we've all experienced stress before, sometimes on 

127
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
a daily or even hourly basis. Much like anger or joy, 

128
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
stress can slowly build and simmer, or it can

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
strike suddenly and with great intensity.

130
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And yeah, stress, certainly the chronic or extreme type

131
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,500
can be bad for your health, but defining stress

132
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,000
is trickier than you might think.

133
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,500
Psychologists would define stress as the process by

134
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
which we perceive and respond to certain events, or

135
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,500
stressors, that we view as challenging or threatening.

136
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,500
In other words, stress isn't technically an emotion, it's

137
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,000
more of a reaction to a disturbing or disruptive stimulus.

138
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And our reactions stem in part from our appraisal of that

139
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
stimulus. A person can either roll with, or get worked up

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,500
about a missed flight, an increased workload, or a 

141
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,000
strange thump in the house. These external stressors

142
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
typically fall into three main categories: catastrophes, or

143
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,500
unpredictable large scale events like war, natural

144
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,500
disasters and terrorist attacks; significant life changes,

145
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,000
things like moving, having a child,  losing or getting a

146
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
job, or the death of a loved on; and then just everyday

147
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
inconveniences like getting caught in traffic, running

148
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
late, or feuding with your roommates.

149
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,500
Any of these stressful events, big or small, even the 

150
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
good things, can fire up your sympathetic nervous

151
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,000
system and trigger that old fight or flight response.

152
00:06:01,048 --> 00:06:03,048
In this way, it's important to understand that stress

153
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:06,000
is ultimately natural. You experience it for a reason

154
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,500
and a bit of short-lived stress can actually be a good

155
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,000
thing. It can make you active and alert when you need to 

156
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,500
be, like an upcoming chemistry test might be stressing

157
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,000
you out, but that might help you find focus so you can

158
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,399
dominate that thing. And in your body, moderate stress

159
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,500
can kick the immune system into action to do things

160
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,300
like heal wounds, and fight infections. It does this by

161
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,500
triggering the release of stress hormones like

162
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,000
adrenaline and cortisol. These chemical messengers 

163
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
are what get your organ systems to respond the way

164
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
you need them to when you're getting charged by a

165
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
bear, or focusing really hard on the gas law

166
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
for your chemistry test. But to also why chronic stress

167
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,500
can really wreck a body and mind, research has shown

168
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,000
that abused children have a high risk of chronic disease

169
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,500
and people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, 

170
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,000
PTSD, which we'll talk about in an upcoming episode,

171
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
experience higher rates of digestive, respiratory,

172
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
circulatory, and infectious diseases. A lot of these

173
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
negative connections between your body's systems

174
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,500
have to do with the fact that many of its most basic

175
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,000
functions, like blood pressure, breathing, body

176
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,500
temperature, digestion, and heartbeat, are in part

177
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,000
regulated by the autonomic nervous system.

178
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:08,000
We've talked before about how the sympathetic side

179
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:11,000
of that system cranks you up, and the parasympathetic

180
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
arm calms you down, but both those systems also

181
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,500
interact with the so-called "brain-in-the-gut", the enteric

182
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,000
nervous system, which helps regulate gastrointestional

183
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
functioning. And it's this brain-gut connection that

184
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
explains how stress causes digestive problems,

185
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,500
because when that werewolf pops out of the bushes

186
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,500
and a wave of cortisol washes through you, your body

187
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
wants to focus its energy on sending blood to your

188
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,000
muscles so that you can react quickly.

189
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Which is good, right?

190
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But it may do that partly by shutting down digestion

191
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
or decreasing the amount of digestive secretions

192
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and making your colon spasm; an anxious mind can

193
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
lead to an anxious gut. Stress is an even bigger risk

194
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
factor in North America's leading cause of death:

195
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
heart disease, because it contributes to increased blood

196
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,500
pressure, heart rate, and cholesterol levels in a number

197
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,000
of different ways. Essentially, when your stressed out

198
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
nervous system is redirecting all of its energy sources to

199
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
your muscles and brain, it pulls flow away from your

200
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
other organs. And one of those organs is the liver,

201
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,500
whose job includes removing the fat and cholesterol

202
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,500
from your blood. So basically, when a stressed liver

203
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,000
can't filter properly, that extra fat and cholesterol 

204
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,500
ends up circulating in your blood, which can settle

205
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
around the heart.

206
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,000
Don't believe me?

207
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,500
One study monitored the blood cholesterol and clotting

208
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,000
speed of 40 male tax accountants throughout the year,

209
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and it found that their cholesterol and clotting rates, and

210
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,500
thus risk of heart attacks, increased dramatically during

211
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,579
the weeks before tax day as they stressed out about

212
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:30,500
finishing their work.

213
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
And physiologically speaking, it's worth pointing out that

214
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,000
some close relatives to stress, when it comes to their

215
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,500
effects on the body, are pessimism and depression, 

216
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,000
which also have been linked to stress and heart

217
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
disease. Many types of studies have found that people

218
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
characterized by their optimism, happiness, love, and

219
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
positive feelings often live significantly longer than their

220
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
grumpy, dour counterparts. Researchers

221
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
don't quite know exactly how chronic negative emotional

222
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
states influence health, but it may be some combination

223
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
of lifestyle or behavioral factors, like neglecting your

224
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,500
health, or not taking your heart meds when you're

225
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,000
feeling blue, or social factors like the way the depression 

226
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
can be isolating and thus prevent others from helping

227
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
you out. Or biological factors, like increases in certain

228
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
kinds of inflammatory proteins released by the immune

229
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
system in response to stress and sadness. 

230
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So in the end, while stress may not directly cause 

231
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
disease, you could say that the two walk hand-in-hand.

232
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,500
In that way, it isn't a stretch to say that chronic stress

233
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,000
can kill, so go ahead

234
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,500
take a deep breath, 

235
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
feel your emotions,

236
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,000
appreciate them,

237
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,500
but don't let them run your life.

238
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
Today, we talked more about how our emotions work

239
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
and how we use facial expressions to help us

240
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,000
communicate. We also looked at the 2-dimensional

241
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
model of emotional experience and how anger, 

242
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
happiness, and depression can affect our health. 

243
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We also discussed what stress does to your nervous

244
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
system and how chronic stress can damage the

245
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,500
functioning of your biological systems.
