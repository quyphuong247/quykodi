1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:06,169
Every rose has it’s thorn, only the good
die young, slow and steady wins the race,

2
00:00:06,168 --> 00:00:08,099
and what you see is what you get.

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,869
Except that in reality several varieties of
roses do not have thorns, both the good and

4
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:18,519
the bad, on occasion, tragically die young,
fast and steady beats slow and steady every

5
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,679
time, and what you see is…well…

6
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:27,800
Our perception, or how we order the cacophonous
chaos of our environment, is heavily influenced

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,710
-- biased, even -- by our own expectations,
experiences, moods, and even cultural norms.

8
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,120
And we can be pretty good at fooling ourselves.
In the last two lessons we’ve learned how

9
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:44,209
we see shapes and colors, hear sounds, and
smell and taste the world’s chemical concoctions.

10
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,210
But our senses mean little without our brain’s
ability to organize and translate that data

11
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,499
into meaningful perceptions.

12
00:00:51,499 --> 00:00:55,728
Without perception, your mother’s face is
just a combination of shapes. Without the

13
00:00:55,728 --> 00:01:00,138
ability to interpret scent, we couldn’t
differentiate the smell of toast from a grease

14
00:01:00,139 --> 00:01:02,359
fire.
Our perception is the process that allows

15
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,659
us to make meaning out of our senses, and
experience the world around us.

16
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,460
It’s what makes life understandable, but
also it means that, sometimes, what you see

17
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:18,459
is not actually what you get.
So that was awesome, right? Upside down, I

18
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:29,328
look like me; right side up, I looked like
some kind of terrifying monster. Your brain

19
00:01:29,328 --> 00:01:32,938
isn’t used to upside-down faces, so it’s
basically just doing its best to put the pieces

20
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:37,608
together. But it knows exactly what a right-side
up face should look like, AND THAT IS NOT

21
00:01:37,608 --> 00:01:43,618
IT! Just one of thousands of examples proving
that your brain does all the work of perception

22
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:48,659
and your eyes, really, are just feeding raw
data. It’s IMPORTANT data, but it isn’t

23
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,939
actually what we see. What we see is the realm
of the mind, not the eye.

24
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:58,898
What kind of bird do you see? A duck, right?
But if I said what kind of mammal do you see,

25
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:03,030
a bunny probably would have popped out at
you. Now you should be seeing both of them

26
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,259
popping back and forth, but likely your brain
wants to perceive the image related to whichever

27
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,860
cue you first heard, or whichever image is
more familiar to you. By cueing “mammal”

28
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:17,600
or “bird,” I influenced your expectations,
and you saw what I wanted you to see. Pretty

29
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,639
cool.
Your expectations are just one factor in your

30
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,659
perceptual set. - The psychological factors
that determine how you perceive your environment.

31
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:31,079
Sometimes seeing is believing, but perceptual
set theory teaches us that believing is also

32
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,790
seeing.

33
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:35,519
Context is another factor in your perceptual
set. If the duck-bunny thing was pictured

34
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,930
with Easter eggs all around it, you’d think
bunny right away. Which is kinda weird, considering

35
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,040
that of ducks and bunnies, one is actually
much more likely to be near an egg. It’s

36
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:45,780
not the bunny.

37
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,939
And that’s an example of how culture is
also an important part of our perceptual set.

38
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:53,710
As much as our perceptions are affected by
context and expectations, they’re also swayed

39
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:58,790
by our emotions and motivations. People will
say a hill is more steep if they’re listening

40
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:02,370
to Emo by themselves, than if they’re listening
to power-pop and walking with a friend.

41
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,280
Most of the time, your personal perceptual
set leads you to reasonable conclusions. But

42
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,919
sets can also be misleading or even harmful.
They’re the basis of tons of entertaining

43
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:16,659
optical illusions. These two tables, for example,
are the same size, but the positions of their

44
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:20,579
legs make that impossible for you to believe
until I lay them over each other.

45
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,250
And while all the fooling our visual perception
can be fun, it also helps us understand how

46
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,430
it works. Our minds are given a tremendous
amount of information, especially through

47
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:35,860
the eyes, and we need to make quick work of
it. Turning marks on a paper into words. Blobby

48
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:41,270
lumps into the face of a friend. Seeing depth,
color, movement and contrast. Being able to

49
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:45,020
pick out an object from all of the other clutter
around it seems so simple.

50
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,020
But we’ve come to discover that it is quite
complicated. So complicated that we have a

51
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,230
name for it. Form Perception.
Take a neat little dynamic called the figure-ground

52
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:57,009
relationship -- it’s how we organize and
simplify whatever scene we’re looking at

53
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:01,299
into the main objects, or figures, and the
surroundings, or ground, that they stand out

54
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:01,620
against.

55
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,509
The classic “faces or vases” illusion
is an example. Is two faces against a white

56
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:08,310
background? Or a vase against a black background?

57
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,680
If you look long enough you’ll see that
the relationship between the object and its

58
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,629
surroundings flip back and forth, continually
reversing. Sometimes white is the figure and

59
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:20,659
black is the ground… that figure-ground
dynamic though, is always there.

60
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,660
The concept applies to non-visual fields,
as well. Say you’re at a party, holding

61
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,980
up the wall, and creeping on your crush across
the room, trying to casually listen in on

62
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,759
what they’re saying. As the focus of your
attention, that voice becomes the figure,

63
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,990
while all the other voices jabbering about
sports and beer pong and Sherlock and everything

64
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,389
that DOESN’T HAVE TO DO WITH THAT ONE BEAUTIFUL
PERSON -- all becomes the ground.

65
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:44,240
Now that your mind has distinguished figure
from ground, it has to perceive that form

66
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,189
as something meaningful. Like, for one, that
large shape on the couch is a person, and

67
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:52,969
further, that person isn’t just any person,
but the specific, unique person of your dreams.

68
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:57,470
One way our minds shuffle all of these stimuli
into something coherent is by following rules

69
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,170
of grouping, like organizing things by proximity,
continuity, or closure.

70
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:05,660
The rule of proximity, for instance, simply
states that we like to group nearby figures

71
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,150
together. So, instead of seeing a random garble
of partygoers, we tend to mentally connect

72
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:13,289
people standing next to each other. Like,
there’s the hockey team over there, and

73
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,379
the debate team over there, and then you got
the band geeks. Why are all these people at

74
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:16,899
the same party?

75
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:22,049
We’re also drawn to organize our world with
attention to continuity--perceiving smooth,

76
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,550
continuous patterns and often ignoring broken
ones.

77
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:29,319
We also like closure, and not just after a
breakup. Visually, we want to fill in gaps,

78
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:34,670
to create whole objects, so here we see an
illusory triangle breaking the completion

79
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:38,800
of these circles on left. But just add the
little lines to close-off the circles, and

80
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,090
you stop seeing the triangle.

81
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:44,888
Form perception obviously is crucial to making
sense of the world -- or, y’know, a moderately

82
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:48,030
interesting party.
But imagine trying to navigate the world without

83
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:53,089
depth perception. As you gaze upon your one
true love, the image hits your retina in two

84
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:58,000
dimensions, yet somehow you’re still able
to see the full three-dimensional gloriousness

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,769
of their form. You can thank your depth perception
for that. Depth perception is what helps us

86
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:07,509
estimate an object’s distance and full shape.
In this case, a nice shape that is currently

87
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:08,870
too far away from you.

88
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,660
It is at least partially innate. Even most
babies have it.

89
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:17,080
We’re able to perceive depth by using both
binocular and monocular visual cues.

90
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:20,560
Binocular cues, as the name gives away, require
the use of both eyes.

91
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,329
Because your eyes are about 2.5 inches apart,
your retinas receive ever-so-slightly different

92
00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:29,139
images. You know, camera one, camera two.
So when you’re looking with both eyes, your

93
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,980
brain compares these two images to help judge
distance. The closer the object, the greater

94
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:36,660
the difference between the two images, also
known as their retinal disparity.

95
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,430
Retinal disparity is pretty easy to see, you
just hold your fingers up and then you look

96
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,699
past them, and suddenly you have four instead
of two fingers.

97
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:47,560
But because those left and right eye images
vary only slightly, retinal disparity doesn’t

98
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,290
help much when it comes to judging far-off
distances. For that we look to our monocular

99
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,360
cues to help us determine the scale and distance
of an object.

100
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,230
These are things like relative size and height,
linear perspective, texture gradient, and

101
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,069
interposition.
Relative size allows you to determine that

102
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:07,430
your crush is not supporting a tiny, newborn
chihuahua on their shoulder, but rather there’s

103
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,180
a full-grown chihuahua behind them in the
back of the room.

104
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,150
In the absence of a chihuahua or like object,
you can also judge distances using your linear

105
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:18,198
perspective. If you’ve ever made a perspective
drawing in art class you’ll remember that

106
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:22,960
parallel lines appear to meet as they move
into the distance, just like the tiled floor.

107
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,549
The sharper the angle of convergence and the
closer the lines together, the greater the

108
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,810
distance will seem.
And if you’ve ever looked out at a mountain

109
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,980
range or a Bob Ross painting, you’ll understand
texture gradient as the cue that makes the

110
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:37,400
first ridge appear all rocky and textured.
But as your eye follows the ridges into the

111
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:41,870
distance, they become less detailed.
And finally, our interposition, or overlap

112
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:46,228
cue, tells us that when one object, like this
oaf here, blocks our view of something else,

113
00:07:46,228 --> 00:07:50,610
your crush, we perceive it as being closer.
And in this case, especially annoying.

114
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,460
So, all of these perceptual concepts can be
demonstrated with a fixed image, but of course,

115
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:57,209
life involves a lot of movement. At least
if you’re doing it right.

116
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:01,448
We use motion perception to infer speed and
direction of a moving object. Like, your brain

117
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:06,270
gauges motion based partly on the idea that
shrinking objects are retreating, and enlarging

118
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:10,589
objects are approaching. The thing is, your
brain is easily tricked when it comes to motion.

119
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:14,388
For instance, large objects appear to move
much more slowly than small ones going the

120
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:17,650
same speed.
And in addition to organizing things by form,

121
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:22,259
depth, and motion, our perception of the world
also requires consistency, or as psychologists

122
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:25,409
call it, constancy.
Perceptual constancy is what allows us to

123
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:30,960
continue to recognize an object regardless
of its distance, viewing angle, motion, or

124
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,999
illumination, even as it might appear to change
color, size, shape, and brightness depending

125
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:40,019
on the conditions. Like, we know what a chihuahua
is whether it looks like this, this, this,

126
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,828
or this.
In the end, though, your perception isn’t

127
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:45,888
just about funky optical illusions, it’s
about how you understand the world and your

128
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:51,139
place in it--both physically and psychologically.
Your sensory organs pull in the world’s

129
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:55,639
raw data, which is disassembled into little
bits of information, and then reassembled

130
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:58,999
in your brain to form your own model of the
world.

131
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:03,269
It’s like your senses are just collecting
a bunch of legos, and your brain can build,

132
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:09,419
and rebuild, whatever it perceives - a party,
your crush, a duck, or a chihuahua. In other

133
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:12,128
words, your brain constructs your perceptions.

134
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:15,240
And if you were correctly constructing your
perceptions this lesson, you learned what

135
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,519
forms your perceptual set; how form perception
works; and the many visual cues that influence

136
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,490
your depth perception.
