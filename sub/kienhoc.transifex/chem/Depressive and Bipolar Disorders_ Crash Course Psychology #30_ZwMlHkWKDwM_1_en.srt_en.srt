00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,209
American psychologist, and professor of psychiatry,
Kay Redfield Jamison, is one of the world's

2
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:09,169
foremost authorities on bipolar disorder.
She's spent her career researching, lecturing,

3
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:11,330
and writing seminal books on the condition.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,109
A condition that she also happens to have
had her entire adult life.

5
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:20,129
In her memoir, "An Unquiet Mind," Jamison
details what it really means to be bipolar.

6
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:25,379
She writes of not sleeping for days on end,
of feeling long periods of euphoria, and filling

7
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:29,018
whole notebooks with her racing thoughts and
grandiose ideas.

8
00:00:29,018 --> 00:00:33,359
While in these manic states, she experienced
a tremendously inflated sense of self-esteem

9
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,299
and did impulsive things that felt good at
the time but had painful consequences, like

10
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:41,689
going on lavish shopping sprees, engaging
in promiscuous behavior, racking up credit

11
00:00:41,689 --> 00:00:43,599
card debt, and emptying her bank accounts.

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,200
But these episodes were followed by emotional
crashes: Crippling bouts of depression that

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,130
sent her into a suicidal spiral. At the age
of 28, Jamison tried to kill herself by taking

14
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,900
an overdose of Lithium, lapsed into a coma,
but thankfully emerged from it determined

15
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:59,259
to find help through medication and therapy.

16
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:03,099
Through her research and writing, Dr. Jamison
has pioneered our understanding of bipolar

17
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:08,090
disorder, depression, and the nexus of mental
struggles that we now think of as mood disorders.

18
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,590
And she's probably one of the best ambassadors
we have for all those people who live successful,

19
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,840
productive lives with mental illness.

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,200
Just like the anxiety disorders we talked
about last time, mood disorders are misunderstood.

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,549
They're diluted by depictions of depression
as something that can be treated with one

22
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:27,069
day at a spa or descriptions of people as
manic depressive just because they were sad

23
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:29,009
yesterday and aren't today.

24
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,319
As students of psychology, our job is to understand
what mood disorders really are, how they manifest

25
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:36,879
themselves, and what might cause them. And
as you probably guessed, this can be pretty

26
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,759
tough terrain to explore. These disorders
can take people from terrifying highs to pits

27
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,528
of despair that seem all but bottomless.

28
00:01:43,528 --> 00:01:48,000
But! In between there's what Jamison has called, 
"A rich, imaginative life"

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
-- all made possible by your moods.

30
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:03,199
We've been talking a lot about terms and concepts
that mean something different than what you

31
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:07,239
think they mean, but this time, the term "Mood"
is not one of those.

32
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:11,419
In a psychological context, moods are pretty
much exactly what you think they are: Emotional

33
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:15,679
states that are even more subjective and harder
to define than the emotions themselves.

34
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,170
And while psychologists have defined about
10 basic emotions, moods tend to fall

35
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:26,289
into two broadly and infinitely variable categories.
You got the good moods and the bad moods.

36
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:30,900
Probably the most important distinction between
emotion and mood is that moods are long-term

37
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,090
emotional states rather than discreet, fleeting
feelings.

38
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:39,090
And "mood-disorders," which are characterized
by emotional extremes and challenges in regulating

39
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,729
mood tend to be longer-term disturbances.

40
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:45,709
These include depressive disorders, typified
by prolonged hopelessness and lethargy, and

41
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:50,200
bipolar disorders, the most prominent of which
involve alternating between depression and mania.

42
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:54,319
Depression has been called the common cold
of psychological disorders. Which is not to

43
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,400
say that it isn't serious, but it's common
and it's pervasive and it's the top reason

44
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,039
people seek out mental health help.

45
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:04,780
We've all felt down before, obviously, often
in response to a specific loss: a breakup

46
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,900
or a lost job or the death of a loved one.

47
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,830
And the fact is, you probably should feel
bad at times like those. It can actually be

48
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,680
good for a mind and body to slow down, to
help digest losses that you experience, but

49
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,110
in general, sadness is temporary. It's when
sadness and grief extend beyond the generally

50
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:25,250
accepted social norms, or plunge into a depth
that causes serious dysfunction that you find

51
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,080
yourself in the territory of depressive disorders.

52
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,390
The DSM-5, our handy (if super flawed) user's
guide to psychological disorders officially

53
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:36,939
diagnoses a major depressive disorder when
a patient has experienced at least five signs

54
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:39,349
of depression for more than two weeks.

55
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:43,889
These symptoms include not just depressed
mood, but also significant weight or appetite

56
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:48,089
loss or gain, too much or too little sleep,
decreased interest in activities, feeling

57
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,930
worthless, fatigued, or lethargic, difficulty
concentrating or making decisions, and recurrent

58
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,580
thoughts of death or suicide.

59
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:59,510
So while everyone experiences sadness, depression
is a physiological as well as psychological

60
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:04,609
illness. It messes with your sleep, and appetite,
and energy, and neurotransmitter levels, all

61
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,450
interfering with the way your body runs itself.

62
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:11,329
Plus in keeping with our definition of psychological
disorders, to be considered a true disorder

63
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:16,079
this behavior needs to cause the person or
others around them prolonged distress - the

64
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,540
feeling that something is really wrong.

65
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,920
Just as a person with a severe, generalized
anxiety disorder may never want to leave the

66
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,639
house, a clinically depressed person often
feels so hopeless and overwhelmed that they

67
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,660
have trouble living a normal life. And unlike
the bipolar disorders, the depressive disorders

68
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,139
tend to be all lows.

69
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:36,220
You've probably heard of manic depression.
It's the outdated term for bipolar disorders.

70
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,660
These include those classic dark lows of depression,
but also bouts of the opposite - of extreme

71
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,350
mania in more severe cases. Someone suffering
from a bipolar disorder may flip back and

72
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:50,170
forth between normal and depressive and manic
phases within a single day or week or month.

73
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:54,460
And a true manic episode doesn't just mean
being energetic or happy, it's a period of

74
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:59,739
intense, restless, but often optimistic hyperactivity
in which your estimation of yourself and your

75
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,540
abilities and your ideas can often get skewed.
Like, really, REALLY skewed.

76
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,879
Some patients experience mania only rarely,
but when they do, it can be destructive. Kay

77
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,759
Jamison has testified to that.

78
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,980
Once during a manic episode, she bought up
a drug store's entire supply of snake-bite

79
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,150
kits, convinced of an imminent attack of rattlesnakes
that only she knew was coming.

80
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:23,829
In another, she purchased 20 books by the
Penguin Publishing House because she said,

81
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:27,099
"It could be nice if the penguins could form
a colony."

82
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,110
In other words, bad judgment is common. And
it can get worse.

83
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,900
Full blown manic episodes often end up in
psychiatric hospitalization, since the risk

84
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:39,509
to self or others can become severe. When
the highs eventually end, they're often followed

85
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:45,379
by dark periods of depression. When left untreated,
suicide or suicide attempts are common, another

86
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:48,250
element of the disorder that Jamison herself
can attest to.

87
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,250
Like so many things in psychology, the cause
of mood disorders is often a combination of

88
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:57,279
biological, genetic, psychological, and environmental
factors. We know, for example, that mood disorders

89
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:02,888
run in families - genes matter. And you're
more likely to experience a bipolar or depressive

90
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:05,090
disorder if you have parents or siblings who
suffer from them.

91
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:08,579
Studies have of identical twins show that
if one twin has a bipolar disorder, that the

92
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:13,329
other has a seven in ten chance of also being
diagnosed, regardless of whether they were

93
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:15,240
raised together or apart.

94
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,668
And while a stressful life can't give you
bipolar disorder, it could trigger a manic

95
00:06:19,668 --> 00:06:24,039
or depressive episode in someone with a pre-existing
condition. Or start a descent into a major

96
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,270
depressive episode in someone who never before
had experienced depression. In other words,

97
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:32,430
a person who loses a loved one could go from
sad to depressed or slide into a bipolar episode,

98
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,079
but it couldn't cause them to have the disorder
to begin with.

99
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:39,539
In the case of depressive disorders, for most
people, after weeks, months, or even years,

100
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,240
their depression can end, hopefully with the
return to baseline healthy functioning.

101
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,819
World-wide, women tend to be diagnosed with
major depression more often than men, but

102
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:51,389
many psychologists think this is simply because
women tend to seek treatment more. It's also

103
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:55,840
possible that depression in men tends to manifest
itself more in terms of anger and aggression,

104
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,159
than as sadness and hopelessness.

105
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,020
This is just an example of how depression
is much more than just being sad and that

106
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:05,299
the characteristic lack of purpose and helplessness
can manifest itself in a lot of different ways.

107
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:09,459
Looking at mood disorders from a neurological
perspective, we see that depressed, manic,

108
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:13,959
and average brains show very different brain
activity in neural imaging scans. As you might

109
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:17,849
expect, a brain in a depressed state slows
down. While a brain in a manic state shows

110
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:22,590
a lot of increased activity, making it hard
for that person to calm down or focus or sleep.

111
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:26,989
Our brain's neurotransmitter chemistry also
changes with these different states. For example,

112
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,460
norepinephrine, which usually increases arousal
and focus, is severely lacking in depressed

113
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:36,129
brains, but kind of off the charts during
manic episodes. In fact, drugs that seek to

114
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:41,069
reduce mania in part do it by reducing norepinephrine
levels. You may have also heard about how

115
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:46,540
low serotonin levels correlate with depressive
states. Exercise, like jogging or break dancing

116
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,710
or whatever, increases serotonin levels, which
is one reason exercise is often recommended

117
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:54,948
to combat depression. And most medications
designed to treat depression seem to work

118
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:58,050
by raising serotonin or norepinephrine levels.

119
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,100
And of course there's yet another way to look
at things. The social-cognitive perspective

120
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,110
examines how our thinking and behavior influence
depression.

121
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,030
People with depression often view bad events
through an internal lens or mind set that

122
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:13,659
influences how they're interpreted. And how
you explain events to yourself, in a negative

123
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,540
or positive way, can really effect how you
recover from them - or don't.

124
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,759
Say you were humiliated in the lunch room
when someone tripped you and chicken soup

125
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,970
flew all over the place, and you sat down
on a brownie, and it was just a bad day. A

126
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,620
depressive mind might immediately start thinking
that the humiliation will last forever, that

127
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,799
no one will ever let you live it down, that
it's somehow your own fault, and you can't

128
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,250
ever do anything right.

129
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,129
That negative thinking, learned helplessness,
self-blame, and over-thinking can feed off

130
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:44,480
itself and basically smother the joy out of
the brain, eventually creating a vicious self-fulfilling

131
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,789
cycle of negative thinking.

132
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:49,480
The good news is that the cycle can be broken
by getting help from a professional, turning

133
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,710
your attention outward, doing more fun things,
and maybe even moving to a different environment.

134
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,769
But again, that social-cognitive prospective
is just part of a much bigger puzzle. Positive

135
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:02,600
thinking is important, but it's often inadequate on its own
own when up against genetic or neurological factors.

136
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:07,389
So mood disorders are complicated conditions
and rarely are they eliminated with a single

137
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:12,490
cure. Instead, they're often things you just
live with. And as Dr. Jamison has shown us,

138
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,950
you can live well.

139
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,620
Today we talked about what mood disorders
are, as well as what they aren't. You learned

140
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:22,220
about the symptoms of depressive and bipolar
disorders, and the possible biological, genetic,

141
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,460
environmental, and social-cognitive causes
of mood disorders.
