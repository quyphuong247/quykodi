00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,129
Here’s a riddle, my Hobbitses: What’s
something we all experience, all the time,

2
00:00:04,128 --> 00:00:07,669
that we can’t really measure, and barely
have words to define? You can’t hold it

3
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:10,968
in your hand, or take a bite out of it. It
isn’t something you learn or practice; it

4
00:00:10,968 --> 00:00:12,399
just IS.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,820
Consciousness.
Every science has certain concepts that are

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,800
so fundamental, yet abstract, that we have
a hard time finding the appropriate words

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,580
to describe them. Ask a physicist and they’ll
tell you energy and space defy simple definitions.

8
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:29,500
Biologists know if something is alive, but
have a harder time explaining what life actually

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,249
is. Ask a psychologist what consciousness
is, and you’ll get…you’ll get a slippery

10
00:00:35,249 --> 00:00:37,140
answer.
For the purposes of this conversation, we’re

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,679
going to actually loosely define consciousness
as our awareness of ourselves and our environment.

12
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:46,640
It’s this awareness that allows us to take
in and organize information from many sources

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,140
and senses, at once.
American psychologist William James thought

14
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:55,088
of consciousness as a continuously moving,
shifting, and unbroken stream, hence the term

15
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:58,698
“stream of consciousness.” Others think
of it as the brain’s roving flashlight,

16
00:00:58,698 --> 00:01:02,388
shining down an unbroken beam of light that
highlights one thing, and then moves on to

17
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:04,100
the next.
The point is, your conscious experience is

18
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,819
forever shifting--for example, right now hopefully
you’re focused on the words coming out of

19
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:11,929
my mouth, but with a little shift - your mind
might wander to how you really should shower

20
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,720
today, and your chair is uncomfortable, and
you suddenly have to pee, and can you believe

21
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:16,900
what Bernice said?!

22
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,200
Do I smell pizza?

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,210
HEY! EYES HERE! WE’RE LEARNING!
Beyond that moment-to-moment shifting, consciousness

24
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:26,949
allows us to contemplate life, think about
infinity, and ride a unicycle across a tightrope

25
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,670
while juggling melons, at least in theory.

26
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,310
Our consciousness helps us plan our futures,
consider consequences, and reflect on the

27
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,710
past. It is both the most familiar, and the
most mysterious part of our lives.

28
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:44,709
It’s kind of like The Force -- but for the
little universes inside our heads.

29
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:53,319
[INTRO]
Throughout our daily lives we flit back and

30
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:58,139
forth between various states of consciousness,
including waking, sleeping, and various altered

31
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,480
states. These can occur spontaneously, like
dreaming, or be physiologically sparked, like

32
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,740
a drug-induced hallucination, or be triggered
psychologically, through meditation or hypnosis,

33
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:08,079
for example.

34
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,370
We’re going to take the next three episodes
to look closely at these different states

35
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,860
of consciousness, but let’s start with what
it really means to be awake.

36
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,780
For centuries, scientists learned what they
could about the brain solely through clinical

37
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,949
observation. And they learned a lot, for sure,
but with today’s technology, we’re actually

38
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:30,089
able to see some of the structures and activity
inside a living, working brain - its electrical,

39
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,430
metabolic, and magnetic signatures displayed
on screens for our wonder and amusement.

40
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,420
The field of cognitive neuroscience is the
study of how brain activity is linked with

41
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:43,049
our mental processes, including thinking,
perception, memory, and language. Like other

42
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,650
kinds of neuroscience, it uses neuroimaging
technologies to consider links between specific

43
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,379
brain states and conscious experiences.
And there’s more than one way to scan a

44
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:56,490
brain. Structural imaging shows the brain’s
anatomy, and is useful in identifying large-scale

45
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:01,920
tumors, diseases, and injuries. In contrast,
functional imaging shows us electromagnetic

46
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,519
or metabolic activity in the brain, like blood
flow, to let us observe correlations between

47
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,520
specific mental functions and activity in
particular brain areas.

48
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,950
So, yes, neuroimaging has been revolutionizing
the field of psychology, much like telescopes

49
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:19,729
and microscopes did for astronomy and biology.
But on the other hand, some of this technology

50
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:25,149
is very new, and there’s plenty of disagreement
about how to interpret neuroimaging findings.

51
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,489
Remember, correlation does not equal causation.
So, activity in a certain brain region while

52
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:33,239
having certain kinds of thoughts might be
useful to know, but it’s not the end of

53
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,270
the conversation.
We’ve already talked a lot about how function

54
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:40,430
is often localized in the brain and how everything
psychological is simultaneously biological--so

55
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:44,989
it stands to reason our thoughts and emotions
could in part be illustrated by a bright flare

56
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:47,340
on a dark screen.
We’ve also collected a fair amount of evidence

57
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,270
that we don’t just have one layer of consciousness
- a single tape playing various tunes - but

58
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:58,050
rather, something more like two layers, each
supported by its own personal bio-psycho-social

59
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,180
pit crew.
I’m talking about one of the dual process

60
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,370
models of consciousness--the idea that our
conscious, deliberate mind could be saying,

61
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:09,459
look! a squirrel! while our implicit, automatic
mind is simultaneously subprocessing like

62
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:14,378
a computer: color: brown, tail: bushy, movement:
climbing, distance: 20 meters, association:

63
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:18,250
my sister had a squirrel phobia as a child,
implicit bias: I think that squirrels are

64
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,100
ruining America. All of which might weigh
upon my behavior upon seeing the little guy.

65
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,180
By some estimates, all your senses are scooping
up nearly 11 million bits of information,

66
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:34,590
EVERY SECOND. And yet, you consciously register
only about 40 at time. So how do we keep focused

67
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:38,198
and filter out all the chatter to actually
get stuff done?

68
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:41,990
With selective attention, of course!
Selective attention is how we focus our consciousness

69
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,569
on one particular stimulus or group of stimuli,
effectively tuning out the rest. Your consciousness

70
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:50,680
is like a spotlight on a busy stage. There
are other things going on around you that

71
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,079
your automatic, subprocessor brain is covertly
registering. But for those moments when you

72
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:58,289
shine your spotlight, most of the other stimuli
fall away.

73
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:03,419
Try it at home! Right now, you’re consciously
watching this lesson on consciousness. You

74
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:08,240
probably don’t notice the feel of your socks
on your feet, or the tongue that’s inside

75
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,389
your mouth, always filling up your mouth with
tongue! But as soon as I mention it, the spotlight

76
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:17,400
of your attention turns to them, you feel
those socks on your feet, and you’re like

77
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:20,668
wow! It’s weird that there’s a tongue
in my mouth!

78
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:24,370
The classic auditory example of selective
attention is the cocktail party effect. You

79
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,918
could be in a room with 47 people jabbering
away, and yet be able to concentrate your

80
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:34,339
hearing on one conversation, tuning out the
rest of the voices and background music. But,

81
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:38,638
if the couple next to you were to speak your
name, suddenly your cognitive radar would

82
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,650
light up and your attention would whip around
to the sound of your name, probably trying

83
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:46,668
to figure out if Bernice was talking behind
your back again.

84
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:47,389
Bernice!!

85
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:51,329
This roving spotlight of selective attention
is pretty handy most of the time, for spies

86
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:56,099
and laypeople alike. But it can also be dangerous,
if you’re being dumb, and say, texting and

87
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,389
driving.
When you shift your primary selective attention

88
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:04,019
from driving to OMG, LOLOLOLOLOL, you also
unwittingly activate your selective inattention,

89
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:08,319
which means that you failed to see that cyclist
who you almost ran over, which would not only

90
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,639
have ruined her life but also yours so DON’T
TEXT AND DRIVE!

91
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,949
In fact, when your full attention is directed
elsewhere, you’d be astounded by the scope

92
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:21,439
of obvious things you fail to notice. It’s
called inattentional blindness.

93
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:26,139
You may have even already been subject to
one of the most famous experiments of inattentional

94
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:31,310
blindness...the Invisible Gorilla or, sometimes,
the Moonwalking bear. Just google either of

95
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,759
those things if you want to be tested on your
awareness and then come back.

96
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:43,759
Pretty great, right?! Given the prompt to
count the number of passes one team makes,

97
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:49,209
your consciousness is focused on following
the players and the ball, nothing else. You

98
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:54,258
don’t see the players in black, they’re
the distraction... also you certainly don’t

99
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:56,410
see the dancing gorilla...or bear...whichever
one.

100
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:00,630
The original version of this experiment found
that about 50% of people didn’t notice that

101
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,870
there was A GORILLA WALKING THROUGH THE ROOM!

102
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,389
THAT is how powerfully selective our attention
can be. Something to remember next time you’re

103
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:07,990
behind the wheel.

104
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,990
But you know who understands and exploits
inattentional blindness better than anyone?

105
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,050
Magicians!
Except they call it misdirection. Famous modern

106
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,360
magician Teller, of Penn and Teller, says
“Every time you perform a magic trick you’re

107
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,889
engaging in a experimental psychology.”
And we can’t help but be rubes.

108
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:27,509
Magicians also prey on our change blindness,
the psychological phenomenon in which we fail

109
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:31,569
to notice changes in our environment. And
no, I don’t mean climate change. I mean

110
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:35,668
the failure to recognize the difference between
what was there a moment ago, versus what is

111
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:38,490
there now.
For example, I have changed shirts several

112
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,139
times since this lesson started.

113
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:44,129
In a well-known and often-copied experiment,
sometimes called the “person swap,” an

114
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:47,879
experimenter will stop someone in a park and
ask for directions. And then, during some

115
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,430
staged interruption, the original experimenter
will leave and be replaced with a totally

116
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,610
different person. Half the time, the subject
doesn’t even notice.

117
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,139
Fun!

118
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:00,168
One of the many perks of studying psychology
with me is you learn all kinds of new ways

119
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:01,139
to mess with people!

120
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:04,699
But while change blindness makes for some
really cool parlor tricks, this failure to

121
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:09,629
notice certain things can be dangerous -- say,
faulty memories lead to false eyewitness testimonies

122
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:13,550
in court, or when friends get deadlocked in
a he-said, she-said disagreement.

123
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:18,350
So, my friends, use The Force. But use it
wisely. As one of my favorite psychologists

124
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:23,449
once advised: “A Jedi uses the Force for
knowledge and defense, never for attack.”

125
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:27,169
Actually, that was Yoda.
Anyway, the bottom line is, we are far less

126
00:08:27,168 --> 00:08:30,849
aware of what’s going on around us than
we think we are. And that’s just when we’re

127
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,889
awake! Imagine what might slip your notice
when you’re half-asleep, drunk, hypnotized,

128
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,889
or hallucinating! That’s what we’re gonna
talk about next time.

129
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:40,598
Thanks for watching this episode of Crash
Course, if you were selectively conscious

130
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,660
of my words, you got introduced the our constant
struggle to define consciousness, learned

131
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:50,100
a little bit about neuroimaging and its developing
role in psychological science, how our consciousness

132
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,990
is split into two pieces, deliberate and automatic,
and how the brain can be selectively attentive,

133
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:00,350
selectively inattentive, and blind to changes
in some surprisingly major ways.
