1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:06,000
Say it's late at night, you're home alone
drifting off to sleep, just, entering that

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,519
dream about Fritos, and then suddenly there's
a banging at the door! Suddenly you're wide

3
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:14,449
awake and it feels like your heart's gonna
explode. You jump up ready to run out the

4
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:18,980
back door, possibly grab a Phillips head screwdriver
and stab it into the darkness until it sticks

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,820
into something. Now whether it's a Weeping
Angel or your neighbor looking to borrow a

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,359
can of beans, it doesn't really matter because
when you heard that sudden noise, your startled

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,000
brain released an icy typhoon of chemicals.
And everything that's now going through your

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,619
mind, like your urge to flee, your urge to
defend yourself, that internal debate about

9
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:41,809
whether Weeping Angels are even real and "Woah!
Where's the cat?" All that? Is just a result

10
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:42,850
of those chemicals.

11
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:47,039
Our brains and our nervous systems and the
substances they produce and are always bathed

12
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,969
in are amazingly complex nuanced systems.
And even though we're always talking about

13
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,179
our mental activities being somehow separate
from all the biological stuff going on in

14
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:59,850
our bodies, in reality, the moods, ideas,
impulses, that flash through our minds are

15
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:06,719
spurred by our biological condition. As psychologists
like to say, "Everything psychological is

16
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,859
biological." So one way to understand how
your mind works is to look at how the chemistry

17
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:15,060
of your body influences how you think, sense,
and feel about the world around you. To do

18
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,310
that, we begin at the simplest level, the
system with the smallest parts, it's all about

19
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:26,329
the neuron, baby.

20
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:29,109
[Intro]

21
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:35,840
Neurons, or nerve cells, are the building
blocks that comprise our nervous systems.

22
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,250
Neurons share the same basic makeup as our
other cells, but they have electrochemical

23
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,790
mojo that lets them transmit messages to each
other. Your brain alone is made up of billions

24
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:49,549
of neurons, and to understand why we think
or dream or do anything, you gotta first understand

25
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:52,600
how these little transmitters work. You actually
have several different types of neurons in

26
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:56,259
your body, from ones that are less than a
millimeter long in your brain to ones that

27
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:01,990
run the whole length of your leg! Yes, you
have cells as long as your legs, which is

28
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:05,879
nothing compared to the hundred and fifty
feet the nerve cells of some dinosaurs had

29
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,819
to be, I'm getting off topic, sorry.

30
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:13,778
No matter how big a nerve is, they all have
the same three basic parts: the soma, dendrites,

31
00:02:13,778 --> 00:02:18,848
and axon. The soma, or cell body, is basically
the neuron's life support; it contains all

32
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:24,388
that necessary cell action like the nucleus,
DNA, mitochondria, ribosomes, and such. So,

33
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:29,019
if the soma dies, the whole neuron goes with
it. The dendrites, as bushy and branch-like

34
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:33,819
as the trees they're named after, receive
messages and gossip from other cells. They're

35
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:38,768
the listeners, whispering what they hear back
to the soma. The axon is the talker. This

36
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:44,259
long, cable-like extension transmits electrical
impulses from the cell body out to other neurons

37
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:49,590
or glands or muscles. Whereas the dendrites
are short and bushy, the axon fiber is long,

38
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,408
and, depending on what type of neuron it is,
is sometimes encased in a protective layer

39
00:02:53,408 --> 00:02:58,090
of fatty tissue, called the myelin sheath.
It's almost like an insulated electrical wire,

40
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,680
the myelin sheath speeds up the transmission
of messages, and if it degrades, as it does

41
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,449
with those affected with multiple sclerosis,
those signals are degraded as well, eventually

42
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:09,379
leading to lack of muscle control.

43
00:03:09,378 --> 00:03:14,198
Neurons transmit signals either when stimulated
by sensory input or triggered by neighboring

44
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:18,180
neurons. The dendrites pick up the signal
and activate the neuron's action potential,

45
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,930
or firing impulse, that shoots an electrical
charge down the axon to its terminals and

46
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,299
towards the neighboring neurons. The contact
points between neurons are called synapses.

47
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:32,129
All those bushy little dendrites are decorated
with synapses that almost but don't quite

48
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:37,870
touch the neighboring axon in the tiniest
game of "I'm not touching you!" of all time.

49
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,158
They're less than a millionth of an inch apart.
And that microscopic cleft is called the synaptic

50
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:47,519
gap. So, when an action potential runs down
to the end of an axon, it activates the chemical

51
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,229
messengers that jump that tiny synaptic gap,
flying like that little air kiss and landing

52
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:57,979
on the receptor sites of the receiving neuron.
Those messengers are neurotransmitters.

53
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:01,839
Although neurotransmitters slide right into
their intended receptors like a key into a

54
00:04:01,838 --> 00:04:06,180
lock, they don't stay bonded to the receiving
neuron. They just sort of pop out, having

55
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,870
excited or inhibited the receiving neuron's
trigger, then the extras immediately get reabsorbed

56
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,938
by the neuron that released them in the first
place in a process called reuptake. Kinda

57
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:19,599
like, "Here you go, oh, psych!" So neurons
communicate with neurotransmitters which in

58
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,310
turn cause motion and emotion; they help us
move around, make jazz hands, learn, feel,

59
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,629
remember, stay alert, get sleepy, and pretty
much do everything we do.

60
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:33,569
Some of them just make you feel good, like
the endorphins we get flooded with after running

61
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:38,310
ten miles or falling in love or eating a really
good piece of pie. We've got over 100 different

62
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:43,410
kinds of these brilliant neurotransmitters
-- some are excitatory and others are inhibitory,

63
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:48,900
and all are good reminders that everything
psychological is also biological. Excitatory

64
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:54,099
neurotransmitters rev up the neuron, increasing
the chances it will fire off an action potential.

65
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,530
Norepinephrine is one you're probably familiar
with, it helps control alertness and arousal.

66
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:03,399
Glutamate is another, involved in memory,
but an over-supply of it can wig out the brain

67
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:07,439
and cause seizures and migraines which is
why some people are sensitive to all that

68
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:12,769
MSG, or monosodium glutamate, in their Ramen.
Inhibitory neurotransmitters on the other

69
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:17,149
hand, chill neurons out, decreasing the likelihood
that the neuron will jump into action. GABA–

70
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:21,750
gamma-aminobutyric acid– is a major inhibitory
neurotransmitter, and you've probably heard

71
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,310
of serotonin which affects your mood and hunger
and sleep. Low amounts of serotonin are linked

72
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,019
to depression, and a certain class of antidepressants
help raise serotonin levels in the brain.

73
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:34,949
Some neurotransmitters like acetylcholine
and dopamine play both sides and can both

74
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:39,170
excite or inhibit neurons depending on what
type of receptors they encounter. Acetylcholine

75
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:43,580
enables muscle action and influences learning
and memory; Alzheimer's patients experience

76
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:47,909
a deterioration of their acetylcholine producing
neurons. Dopamine, meanwhile, is associated

77
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:52,320
with learning, movement, and pleasurable emotions,
and excessive amounts of it are linked to

78
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,319
schizophrenia as well as addictive and impulsive
behavior.

79
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:59,379
So neurotransmitters are basically your nervous
system's couriers. But they aren't the only

80
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:04,129
chemical messengers delivering the news; they've
got some competition brewing in the endocrine

81
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:08,409
system. And if you've been through puberty,
you know what I'm talking about: hormones.

82
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,830
Like neurotransmitters, hormones act on the
brain, and indeed some of them are chemically

83
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:19,109
identical to certain neurotransmitters. Hormones
affect our moods, arousal, and circadian rhythm,

84
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,879
they regulate our metabolism, monitor our
immune system, signal growth, and help with

85
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:28,259
sexual reproduction. You could say that most
of them boil down to the basics: attraction,

86
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:29,509
appetite, and aggression.

87
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:33,409
Whereas neurons and synapses flick on and
off, sending messages with amazing speed,

88
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,820
the endocrine system likes to take its time,
delivering the body's slow chemical communications

89
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:42,259
through a set of glands that secrete hormones
into the bloodstream where they're ferried

90
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:44,469
to other tissues, especially the brain.

91
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,990
So while the nervous and endocrine systems
are similar, in that they both produce chemicals

92
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,269
destined to hit up certain receptors, they
operate at very different speeds. It's like,

93
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:55,719
if the nervous system wants to get in touch
with you, it sends you a text. But if the

94
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,290
endocrine system has a message, it will like
lick the stamp, and put it on, and write your

95
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:05,770
address, and then a note and a pen on paper,
and then fold it up and put and mail it to

96
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:10,560
you with the Post Office. But fast isn't always
better, and your body will remember that letter

97
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,269
longer than the text. Hormones, they linger.
Which helps explain why it takes some time

98
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,109
to simmer down after a moment of severe fright
or anger.

99
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,300
And our endocrine systems have a few important
hormone brewing glands. We've got a pair of

100
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,460
adrenal glands snuggled up against our kidneys
that secrete adrenaline, that famous fight

101
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:30,669
or flight hormone that jacks up your heart
rate, blood pressure and blood sugar, giving

102
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:35,550
you that tidal wave of energy preparing you
to run like heck or punch that charging baboon

103
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:40,600
in the throat; the pancreas sits right next
to the adrenal gland and oozes insulin and

104
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,129
glucagon hormones that monitor how you absorb
sugar, your bodies main source of fuel. Your

105
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:49,399
thyroid and parathyroid glands at the base
of your throat secrete hormones that regulate

106
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:53,589
your metabolism and monitor your body's calcium
levels; if you have testicles, they're secreting

107
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:57,729
your sex hormones like estrogen and testosterone,
and if you've got ovaries, they're doing that

108
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:58,189
job.

109
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:03,089
And all those glands are super important,
but there is one gland that rules them all,

110
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:07,589
and in the darkness binds them: the pituitary
gland. Although it's just a little pea-sized

111
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:12,829
nugget hidden deep in the bunker of the brain,
it is the most influential gland in this system.

112
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:17,639
It releases a vital growth hormone that spurs
physical development and that love hormone,

113
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:22,300
oxytocin, that promotes warm, fuzzy feelings
of trust and social bonding. What really makes

114
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,949
the pituitary the master gland is that its
secretions boss around the other endocrine

115
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:31,789
glands, but even the pituitary has a master
in the hypothalamus region of the brain, which

116
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,528
we will talk more about next episode.

117
00:08:33,528 --> 00:08:38,509
So, AHHHHHHHHH! if I managed to scare you,
sorry, but I'm illustrating a point. You have

118
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:43,199
no control over being scared, but maybe now
you do understand a little more clearly how

119
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:46,409
your nervous and endocrine systems worked
together to call the shots.

120
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:50,490
First, the sensory input from your eyes and
ears went to your brain, the simplest bits

121
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:55,620
of your hypothalamus without even letting
you analyze it and were like ahhhh, and then,

122
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,159
that ran down the chain of command from your
pituitary to your adrenal glands, to the hormone

123
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,828
adrenaline, to the rest of your body and then
back to your brain, which then realized that

124
00:09:04,828 --> 00:09:08,688
I was just messing with you and told everybody
to just calm down for once!

125
00:09:08,688 --> 00:09:13,058
The whole deal is a feedback loop: your nervous
system directs your endocrine system which

126
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:17,308
directs your nervous system, brain, gland,
hormone, brain. And of course each of these

127
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:21,198
systems is fantastically complex. Way more
than we can get into here.

128
00:09:21,198 --> 00:09:25,578
So, in our next lesson, we're gonna get all
up in your brain, and delve deeper into the

129
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:30,269
different components of your nervous system,
find out what your old brain is, and learn

130
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,278
about how much of your brain you actually
use.

131
