1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:05,710
So if the name Ivan Pavlov rings a bell, it’s
because his experiments are among the most

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,388
famous in the history of psychology.

3
00:00:08,388 --> 00:00:12,018
His work contributed to the foundation of
the behaviorist school of thought that viewed

4
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:18,120
psychology as an empirically rigorous science
focused on observable behaviors and not unobservable

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,630
internal mental processes.
Even though today we view psychology as the

6
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:27,049
science of both behavior AND mental processes,
Pavlov’s influence was tremendous. His research

7
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,170
helped pave the path for more experimental
rigor in behavioral research, right up to

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,370
the present day.
Born in 1849 in Russia, Pavlov was never much

9
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:40,488
for psychology. After giving up on his original
aspirations to become a Russian Orthodox priest

10
00:00:40,488 --> 00:00:45,599
like his father, he instead earned a medical
degree and spent nearly twenty years studying

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,679
the digestive system, earning Russia’s first
Nobel Prize in his mid-50s for his research

12
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:53,210
expanding our understanding of how stomachs
worked.

13
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:59,539
He didn’t study human stomachs though...cause
the procedures were terrible and cruel...he

14
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:01,130
studied dog stomachs.

15
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,650
And while researching those dogs, he noticed
how the animals would salivate at a mere whiff

16
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,510
of their dinner.

17
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,969
At first he found all that slobber annoying,
but soon started to suspect that this behavior

18
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:14,500
was actually a simple but important form of
learning.

19
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,950
For us scholars of psychology, we can define
learning as the process of acquiring, through

20
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,299
experience, new and relatively enduring information
or behaviors.

21
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:27,700
Whether through association, observation,
or just plain thinking, learning is what allows

22
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,710
us to adapt to our environments and to survive.
And as Pavlov began to discover, it wasn’t

23
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:34,079
only humans who learned.

24
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,868
Soon enough he was turning out his famous
series of experiments, in which he paired

25
00:01:37,868 --> 00:01:43,659
the presence of meat powder - yummy - which
got the dogs to drooling, with lots of different

26
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:47,840
neutral stimuli -- things that wouldn’t
normally make you drool, like a certain sound,

27
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,170
a shining light, or a touch on the leg.
Then Pavlov observed, after several of these

28
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,349
pairings, a dog would start to drool just
at the sound or the light or the touch, even

29
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:59,399
if there wasn’t any slobber-inducing meat
powder around.

30
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,880
Animals, he found, can exhibit associative
learning. That’s when a subject links certain

31
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:07,828
events, behaviors, or stimuli together in
the process of conditioning.

32
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:12,189
This may be the most elemental, basic form
of learning a brain can do. But that doesn’t

33
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:16,699
mean that the processes behind conditioning
are, or ever were, obvious. Or, for that matter,

34
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:17,009
simple.

35
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:20,909
In fact, the research that’s gone into how
we’re conditioned by our environments has

36
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:25,680
helped shape the science of psychology, from
a still-kinda-subjective-thought-exercise

37
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,780
into the more rigorous discipline we know
today.

38
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,580
And it also starred some of psychology’s
most notable, and often controversial, figures,

39
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,260
including Pavlov, B. F. Skinner -- aaaand
that guy who trained kids to be terrified

40
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:41,479
of furry animals...
[INTRO]

41
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:48,479
OK, I’m not a licensed dog-trainer - do
they license dog trainers? But I can break

42
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:55,439
down for you the sequence of steps in Pavlov’s
famous experiment, to help you get a sense

43
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,370
of how conditioning works:
First, before conditioning, the dog just drools

44
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:05,459
when it smells food. That smell is the unconditioned
stimulus, and the slobbering, the unconditioned,

45
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,259
or natural response. The ringing sound, which
at this point means nothing to the dog, is

46
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:15,179
the neutral stimulus, and it produces no drooling.
During conditioning, the unconditioned stimulus

47
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,409
-- that food smell -- is paired with the neutral
stimulus -- the bell sound -- and results

48
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:24,098
in drooling. This is repeated many times until
the association between the two stimuli is

49
00:03:24,098 --> 00:03:28,238
made, in a stage called acquisition.
By the time you get to the after-conditioning

50
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,750
phase, that old neutral stimulus has become
a conditioned stimulus, because it now elicits

51
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,919
the conditioned response of drooling.
Sounds super simple, right? If you have a

52
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,018
dog, you’ve probably seen it tapdance at
the sight of a leash, but in Pavlov’s day,

53
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:46,000
this whole series of steps hadn’t really
been studied in a lab setting, or thought

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,699
about in scientific terms.
Pavlov’s work suggested that classical conditioning

55
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:53,939
-- as this kind of learning came to be known
-- could be an adaptive form of learning that

56
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:59,009
helps an animal survive by changing its behavior
to better suit its environment. In this case,

57
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:02,449
a bell means food, and food means survival.
So get ready!

58
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:07,169
Not only that, but methodologically, classical
conditioning shows how a process like learning

59
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:12,329
can actually be studied through direct observation
of behavior, in real time, without all those

60
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,670
messy feelings and emotions.
This was something Pavlov especially appreciated

61
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:21,329
given his disdain for “mentalistic” concepts
like consciousness and introspection championed

62
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,158
by Freud.
Behaviorist psychologists, like Pavlov’s

63
00:04:24,158 --> 00:04:28,930
younger American analogues B.F. Skinner and
John B. Watson, also embraced the notion that

64
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,309
psychology was all about objective, observable
behavior.

65
00:04:32,309 --> 00:04:37,020
In his 1930 book Behaviorism, he argued that
given a dozen healthy infants he could train

66
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:41,658
any one of them to be a doctor, artist, lawyer,
or even a thief, regardless of their talents,

67
00:04:41,658 --> 00:04:43,139
tendencies, or ancestry.

68
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:46,369
Whoa there, Watson! Thankfully no one gave
him any infants.

69
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:51,129
In his most famous and, yes, controversial
experiment, Watson conditioned a young child,

70
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:55,619
dubbed “Little Albert,” to fear a white
rat. Maybe that doesn’t sound so bad, but

71
00:04:55,619 --> 00:05:01,059
he accomplished this by pairing the rat with
a loud, scary noise, over and over and then

72
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:04,939
demonstrated that the child’s terror could
branch out and be generalized to include other

73
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:08,028
furry, white objects… like bunnies, dogs,
or even fur coats.

74
00:05:08,028 --> 00:05:13,829
So yeah, that’d never fly today, obviously,
but Watson’s research did make other psychologists

75
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:20,008
wonder whether adults, too, were just holding
tanks of conditioned emotions -- and if so,

76
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:24,059
whether new conditioning could be used to
undo old conditioning. Like, if you’re terrified

77
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:27,960
of roller coasters, but you made yourself
ride one ten times a day for two weeks, would

78
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:30,908
your fears fade?
For the record, recent exploration has revealed

79
00:05:30,908 --> 00:05:35,519
that the boy known at Little Albert sadly
died a few years after these experiments,

80
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,008
while Watson eventually left academia and
got into advertising, where he put all that

81
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:42,360
associative learning to lucrative use.

82
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,270
So that’s classical conditioning. But we’ve
also got another kind of associative learning:

83
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:49,778
operant conditioning.
If classical conditioning is all about forming

84
00:05:49,778 --> 00:05:55,538
associations between stimuli, operant conditioning
involves associating our own behavior with

85
00:05:55,538 --> 00:05:59,709
consequences. The kid who gets a cookie for
saying please, or the aquarium seal that gets

86
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:04,859
a sardine for balancing a ball on its nose,
they’ve both been trained with operant conditioning.

87
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,348
The basic premise here is that behaviors increase
when followed by a reinforcement, or reward,

88
00:06:09,348 --> 00:06:13,449
but they decrease when followed by a punishment.
And the most well-known champion of operant

89
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:18,908
conditioning is American behaviorist B.F.
Skinner. He designed the famous operant chamber,

90
00:06:18,908 --> 00:06:23,618
or “Skinner Box”--a confined space containing
a lever or button that an animal could touch

91
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:28,479
to get some sort of reward, typically food,
along with a device that keeps track of its

92
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:30,928
responses.
Okay, time for a debunking break!

93
00:06:30,928 --> 00:06:35,748
Other than maybe Freud, no other figure in
psychology seems to be as shrouded in lore

94
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:40,679
and misinformation as B. F. Skinner. So I’m
just going to tell you straight that, no,

95
00:06:40,678 --> 00:06:46,278
Skinner never put any kids in this box. And
no, he didn’t raise his children without

96
00:06:46,278 --> 00:06:50,228
love or affection, and his daughter didn’t
hate his guts until the day she committed

97
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:54,748
suicide. Deborah Skinner is alive and well,
and she loved her dad plenty.

98
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:59,189
Skinner DID, however, invent something called
an air crib--a climate controlled box with

99
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:04,199
a window on the front that was meant to keep
babies warm and safe while moms ran around

100
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,338
doing their 1950’s-lady thang. It’s not
exactly where I’d like to spend the night,

101
00:07:08,338 --> 00:07:11,050
but it wasn’t remotely the same as the Skinner
Box.

102
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,978
No one knows where all of these myths came
from, but being a somewhat controversial guy,

103
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:18,908
Skinner had a lot of haters, some of whom
were probably happy to perpetuate misinformation.

104
00:07:18,908 --> 00:07:23,678
But back to the rat in the box. Basically,
the box provided an observable stage to demonstrate

105
00:07:23,678 --> 00:07:28,138
Skinner’s concept of reinforcement, which
is anything that increases the behavior that

106
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:32,528
it follows. In other words, you push the lever,
you get a snack, and then you want to keep

107
00:07:32,528 --> 00:07:35,678
pushing the lever.
But most rats aren’t going to push a lever

108
00:07:35,678 --> 00:07:41,049
for no reason. I mean, there aren’t food-dispensing
levers in a natural environment, so operant-conditioning

109
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,020
behavior requires shaping.

110
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:46,348
Maybe you give the rat a nibble of food each
time it gets closer to the bar, then only

111
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:50,699
when it touches the bar, until little by little,
in a series of successive approximations to

112
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,598
the desired behavior, you only reward them
only when they do what you’re trying to

113
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:57,728
shape them to do.
In everyday life, we’re all continually

114
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:02,658
reinforcing, shaping, and refining each other’s
behaviors, both intentionally and accidentally.

115
00:08:02,658 --> 00:08:06,118
We do this with both positive and negative
reinforcement.

116
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:11,189
Positive reinforcement obviously strengthens
responses by giving rewards after a desired

117
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:15,879
event, like the rat snack after a lever push,
or getting a cookie when you say please.

118
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:19,588
Negative reinforcement is a little trickier.
It’s what increases a behavior by taking

119
00:08:19,588 --> 00:08:24,559
away an aversive or upsetting stimulus. Like,
say, you get in your car and it does that

120
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:29,459
infernal beeping thing until you fasten your
seatbelt. The car is reinforcing your seatbelt-wearing

121
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:33,918
by getting rid of that horrible beeping. And
it’s good, because you should wear your

122
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:35,509
seatbelt.
It’s important to recognize here that negative

123
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:38,658
reinforcement is NOT the same as punishment.

124
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:43,918
Punishment decreases a behavior either positively,
by say, giving a speeding ticket, or negatively,

125
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,028
by taking away a driver’s license.
But negative reinforcement removes the punishing

126
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:53,250
event to increase a behavior. So, painkillers
negatively reinforce the behavior of swallowing

127
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,078
them by ending the headache.

128
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:58,519
So by now hopefully you’re getting the picture.
There are things that we want and things that

129
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:03,120
we don’t want, and we can be taught by way
of those impulses to behave certain ways.

130
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,370
But it’s worth pointing out that conditioning
is way more complex than just the cookie and

131
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,459
the beeping car.
For one thing ending annoyance or getting

132
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:15,689
a cookie, are types of primary reinforcers--you
don’t have to learn that, they just make

133
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,370
innate biological sense. Beeping is annoying,
cookies are delicious.

134
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,568
But there are other kinds of reinforcers that
we only recognize after we learn to associate

135
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:29,019
them with primary reinforcers. Like, a paycheck
is a conditioned reinforcer--we want money

136
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:32,730
because we need food and shelter, which are
still the primary drivers.

137
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:37,500
Plus, just as there are different kinds of
reinforcers, so are there various reinforcement

138
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,850
schedules. Like, those boxed rats were getting
continuous reinforcement when they got a treat

139
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,420
every single time they hit that lever, so
they picked it up pretty quickly.

140
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:49,309
But if one day the rat chow doesn’t come,
that connection quickly dwindles, and the

141
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:53,039
rat stops hitting the lever. This is a process
called extinction.

142
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,159
And it is important, because that’s how
real life works. Outside of a Skinner box,

143
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:03,149
you’re not gonna get continuous reinforcement.
All of life is a series of partial, or intermittent

144
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:08,139
reinforcements, that occur only sometimes.
Learning under these conditions takes longer,

145
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:11,818
but it holds up better in the long run and
is less susceptible to that extinction.

146
00:10:11,818 --> 00:10:16,088
So, say a cafe gives out a free cup of coffee
for every ten you buy, while another shop

147
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:20,779
pours a free double shots every Tuesday morning,
and yet another has a free-coffee lottery

148
00:10:20,778 --> 00:10:25,278
that customers win at random. These are all
different kinds of intermittent reinforcement

149
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:28,019
techniques that get customers coming back
for more.

150
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:32,709
Now, Pavlov, Watson, and Skinner’s ideas
were definitely controversial -- as well as

151
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:36,278
the whole scary-rat experiments. Plenty of
folks disagreed with their insistence that

152
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:40,828
only external influences, and not internal
thoughts and feelings, shaped behavior.

153
00:10:40,828 --> 00:10:45,539
It was clear to many of the behaviorists’
rivals that our cognitive processes - our

154
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:49,480
thoughts, perceptions, feelings, memories
- also influence the way we learn.

155
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,750
We’re going talk about how these other things
factor into learning next week when we look

156
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:59,028
more at conditioning, cognition and observational
learning -- and yeah, also watch kids beat

157
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:03,100
the face iff blow-up dolls.
Today you learned about how associative learning

158
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,939
works, the essentials of behaviorist theory,
the basic components of classical and operant

159
00:11:07,938 --> 00:11:13,389
conditioning, including positive and negative
reinforcement, and reinforcement scheduling.

160
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:16,909
