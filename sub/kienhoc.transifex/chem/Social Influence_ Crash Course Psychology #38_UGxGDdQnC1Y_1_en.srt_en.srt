1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,189
If someone in a position of authority told
you to like, stop walking on the grass, you

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:08,050
would stop walking on the grass, right? And
if they told you to help someone's grandma

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,210
cross the street, or pick up your dog's poop,
or put your shoes on before you go into a

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,160
store, you'd probably comply.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,789
But what if they ordered you to physically
hurt another person? You're probably thinking

6
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,429
"No way! I could never do something like that."
But there's a good chance you're wrong.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,659
In the early 1960s, Yale University psychologist
Stanley Milgram began what would become one

8
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:39,559
of social psychology's most famed and chilling
experiments.

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:45,060
Milgram began his work during the widely publicized
trial of World War II Nazi war criminal Adolf

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,870
Eichmann. Eichmann's defense, along with other
Nazis', for sending millions of people to

11
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:54,578
their deaths, was that he was simply following
the orders of his superiors. And while that

12
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:59,079
may have been true, it didn't fly in court
and Eichmann was ultimately executed for his

13
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:05,000
crimes. But the question got Milgram to thinking,
what might the average person be capable of

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,409
when under orders?

15
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:10,900
So, for his initial experiment, Milgram recruited
forty male volunteers using newspaper ads.

16
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,320
He built a phony "shock generator" with a
scale of thirty switches that could supposedly

17
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:21,319
deliver shocks in increments from 30 volts
up to 450 volts, labeled with terms like "slight

18
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:27,439
shock" to "dangerous shock" up to simply "XXX."
He then paired each volunteer participant

19
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,390
with someone who was also apparently a participant,
but was in fact one of Milgram's colleagues,

20
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,909
posing as a research subject. He had them
draw straws to see who would be the "learner"

21
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:40,710
and who would be the "teacher." The volunteers
didn't realize that the draw was fixed so

22
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:45,419
that they'd always be the teacher, while Milgram's
buddy would be the learner. So the fake learner

23
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,239
was put into a room, strapped to a chair,
and wired up with electrodes. The teacher,

24
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:53,509
the person who was being studied, and a researcher
who was played by an actor, went into another

25
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:57,290
room with a shock generator that the teacher
had no idea was fake.

26
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,920
The learner was asked to memorize a list of word
pairs, and the participant was told that he'd

27
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,990
be testing the learner's recall of those words
and should administer an electric shock for

28
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:11,248
every wrong answer, increasing the shock level a
little bit each time. From here, the pretend learner

29
00:02:11,248 --> 00:02:16,459
purposely gave mainly wrong answers, eliciting
shocks from the participant. If a participant

30
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:21,709
hesitated, perhaps swayed by the learner's
yelps of pain, the researcher gave orders

31
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:26,239
to make sure he continued. These orders were
delivered in a series of four prods.

32
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,378
The first was just "Please continue," and
if the participant didn't comply, the researcher

33
00:02:30,378 --> 00:02:35,649
issued other prods until he did. He'd say
"The experiment requires you to continue"

34
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:42,180
and then "It's absolutely essential that you continue"
and finally "You have no choice but to continue."

35
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,058
Even Milgram was surprised by the first round
of experiments. About two-thirds of the participants

36
00:02:47,058 --> 00:02:52,639
ended up delivering the maximum 450 volt shock.
All of the volunteers continued to at least

37
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,249
300 volts. Over years, Milgram kept conducting
this experiment, changing the situation in

38
00:02:57,248 --> 00:03:00,718
different ways to see if it had any effect
on people's obedience. What he repeatedly

39
00:03:00,718 --> 00:03:05,108
found was that obedience was highest when
the person giving the orders was nearby and

40
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:09,359
was perceived as an authority figure, especially
if they were from a prestigious institution.

41
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:14,269
This was also true if the victim was depersonalized,
or placed at a distance such as in another

42
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:18,120
room. Plus, subjects were more likely to comply
with the orders if they didn't see anyone

43
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,319
else disobeying, if there were no role models
of defiance.

44
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:26,128
In the end, Milgram's path-breaking work sheds
some seriously harsh light on the enormous

45
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:32,108
power of two of the key cornerstone topics of social
psychology: social influence and 

46
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:36,680
We all conform to some sort of social norms,
like following traffic laws or even obeying

47
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,778
the dress codes for different roles and environments.
When we know how to act in a certain group

48
00:03:40,778 --> 00:03:45,938
or setting, life just seems to go more smoothly.
Some of this conformity is non-conscious automatic

49
00:03:45,938 --> 00:03:49,748
mimicry, like how you're likely to laugh if
you see someone else laughing or nod your

50
00:03:49,748 --> 00:03:53,448
head when they're nodding. In this way, group
behavior can be contagious.

51
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:58,349
But overall, conformity describes how we adjust
our behavior or thinking to follow the behavior

52
00:03:58,348 --> 00:04:02,899
or rules of the group we belong to. Social
psychologists have always been curious about

53
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,419
the degree to which a person might follow
or rebel against their group's social norms.

54
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:13,010
During the early 1950s, Polish-American psychologist
Solomon Ash expressed the power of conformity

55
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:14,120
through a simple test.

56
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,720
In this experiment, the volunteer is told
that they're participating in a study on visual

57
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,790
perception and is seated at a table with five
other people. The experimenter shows the group

58
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:27,280
a picture of a standard line and three comparison
lines of various lengths, and then asked the

59
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,869
people to say which of the three lines matches
the comparison line. It's clear to anyone

60
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,560
with any kind of good vision that the second
line is the right answer, but the thing is,

61
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,819
most, if not all of the other people in the
group start choosing the wrong line. The participant

62
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:47,399
doesn't know that those other people are all actors,
a common deception used in social-psychological

63
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:51,739
research, and they're intentionally giving
the wrong answer. This causes the real participant

64
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,509
to struggle with trusting their own eyes or
going with the group.

65
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:57,699
In the end most subjects still gave what they
knew was the correct answer, but more than

66
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:02,759
a third were essentially just willing to give
the wrong answer to mesh with the group. Ash,

67
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,779
and subsequent researchers, found that people
are more likely to conform to a group if they're

68
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:11,759
made to feel incompetent or insecure and are
in a group of three or more people, especially

69
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,289
if all those people agree. It also certainly
doesn't hurt if the person admires the group

70
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:21,640
because of maybe their status or their attractiveness,
and if they feel that others are watching their behavior.

71
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,069
We also tend to conform more if we're from
a culture that puts particular emphasis on

72
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:31,899
respect for social standards. This might sound
a little bit familiar, like, all of high school,

73
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:37,159
fraternities or sororities, the big company you work for,
or any other group that you've ever been a part of.

74
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,830
The classic experiments of Milgram and Ash
showed us that people conform for lots of

75
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:45,740
different reasons, but they both underscored
the power of situation in conformity - whether

76
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,500
that situation elicits respect for authority,
fear of being different, fear of rejection,

77
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,079
or simply a desire for approval. This is known
as normative social influence, the idea that

78
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:59,279
we comply in order to fuel our need to be
liked or belong.

79
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,529
But, of course, groups influence our behavior
in more ways than just conformity and obedience.

80
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:07,939
For example, we may perform better or worse
in front of a group. This is called social

81
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:12,149
facilitation and it's what might, say, help
you sprint the last hundred meters of a race

82
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:16,419
if people are cheering you on, but it's also
what can make you nervous enough to forget

83
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,080
the words to that poetry you were supposed
to be slamming in front of a crowd.

84
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,069
But that's what can happen in front of a group,
what happens when you're actually part of

85
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:29,310
a group? Do you work harder or start slacking?
One study found that if you blindfold students,

86
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:33,009
hand them a rope and tell them to pull as
hard as they can in a game of tug-of-war,

87
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:37,139
the subjects will put in less work if they
think they're part of the team instead of

88
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:42,789
pulling by themselves. About 20% less, it
turns out. This tendency to exert less effort

89
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:47,920
when you're not individually accountable is
called social loafing. That's pretty good.

90
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,480
You can now add the word "loafing" to your
scientific vocabulary.

91
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,840
But a group's ability to either arouse or
lessen our feelings of personal responsibility

92
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,369
can make us do more dangerous things than
just phone in some group homework assignment.

93
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:05,629
It can also lead to deindividuation, the loss
of self-awareness and restraint that can occur

94
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:10,040
in group situations. Being part of a crowd
can create a powerful combination of arousal

95
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:15,230
and anonymity; it's part of what fuels riots
and lynch mobs and online trolling. The less

96
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:19,889
individual we feel, the more we're at the
mercy of the experience of our group, whether

97
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:21,069
it's good or bad.

98
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:24,209
And it should come as no surprise that the
attitudes and beliefs we bring to a group

99
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:28,349
grow stronger when we talk with others who
share them. This is a process psychologists

100
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:34,140
know as group polarization, and it often translates
into a nasty "us" vs "them" dynamic.

101
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:39,500
And you know what is great at polarizing groups?
The internet. The internet has made it easier

102
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,870
than ever to connect like-minded people and
magnify their inclinations. This can of course

103
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,840
breed haters, like racists may become more
racist in the absence of conflicting viewpoints,

104
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,689
but it can, and often does, work for good,
promoting education, crowd-sourcing things

105
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:58,930
like fundraising, and organizing people to
fight all kinds of worldsuck.

106
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,370
And group dynamics can not only affect our
personal decisions, they can also influence

107
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:08,379
really big decisions on a larger, even national
scale. Groupthink is a term coined by social

108
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:12,959
psychologist Irving Janis, to describe what
happens when a group makes bad decisions because

109
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,729
they're too caught up in the unique internal
logic of their group. When a group gets wrapped

110
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:22,590
up in itself and everyone agrees with each
other, no one stops to think about other perspectives.

111
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:28,459
As a result, you get some big and bad ideas,
including some enormous historical fiascoes,

112
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:32,990
like the Watergate cover-up and the Bay of
Pigs invasion and the Chernobyl nuclear reactor

113
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,889
accident. So while two heads may often be
better than one, it's important to make sure

114
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:41,490
those heads are still open to different opinions
or they could do some really dumb stuff.

115
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:46,289
In the end, it's best to understand ourselves
and our decisions as informed simultaneously

116
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:52,169
by both individual and group factors, personality,
and situation. And don't get too freaked out

117
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:55,818
about what people are capable of; I mean,
just think back to Milgram's experiment. For

118
00:08:55,818 --> 00:09:00,149
the two-thirds of us who would shock someone
to death in the right circumstance, there's

119
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:06,408
another third who wouldn't, reminding us that while
group behavior is powerful, so is individual choice.

120
00:09:06,408 --> 00:09:11,340
Today you learned about the power of social
influence, conformity, and authority. We looked

121
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,939
at the shocking results of the famous Milgram
experiment, the concept of automatic mimicry,

122
00:09:16,938 --> 00:09:21,969
and how Solomon Ash proved the power of conformity
in situation. You also learned how normative

123
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:26,709
social influence sways us, how social facilitation
can make or break your performance and how

124
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:32,758
social loafing makes people lazy in a group.
And finally, we discussed how harmful deindividuation,

125
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:35,068
group polarization, and groupthink can be.
