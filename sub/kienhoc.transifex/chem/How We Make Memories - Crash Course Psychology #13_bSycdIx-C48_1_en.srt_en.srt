00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,919
Clive Wearing was playing the piano alone
in his room. When his wife came into the room,

2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:08,580
he immediately leapt up and embraced her with
joyful enthusiasm.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,230
A minute later, she slipped out to grab a
glass of water, and when she returned, he

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,399
gave her that same bright greeting, as if
she’d been gone for days.

5
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:18,989
And then he did again.

6
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:19,629
And again.

7
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:25,269
Clive was an accomplished London musician,
until, in 1985 at the age 47, he contracted

8
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:30,939
a rare Herpes encephalitis virus that ravaged
his central nervous system. Since then he’s

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,910
been unable to remember almost any of his
past, or to make any new memories.

10
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:40,409
His wife is the only person he recognizes,
but he can never recall the last time he saw

11
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:45,879
her. This may be the most profound case of
extreme and chronic amnesia ever recorded.

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,100
Our memory helps make us who we are. Whether
recognizing loved ones, recalling past joys,

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,039
or just remembering how to, like, walk and
talk and fry an egg, memory is the chain that

14
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,189
connects our past to our present.

15
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:04,128
If it breaks, we’re left untethered, incapable
of leaving the present moment, and unable

16
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,379
to embrace the future.

17
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,530
But memory isn’t an all or nothing thing,
of course.

18
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:12,320
Wearing can’t remember any details about
his personal past, but he still remembers

19
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,179
how to speak English, get dressed, and play
the piano.

20
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,070
Some memories you process automatically, and
they are stored differently than your more

21
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:23,279
personal or factual memories, like, your first
kiss, or how to recite pi to twelve places,

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,849
or who won the Peloponnesian War.

23
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:28,009
Speaking of ancient Greeks -- and to help
demonstrate what I’m talking about -- I

24
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:32,580
want you to have a look at our Spartan friend
here, and remember his name. ‘Cause we’re

25
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:38,269
gonna test your memory in just minute.

26
00:01:38,269 --> 00:01:42,048
[INTRO]

27
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:49,049
Technically, memory is learning that has persisted
over time -- information that has been stored

28
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:52,060
and, in many cases, can be recalled.

29
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,509
Except of course during the exam!

30
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:58,670
Our memories are typically accessed in three
different ways — through recall, recognition,

31
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,060
and relearning.

32
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,750
And if you think about all the different kinds
of tests you’ve taken in school, they’re

33
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,068
all actually designed to size up how you access
stored information in these ways.

34
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:12,780
Like, recall is how you reach back in your
mind and bring up information, just as you

35
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,500
do in fill-in-the-blank tests.

36
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,259
So if i say, BLANK is the capital of Greece,
your brain would hopefully recall the answer

37
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:20,139
as Athens.

38
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:25,159
Recognition, meanwhile, is more like a multiple-choice
test -- you only need identify old information

39
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:29,370
when presented with it.
As in: which of the following was NOT an ancient

40
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,439
city in Greece: Athens, Marathon, Pompeii,
or Sparta.

41
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,300
And relearning is sort of like refreshing
or reinforcing old information. So when you

42
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:43,510
study for a final exam, you relearn things
you half-forgot more easily than you did when

43
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:47,859
you were first learning them, like, say, a
basic timeline of the Greek empire.

44
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:53,540
But how? How does all of that data that we’re
exposed to, all the time, every day, become

45
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:53,870
memory?

46
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,890
Well, in the late 1960s, American psychologists
Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin figured

47
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:02,649
out enough about the process of memory-formation
to break it down into three stages:

48
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,430
First, it’s first encoded into brain, then
stored for future use, and then eventually

49
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,780
retrieved.

50
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,019
Sounds simple, but by now you’ve figured
out that, just because you take a lot of stuff

51
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:15,390
about your mind for granted, that doesn’t
mean it isn’t complicated.

52
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:20,429
By Atkinson and Shiffrin’s model, we first
record things we want to remember as an immediate,

53
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,230
but fleeting, sensory memory.
Think back to the image I showed you a minute

54
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:27,590
ago. Do you remember his name?
If you do it’s because you successfully

55
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:32,019
managed to shuffle it into your short-term
memory, where you probably encoded it through

56
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:34,550
rehearsal.
This is how you briefly remember something

57
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:39,370
like a password or phone number-- hey Tommy,
what’s Jenny’s number? Okay. 867-5309...867-5309…

58
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:46,370
8-6-7-5-3… see you’re getting it in your
head there.

59
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:51,670
Or in this case, I told you to remember that
guy’s name, so maybe you were thinking “Leonidas”

60
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:54,030
repeatedly over and over, even if you didn’t
think you were doing it.

61
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,500
But this information really only stays in
your short-term memory for under thirty seconds

62
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,340
without a lot of rehearsal. So if you weren’t
repeating “Leonidas,” you’d probably

63
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,590
have
forgotten it already.

64
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:09,310
Because your mind, amazing as it is, can really
only hold between four to seven distinct bits

65
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,930
of information at a time--at which point,
the memory either decays, or gets transferred

66
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,579
into long-term memory.
Long-term memory is like your brain’s durable

67
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:24,088
and ridiculously spacious storage unit, holding
all your knowledge, skills, and experiences.

68
00:04:24,088 --> 00:04:28,490
Now, since the days of Atkinson and Shiffrin,
psychologists have recognized that the classical

69
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,939
definition of short-term memory didn’t really
capture all of the processes involved in the

70
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,990
transfer of information to your long-term
memory.

71
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,218
I mean, it’s more than just being able to
remember some Greek guy’s name. So later

72
00:04:38,218 --> 00:04:43,259
generations of psychologists revisited the
whole idea of short-term memory and updated

73
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,419
it to the more comprehensive concept of working
memory.

74
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:50,758
Working memory involves all the ways that
we take short-term information and stash it

75
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,879
in our long-term stores. And increasingly,
we think of it as involving both explicit

76
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,229
and implicit processes.
When we store information consciously and

77
00:04:58,228 --> 00:05:02,728
actively, that’s an explicit process. We
make the most of this aspect of working memory

78
00:05:02,728 --> 00:05:06,848
when we study, for instance, so that we can
know that Athens is the capital of Greece,

79
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,378
and that Pompeii was a Roman town, and not
a Greek one.

80
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:12,770
This is how we capture facts and knowledge
that we think we’re going to need -- like

81
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:18,008
I told you specifically to remember Leonidas’
name, you concentrated on that detail and

82
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:21,399
filed it away, if briefly.
But of course we’re not conscious of Every.

83
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:26,689
Tiny. Thing that we take in. Yet, our working
memory often transfers stuff we’re not aware

84
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:31,909
of to long-term storage. We call that an implicit
process, the kind you don’t have to actively

85
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:34,759
concentrate on.
A good example might be classically conditioned

86
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:38,439
associations, like, if you get all sweaty
and nervous at the dentist because you had

87
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:41,619
a root canal last year.
You don’t need to pull up that file on the

88
00:05:41,619 --> 00:05:47,240
last time you got your face drilled to think
oh hey, oral surgery! Not my favorite! Instead,

89
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,019
implicit processes cover all that stuff automatically.
This kind of automatic processing is hard

90
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:55,038
to shut off-- unless you’ve got something
unusual going on in your brain, you may not

91
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:59,658
have much choice but to learn this way, like
how you learned how to not put your hand into

92
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:03,748
a fire. That learning would have happened
pretty much automatically as soon as you first

93
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:07,309
yanked your hand away from an open flame.
Whether things are lodged in there explicitly

94
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:13,729
or implicitly, or both, there are also different
kinds of long-term memory. For instance, procedural

95
00:06:13,728 --> 00:06:18,050
memory refers to how we remember to do things
-- like riding a bike or reading - it’s

96
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,149
effortful to learn at first, but eventually
you can do it without thinking about it.

97
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:26,879
Long-term memory can also be episodic, tied
to specific episodes of your life -- like

98
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,149
“remember that time that Bernice fell out
of her chair in chemistry lab and started

99
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:31,168
laughing uncontrollably?”

100
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:33,990
Man, good times.
There are other types of long-term memory,

101
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,460
too, and we’re continually learning more
about the biology and psychology of the whole

102
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:43,058
complex phenomenon.
For instance, while Clive Wearing’s episodic

103
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:47,860
memories (among others) seem to be deeply
affected, his procedural memories for things

104
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,908
seems to be in one piece.
This has to do with neuroanatomy that we don’t

105
00:06:50,908 --> 00:06:55,449
have time to explore here, and that we don’t
yet fully understand -- Wearing and others

106
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:59,088
have a lot to teach us about the different
types of long-term memory storage.

107
00:06:59,088 --> 00:07:02,348
Now, for healthy memories, there are lots
of little tricks you can use to help remember

108
00:07:02,348 --> 00:07:06,338
information. Mnemonics, for one, help with
memorization, and I’m sure you know a few

109
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:11,368
that take the form of acronyms--ROY G. BIV
for the colors of the rainbow, for instance.

110
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:16,009
Mnemonics work in part by organizing items
into familiar, manageable units, in a process

111
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:20,848
called chunking. For example, it may be hard
to recall a seven-digit number, but it’ll

112
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:25,079
be easier to commit it to memory in the rhythm
of a phone number: 867-5309. Or you could

113
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:29,769
just, you know, write a song about it.
Strategies like mnemonics and chunking can

114
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:34,698
help you with explicit processing, but how
well you retain your data can depend on how

115
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:37,889
deep you dig through the different levels
of processing.

116
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:42,278
Shallow processing, for instance, lets you
encode information on really basic auditory

117
00:07:42,278 --> 00:07:46,408
or visual levels, based on the sound, structure
or appearance of a word.

118
00:07:46,408 --> 00:07:50,959
So if you’re trying to commit the name Leonidas
to your explicit memory, using shallow processing

119
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,319
you might encode the word by recalling the
cool font you saw it in.

120
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,979
But to really retain that information, you’d
want to activate your deep processing, which

121
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:04,649
encodes semantically, based on actual meaning
associated with the word. In this case, you

122
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:09,488
might remember the story of the mega-tough
yet very scantily clad warrior of ancient

123
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:14,308
Greece. Or you might remember that “leon”
means “lion” in Greek, that lions are

124
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:18,149
tough fighters, and that Leonidas was a tough
Spartan warrior-king.

125
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:20,988
And then to really, really make it stick,
you want to connect it to something meaningful

126
00:08:20,988 --> 00:08:25,938
or related to your own personal, emotional
experience. Like maybe Gerard Butler’s bronzed

127
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:30,569
eight-pack torso and unconquerable blood-lust
helped lock down the words Spartan and Leonidas

128
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:31,968
in your forever memory.

129
00:08:31,968 --> 00:08:35,979
I mean, maybe. If … if that helps you.
In the end, how much information you encode

130
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:40,560
and remember depends on both the time you
took to learn it and how you made it personally

131
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,619
relevant to YOU.
Memory is extremely powerful. It’s constantly

132
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,799
shaping and reshaping your brain, your life,
and your identity. Clive Wearing is still

133
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:54,588
himself on the outside, but in his inability
to recall who he was, or process what has

134
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:58,540
happened, he has lost some critically important
part of himself.

135
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:03,458
Our memories may haunt us or sustain us, but
either way, they define us. Without them,

136
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:08,729
we are left to wander alone in the dark.
If you were committing this lesson to memory,

137
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,220
you learned about how we encode and store
memory, the difference between implicit automatic

138
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:18,420
and effortful explicit processing, how shallow
and deep processing work, and a few types

139
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:22,240
of long-term storage.
