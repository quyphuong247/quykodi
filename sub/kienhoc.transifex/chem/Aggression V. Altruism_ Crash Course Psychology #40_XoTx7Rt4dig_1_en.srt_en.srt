1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:04,820
Let me tell you about Robber's Cave. In 1954,
a group of 11 boys, all about 12 years old,

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,618
were invited to a special summer camp in the
deep woods of southeastern Oklahoma, at a

3
00:00:09,618 --> 00:00:13,618
place called Robber's Cave State Park. None
of the boys knew each other, although they

4
00:00:13,618 --> 00:00:18,059
all came from similar backgrounds. They spent
their days bonding over things like games

5
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:22,390
and swimming and treasure hunts, and in no
time, they formed a tight friendly group.

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,980
They even came up with a name for themselves:
the Rattlers.

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:30,429
But soon they began to notice something. No,
not a guy in the woods with a hockey mask,

8
00:00:30,428 --> 00:00:35,689
there was another group of boys also 11 of
them, also the same age, that had been staying

9
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:39,309
at the other end of the park the whole time.
The Rattlers never interacted with these other

10
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:43,650
boys, so they didn't know that those kids
were also spending time bonding over games

11
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,030
and swimming and treasure hunts, and that
they'd come up with a name for themselves,

12
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,920
too: the Eagles. But the Rattlers didn't like
the look of the Eagles, oh, no, they didn't

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,030
like them using their baseball diamond or
their dining hall.

14
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,120
And the feeling was mutual. It didn't take
long for each group to start complaining to

15
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,259
the camp's counselors about the other gang,
and eventually, they both said that they wanted

16
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:07,390
to set up a contest to determine once and
for all which group was better. The counselors

17
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,209
were only too happy to comply, because as
I'm sure you've figured out by now, those

18
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:13,039
counselors were actually researchers.

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,270
The man who set up what would be remembered
as the Robber's Cave Experiment was Turkish

20
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:21,489
American social psychologist Muzafer Sherif.
He was interested in what it would take for

21
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:25,810
rivals to overcome their differences and resolve
their conflicts. Specifically, Sherif wanted

22
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,579
to test something called Realistic Conflict
Theory. He hypothesized that conflict happens

23
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:35,060
when you combine negative prejudices with
competition over resources, and the boys at

24
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,010
Robber's Cave were well on their way to proving
him right.

25
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,210
Over the next couple of days, the Rattlers
and the Eagles competed against each other

26
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:46,629
for prizes in a series of games, like tug-of-war
and foot races, and soon, what started as

27
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:52,060
your basic trash talking and taunting and
name-calling morphed into fist-fights, thefts,

28
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,100
and raids on each others' cabins. But then
their dynamics changed or were changed for them.

29
00:01:57,099 --> 00:02:01,379
After the games were over, the researchers
integrated the groups and gave the kids shared

30
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,118
goals that they could only achieve through
cooperation. The tide quickly turned. All

31
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:10,498
22 boys worked together to move a stalled
truck that was carrying their food, they took

32
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:15,218
care of a partially felled tree that was deemed
a danger to the camp, they collaborated in

33
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:20,299
setting up tents, even though they weren't
given complete sets of equipment. While isolation

34
00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:26,419
and competition made enemies of the strangers, shared
goals and cooperation turned enemies into friends.

35
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:31,459
Over the past 39 weeks, we've learned a lot
about ourselves, our emotions and our personalities,

36
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:36,549
how our minds can get sick, how we can help
them get well again, why we can do vicious

37
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:40,299
things and then turn around and act like heroes.
So maybe it's fitting that we wrap up this

38
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:44,099
course by looking at a couple of opposing
forces that some consider the very definition

39
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:49,810
of human nature: aggression and altruism.
Conflict and cooperation. You might think

40
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:55,390
of it as the psychology of war and peace, or simply, 
what we can all learn from a bunch of 12 year olds.

41
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:11,358
In psychology, aggression is defined as "behavior
intended to hurt or destroy someone, something,

42
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:17,400
or even yourself." People aggress, as psychologists
say, in all kinds of ways, verbally, emotionally,

43
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,980
and physically, and for lots of different
reasons: out of anger, to assert dominance,

44
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:26,879
or as a response to fear. But that's just
a glimpse into why someone might become aggressive.

45
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,359
Where does the aggression actually come from?

46
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:32,419
Like a lot of behaviors we've talked about
it, it seems to emerge from that familiar

47
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:37,469
combination of biological factors, like genetic,
neurological, and biochemical influences,

48
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:42,180
and our environment and experience. In terms
of genetic influences, studies of twins, and

49
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,359
yes, Crash Course Psychology might have been
called Crash Course Studies of Twins, showed

50
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:50,489
that if one identical twin has a violent temper,
often the other one does, too, but fraternal

51
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:52,639
twins are much less likely to be so similar.

52
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,569
Neurologically speaking, no single area of
the brain controls aggression, but certain

53
00:03:56,568 --> 00:04:01,248
areas like the limbic system do appear to
facilitate it. Research on violence and criminality

54
00:04:01,248 --> 00:04:05,400
has also revealed a link between aggression
and diminished activity in the frontal lobes,

55
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,730
which play a vital role in impulse control.

56
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:12,778
And finally, our aggressiveness can be influenced
by our own biochemistry, hormones like testosterone

57
00:04:12,778 --> 00:04:16,769
and glucocorticoids and pheromones have all
been implicated in animal models of aggression.

58
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,759
It's a little trickier in humans, it's a lot
trickier in humans, but it's highly likely

59
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,120
that our hormones are intimately linked with
feeling and showing aggression.

60
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,579
Obviously, aggression isn't just about biology.
Psychological and cultural factors also play

61
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:33,689
an important role, as does the power of the
situation. For example, there's the Frustration-Aggression

62
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:37,529
Hypothesis, the simple idea that people become
aggressive when they're blocked from reaching

63
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:41,918
a goal. To demonstrate, consider the not-very
aggressive sport of baseball. There's a study

64
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:46,878
that analyzed 44 years worth of baseball stats,
and focused on the more than 27,000 incidents

65
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,680
when a pitcher hit a batter with a ball. It
turned out that this was most likely to occur

66
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,459
if the pitcher was frustrated by a recent
home run or if one of his own teammates had

67
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:57,180
been hit by a pitch in the previous inning.

68
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,939
But we also learn aggression by watching others.
Like, if you grew up watching your parents

69
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:04,949
throw popcorn and jeering lewdly at their
most hated soccer team, you might have learned

70
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:08,800
something from their behavior. So combine
all of those biological factors and funnel

71
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,810
them through a particular person with a particular
history in a particular situation, and you

72
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,500
can begin to see how aggression can have many
roots that grow together.

73
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,430
Thankfully, though, humans are more than their
bad tempers. While some things in people will

74
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,500
leave us annoyed and angry, others breed friendship
and affection. So yes, there are positive

75
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:32,079
topics in social psychology, like altruism,
our selfless, even self-sacrificing regard

76
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,378
for the welfare of others. This could be something
as simple as jumpstarting a stranger's car

77
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:40,430
or as heroic as running into a burning building
to save someone. But if being altruistic is

78
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:44,629
so awesome, why aren't we all that way all
the time? Or maybe the better question is,

79
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:48,550
why do we ever do anything selfless, like,
what's in it for us?

80
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,689
In the late 1960s, social psychologists Bibb
Latane and John Darley conducted a series

81
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:57,580
of experiments examining when and why we help
others. In one experiment, they placed a subject

82
00:05:57,579 --> 00:06:02,089
in a room, sometimes alone, sometimes with
two other subjects, and sometimes with two

83
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:07,668
actors posing as subjects. Then, they simulated
an emergency by filling the room with smoke

84
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:11,698
and waited to see if the subject would do
anything to alert the others or help themselves.

85
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:16,550
If the subject was alone, they'd report the
smoke 75% of the time. But subjects in a group

86
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,500
of three only spoke up 38% of the time. And
when they were stuck in the room with two

87
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,810
oblivious actors, only 10% of the participants
said anything to the others. Darley and Latane

88
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,639
found that people typically helped others
only if they noticed the incident, interpreted

89
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,319
it as an emergency, and then finally, assumed
responsibility, and all of these things were

90
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:39,960
much more likely to occur if a person was
alone, while the presence of others deterred

91
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,168
the person from helping.

92
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:45,948
This kind of diffusion of responsibility referred
to as the bystander effect, can weaken our

93
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:50,218
instinct for altruism. The bystander effect
is a bit like the concept of social loafing

94
00:06:50,218 --> 00:06:54,079
that we talked about. If you're around other
people, it's easier to think that someone

95
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,158
else is going to pick up the slack or in this
case, come to the rescue.

96
00:06:57,158 --> 00:07:01,288
When people do decide to help others, they
may do it for a number of reasons. One perspective

97
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:05,209
is that we tend to help others mainly out
of self-interest. By this thinking, helping

98
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:10,029
really isn't altruistic at all, and instead,
our actions boil down to a sort of cost-benefit

99
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:14,109
analysis. Like, maybe we'd turn in a lost
wallet because we're hoping for a reward or

100
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,139
we pitch in on a project at work because we
think we'll get recognized and promoted by

101
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:22,519
our bosses. Social psychologists contextualize
these kinds of examples in the broader theory

102
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:25,859
of social exchange. When it comes to doing
things for other people, we're always trying

103
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,210
to maximize our personal rewards while minimizing
our costs. But social exchange doesn't have

104
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:33,930
to be as selfish as that, it can also mean
that we act altruistically because we expect

105
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,978
that the people we help will go on to help
others, so if we give someone a hand changing

106
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:42,008
a tire, maybe they'll stop next time they
see someone else, maybe even us, broken down

107
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:45,770
on the side of the road. You might know this
concept, sometimes it's called the norm of

108
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:48,158
reciprocity, sometimes it's called paying
it forward.

109
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:52,129
And then there's the social responsibility
norm, which is the simple expectation that

110
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:57,218
people will help those who depend on them,
like any parent can expect to give more help

111
00:07:57,218 --> 00:08:01,449
than they're going to receive from young children.
That's just part of being a parent. Naturally,

112
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:06,210
the world would be a delightful place if altruism
were the standard for human behavior, but

113
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:08,788
then, psychology wouldn't be nearly so interesting.

114
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:14,339
In some ways, you might say that what fuels
conflict is the opposite of altruism: self-interest.

115
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:18,668
Social psychologists view conflict as any
perceived incompatibility of actions, goals,

116
00:08:18,668 --> 00:08:24,049
or ideas. That could mean two nations fighting
over a border, sparring religious or political

117
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,180
groups, or you and your boo fighting over
whose turn it is to do the dishes.

118
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,468
And in a weird conundrum of human behavior
a lot of conflicts arise from what psychologists

119
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:35,668
call "a social trap," where people act in
their own short term self-interest, even though

120
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:40,009
it takes a toll on the larger group and on
themselves over the long-term. You see this

121
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:43,460
kind of thing all the time on an individual
scale, like in a crime movie, when a criminal

122
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,889
just betrays all of his criminal friends to
get the big payout, it doesn't turn out very

123
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:51,830
well for him in the end. But on a larger scale,
you can find social traps taking their toll

124
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:56,610
on the environment, like when we poach elephants
to sell their ivory or cut down old growth

125
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,629
forests to make a quick buck in the lumber
market. Either way, when self-interest succeeds

126
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:05,330
in wrecking the collective interest by, say,
depleting some limited resource, it becomes

127
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:10,810
easy to start viewing our neighbors as competitors,
taking us right back to the ingroup vs. outgroup

128
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:13,669
mindset that we all know causes big problems.

129
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:16,539
So as long as there's self interest, there's
gonna be conflict.

130
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:21,120
But before you get all down on humanity, remember
those Robber's Cave boys. They were ready

131
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,639
to go full-on Lord of the Flies before shared
goals forced them to cooperate and ultimately,

132
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,639
make peace. The power of cooperation to make
friends of former enemies is one of the most

133
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:35,639
hopeful areas of psychological research. If
greed and self-interest can destroy the world,

134
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,769
perhaps cooperation can save it.

135
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:41,919
Today, you learned about the Robber's Cave
experiment and what it taught us about realistic

136
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:47,589
conflict theory and how shared goals can overcome
conflict. We looked at the physical and environmental

137
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:52,720
triggers of aggression, and the frustration-aggression
hypothesis. You also learned about altruism,

138
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,820
the bystander effect, and when we are more
or less likely to help a person in need, and

139
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:02,060
also about the social exchange theory, the
reciprocity norm, the social responsibility

140
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,519
norm, and social traps.
