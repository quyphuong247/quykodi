1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:05,068
If you saw our last lesson on psychotherapy
you might be wondering: What happened to Bernice?

2
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:08,400
Has she found a way to manage her depression?
Is she still wracked with anxiety?

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,080
Well it's really nice of you to ask. And I'll
tell her you said, "hi." But for our purposes

4
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:17,070
as students of psychology, the bigger question
arising from Bernice's case is "has psychotherapy

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,740
helped?" and just as important, "how can we
tell?"

6
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:24,949
Well believe it or not, one of the main ways
experts use is to simply ask the client, and

7
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:26,589
see how they say they're doing.

8
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:30,149
Is Bernice out of bed, and living her life?
Did she make it through mid-terms without

9
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:34,719
spiraling into a crisis? And did she take that
plane trip to Baja to party with her girls?

10
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,960
As a clinician, that would all be useful to
know, right? But the key is that we want to

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,268
ask these questions in a scientifically rigorous
manner, so that we really know a treatment

12
00:00:43,268 --> 00:00:46,030
works, rather than just extrapolating from
individual cases.

13
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,268
And there's also a whole other category of
treatment that's pretty different from the

14
00:00:49,268 --> 00:00:51,939
talking and listening that goes on in psychotherapy.

15
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:56,199
These are as much medical intervention as
they are psychological science; the biomedical

16
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,880
treatments. These can be as common-place as
medications like Zoloft or Lithium, or a bit

17
00:01:00,889 --> 00:01:06,879
more unusual and invasive like magnetic stimulation,
neural implants, or even electroshock therapy.

18
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:09,079
And YES, it's still a thing.

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,460
Healing a troublesome mind isn't like healing
a broken arm. So one of the challenges that

20
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:27,828
psychologists face is simply knowing whether
they're doing their job, and doing it well.

21
00:01:27,828 --> 00:01:32,228
The methods psychologists use to assess how
effective treatments are mostly involve client

22
00:01:32,228 --> 00:01:36,978
and clinician perceptions along with outcome
research. Client perceptions are just what

23
00:01:36,978 --> 00:01:40,868
they sound like, you see a therapist, and
someone asks you how you feel after your treatment.

24
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:45,129
It varies by treatment, but client perception
tends to be pretty rosy. One study found that

25
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:49,478
89% of folks said that they were at least
"fairly well satisfied" with their treatment.

26
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:53,390
But of course, perceptions are inherently
subjective, and some believe that the therapeutic

27
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:58,310
relationship lends itself to a positive bias
in client reviews. Basically, if you're sticking

28
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,769
to your treatment, you probably like your
therapist.

29
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:05,299
Clinician perspectives can be similarly skewed,
not only in terms of a self-serving bias,

30
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,789
but also because they may not be around to
see a client's future relapses or setbacks

31
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:13,469
in mental health. A patient could see ten
therapists over time, feel better at the end

32
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:17,370
of each treatment, but keep struggling over
the long term, even though each

33
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,580
therapist thought the treatment was a success.

34
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,320
So, can we objectively measure how well
psychotherapy works? Well, we have treatment

35
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,719
outcome research, a way of systematically measuring
which therapies work best for which problems.

36
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:34,859
And the gold standard of treatment outcome
research is the randomized clinical trial, or RCT.

37
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,170
If you will remember your research methods,
you'll know that RCTs generally require randomly

38
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:43,839
selected and assigned participants, a control
group, and at least one experimental group

39
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,700
that receives the treatment. This design accounts
for individual differences between people

40
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:52,199
and other extraneous factors, so that we know
that if people in the experimental group get

41
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:54,179
better and people in the control group don't,

42
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,319
it was truly the therapeutic intervention that made the difference.

43
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:02,459
And once enough researchers have run their
own RCTs, you can gather data via meta analysis,

44
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,439
measuring results across multiple trials to
see basically whether a treatment works, and

45
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:10,189
how well it does, across a variety of settings.

46
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:15,090
Two important terms you should know here are
effectiveness and efficacy. Effectiveness

47
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,979
is whether or not a given therapy works in
a "real-world setting," whereas efficacy is

48
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:25,119
whether a therapy works better than some other,
comparable intervention, or a control. Both

49
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,950
terms matter, and you'll wanna get them straight,
if you're tryin' to parse the research literature.

50
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:36,049
Dozens of studies have confirmed that psychotherapy
is both effective and efficacious. While controls,

51
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:40,000
usually people who don't get any therapy,
often do get better on their own, those in

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,120
psychotherapy usually improve faster, and
with a significantly lower risk of relapse.

53
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,719
However, and try not to look too shocked when
I tell you this, there is a lot of argument

54
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,479
about which therapies work best.

55
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:56,219
In some cases, like phobias, there are clear
winners, behavior therapy for instance. In

56
00:03:56,229 --> 00:04:00,709
others, like major depressive disorder, there
are cognitive, behavioral and psychodynamic

57
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:05,060
interventions that have all been successful
in RCTs. And while a lot of psychologists

58
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,069
seem to get a kick out of arguing about which
therapies are better than others, there do

59
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:12,859
seem to be some common factors that unite
the more effective ones.

60
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:18,590
A big one is simply instilling hope, helping
demoralized clients regain hope that things

61
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:23,319
can, and will get better. There is also the
value of getting a new perspective, learning

62
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:27,089
that there is a plausible explanation for
your troubles, and finding a new way of looking

63
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:31,339
at yourself, the world around you, and what
your future might look like. And across the

64
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:37,009
board, any good therapist provides genuine
empathy within a trusting, caring relationship.

65
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:42,469
They seek to listen, and understand and not
judge, and offer clear and positive communication.

66
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:47,220
But psychotherapy, or talking it out, is just
one way to treat psychological disorders.

67
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,930
Quite often, biomedical therapies are an option,
sometimes for the more severe disorders, but

68
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,670
in many cases, in combination with psychotherapy.
Biomedical therapies aim to physiologically

69
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,600
change the brain's electrochemical state with
psychotropic drugs, magnetic impulses, or

70
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,570
even electrical currents and surgery. As you
might expect, pharmacotherapy is by far the

71
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:10,060
most widely used, that's the one where you
just take drugs. Psychotropic drugs are just

72
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,579
any pharmaceutical that affects your mental
state, the most commonly used ones fall into

73
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:19,219
four major categories; antipsychotics, anxiolytics,
antidepressants, and mood stabilizers,

74
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,520
each aimed at a specific family of problems.

75
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:26,379
Antipsychotics are used to treat schizophrenia
and other types of severe thought disorders.

76
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:30,379
Most of these medications alter the effects
of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain

77
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:34,589
by blocking its receptor sites, and blocking
its uptake. This is based on the assumption

78
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:39,388
that an overactive dopamine system contributes
to schizophrenia, but, like many psychotropic

79
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:42,149
drugs, antipsychotics come with nasty side
effects.

80
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:46,779
Anxiolytics, or anti-anxiety meds, usually
work by depressing activity in the central

81
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:51,930
nervous system, much like a stiff drink might.
For this reason, and others, it can be super

82
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,250
dangerous to mix certain anxiety meds with
booze. Also, letting your nerves mellow out

83
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,689
can feel so good that patients may risk becoming
addicted to some anxiolytics.

84
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:04,620
Antidepressants are used to treat depression,
as you might expect, but also a number of

85
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:09,209
anxiety disorders. Each type is thought to
work a bit differently, mainly by altering

86
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:13,909
the availability of various neurotransmitters,
like serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain,

87
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,250
which in turn appears to help with mood and
anxiety problems. Some of the most common

88
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:24,168
are selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors,
or SSRIs, like Zoloft, Paxil, and Prozac,

89
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:28,500
which partially block the normal re-uptake
of serotonin. This makes it more available

90
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,870
to the synapses, which, hypothetically at
least, allows its mood-enhancing effects to

91
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,459
kick in. Current research suggests that the
use of antidepressant medication is most effective

92
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:41,060
when combined with psychotherapy, which makes
a lot of sense, and the same goes for a number

93
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,019
of other psychological disorders.

94
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:47,409
It's worth pointing out here that some meta-analyses
suggest that antidepressants aren't any more

95
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,980
effective than psychotherapy when symptoms
are mild to moderate. One meta analysis that

96
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,379
riled people up in recent years even suggested
that antidepressants are no better than a

97
00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:01,250
placebo in those cases. So psychotropic drugs
can help, but sometimes you also need to start

98
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,589
exploring the root causes of your issues and
reevaluate how you deal with them, which is

99
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:07,569
what psychotherapy is perfect for.

100
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:11,540
Bernice, for example, probably would have
benefited from both talk therapy and a dose

101
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,590
of anxiolytic or antidepressant meds.

102
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:17,899
The last big psychotropic drug group is the
mood-stabilizers. They can be extremely effective

103
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:22,039
in smoothing out the highs and lows of bipolar
disorder. Simple salts of Lithium were the

104
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,580
first of these drugs used, and they remain
in widespread use today. Dr. Kay Redfield

105
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,819
Jamison, who we talked about a few weeks ago
has said that Lithium "prevents my disastrous

106
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:35,180
highs, diminishes my depressions, gentles
me out, keeps me from ruining my career and

107
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,160
relationships, keeps me out of a hospital,
and alive."

108
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,840
And while drugs are the most popular biomedical
treatment, they aren't the only kind. For

109
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:47,729
one, there's electro-shock therapy. Now, hear
me out, this does carry a long history of

110
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:52,418
negative connotations, like of people being
strapped down and shocked into mental oblivion,

111
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:56,558
but the technology has made a comeback, and
can actually be quite effective in treating

112
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,759
severe, treatment-resistant depression. It's
properly called electroconvulsive therapy,

113
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:05,659
or ECT, and it involves sending a brief electrical
current through the brain of an anesthetized

114
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,419
patient. This excites the neurons, causing
them to fire rapidly, until the patient goes

115
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:15,009
through a small, controlled seizure that lasts
about two minutes. And we're not exactly sure

116
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:19,589
why this helps to relieve negative symptoms, but
there are several theories that are being pursued.

117
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:24,619
One suggests that the resulting seizure beneficially
alters neurotransmitter activity in areas

118
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,180
of the brain associated with moods and emotions,
effectively jumpstarting a severely depressed

119
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,479
brain. Another theory suggests that these
electrical impulses modify stress hormone

120
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,099
activity in the brain, which we know could
play a role in sleep, energy, appetite, and

121
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:43,219
mood. ECT may also re-activate previously
dormant or suppressed neurons, or possibly

122
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:49,559
stimulate the growth of new ones in key brain regions,
helping the brain regain some level of lost functioning.

123
00:08:49,568 --> 00:08:53,778
There are a couple of other brain-stimulation
treatments, too, that are more gentle. One

124
00:08:53,778 --> 00:08:59,318
is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation,
rTMS, which involves the painless application

125
00:08:59,318 --> 00:09:05,318
of repeated electromagnetic pulses. Another,
deep-brain stimulation, DBS, is more invasive,

126
00:09:05,318 --> 00:09:09,990
and calls for surgically implanting a kind
of "brain pacemaker" that sends out electrical

127
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,639
impulses to specific parts of the brain. Despite
all the new research and often positive results

128
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:20,129
around rTMS and DBS, we're still sorting out
how these treatments work to heal the brain

129
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:26,139
and mind, but they're hypothesized to jump-start the
neural circuitry in a depressed brain, similarly to ECT.

130
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:30,299
So you'll notice that all these options come
with certain risks, and really no treatment

131
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:35,649
is entirely risk free, perhaps not even psychotherapy.
But we should also note that some of the less

132
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:40,089
severe manifestations of psychological disorders
may be improved with pretty simple lifestyle

133
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:44,579
changes. Thirty to sixty minutes of daily
aerobic exercise has been shown to be as effective

134
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:49,458
as antidepressant medications in research
on mild depression. Just remember those words;

135
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:54,219
"daily" and "aerobic." Adequate sleep, social
interaction, and good nutrition also all play

136
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,600
a part in managing moods. In other words,
general healthy living helps. There's an Old

137
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,009
English proverb that says "different sores
have different salves" and the same is true

138
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:06,800
here. What works for one person may not work
for another, and sometimes a few different

139
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,248
kinds of intervention might be needed all
at once.

140
00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:13,579
Today you learned how client and clinician
perceptions, outcome research, and meta-analytic

141
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:18,588
reviews work together to determine the efficacy
and effectiveness of psychological treatments.

142
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:22,559
You also learned how biomedical therapies
work, including the four major families of

143
00:10:22,558 --> 00:10:27,389
drug therapies, along with electro-convulsive
therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic

144
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:32,619
stimulation, and deep brain stimulation. And
also how lifestyle changes and general healthy

145
00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:34,420
living can improve mental health.
