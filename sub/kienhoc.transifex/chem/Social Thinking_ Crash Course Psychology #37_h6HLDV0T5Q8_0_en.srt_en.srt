1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,399
Question: Why do people do horrible things?

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:09,980
Slave owners, and Nazis, any of the perpetrators
of history's atrocities. How do they so successfully

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,059
dehumanize other people for so long? At a
smaller scale, how do bullies in the lunchroom

4
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,969
manage to treat other kids with such cruelty
and then go home and pet their dog and call

5
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:20,739
their grandma and say "happy birthday?"

6
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:24,699
Most of what we've been studying so far has
focused on the individual. We've covered sub-fields

7
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:29,339
of psychology like cognitive, personality,
and clinical psychology, which tend to address

8
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:33,710
the phenomena contained within a single person's
mind. But there's also social psychology,

9
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,429
which focuses on the power of the situation.
It examines how we think about, influence,

10
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:42,609
and relate to one another in certain conditions.
And it's better equipped to answer this question

11
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,749
about people doing horrible things.

12
00:00:44,749 --> 00:00:48,120
Social psychology can not only give us some
of the tools we need to understand why people

13
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:51,998
behave brutally, it can also help us understand
why we sometimes act heroically.

14
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:55,999
Like why did Jean Valjean reveal his true
identity to save some stranger from being

15
00:00:55,999 --> 00:01:00,870
tried in his place? And why did Nazi Oskar
Schindler risk his own hide to save over a

16
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:05,969
thousand Jewish people? What made Darth Vader
throw the Emperor down that hole, even as

17
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:07,539
he was being electrocuted?

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,200
I can't say there are any easy answers about
humanity's greatness or it's horribleness.

19
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:15,729
Certainly, there aren't any that we can find
in the next ten minutes. But we can point

20
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,770
ourselves in the right direction, and it starts
with social thinking.

21
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:32,939
When we're trying to understand why people
act like villains or heroes, one of the things

22
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,900
we're really asking is, "Did they do what
they did because of their personality? Or

23
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,990
their situation?" Austrian psychologist Fritz
Heider began plumbing the depths of this question

24
00:01:40,989 --> 00:01:45,049
in the 1920s when he was developing what's
now known as the Attribution Theory.

25
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:49,709
This theory simply suggests that we can explain
someone's behavior by crediting either their

26
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:55,019
stable, enduring traits - also known as their
disposition - or the situation at hand. And

27
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:59,329
we tend to attribute people's behavior to
either one or the other. Sounds pretty simple,

28
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:04,539
but it can be surprisingly hard to tell whether
someone's behavior is dispositional or situational.

29
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,890
Say you see Bruno at a party and he's acting
like a wallflower all night. You might assume

30
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:13,068
that he just has a shy personality. But maybe
he doesn't; maybe he'd ordinarily be re-enacting

31
00:02:13,068 --> 00:02:17,098
all the moves from Footloose at this party
but on this night, he had a twisted ankle

32
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:23,369
or a headache or he'd just seen his ex with
somebody new - those are all situational explanations.

33
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,938
Overestimating the forces of personality while
underestimating the power of the situation

34
00:02:27,938 --> 00:02:31,979
is called the Fundamental Attribution Error.
And as you can imagine, making this kind of

35
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:37,539
error can really end up warping your opinion
of another person and lead to false snap judgments.

36
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:41,699
This might not be such a big deal when it
comes to Bruno and his awesome dance moves

37
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:46,568
but according to one study of college students,
7 in 10 women report that men have misread

38
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:51,508
their polite friendliness - which would be appropriate
for the situation - as a sexual come-on.

39
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:56,848
We choose how we explain other people's behavior
everyday and what we choose to believe can

40
00:02:56,848 --> 00:03:01,229
have big consequences. For example, our political
views will likely be strongly influenced by

41
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:04,888
whether we decide to attribute poverty or
homelessness to personal dispositions, like

42
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:10,069
being lazy and looking for a hand-out, or social
circumstances like lack of education and opportunity.

43
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:14,318
And these attitudes can, in turn, affect our
actions. Activists and politicians know this

44
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,259
well and they can use it to their advantage
to persuade people in different ways.

45
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:23,739
In the late 1970s and 80s, psychologist Richard
Petty and John Cacioppo developed a dual process

46
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:27,718
theory of understanding how persuasion works.
The first part of their model is known as

47
00:03:27,718 --> 00:03:32,878
the Central Route Persuasion and it involves calling on
basic thinking and reasoning to convince people.

48
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:36,849
This is what's at work when interested people
focus on the evidence and arguments at hand,

49
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:40,908
and are persuaded by the actual content of
the message. So when you're watching a political

50
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:45,408
debate, you might be persuaded by a candidate's
particular policies, positions or voting history.

51
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:47,378
That is, the stuff they're actually sayin'.

52
00:03:47,378 --> 00:03:52,048
But we all know that persuasion involves more
than that. There is also Peripheral Route

53
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:56,099
Persuasion at work. This influences people
by the way of incidental cues, like a speaker's

54
00:03:56,098 --> 00:03:58,789
physical attractiveness or personal relatability.

55
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:02,829
There's not a lot of hard thinking going on here,
it's more of a gut reaction. So you might decide

56
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,440
to vote for a particular candidate because you think
they're cute or they're from your home town.

57
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:10,818
Peripheral Route Persuasion happens more readily
when you're not paying a ton of attention,

58
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:15,408
which is why billboards and television ads
can be scarily effective. So that's how politicians

59
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:20,379
and advertisers and maybe bosses and teachers
and pushy friends try to change our behavior

60
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:21,879
by changing our attitudes.

61
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:26,699
But, it turns out that the reverse is true
too. Our attitudes can be affected by our

62
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:29,439
behaviors. You might have heard about the
phrase, "Fake it till you make it." Meaning,

63
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:34,050
if you smile when you're actually sad the
act of smiling may carry you through an attitude

64
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,930
change until you actually feel better.

65
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,418
Sometimes we can manipulate ourselves this
way, but it's also an incredibly effective

66
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:43,579
method people use to persuade each other.
It generally works best in increments, through

67
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:47,639
what psychologists call the foot-in-the-door
phenomenon. People tend to more readily comply

68
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,160
with a big request after they've first agreed
to smaller more innocuous requests.

69
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,470
Like Darth Vader didn't just go from "Go get
'em Anakin," to Dark Lord overnight. He was

70
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:02,080
slowly enticed to the dark side, by a series
of escalating actions and attitude changes.

71
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,519
Do this favor for me, now run this errand,
now kill these Padawans. Now blow up a planet!

72
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:10,889
What started this small actions went on to
become big ones, suddenly transforming Vader's

73
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:13,030
belief's about himself and others.

74
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:17,519
There's plenty of experimental evidence that
moral action really does strengthens moral

75
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,779
convictions, just as amoral action strengthen
amoral attitudes. And there is perhaps no

76
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:25,939
better example of this than the Stanford Prison
Experiment.

77
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:30,740
Back in 1971 Stanford psych professor Philip
Zimbardo and his team put an ad in the local

78
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,889
paper looking for volunteers to participate
in a 14 day experiment. After screening around

79
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:41,038
70 applicants, 24 male college students were
deemed physically and mentally fit enough

80
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,360
to participate in the study. For their troubles
they'd each be given $15 a day.

81
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,000
The participants didn't know the exact nature
of the experiment, just that it involved a

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,889
fake prison situation. And with a coin flip,
half were randomly deemed prisoners and the

83
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:58,310
other half guards. The guards were told that
it was the prisoner's behavior that was being

84
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,418
studied. The prisoners weren't told much of
anything, aside from that they had been arrested

85
00:06:02,418 --> 00:06:06,899
and taken to prison. Other than that neither
group had many specific instructions.

86
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:11,978
Zimbardo wanted to observe how each party
adapted to their roles, and so, on a quiet

87
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:17,519
Sunday summer morning in Palo Alto, real cops
swooped in and arrested the prisoners in their

88
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,508
homes under charges of robbery. They were
frisked, handcuffed, and read their rights.

89
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:26,879
Back at the station, they were formally booked
and then blindfolded in a holding cell wearing

90
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,250
only hospital gowns. The researchers had taken
great care to make sure that the setting was

91
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,959
extremely realistic, which is one reason they
used real cops in the arrest before handing

92
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:40,560
the prisoners over to the fake guards. And
it took no time at all for this role-playing

93
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,300
to become really, really real.

94
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,939
The initial trauma of the humiliation of the
arrest, the booking, strip-searching and waiting,

95
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:52,189
immediately kicked off a loss of identity
in the prisoners. A few prisoners only made

96
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:57,189
it through the first night before they became
too emotionally distressed and had to be released.

97
00:06:57,189 --> 00:07:00,930
Things only went downhill from there. Though
the guards could act any way they wanted as

98
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:05,379
long as they didn't physically hurt anyone,
encounters quickly became cruel, hostile,

99
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:09,389
and dehumanizing. Guards hurled insults and
commands, referred to the prisoners only by

100
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:14,280
number, and put some of them in solitary confinement.
Prisoners started breaking down, others rebelled,

101
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:18,839
and still others became passively resigned
as if they deserved to be treated so badly.

102
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,109
Things got bad enough that the experiment
ended after only six days, causing relief

103
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,889
in the fake prisoners, while interestingly
leaving some fake guards feeling angry.

104
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:31,968
Luckily, everyone involved bounced back to
normal once out of the prison setting. All

105
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:36,550
of those negative moods and abusive behaviors
were situational, and that fact reinforced

106
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:41,740
the important concept that the power of a
given situation can easily override individual

107
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,780
differences in personality. Although it would
never fly by today's ethical standards, Zimbardo's

108
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:49,948
famous study remains influential today because
it sheds such a harsh light on the nature

109
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:51,560
of power and corruption.

110
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,060
And yet, people differ. Many people succumb
and become compliant in terrible situations,

111
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,639
but not everyone does. Lots of people risked
their lives to hide Jewish people in World

112
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,180
War II, help runaway slaves along the Underground
Railroad, keep Tutsi refugees safe during

113
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,668
the Rwandan genocide, or generally refuse
to comply or participate in actions they didn't

114
00:08:08,668 --> 00:08:13,198
believe in. Some people can, and do resist
turning to the dark side, even when it seems

115
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,619
like everyone around them is going mad. And yet, 
the fact is, these people tend to be in the minority.

116
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:24,030
So why? Why does it seem so easy to rationalize
a negative action or attitude and so hard

117
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:28,688
to muster the positive ones? One partial explanation
comes from American social psychologist Leon

118
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:33,788
Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance. It's one of
the most important concepts in psychology.

119
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:37,679
Festinger's theory begins with the notion
that we experience discomfort - or dissonance

120
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,659
- when our thoughts, beliefs, or behaviors
are inconsistent with each other.

121
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,839
Basically, we don't like to confuse ourselves.

122
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:47,889
For example, if Bruno was generally considered
a peaceful person but finds himself suddenly

123
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:52,808
punching at his friend over a fender-bender, he's likely
experiencing some level of cognitive dissonance.

124
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:58,489
So, by Festinger's thinking, Bruno might relieve
this tension by actually modifying his beliefs

125
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,419
in order to match the action's he's already
committed, like telling himself, "Turns out,

126
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:06,099
I'm not such a nice guy after all, maybe I'm
actually a bully." On the other hand, he might

127
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,399
resolve his internal tension by changing how
he thinks about the situation. He might still

128
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,789
think of himself as a peaceful person, but
realize that an unusual situation led to an

129
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:19,588
unusual action, like, he'd had a bad day and
it was his mom's new car, or his friend was

130
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:25,089
just really askin' for it. So, he can keep
being the ordinarily peaceful guy he was before.

131
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:28,620
It's kind of an inverted fundamental attribution
error if you think about it. Attributing a

132
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,700
person's actions mainly to the situation,
instead of his personality. The point is that

133
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,759
this mismatch between what we do and who we
think we are induces tension - cognitive dissonance

134
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,450
- and that we tend to want to resolve that
tension. That's part of what turns an Anakin

135
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:46,149
into a Darth Vader, and then, if we're lucky,
back into an Anakin.

136
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:50,350
Today you learned that social psychology studies
how people relate to each other. We discussed

137
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:55,870
Fritz Heider's attribution theory, and fundamental
attribution error. You also learned how attitudes

138
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:01,060
can affect actions, like through the duel-process
theory of persuasion, and also how behavior

139
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:05,739
can change attitudes, like through the foot-in-the-door
phenomenon. The Stanford prison experiment

140
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,519
illustrated how a situation can override individual
differences in personality, while Leon Festinger's

141
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:15,240
theory of cognitive dissonance explained how we ease
the tension between conflicting thoughts and actions.
