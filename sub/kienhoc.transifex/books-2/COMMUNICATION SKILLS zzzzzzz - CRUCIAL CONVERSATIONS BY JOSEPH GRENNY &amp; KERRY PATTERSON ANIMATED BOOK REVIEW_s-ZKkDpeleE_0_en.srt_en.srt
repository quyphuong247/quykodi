1
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,570
There's this guy named john, he lives with
his girlfriend in the countryside.

2
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,550
john is sick of living in the same place,
he wants to move to a bigger city with better

3
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,890
opportunities.

4
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,929
there's only very few people around his current
location and no opportunities whatsoever.

5
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:39,119
The problem is, he needs to bring up the idea
to his partner, especially that john is aware

6
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,439
that his girlfriend's favorite place to live
is a less noisy area.

7
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,119
john at last, chose to compromise, swallowed
his dreams in his heart.

8
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,878
and kept silent about it.

9
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:54,948
he's afraid if he did initiate that crucial
conversation, he'd loose his partner.

10
00:00:54,948 --> 00:00:57,710
We're all prone to these types of circumstances.

11
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,359
For instance, your boss is not doing his job
right and since everyone around knows he's

12
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:04,618
unable to control his temper.

13
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:08,989
You chose not to correct the guy, you have
no clue how to handle a crucial conversation

14
00:01:08,989 --> 00:01:09,250
so you decide to remain silent.

15
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,069
Or another one could be:
You've impregnated your girlfriend, and now

16
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:17,699
you have to admit what you did to your parents
but hey, that's a very sensitive topic to

17
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,100
bring up to the table.

18
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:24,458
Instead, you choose to quit school, work at
a part time job so you could secretly feed

19
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:28,868
your kid just so you don't face the torment
of your parents.

20
00:01:28,868 --> 00:01:33,950
These are situations where a crucial conversation
is inevitable to move things forward.

21
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,618
And almost, everytime people choose one of
these two alternatives

22
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:42,618
Either A: they avoid the confrontation, terrified
of what the outcome might be.

23
00:01:42,618 --> 00:01:48,539
or, they face the fear, bring up the sensitive
topic but handle the conversation poorly resulting

24
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:50,649
in disastrous outcomes.

25
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:55,379
So for you to stop screwing things up, you
better learn how to handle crucial conversations

26
00:01:55,379 --> 00:02:06,399
unless you want to avoid them for the rest
of your life.

27
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,759
Let's say, your girlfriend got addicted to
alcohol, she's drinking every single night

28
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:13,628
and her behavior began affecting the relationship.

29
00:02:13,628 --> 00:02:18,649
Now going up to her and forcing your opinion
on her isn't going to fix anything

30
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,680
She'll probably start yelling if you that,
you begin to yell back and both end up ruining

31
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,569
the relationship.

32
00:02:23,568 --> 00:02:25,810
Instead, here's what you should do:

33
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,239
Before striking up a crucial conversation,
ask yourself these questions:

34
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,620
What do i want for myself ? what do i want
for others ?

35
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,000
and what do i want for the relationship?

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,750
these questions will clarify your intention
behind starting the conversation in the first

37
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,459
place.

38
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,158
Are you walking up to the person just to yell
at him?

39
00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:48,009
or is it because you want to solve a problem
to further improve the relationship?

40
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:51,419
The first principle here is to "start with
heart".

41
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:55,858
Did you find out that your girlfriend did
a big mistake? instead of dashing toward her

42
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:57,340
like a violant tornado.

43
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,688
Take a step back, ask yourself what do i want
for the relationship ?

44
00:03:01,688 --> 00:03:06,419
This question illustrates a clear purpose
in your mind to the reason behind addressing

45
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,568
the other person in the first place.

46
00:03:08,568 --> 00:03:20,848
Keep in mind that you're there to solve a
problem, not to cause further chaos.

47
00:03:20,848 --> 00:03:24,298
In crucial conversations, people tend to feel
unsafe.

48
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:30,498
Signs that people feel unsafe include remaining
silent, taking things personally or withdrawing

49
00:03:30,498 --> 00:03:32,209
to avoid confrontation.

50
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:36,468
So it's really important for you to learn
how to coax the other person so they'd feel

51
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:39,218
at ease while talking about sensitive topics.

52
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:44,068
To achieve this you need learn how to establish
a "pool of shared meaning"

53
00:03:44,068 --> 00:03:46,348
The second you initiate the conversation,
say:

54
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:50,238
"hey let's imagine a pool floating in the
middle while we talk"

55
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,789
"in this pool each of us will be throwing
all of his opinions"

56
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:56,949
"Without getting frowned upon,judged or criticized"

57
00:03:56,949 --> 00:04:01,229
"each opinion thrown into the pool, will be
acknowledged and examined for credibility"

58
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:05,378
"After sharing our thoughts and analizying
every single one of them objectively"

59
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:10,048
"We get to make a final decision based on
what was thrown into the pool"

60
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,560
This technique is called: the pool of shared
meaning.

61
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,218
It can do wonders if you apply this into your
relationships.

62
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:18,269
In crucial conversations, both parties tend
to believe that he or she is right and that

63
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,129
the other person must compromise.

64
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:23,149
So it's important to give up on your selfishness,

65
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:27,569
And establish a "pool of shared meaning" the
second you enter the conversation.

66
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:32,459
Tell the other person to share his thoughts
into the pool without fear of judgement or

67
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:33,299
criticizm.

68
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,810
Make it clear that this isn't a win-loose
situation.

69
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,750
But rather a means to find a shared solution

70
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,420
A solution that will surely benefit both parties.

71
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:47,110
In most crucial discussions, people don't
want to share their opinion because they fear

72
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,569
that others will judge them.

73
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:54,920
Establishing a pool of shared meaning will
make the other person feel safe and more willing

74
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:02,100
to share.

75
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,129
The pool of shared meaning is just a beginning.
Once the pool established, what comes next

76
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:08,949
is the most important.

77
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:13,439
Recall that a pool of shared meaning isn't
a technique to use so you can manipulate others

78
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,639
to thinking that you're the right one.

79
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:19,949
When you establish the pool, you have to be
genuinely interested in finding a win-win

80
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:22,469
solution that will benefit both of you guys.

81
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:27,440
And to be able to find that kind of solution,
you have to create a mutual purpose between

82
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,969
you and the other person.

83
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,060
The authors refered to four skills that will
help you achieve that.

84
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,970
These four skills form the acronym "CRIB"

85
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,560
The "C" stands for: Commit to seek mutual
purposes.

86
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,430
It's pretty rare that people seek out mutual
purposes while conversing, because both sides

87
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,879
think they are right.

88
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,490
If you find out that the conversation isn't
going anywhere, and that you're just adding

89
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,840
further fuel to the fire.

90
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,679
Suggest that both of you should completely
give up the idea that they are right.

91
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,280
Thereby help each other to find a mutually
beneficial resolution.

92
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,409
An example for this is to say:
"hey, i feel like we're both trying to force

93
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,830
our point of view here"

94
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:13,859
"how about we stop for a second, and think
up a third alternative that benefits both

95
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,750
sides"

96
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,620
The "R" goes for: Recognize the purpose behind
the strategy.

97
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,800
for instance,
you bought tickets to a noisy festival but

98
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,960
your girlfriend wants to stay home.

99
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,089
instead of laching on to your own purpose,
start questionting the other person.

100
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,609
the magical word is "why"

101
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,580
Ask your girlfriend why is she pushing so
hard to stay indoors.

102
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:39,609
She responds: "I don't like to go to a festival"

103
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,590
Keep asking why until you find out a clear
reason.

104
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:45,609
"oh i see ,you want to stay home because it's
calmer."

105
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:50,189
Now that you know the reasons, you can make
up a mutual purpose by saying:

106
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:52,089
"You want somewhere calm right?"

107
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:53,539
"i just want to go out."

108
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,970
"In this case, let's go to the park, it isn't
that noisy there"

109
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,940
"i get to breath some fresh air, while you
get to be calm, it's win-win"

110
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:03,050
Now she'll be happy to say yes.

111
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,629
Remember, give up on your own purposes, then
question the other person for their reasons.

112
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:13,850
The moment you form a clear understanding
to why they want what they want.

113
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:18,439
You can then align your need to the their
need therefore create a mutual purpose that

114
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:21,189
will satisfy both sides.

115
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:23,969
There can be more complex circumtances.

116
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:29,750
Where even after questioning for their reasons,
it's still not enough to create a Mutual Purpose.

117
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:35,139
This is what the "I" stands for : if you're
unable to create a mutual purpose, invent

118
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:35,930
one.

119
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,959
To be able to invent a mutual purpose, you
have to convince the other person that this

120
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,839
invented purpose will serve as a long-term
purpose.

121
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:48,000
For example, Your business partner is procrastinating
on his work.

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,170
If you come up to him and say, "hey dude,
why are you being so lazy"

123
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:57,900
His answer would be "well, i just don't feel
like it, i want chill back and relax"

124
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:02,060
So in this this situation, asking why won't
help.

125
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,839
Instead, remind the person of a long-term
goal.

126
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:10,439
say: "hey man, project yourself into the future.
10 years from now, do you see our business

127
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:16,439
as prosperous or did it fail? because you
aren't getting the job properly done"

128
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:22,329
Reminding the other person of a long-term
goal, is a great way to invent a mutual purpose.

129
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:26,529
Another case would be, your girlfriend is
ruining her health with alcohol and cigarettes?

130
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:31,649
Perhaps you could tell her to envision her
self with cancer in her future life.

131
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:36,870
People often get caught up in the pleasures
of the moment, thereby forget about the impact

132
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,250
of instant gratification on there future lives.

133
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:45,259
Long-term purposes serve better at convincing
people because they are strong motivators.

134
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,730
Lastely B: brainstorm new strategies:

135
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:52,230
Now that you've created a mutual purpose,
you can start brainstorming to come up new

136
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,829
ways of thinking that serves both of parties
equally.

137
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:01,179
Imagine you're working at a company, it's
a pretty good job, you love it.

138
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:05,188
But one day, you find out that your boss isn't
doing his job well.

139
00:09:05,188 --> 00:09:08,879
and it's affecting everyone including the
percentage of the benefits.

140
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,069
Now someone has to build up the courage and
confront the boss to correct his behavior.

141
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:17,309
None of your collegues were willing to do
it but hey, since you learned about how to

142
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:20,649
establish a pool of shared meaning, you're
good to go right?.

143
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:25,259
So you go to your boss and strike up that
crucial discussion.

144
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:29,620
The idea of sharing thoughts into the pool
was welcomed by him.

145
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,350
But, after throwing in your own opinions

146
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,470
You could sense that his emotions got a little
bit heated and his eyebrows contracted with

147
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:37,939
anger.

148
00:09:37,938 --> 00:09:41,620
However, you decide to ignore his reactions
and keep pushing.

149
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,980
Next thing you know, you're homeless.

150
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,730
The idea here is, The pool of shared meaning
technique works like a charm.

151
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,170
But sometimes, people are shocked to hear
one of your opinions.

152
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:57,318
other times they misinterpret your intentions
even though you've established a pool of shared

153
00:09:57,318 --> 00:09:57,870
meaning.

154
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:03,850
In this case, you have to learn how to deviate
these misinterpretations so the person would

155
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,389
get back to solving the core problem.

156
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:10,589
There's an effective tool for this known as
Contrasting.

157
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:14,519
Contrasting consists of two parts.
the don't part, and the do part.

158
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,629
the don't part is about fixing the misinterpretation.

159
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:22,089
an example is to say: "hey boss, the last
thing that i wanted to do was to make fun

160
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:22,819
of you"

161
00:10:22,818 --> 00:10:25,149
this will negate any bad intentions.

162
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:28,289
The do part is: to praise the other person's
self esteem.

163
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:34,708
say: "in fact, i think that your efforts are
enormous and immensely appreciated"

164
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:39,628
Contrasting will fix other people's misundertanding
of your opinions so you're both able to get

165
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:41,870
back to solving the main problem.

166
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,120
Just remember, everytime the other person
is to digress from resolving the problem and

167
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,669
turn reactive, angry or emotional.

168
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:52,769
It just means that they felt unsafe, that
their self-image is on the line.

169
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:59,730
Use contrasting to restore safety, to deviate
their attention back on the main issue.

170
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:04,009
As a recap, i'll summarize all the main points
in way that's easier to internalize.

171
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:09,919
-In crucial conversations, the first thing
you'd want to keep in mind is mental preperation.

172
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:15,389
Before entering the danger zone, ask yourself
what do i want for myself? for the other person?

173
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:17,028
and for the relationship?

174
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:22,818
-Second, as soon as you start talking, make
sure to establish a pool of shared meaning.

175
00:11:22,818 --> 00:11:27,438
tell the other person to talk freely, that
no one will be judged or shamed while running

176
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:31,799
the conversation.
this creates safety. When people feel safe,

177
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,919
they are more liable to share.

178
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,769
-Third, use the "CRIB" Skills to handle the
conversation.

179
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:43,688
Both sides must contribute and help each other
to analyze every opinion thrown into the pool

180
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:44,828
of shared meaning.

181
00:11:44,828 --> 00:11:51,888
You do this by asking the other person for
his reasons thereby create a mutual purpose,

182
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:53,308
a win-win solution.

183
00:11:53,308 --> 00:12:01,278
-If asking why doesn't work, remind the other
person of a long-term purpose because it serves

184
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:03,269
as a strong motivator.

185
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:07,028
-While talking, the person might get angry
or take things personally.

186
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:12,049
If this happens, use contrasting to relieve
any bad intentions.

187
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:16,778
Follow up by praising the person's self esteem
and show respect for them so they're able

188
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:20,999
to calm down again, and focus back on resolving
the main problem.

189
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:27,058
Lastly, after inventing or creating a mutual
purpose, start brainstorming new ideas, new

190
00:12:27,058 --> 00:12:31,999
ways of thinking to come up with a win-win
solution satisfying both sides.

191
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:36,819
And this is essentially, the right strategy
to go about handling, Crucial Conversations.
