1
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:15,049
Whenever you’re talking to people, say what
you have to say. But once they start replying

2
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:20,980
back to you, completely ignore it. It can’t
possibly be interesting or important. In fact,

3
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,969
it is critical that you use this time to prepare
for what you’re going to say once they’re

4
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:31,570
done. Think very hard about what absolutely
genius thing you’re going to say next. Also,

5
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,480
make it really obvious that this is exactly
what you’re doing by not showing any form

6
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:39,609
of acknowledgement once they’re done and
if you can, start your next thought even if

7
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:44,109
they’re not quite finished with their final
sentence.

8
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:48,089
Whenever you’re around people, complain
a lot. If you’re meeting someone after work

9
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,160
for dinner, make sure you tell them all about
how horrible it is to work where you work.

10
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,229
If you can, also throw in some unpleasent
facts about your family for extra bonus points.

11
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:02,409
It’s not enough that you’re drained after
a long day of work, you can’t possibly be

12
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:08,259
happy until the other person is completely
drained as well.

13
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:11,640
The following step works well with anyone,
but I’ve found that it works especially

14
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,560
well if you have a significant other. Like
most people, she probably has great qualities

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,890
along with some unpleasent ones. And you know
very well which ones you need to focus on.

16
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:26,359
Don’t ever say anything appreciative about
how she cleaned up your mess, or how she tried

17
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:31,640
to make you happy yesterday... These things
are irrelevant. Focus instead on the one negative

18
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,840
trait she has and constantly criticize her
for it.

19
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,460
Always walk around with a pissed off and an
unpleasent face. Don’t ever smile. When

20
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:47,099
people don’t react well to you and your
social interactions suffer, be confused as

21
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:49,769
to why...

22
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:53,579
Make sure to not make any effort to remember
people’s names. It’s not like you can

23
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,959
make them feel like you care if you do. If
this task requires that you put in extra effort

24
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:04,469
or figure out a way to get better at this,
come up with an excuse to not take responsibility.

25
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,949
One that works really well is the following...
All you have to do is say this magic sentence:

26
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:14,669
“Sorry, but I’m not good with names.”
This somehow completely takes away any need

27
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:20,748
to make an effort, and hey, now you’re the
victim. Congratulations!

28
00:02:20,748 --> 00:02:24,650
Remember at all times that the most important
person is you, and therefore the most important

29
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:29,278
interests and hobbies in the world are of
course the ones that you have. Don’t ever

30
00:02:29,278 --> 00:02:33,408
genuinely be interested in what’s going
on with other people. Your one friend’s

31
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:37,598
a martial artist while the other’s a soccer
player? Don’t ever ask them what that’s

32
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:43,429
like and possibly look at things from a new
perspective. No, those are barbaric and unsophisticated

33
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:48,629
practices you have no interest in. Instead
always talk about reading books and how that

34
00:02:48,628 --> 00:02:52,759
is the most important thing in the world.
And while you’re doing that, make sure to

35
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:56,778
tell them about how much you love Dale Carnegie
as well.

36
00:02:56,778 --> 00:03:01,748
Don’t ever make people feel important especially
when you’re dealing with people in a position

37
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:07,378
of power. If a cop pulls you over, don’t
ever say things like “yes, sir” or “yes,

38
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:12,370
ma’am.” Talk to him or her like you talk
to your homeboys. After all, you are a self-proclaimed

39
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:18,370
gangster and any other form of interaction
would be a weakness on your part. As a result,

40
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,778
end up with a ticket that is ten times worse
than what you would have gotten by making

41
00:03:21,778 --> 00:03:27,269
the person feel important. I mean it’s not
like many people in a position of power aren’t

42
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:31,879
strictly there just because they get that
sinister sense of pleasure from other people

43
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,608
making them feel important.

44
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:39,579
Whenever it becomes really obvious to you
and everyone around you that you are wrong,

45
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:44,699
do not admit it. To you, that is a sign of
weakness and it will embarass you. Don’t

46
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:49,749
say something respectable like, “You guys
are right. I had a wrong perspective on this.

47
00:03:49,748 --> 00:03:53,938
Thanks for teaching me something new.” No!
Don’t do that! That will actually get rid

48
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:59,198
of any possible embarassment and make people
respect you.

49
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,969
And finally, work hard at cultivating the
inability to put yourself into another person’s

50
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:08,568
shoes, always think about only what you want,
and never appeal to the interests of the person

51
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:13,278
you’re dealing with. If you work at a business
and you want to ask for a raise, walk in there

52
00:04:13,278 --> 00:04:17,959
with a mindset of how you think you obviously
deserve more, and how you want to be able

53
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,750
to afford more things, and how you should
get a raise just because you’ve been there

54
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,449
a certain amount of time... Don’t mention
or show how your work is critical to moving

55
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:31,040
the business forward cause let’s be honest,
it’s probably not. Plus, then you’d be

56
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,720
appealing to the business owner’s interest
and that might actually get you a raise. But

57
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,940
hey, don’t do that... These types of thoughts
don’t occur to you. The ability to put yourself

58
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:44,569
in another person’s shoes, think about what
they want, appeal to their interests, and

59
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:48,540
therefore maximize the chances of getting
what you want is alien to you.
