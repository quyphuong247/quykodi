Gandhi: An Autobiography - The Story of My
Experiments With Truth by Mahatma Gandhi

2
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:22,550
Born on 2nd October 1869 in Porbandar, at
school Gandhi was very shy and a mediocre

3
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:28,800
student. At the age of 13 he was married as
a Hindu. He goes on to state that child marriage

4
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,049
is not something he supports.
He was born and bred to not eat meat but a

5
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:37,578
school friend who was strong and brave told
Gandhi that these traits were due to eating

6
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:42,679
meat and convinced him to try some. He tried
some goat’s meat and continued for about

7
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:47,058
a year in secret, before deciding that lying
to his parents was worse than not being a

8
00:00:47,058 --> 00:00:53,048
meat-eater and he never ate meat again.
For a short while Gandhi also took up smoking

9
00:00:53,048 --> 00:00:57,750
with his friend, stealing coppers from servant’s
pocket money to purchase the cigarettes. Once

10
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,768
he grew up though, he had no desire to smoke
and saw smoking as dirty and harmful.

11
00:01:01,768 --> 00:01:08,400
At the age of 16, Gandhi’s father died.
A few days later his wife gave birth, but

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,079
their child only survived a few days.
After passing his final school exams, Gandhi

13
00:01:14,078 --> 00:01:18,688
went to England to study law. He was given
his mother’s permission by vowing not to

14
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:27,008
touch wine, women or meat. He left from Bombay
and set sail on 4th September 1888.

15
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:31,629
Once arriving at Southampton, he went straight
to London, staying first at a hotel and then

16
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:37,468
with an English family. He tried to become
an English gentleman and assimilate into society

17
00:01:37,468 --> 00:01:43,998
by reading newspapers, buying a hat and learning
to tie a tie. He also briefly took dancing

18
00:01:43,998 --> 00:01:47,978
lessons and was taught to play the violin,
but neither of these two things lasted more

19
00:01:47,978 --> 00:01:52,060
than a few months.
What then followed was a period of intense

20
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,879
study and modest living. However, in his last
year in England in 1890, he did travel to

21
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:04,798
Paris to a great exhibition, where the prime
attraction was the newly built Eiffel Tower.

22
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,740
After three years in England, Gandhi passed
his exams and became qualified to practice

23
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:14,180
law. He returned to India in the summer of
1891 to find that his mother had passed away

24
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,209
while he was abroad.
Gandhi worked in the High Court in Bombay,

25
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:24,239
gaining experience and studying Indian law.
However, in one particular case he was due

26
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,819
to cross-examine a witness but his shyness
rendered him speechless. He handed back his

27
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:34,759
fee for the case and left Bombay, returning
to Rajkot where his elder brother lived, and

28
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:40,120
set up an office there.
In 1893, Gandhi was offered a contract from

29
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,390
an Indian firm who were involved in a court
case in South Africa. Gandhi jumped at the

30
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:50,229
chance of a new experience and seeing a new
country and set off in April, leaving behind

31
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:55,759
his wife and their now two children. After
several stops in places such as Mombasa and

32
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:01,870
Zanzibar, Gandhi arrived in Natal in May.
Whilst in South Africa Gandhi suffered many

33
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,908
prejudices such as being kicked out of first
class on a train despite having a ticket and

34
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:11,568
being asked to eat dinner in his room so as
not to offend other hotel guests in the restaurant,

35
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:15,729
all because of his colour.
After travelling to Pretoria, he met some

36
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:20,568
Christian friends and began to study the Christian
religion but vowed not to embrace any other

37
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:23,949
religion before he fully understood his own
– Hinduism.

38
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:29,298
It was the year he spent in Pretoria that
gave him a true knowledge in the legal practice

39
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:33,730
and where he gained the confidence to be a
successful lawyer. After winning the Indian

40
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:38,030
company’s case, Gandhi returned to Durban
in Natal.

41
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:43,348
There he assisted fellow Indians in opposing
a bill that denied them the right to vote.

42
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:48,179
He continued his social activism by helping
found the Natal Indian Congress which helped

43
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,930
the Indian community unite as a political
force.

44
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,968
After three years in South Africa, he returned
to India for six months to pick up his wife

45
00:03:56,968 --> 00:04:01,438
and two sons and brought them all back to
Durban.

46
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:06,049
However on arrival to the port Gandhi discovered
that many of the white residents of Durban

47
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:09,218
were not happy with him and he was charged
with:

48
00:04:09,218 --> 00:04:14,718
1. Taking part in unmerited condemnation of
Natal whites while he was in India.

49
00:04:14,718 --> 00:04:19,719
2. Trying to swamp Natal with Indians by bringing
over shiploads of passengers to achieve this

50
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,810
aim.
Both accusations were false so Gandhi went

51
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:30,089
ashore. He was soon surrounded by a crowd
who threw stones, bricks and rotten eggs at

52
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:35,779
him. Luckily the police soon arrived and escorted
him to his friend’s house. The crowds would

53
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:41,168
not disperse so Gandhi eventually fled the
house, disguised as a police constable. He

54
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:46,639
made a statement saying he did not want to
prosecute anyone who attacked him.

55
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,740
Gandhi proved his innocence of both charges
through being interviewed by the press and

56
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,019
they declared him innocent. Gandhi and his
wife had two more sons in South Africa after

57
00:04:56,019 --> 00:05:02,099
which he took a vow of celibacy.
In 1900, soon after the Boer War broke out,

58
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,710
Gandhi and a group of his friends created
an Ambulance corps, carrying the wounded on

59
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:11,339
stretchers within the line of fire, participating
on the side of the British Empire.

60
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:16,000
Once he was relieved of war duties, Gandhi
returned to India. He went on a tour of the

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,228
country, travelling third class to acquaint
himself with the hardships of third class

62
00:05:20,228 --> 00:05:28,318
passengers. The journey spanned from Calcutta
to Benares, Agra, Jaipur, Palanpur and Rajkot,

63
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,879
spending one day in each city. He then went
back to South Africa, this time leaving his

64
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,879
family back in India.
Gandhi set up an office in Johannesburg. He

65
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:43,199
worked as an editor for the weekly newspaper,
“Indian Opinion”. Around this time Gandhi

66
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,669
was strongly influenced by a book he read
called “Unto This Last” by John Ruskin.

67
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:52,568
Gandhi took three main principles from the
book’s teaching:

68
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:56,680
1. The good of the individual is contained
in the good of all.

69
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,978
2. A lawyer’s work has the same value as
a barber’s, in so much as they all have

70
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:04,978
the same right of earning their livelihood
from their work.

71
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:11,339
3. A life of labour, i.e. manual labour, is
a life worth living.

72
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:15,508
Gandhi changed his life according to these
points and created the Phoenix Settlement,

73
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:20,439
a farm where he would live with others and
publish the Indian Opinion newspaper. Everyone

74
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:26,879
working there would receive the same salary
regardless of race, nationality or job type.

75
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,710
Gandhi tried to persuade his European friends
at the settlement to get married and also

76
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:35,329
invited Indian friends to bring their families
over from home. It wasn’t long until the

77
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:40,758
settlement had developed into a small village.
In Phoenix, simplicity was introduced where

78
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:46,098
possible and personal physical labour was
preferred. For example, instead of buying

79
00:06:46,098 --> 00:06:50,439
bread from the bakers, they began to make
their own. Gandhi brought his family over

80
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:54,569
again and the children were happy to help
out with the work.

81
00:06:54,569 --> 00:07:00,629
Then in 1906, the British government declared
war against the Zulus in Natal. Gandhi created

82
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:05,060
the Indian ambulance corps again, working
on the front line, this time helping carry

83
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:10,949
and nurse innocent, wounded Zulus that had
been shot by mistake by the British soldiers.

84
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:15,370
After the so called “rebellion” was coming
to an end, Gandhi went to Johannesburg.

85
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:21,990
At this time Gandhi began further experimenting
with his diet. He practiced fasting and later

86
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:27,720
a pure fruit diet, his ambition being to live
the life of the poorest people. At other times

87
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,370
he gave up salt and milk, thinking they were
not necessary. His belief on fasting was that

88
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:39,519
it was very helpful when working towards self-restraint.
At the outbreak of the First World War, Gandhi

89
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,189
was arriving in England on a boat. He planned
to participate in an ambulance corps once

90
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:49,459
again but fell ill. The doctors suggested
a temperate climate might aid his recovery,

91
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:55,508
so he returned to India in 1915.
Previously while he was in South Africa, Gandhi’s

92
00:07:55,509 --> 00:08:00,538
thoughts had led to him developing what was
to be called “satyagraha”. It translates

93
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:06,098
roughly as “insistence to the truth” and
refers to non-violent protest and resistance.

94
00:08:06,098 --> 00:08:12,529
In India, Gandhi joined the National Congress.
He was now a strong public speaker and negotiator

95
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:17,788
after years of practice. He was asked by Indian
labourers in Champaran to help them as they

96
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:23,500
were being supressed, taxed and forced to
grow crops for their mainly British landlords.

97
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:30,168
Gandhi visited them and proposed satyagraha,
i.e. non-violent mass civil disobedience.

98
00:08:30,168 --> 00:08:35,689
He was arrested for creating unrest and was
ordered to leave but he refused. Hundreds

99
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,279
of thousands of people protested and he was
released. Gandhi led the protests against

100
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:46,778
the landlords who eventually signed an agreement
offering more compensation to the tenants.

101
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:51,990
After consulting with friends, Gandhi decided
to open primary schools in six villages. All

102
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:57,430
the villagers had to agree to, was to provide
board and lodging for the teachers. Gandhi

103
00:08:57,429 --> 00:09:01,979
then successfully appealed publically for
voluntary teachers.

104
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,149
His next step was to improve the sanitary
conditions of the villages. For this he borrowed

105
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:10,539
doctors from other roles for periods of six
months or so.

106
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:17,509
In 1918, Gandhi led another campaign of satyagraha
in Kheda, which had been hit by floods. Many

107
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:21,439
peasants there were facing famine and wanted
relief from tax payments until the famine

108
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,560
was over. In the end after several months,
the government agreed to the delayed payment

109
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,958
of the taxes.
During the First World War, Gandhi agreed

110
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,189
to actively recruit fellow Indians to help
the war effort, despite not willing to injure

111
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,750
or kill anybody himself. He believed that
the willing of Indians to help the British

112
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,419
Empire in its hour of need would quicken and
increase the chances of racial distinctions

113
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:49,009
being eradicated within the Empire against
Indians.

114
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:53,509
Around this time, Gandhi also tried to appeal
to Indian Muslims and supported them in many

115
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:59,700
of their causes. As a result, Gandhi became
popular in both the Hindu and Muslim communities

116
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,879
and was able to promote and instigate his
form of peaceful resistance across India against

117
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:09,259
the British rule.
Many peaceful civilians were killed by British

118
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:14,549
troops with the intention to prevent a violent
uprising, but it only made Gandhi more popular

119
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:19,458
and the movement stronger.
He led the Congress to reorganise itself with

120
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:24,849
a new constitution which would work towards
complete independence.

121
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:29,589
Gandhi thought the removal of poverty would
help establish independence. One way to achieve

122
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:35,610
this would be to advocate the wearing of homespun
cloth instead of British-made clothing materials.

123
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:41,528
He tried to get as many Indians as possible
to make the garments, male or female, rich

124
00:10:41,528 --> 00:10:45,299
or poor.
Gandhi finishes his autobiography by stating

125
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:49,439
that his latest principal experiments, all
made through the Congress, have left history

126
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,980
still in the making and his conclusions on
the experiments are not yet decisive. History

127
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,659
now proves that his movement for Indian independence
was not only ultimately successful, but he

128
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,419
has influenced and inspired freedom and civil
rights movements throughout the world.
