00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:23,600
Douglas Robert Steuart Bader was born on 21st
February 1910. He and his older brother, Derick,

2
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,390
often argued when they were youngsters, with
Douglas constantly leaping at any challenges

3
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,340
and dares from his brother.
He excelled at sports at school but did not

4
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,590
apply himself with academia until he had to
pass a test to enrol at Cranwell Royal Air

5
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,390
Force College, with a view to joining the
RAF.

6
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,539
His flying rating was described as “above
average” in his official report at Cranwell

7
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:50,268
and he was posted to Number 23 squadron to
fly Gloster Gamecock fighter aircraft, with

8
00:00:50,268 --> 00:00:56,558
a top speed of 156 miles per hour.
He was based in Kenley and in-between flying

9
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:02,298
represented the RAF in rugby and cricket.
The squadron were given Bristol Bulldog fighters

10
00:01:02,298 --> 00:01:09,390
which flew up to 176mph. Bader was also playing
rugby for local team Harlequins and several

11
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,010
good performances got him a call up to play
for England, earning his cap against the Springboks

12
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,439
of South Africa.
A few months later on 14th December 1931,

13
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,280
Bader was taking off from Woodley Aerodrome
where some younger pilots had dared him to

14
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,530
demonstrate some acrobatics in his Bulldog.
Whilst doing a roll the left wingtip hit the

15
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,599
ground and the aircraft cartwheeled into a
crumpled wreck.

16
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,669
Bader drifted in and out of consciousness
in the ambulance and was soon on the hospital

17
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:43,920
operating table. The crash had badly damaged
his legs. His right leg was amputated above

18
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,259
his smashed right knee. They tried to keep
the left leg but septicaemia and gangrene

19
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,069
set in and it too, was amputated, six inches
below the knee.

20
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:58,478
It was exactly one month and one day after
the crash that Bader was able to get up for

21
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:05,299
the first time, heaving himself onto a wheelchair.
That day was the 13th January and after another

22
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:09,860
operation to trim the bone near his stumps,
he eventually left the hospital for good in

23
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,380
April.
He was transferred to an RAF hospital in Uxbridge.

24
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:18,419
He was allowed to venture out and even managed
to drive a car by using his one strong leg

25
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:24,229
for the accelerator and brake, and an umbrella
to press the clutch when changing gear.

26
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:28,439
Seven months after the accident, he walked
out of a building on his new artificial metal

27
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:33,329
legs. He’d lost about an inch in height
but for the first time since the crash, he

28
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:39,569
looked and felt like an ordinary chap.
After passing his disabled drivers test, the

29
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:44,949
next step was to learn to fly again. Bader
was convinced he could do it, as it required

30
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:50,009
less legwork than driving.
He passed his RAF medical test and was deemed

31
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:55,340
fit to fly on dual flights with an instructor
but flying was so natural to him, he was soon

32
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:01,360
flying solo, albeit whilst not being allowed.
However, when he went to see which flying

33
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,159
category the medical board would issue for
him, he was disappointed to be told by the

34
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:08,949
Wing Commander that they couldn’t pass him
fit for flying because there’s nothing in

35
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:13,289
the King’s Regulations which covered his
case and he’d have to settle for a ground

36
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:17,400
job.
But Bader did not want a ground job and soon

37
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,230
he received a letter from the Air Ministry
informing him that he can no longer be employed

38
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:26,158
by the RAF and suggested he retired due to
ill health.

39
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:31,188
He now had no job and nowhere to live but
Bader soon rented a room in London and also

40
00:03:31,188 --> 00:03:36,120
got an office job there selling aviation spirit
to airlines and governments. He didn’t much

41
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,930
like the job, but it did give him the money
to support his future wife, Thelma, who he’d

42
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,909
met soon after his accident, and his spirits
were raised when they got engaged. They married

43
00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:51,259
soon after.
In 1939 Bader wrote to the Air Ministry asking

44
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:57,560
for a flying refresher course should there
be a war. “No” was the response. An old

45
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,299
colleague in the RAF also wrote on Bader’s
behalf and got a slightly more positive answer,

46
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:07,870
“No” but if war was to break out they’d
almost certainly want his services if the

47
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,269
doctor agreed.
On the day Prime Minister Chamberlain announced

48
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:16,798
Britain had gone to war, Bader wrote again.
He received a telegram asking him to report

49
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,839
to the Air Ministry selection board. This
time he passed the medical and later after

50
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,859
not flying for seven years passed that test
too.

51
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,080
Whilst training he got to fly the Hurricane
fighter aircraft and his final report described

52
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:37,939
his flying ability as “exceptional”. He
was posted to 19 squadron in Duxford. In his

53
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:43,170
new squadron he got to fly the Spitfire for
the first time. Soon he became leader of his

54
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:48,569
section and eventually became a flight lieutenant
as he was promoted to flight commander of

55
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:52,209
222 squadron.
After what seemed like a never-ending period

56
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:57,599
of leading the squadron in aerobatics, formation
flying and routine patrols, Bader’s first

57
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,050
engagement with the enemy in the Second World
War came over Dunkirk.

58
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:08,860
His first kill was a Messerschmitt 109, shooting
it down with his Spitfire’s guns. The remaining

59
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,830
patrols in Dunkirk were uneventful for Bader.
After that he was promoted again and given

60
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:21,430
his own squadron, 242. It was a Canadian squadron,
the only one in the RAF, and he was their

61
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:27,389
new squadron leader, flying Hurricanes again.
With his discipline and his tendency to lead

62
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:33,339
from the front, Bader soon had the squadron
in tip-top shape and morale was high. He shot

63
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:38,469
down a lone Dornier after being alerted to
a suspicious aircraft over England. He’d

64
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,250
gone up himself as the weather was so bad.
This was soon followed by another Dornier

65
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:48,939
kill near Yarmouth.
Bader’s first major battle was on 30th August

66
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:55,019
1940. 242 squadron was scrambled and their
18 Hurricanes intercepted over 100 German

67
00:05:55,019 --> 00:06:01,159
aircraft, mainly bombers. In the ensuing battle,
Bader registered two kills and the squadron

68
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,620
had downed 12 aircraft in total, without any
damage to a single Hurricane.

69
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,680
Bader discussed and tried out new tactics
for the air battle. He came up with a new

70
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,660
formation, where five squadrons would fly
together, called “12 Group Wing”.

71
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,630
The wing was a success and they managed 52
kills in one day at their peak. Bader was

72
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:27,800
awarded the Distinguished Service Order medal.
When the Battle of Britain was over, the 12

73
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:35,090
Group Wing had shot down 152 enemies whilst
losing 30 of their own pilots. By the end

74
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:40,060
of 1940, 242 squadron had one DSO and nine
Distinguished Flying Crosses, one of which

75
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:45,180
was awarded to Bader.
Next Bader was chosen to fly in a secret operation

76
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,670
called “First Offensive Sweep”. He was
to be part of three fighter squadrons supporting

77
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:56,560
bombers flying into France to bomb German
ammunition dumps. The mission was a success

78
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,290
and soon Bader was told to leave 242 squadron
as he was put in charge of three Spitfire

79
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:06,550
squadrons ready to continue these fighter
sweeps into enemy territory. He’d been promoted

80
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:11,750
to Wing Commander.
The sweeps into France continued. Often the

81
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,620
three squadrons would fly alone. Sometimes
they’d join other fighters in a “beehive”

82
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:22,060
formation, which consisted of 100 or so fighters
surrounding and protecting a bomber.

83
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:27,180
Bader led the wing on every raid and had 20½
confirmed enemy aircraft destroyed. He had

84
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:33,310
a veil of invincibility but then one day the
unthinkable happened. Whilst dog fighting

85
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:38,519
with some Messerschmitts, something hit his
aircraft. It must have been an enemy fighter

86
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:43,529
as when he turned around the rest of the aircraft
was missing. He tried to get out of the cockpit

87
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:49,000
but his metal leg was trapped. Luckily he
could unclip it. Having legs would have sent

88
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,250
him down with the Spitfire but instead he
was parachuting down to France and was knocked

89
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,920
unconscious on landing.
He was soon discovered by three German officers

90
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,310
and was taken to a nearby hospital in Saint
Omer. He asked the Germans to recover his

91
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:08,189
leg, which they did, but the leg was damaged
so he asked them to repair it, which they

92
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:10,709
also did.
He knew that once he was transferred to a

93
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:15,959
prison camp in Germany it would be extremely
difficult to escape. He enlisted the help

94
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:20,639
of a French nurse at the hospital, who gave
him a note from a local French couple, saying

95
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,360
their son would be waiting outside the hospital
gates between midnight and 2am each night

96
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,410
to help him, if he managed to escape. When
it was announced he was being transferred

97
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:35,750
to Germany the next day, that evening Bader
tied together 15 bed sheets from his ward

98
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,799
and descended on them after clambering out
the window.

99
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:44,370
After meeting the couple’s son, he was taken
to the nearby French family home but was discovered

100
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:48,009
by the Germans hiding in the shed when they
came to search the property.

101
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:53,588
This time the Germans took no chances. They
took Bader’s metal legs and drove him to

102
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:57,250
Brussels, where he was put on a train and
guarded whilst it travelled to Germany.

103
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:02,750
Bader spent the next few months in various
prisoner of war camps. One of the largest

104
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:09,360
was Warburg, which consisted of a huge cage
that held 3,000 men, a quarter of a mile square.

105
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,688
Once in Germany they had given him his legs
back, but the living conditions were dire.

106
00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:19,679
Here Bader was part of several plans to escape,
including digging tunnels and picking locks,

107
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:24,859
but none of them were successful for him.
The most extravagant plan came later at another

108
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,329
camp, when he was involved in making a glider
to escape, flying from the high castle walls

109
00:09:29,328 --> 00:09:35,149
of the camp he was in at the time. They intended
to use bed boards to build the frame, with

110
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:40,519
sheets for wings and glue made out of potatoes,
but they never got to finish it.

111
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:45,240
Eventually, after three and a half years in
captivity, with a final night consisting of

112
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,500
the constant noise of non-stop shelling, he
was greeted at dawn by the view of American

113
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:55,528
soldiers entering the camp and German guards
handing over their rifles, one by one. He

114
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:59,198
was now free.
He caught a lift with a young American pilot

115
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:04,438
to Versailles where he spoke to his wife on
the phone,. From there he was driven to Paris

116
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:10,088
and then flown to London where, after a medical,
he drove to Ascot to be reunited with Thelma.

117
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:17,269
On 15th September 1945, Bader was given the
role of organising and leading a victory flypast

118
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:25,419
over London to celebrate peace. Over 300 aircraft
took part. He finished the war with 22½ official

119
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:32,028
kills, two DSOs and two DFCs. He is seen by
many as the best fighter leader and tactician

120
00:10:32,028 --> 00:10:32,929
from the Second World War.
