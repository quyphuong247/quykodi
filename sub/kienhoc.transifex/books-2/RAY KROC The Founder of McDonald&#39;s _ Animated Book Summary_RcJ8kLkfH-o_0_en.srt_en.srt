00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:20,000
Ray Kroc is the man who turned McDonald’s
from a single restaurant into the fast-food

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,070
giant it is today.
His family did not have much money growing

3
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:29,239
up but Kroc had a happy childhood. He liked
playing baseball and learnt playing piano

4
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:35,620
at the age of 6. He was also good at selling
things, even at a young age. His entrepreneurial

5
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:41,219
endeavours included running a lemonade stand
and starting a music store with his friends.

6
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,359
This early work set Kroc on the path to becoming
a successful businessman.

7
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:52,429
In 1917, the United States entered World War
I. At 15, he lied about his age to join the

8
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:57,658
Red Cross and help the war effort. He trained
to be an ambulance driver but the war was

9
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:03,018
over before he could go abroad.
After the war, Kroc got married and had a

10
00:01:03,018 --> 00:01:08,328
daughter. To support his young family he took
a job selling paper cups to restaurants. It

11
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:12,519
did not take him long to become one of the
best salesmen in the company.

12
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:16,789
He experimented with other jobs such as selling
real estate and playing the piano but it was

13
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:22,039
clear selling was what he did best. He returned
to the Lily-Tulip Cup Company and became a

14
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:27,590
sales manager for the Midwest region.
One of his customers was a businessman who

15
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,978
owned several ice cream shops in Chicago.
He had invented a machine that could make

16
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:37,420
five milk shakes at once called the Multimixer.
Kroc tried to get his company to sell the

17
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,560
Multimixer as he knew it was a great product
but they were not interested. So in 1939,

18
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,659
he made the huge decision to quit his job
and start his own company selling the Multimixer

19
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:53,149
to other restaurants and ice cream stands.
As he was an excellent salesman, Kroc developed

20
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:58,179
his company into a very successful outfit.
He employed tactics such as inventing new

21
00:01:58,179 --> 00:02:03,079
drinks to make with his machine and a decade
later he was selling over 9,000 Multimixers

22
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:10,609
a year in cities all around the country.
By the 50s, Kroc began losing customers. People

23
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,540
were moving from the cities into suburbs and
drove to large restaurants instead of going

24
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:19,900
to independent ice cream stands. As a result,
the ice cream stands went out of business

25
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,840
and were no longer Kroc’s customers.
Kroc was still getting plenty of business

26
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,140
from one small restaurant. It was called McDonald’s
in San Bernardino, California and they had

27
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:33,599
eight Multimixers. Kroc went to visit the
brothers who owned the restaurant, Maurice

28
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,359
and Richard McDonald in 1954 and discovered
it was a very small restaurant with people

29
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,220
queuing up outside, ordering food from a window.
The food was very limited as they only sold

30
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:50,400
burgers, fries, soft drinks and milk shakes
but the food was served extremely quickly.

31
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,110
Kroc thought the restaurant was a brilliant
idea and suggested to the brothers that they

32
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,850
expand their business. The brothers refused
as they didn’t want the added responsibility.

33
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:04,159
Instead, Kroc offered to start a restaurant
franchise. The three of them agreed that Kroc

34
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:10,479
could use the McDonald’s name and the brothers
would get a percentage of the sales. In 1955,

35
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:15,599
Kroc started his franchise company, McDonald’s
System Inc. and opened his first McDonald’s

36
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,310
in Des Plaines in April that year.
The McDonald brothers taught him how to run

37
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,509
the restaurant like they did, including how
to prepare and serve the food in such a quick

38
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:31,929
way, thanks to an efficient setup in the kitchen.
On the restaurant’s first day, Kroc made

39
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:37,090
$366. He worked extremely hard at his restaurant
to ensure it was a success, from picking up

40
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,920
rubbish outside to make the restaurant look
attractive and clean to training his workers

41
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,869
to remember quality, cleanliness and service
were all important.

42
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,039
Kroc also helped other people set up new McDonald’s
restaurants as franchises. In the first year,

43
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:57,120
he sold 18 franchises and by 1957 there were
40 McDonald’s.

44
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,810
Consistency was important to Kroc. As well
as each restaurant being called the same,

45
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:05,090
he wanted every customer to have the same
experience so there were many rules to follow

46
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:11,650
for each franchise owner. The menu had to
be the same and each item on the menu had

47
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:17,189
to be prepared the same way regardless of
which restaurant a customer was eating in.

48
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:21,759
This strategy worked and some franchise owners
were making more money than Kroc was.

49
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,330
Kroc’s next step toward success was to set
up a real estate company. The company would

50
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:32,399
buy the land that franchisees could then rent
to run a McDonald’s restaurant on. There

51
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:38,069
were two major benefits of this system. One
it let Kroc choose the location for each new

52
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,899
McDonald’s and two, it made him a lot of
money.

53
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:49,399
By 1960, Kroc sold his Malt-A-Mixer Company
and McDonald’s System Inc. became McDonald’s

54
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:54,409
Corporation. Kroc was sharing the profits
from the 228 restaurants he now had with the

55
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,420
McDonald’s brothers and in 1961 he agreed
to buy the McDonald’s name from them for

56
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:06,939
$2.7million to take sole control of the company.
Throughout the rest of the 60s, Kroc entered

57
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:12,579
a period of vast expansion opening restaurants
all over the US and into Canada and Puerto

58
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:15,469
Rico.
He enforced his strict rules at each restaurant

59
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:21,240
to ensure consistency and conformity but did
allow franchisees to suggest new ideas. In

60
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:28,069
1962 in Cincinnati the Filet-O-Fish was added
to the menu. In 1968 in Pittsburgh the Big

61
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:32,699
Mac was introduced.
Kroc was also quick to acknowledge when he

62
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:37,379
was wrong. The Hulaburger was introduced as
a slice of grilled pineapple and two slices

63
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:42,540
of cheese on a bun with no meat. It did not
prove popular and was quickly taken off the

64
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,860
menu.
Kroc pitched McDonald’s as family-friendly

65
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,430
restaurants, promoting the fact that they
were clean and affordable places to eat on

66
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,650
TV and in magazines.
In 1963, Ronald McDonald was introduced as

67
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:59,409
a playful clown, soon becoming one of the
most recognised children’s characters in

68
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:05,030
the world and a very successful marketing
mascot. Many of his restaurants also introduced

69
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:11,019
play areas where children could have fun to
maintain the family-friendly theme.

70
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:16,789
1979 saw the rollout of Happy Meals to each
McDonald’s. Each meal included a small toy

71
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,330
and proved extremely popular with children.
It therefore was also an extremely powerful

72
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:27,948
marketing tool, allowing tie-ins with films,
TV shows or toy brands.

73
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:32,300
Kroc became extremely wealthy from McDonald’s
and donated part of his fortune to charity

74
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:38,460
through donations and other charitable activities.
He started the Kroc Foundation in 1969 to

75
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:44,819
raise money to help fight diseases such as
diabetes, arthritis and multiple sclerosis.

76
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:50,050
Kroc retired as CEO from the McDonald’s
Corporation in 1973 but still stayed active

77
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,770
on the board of directors and carried on working
for McDonald’s until he died in 1984.

78
00:06:55,769 --> 00:07:03,279
His legacy continues to this day and the company
has over 36,000 restaurants in 119 countries.

79
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,939
Ray Kroc’s simple idea of making food fast,
convenient and consistent has changed the

80
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:13,500
way many people eat forever. His hard work,
skill as a salesman and interest in innovation

81
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,360
has helped McDonald’s become one of the
greatest business success stories in the world.
