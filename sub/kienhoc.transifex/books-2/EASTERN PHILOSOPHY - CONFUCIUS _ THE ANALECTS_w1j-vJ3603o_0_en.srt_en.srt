1
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:14,708
"A person is worthy of being a teacher if
he is able to gain new insights from chewing

2
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:16,629
over what he already knew"

3
00:00:16,629 --> 00:00:21,519
You cannot teach any craft unless you have
gained perfect control over the basics as

4
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:23,089
well as difficult moves.

5
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:26,678
You should be able to answer any question
your disciple asks.

6
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:32,719
You have to ensure that you can effortlessly
expound on any detail or nuance about your

7
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,549
craft.

8
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:36,529
As a teacher, you should never forget the
basics.

9
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,719
Constantly revise what you have already learned
while trying out new techniques

10
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,259
It's so easy to turn conceited after years
of practice, you should be conscious of this

11
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:47,079
cancerous boastfulness.

12
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:50,649
If left untamed, it'll slowly transform into
arrogance.

13
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:53,039
This arrogance gives birth to envy.

14
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,600
You'll turn envious toward any disciple who
tries to surpass you & you'll strive to plot

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,079
for their downfall.

16
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:03,219
Remember, you're sole purpose is to help the
weak ascend to your level

17
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:07,500
And not to act like the boss & soak up everyone's
praise & approval because you have a black

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,489
belt or whatever.

19
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:14,140
Hence a true master needs to be as humble
in his learning as his students & as eager

20
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,219
to further his knowledge like themselves.

21
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:23,908
Mastery calls for continual refinement of
the wisdom you already possess & a firm keenness

22
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,040
for novel insights.

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:35,450
"The Superior Man is all-embracing and not
partial. The inferior man is partial and not

24
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:35,909
all-embracing."

25
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,859
A superior man is all embracing, meaning he's
concerned about his self-interest as well

26
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,340
as other people's needs

27
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,359
He's generous & helpful in times of need.

28
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:51,430
His character is poised & balanced: audacious
yet humble, bold yet sensitive, agressive

29
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,580
yet sympathetic.

30
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:58,670
He knows how & when to access different facets
of his personality depending on the situation.

31
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,109
if someone crosses his boundaries for example,
he will not hesitate to show anger to shield

32
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:04,079
his beliefs.

33
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,469
With great men, he's a man and a half.

34
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:08,919
With wolves, he's a fox and a half.

35
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,919
on the second half of the quote, we've got
the inferior, partial man.

36
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:17,568
This guy's intentions are everlastingly directed
toward self-interest per se.

37
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:23,479
Continuously looking for the fastest lane
to get what he wants by any means: manipulation,

38
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:26,039
traps, deception & the like.

39
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:31,060
He will often lure you into thinking it's
a win-win collaboration yet his underlying

40
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,340
motives are nothing but to make use of your
efforts.

41
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,209
The inferior man thinks he's winning over
you but his spiteful attitude brings more

42
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:43,020
enemies than friends & will sooner lead to
his downfall.

43
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,489
His character is a mixture of childish manners
& a chicken's brain.

44
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:50,200
He's far from being a grown man.

45
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,869
his defected persona is unbalanced.

46
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,599
his actions often stem from extremes,

47
00:02:54,598 --> 00:03:00,179
He's either too courageous to an egocentric
extent or too cowardly to a point he gets

48
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,520
fazed by the slightest issues.

49
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,739
He's either too aggressive or too sensitive.

50
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:08,280
Overly bold or
EAsily frightened.

51
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,860
in a phrase, he still has a lot to work on.

52
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:18,550
"To study and not think is a waste. To think
and not study is dangerous."

53
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,410
Let's cut this quote in two halfs.

54
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:24,598
first let's explain part one: "to study and
not think is a waste"

55
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:28,878
Most people turn into theory junkies instead
of trying out what they have learned.

56
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:30,409
for example depression:

57
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:34,799
if you're depressed & have already watched
tons & tons of videos on how to cure depression,

58
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,030
I believe that's sufficient, you don't need
to watch more videos about it, you just have

59
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,909
to apply what you have learned.

60
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:44,378
Stop asking questions you already have the
answer thereof.

61
00:03:44,378 --> 00:03:49,159
If you already know how to cure depression,
you don't need to watch videos about it every

62
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,120
single time you get depressed.

63
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,480
Just use the same techniques that aided in
curing your previous depression.

64
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:59,909
learn to think on your own, solve your own
issues without having to watch someone explain

65
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:02,969
to you things you already know over & over.

66
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:05,959
"to study and not think is a waste"

67
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,650
Nonetheless,
"to think and not study is dangerous."

68
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:15,150
Referring to guidance before acting is as
crucial as acting upon that guidance.

69
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,649
Some people think they can get things done
on their own without refering to a master's

70
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:20,589
advice.

71
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:25,689
For instance, people who start businesses
without ever reading a single business book.

72
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:27,060
How foolish is that ?

73
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,410
and then, they get confused as to why their
business failed ?

74
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:34,090
This is why theory is as vital as practice.

75
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:38,619
Refering to guidance will ensure that you
won't stray from the right path.

76
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,970
Guidance from experts cuts your learning curve
by revealing potential pitfalls that could

77
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,150
hinder your progress.

78
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:48,529
Theory without practice is as mindless as
practice without theory.

79
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:54,049
"To study and not think is a waste. To think
and not study is dangerous."

80
00:04:54,050 --> 00:05:01,139
"To say that you know something when you know
it and to say that you do not know something

81
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:05,319
when you do not know it--this is true knowing"

82
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:10,110
People who pretend to know everything are
often found plagued by seeds of insecurity,

83
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,870
they fear getting judged for not knowing about
some things.

84
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,509
Others are pretentious out of arrogance, they
don't want to be conceived as ignorant or

85
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:19,389
inferior.

86
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:24,350
so they can't help but hide their ignorance
by lying that they are well-informed about

87
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:28,370
all matters.
I call this, fake wisdom.(laughs)

88
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:33,478
You shouldn't talk about things you don't
know, be it online or in real life.

89
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:38,288
One reason is because some experts in that
field will hear you blasting out delusions

90
00:05:38,288 --> 00:05:41,728
& will prove you wrong. you'll get ridiculed.

91
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:43,859
Don't think you're going to get away with
lying.

92
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,569
Always expect a fair level of cleverness in
every individual.

93
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:49,069
in conversations,

94
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:51,790
If questioned on a topic you're clueless about,

95
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,009
Simply say: "I don't know" How hard is that?

96
00:05:55,009 --> 00:06:00,160
be honest about what you know & don't know
but also certain that what you know is not

97
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,070
a delusion.

98
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,269
I've explained this point in the fiftieth
law,

99
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:09,829
It basically means you should confirm that
your sources of knowledge are actually valid.

100
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:13,779
Sometimes it's quite difficult to ascertain
the validity of your sources.

101
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:18,649
For instance, you can literally find a thousand
articles that talk about the same topic & each

102
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:20,679
one of them offers a different perspective.

103
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,280
Well, who's the right one ?

104
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:27,069
in this case, most people, for they don't
want to think too much, take the easy way

105
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:31,930
out. That is to blindly adopt one of those
perspectives as their beliefs.

106
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,069
Don't.

107
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:37,379
If confronted with similar cases, You should
read through these various sources & then

108
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:43,509
devise your own interpretation. One that seems
practical to you & suitable to your own circumstances.

109
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:47,220
"To say that you know something when you know
it

110
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:53,020
and to say that you do not know something
when you do not know it--this is true knowing"
