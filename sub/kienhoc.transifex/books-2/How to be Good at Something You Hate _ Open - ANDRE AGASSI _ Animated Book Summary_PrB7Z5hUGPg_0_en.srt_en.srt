1
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:20,679
Even at the age of seven years old, Andre
Agassi hated tennis. His father used to make

2
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:26,269
him return 2,500 balls a day on the tennis
court, that’s nearly a million a year, all

3
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:30,368
being fired at him from a souped-up ball machine
he called ‘the dragon’.

4
00:00:30,368 --> 00:00:34,570
The tennis court was built by his father in
the backyard of their house, which sat in

5
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:39,350
the middle of the desert next to Las Vegas.
What was a tennis court to most people was

6
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:44,890
a prison to Andre Agassi.
His father was a tough man, a former boxer

7
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:50,049
who represented Iran in the Olympics twice.
In boxing terms he taught Agassi to be a great

8
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:55,599
counter-puncher on the court i.e. a great
returner of serve.

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,460
His mother, Betty married his father in 1959
in Chicago. Andre Kirk Agassi was their fourth

10
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:08,290
child, born 29th April 1970.
At eight years old Agassi started playing

11
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:13,620
tournaments against children under ten. He
won the first seven of them.

12
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,770
At the local tennis club one day, Agassi’s
father spots the famous American football

13
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:23,390
player, Jim Brown. Brown is looking to play
a game for money and a $10,000 wager is set

14
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:28,718
on the outcome of the match between Brown
and a young Andre Agassi, aged nine. While

15
00:01:28,718 --> 00:01:33,589
Agassi’s father gets the money the owner
of the club dissuades Brown from taking the

16
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:38,399
bet and they eventually agree to play two
sets, then decide how much to bet on the third.

17
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:45,179
Agassi wins the first two sets: 6-3 6-3. Jim
Brown decides to only bet $500 on the third,

18
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:50,368
which he loses 6-2.
Andre’s older brother Philly was also made

19
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:54,890
to play tennis and warned Andre that if their
father ever gave him a white pill before a

20
00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:00,968
match, to purposefully play badly and feign
illness. This happened a while later. The

21
00:02:00,968 --> 00:02:05,399
pill his father gave him was speed to try
and give him a competitive edge but Agassi

22
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,370
deliberately lost and the brother’s plan
worked. His father never gave Agassi a pill

23
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,789
again.
Agassi is his father’s last hope of having

24
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:18,120
a child who can become the tennis world number
one so he decides to send him to a tennis

25
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,090
boarding school in Florida which is a boot
camp for young tennis players. The family

26
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:28,340
can only afford to send him for three months
as the school costs $12,000 per year, but

27
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,780
after the owner of the school saw Agassi play,
he called his father, ripped up the cheque

28
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:39,129
and said Agassi can stay free of charge.
Whilst at the school, Agassi rebelled. His

29
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:45,169
grades were bad, he drank, smoked pot and
got an earring and a pink Mohawk. At 14 years

30
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:48,349
old he quit schooling and took up tennis training
full time.

31
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:54,090
At 15 he was receiving wildcard entries to
tournaments, beating grown men and working

32
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,590
his way up the rankings. He received no prize
money as an amateur but did get paid expenses.

33
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:05,960
On his 16th birthday he turned professional.
His brother Philly became his full time travel

34
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,420
partner, helping Agassi with everything when
he hit the road.

35
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:15,199
His first tournament as a pro sees him reach
the final. His first grand slam was the 1986

36
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:22,049
US Open, but he lost in the first round. He
does, however, break into the world top 100.

37
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,740
Agassi then goes on a losing streak and is
on the verge of quitting the sport due to

38
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,670
lack of money, to the point where he gave
away his rackets to some homeless people in

39
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:34,949
a park, but in what was to be his last tournament,
he beats the Wimbledon Champion Pat Rafter

40
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:40,509
in a huge upset.
In 1987 Agassi wins his first tournament as

41
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:47,319
a professional, the winner’s cheque is $90,000.
His popularity increases in 1988 and people

42
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:51,949
in the crowd imitate his look, sporting denim
shorts and a mullet haircut.

43
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:56,429
He moves up the rankings to number four in
the world but struggles in longer games due

44
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:03,000
to his lack of size and strength. In the second
half of 1989 he starts training with Gil Reyes,

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
the University of Nevada, Las Vegas strength
coach and his conditioning greatly improves.

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,800
He sets himself a target to win a Grand Slam.
One little known fact when Agassi was playing

47
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,560
tennis as a young pro was that despite being
known for his long hair, he was in fact going

48
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,930
bald and was wearing a hairpiece. In 1990
he reaches his first Grand Slam final at the

49
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:29,060
French Open but loses. He was more nervous
than normal as his hairpiece had fallen apart

50
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,280
in the shower the night before and he was
worried it would unclip and expose his secret

51
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,369
to the world during the match.
By August 1990 he’d put on ten pounds of

52
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:44,310
muscle and had made the final of another Grand
Slam, this time the US Open. He’d removed

53
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,540
the hairpiece in favour of a thick hairband
and coloured highlights but it doesn’t help

54
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,430
and he loses again.
At the French Open in 1991 he again reaches

55
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:59,180
the final but loses for a third time. His
fourth Grand Slam final was at Wimbledon in

56
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:05,709
1992 and at the age of 22 he finally becomes
a Grand Slam Champion. He calls his father

57
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:10,039
after the match and can hear him wiping away
tears and sniffling on the other end of the

58
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,910
line. He’s made his father proud.
Agassi doesn’t play much tennis over the

59
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,870
next few months due to a wrist injury and
eventually has surgery. Around this time he

60
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,180
starts dating the actress, Brooke Shields.
He also gets a new tennis coach – the former

61
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,560
player, Brad Gilbert.
Agassi goes on a losing streak whilst learning

62
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,829
his new coach’s methods of training and
enters the 1994 US Open unseeded with a world

63
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:41,509
ranking of twenty. He becomes the first unseeded
player to win the US Open since 1966. The

64
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:45,370
first player ever to achieve that was the
grandfather of Brooke Shields and she’s

65
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,939
sitting in Agassi’s box in the crowd to
see him win.

66
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:53,550
Before the next Slam, Agassi shaves all his
hair off. It makes no difference to his game

67
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,819
as he wins his second Grand Slam in a row
and becomes the Australian Open Champion.

68
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:03,189
A few weeks later after some more good performances,
Andre Agassi is announced as the new world

69
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:08,800
number one, the 12th player to be number one
since the rankings began, twenty years previously.

70
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,329
He’s become the best in the world at what
he does at 25 years of age.

71
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:18,629
His next challenge is to win all four Grand
Slams. He’s won three already and just needs

72
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:23,610
the French Open to complete the set and become
the first American to do so.

73
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,550
In the meantime, Agassi proposes to Brooke
Shields after being an item for a couple of

74
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:33,139
years and they start planning their wedding.
Agassi also follows in his father’s footsteps

75
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:38,400
in 1996 and becomes an Olympian. He wins gold
at the Atlanta Olympics.

76
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:45,388
On 19th April 1997, Agassi and Brooke Shields
got married. However, on the court things

77
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:50,620
were not good. Agassi was losing matches,
many in the first round of tournaments and

78
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:56,019
on top of that, he’d started taking drugs
and getting high. His ranking slips to 141

79
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:59,829
in the world.
He is told that he’s failed a drugs test

80
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:05,589
and could face a suspension from tennis. He
writes to the ATP and lies, saying his drink

81
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:10,929
was spiked with crystal meth and he didn’t
knowingly take drugs. The ATP accepts his

82
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,590
explanation and the failed test is thrown
out.

83
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:20,109
Around this time Agassi meets Nelson Mandela
and despite being at this low point is inspired

84
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:25,120
to turn his life around. He begins training
in tennis properly again and starts entering

85
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,009
low ranking tournaments, eventually winning
them.

86
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:33,800
But as his world ranking improves, his relationship
with Brooke Shields worsens. They’ve grown

87
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,860
apart and divorce five years after first getting
to know each other.

88
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:45,330
In 1999 Agassi enters the French Open. He’s
29, which is old in tennis terms and it could

89
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:50,229
be his last chance to win his fourth, and
so far elusive, Grand Slam. He reaches the

90
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:55,169
final where he finds himself two sets down
but battles back winning the next three, and

91
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:58,779
the Championship.
The Women’s Champion that year was Steffi

92
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:03,978
Graf. Graff and Agassi were the only two people
to have won all four Grand Slams and an Olympic

93
00:08:03,978 --> 00:08:11,399
gold medal. Later in 1999, Agassi and Graf
start a relationship. Graf announces her retirement

94
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:16,429
from tennis soon after but Agassi goes from
strength to strength, winning the US Open,

95
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:21,959
his fifth Slam and regaining the world number
one ranking. He continues by winning the 2000

96
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:28,899
Australian Open the next year, a feat he repeats
in 2001 to become a seven-time Slam winner.

97
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:34,750
In 2001, Agassi marries Graf and they have
their first child, a son. He’s also built

98
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:39,679
a school that has just opened as part of a
charitable foundation that he previously started.

99
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:47,669
In 2003 Agassi wins the Australian Open again,
his eighth and last Grand Slam victory. Later

100
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:52,188
that year Agassi and Graf have their second
child, this time a daughter.

101
00:08:52,188 --> 00:08:59,099
The 2006 US Open was Agassi’s last tournament.
Severe back problems forced his retirement

102
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:04,790
after 21 years playing the sport as a career.
It was a sport he openly admitted to hating

103
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:09,188
many times, but is nonetheless considered
one of the greatest ever players of it.
