1
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,028
It's not that we have a short time to live,
but that we waste much of it.

2
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:23,989
Life is long enough,
and it's been given to us in generous measure

3
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:27,269
for accomplishing the greatist things...

4
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:30,399
Alright, so Seneca was looking around and
seeing

5
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,409
how everyone was complaining about
how short life is,

6
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:36,509
and he said,
"Look, life isn't short.

7
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:41,619
You're just wasting most of it."
"You're always drunk and unconscious."

8
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:45,329
"You're willing to spend time with people
that add no meaning to your life

9
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,399
and that you don't even like."
"You come home and fight with your wife

10
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:54,189
until it's time to go to sleep."
"You're willing to work as a slave for someone

11
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:58,539
until you're 60 and done with public duties."
"And then when you're 60

12
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:01,809
and finally wake up,
you look at life and say,

13
00:01:01,808 --> 00:01:03,269
'Where did it all go?'"

14
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,549
And I thought, "Wow!"
I mean 2,000 years have passed and just look

15
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:13,579
around you.
Nothing has changed. Absolutely nothing!

16
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:16,459
He says,
"Look back at your life..."

17
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:19,179
Start adding up all the stupid things
you spent your life on.

18
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,420
And let's make that relevant for today...
Hanging out with people that you don't even

19
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,280
like,
and then coming home and making sure that

20
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,109
you also
don't miss out on their really important Facebook

21
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:32,500
status.
Spending hours passed out drunk,

22
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,109
unconsciously watching TV,
constanstly fighting with your spouse about

23
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:40,560
stupid little things,
doing your little meaningless duties,

24
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,530
that you feel like you MUST do.
You actually don't HAVE TO do

25
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,509
most of the things you think you have to do.

26
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,040
But now, add up all those hours,
and it turns out you've had plenty of time!

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,630
All those hours are plenty of time
for you to have lived a great life.

28
00:01:57,629 --> 00:01:59,420
But you didn't,
and instead,

29
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,710
you now complain about the shortness of life.

30
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:08,000
And this is really hard for people to understand.
There's nothing I value more than my time.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,949
I'm like really greedy with my time,
and I get shit for it all the time.

32
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:15,599
But here's the thing...
It's always a choice that you have to make,

33
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,870
and everything comes at a cost.
Let's say I dedicate an hour to talking

34
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,819
to a friend of mine
who wants to bitch about how he hates work...

35
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:28,979
Now, what am I giving up when I do that?
Well, I could've dedicated that hour

36
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:33,698
to doing something that I think is meaningful
or something that I actually enjoy.

37
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:38,010
I could have spent quality time with my girlfriend,
or a friend who I'm going to learn from,

38
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:41,539
or who's going to add more happiness or meaning
to my life.

39
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:44,698
Because when I'm dying,
I'm not going to look back at my life and

40
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:48,199
say,
"I'm so happy I gave my time

41
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:51,480
to every person who wanted to bitch
and complain about something."

42
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:56,768
"And I'm so glad that I listened to some rumors
that I really didn't give a shit about

43
00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:00,370
but hey, at least I was really polite."
No...

44
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,349
I'm going to say,
"I'm happy I spent time doing what I thought

45
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,599
was meaningful
and doing what I loved.

46
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,439
I'm glad I spent time with people who were
actually important..."

47
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,060
Seneca says,
"Do you just hand out your money to everyone?"

48
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,969
Probably not, right?
If you had a friend who asked you for a $100

49
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:20,780
every other day,
he probably wouldn't stay your friend for

50
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,469
too long, right?
So why are you handing out your time to everyone

51
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:29,689
whenever they want to bitch about something,
or when they're just wasting your time?

52
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:34,709
I mean it makes no sense!
You can always make another $100,

53
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:40,340
but you can't make another two hours
that you just wasted on something stupid.

54
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,159
So stop handing out your time to everyone,
and start valuing your time.

55
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,599
Realize it's the most important thing you
have.

56
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,039
And you know, I'm 22 years old right now.
And I look at life, and I think,

57
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:56,969
"If I live to 60, that's like 40 more years."
"That is so much time!"

58
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:00,219
That is so much time!
You could do the most unbelievable things

59
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:04,060
in 40 years!
But there's probably going to be some 60-year-old

60
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,590
guy
watching this and saying,

61
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:11,069
"Heh, look at this naive little kid."
"You have no idea how fast it flies by."

62
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:14,578
"There is no time to do anything..."
And you know what,

63
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:17,699
I agree...
Forty years isn't sufficient time

64
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:23,069
when you've spent 39 of those years
being a slave for someone else from 9-5,

65
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:26,978
when you've given your time to everyone
just because they asked for it,

66
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:30,089
when you've spent years unconscious in front
of the TV,

67
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:33,439
and when you've spent entire nights fighting
with your wife

68
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,319
about who should do the dishes.
