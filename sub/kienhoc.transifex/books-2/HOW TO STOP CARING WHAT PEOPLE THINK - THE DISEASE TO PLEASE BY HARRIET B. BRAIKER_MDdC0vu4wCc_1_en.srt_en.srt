1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,830
I recall a friend in college who's crazy about
this girl.

2
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,929
After days of contemplating her from afar,
he finally built up the courage to ask her

3
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:20,609
out.

4
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:22,050
They started dating.

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,730
However, a few weeks later he came up to me
venting how she refused to be his girlfriend.

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,140
He said he was trying his best to impress
her.

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,829
Agreeing with everything she says & nodding
his head to her never-ending requests.

8
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,698
This behavior is a common symptom in people-pleasers.

9
00:00:37,698 --> 00:00:41,219
You agree more often with everthing even if
it's irrational.

10
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,609
Owing to the belief that constant agreement
will help you gain approval, attraction, praise

11
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:47,479
etc.

12
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:51,609
A girl doesn't want a yes-man, she wants a
guy who has his own opinions

13
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:56,269
& wouldn't fear to disagree with her if necessary.

14
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,899
People-pleasing isn't only detrimental to
your dating life.

15
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:03,500
I had friends who'd walk around nodding their
heads everywhere they go, trying to be nice

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,890
on the regular.

17
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,250
They would do anything to satistfy everyone,
often at their own expense.

18
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:14,599
As some people will take advantage of their
niceness and start bossing them around like

19
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:16,809
a slave.

20
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,939
Being Agreeable all the time is another form
of lying.

21
00:01:19,938 --> 00:01:24,529
Do you really agree with every single opinion
? the odds are, no.

22
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,599
then if you keep nodding to whatever people
say, you're simply lying to them.

23
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:31,849
Make it a habit to say no whenever you disagree.

24
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:35,828
You'll be surprised at how much respect you'll
gain just by telling the truth

25
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:39,539
than by deceiving others, concuring with every
opinion.

26
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,020
You will appear more powerful by overtly expressing
your unorthodox ideas

27
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:47,200
than by operating through a niceness pretence.

28
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,880
You will be perceived as someone who owns
a strong sense of reality.

29
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:57,649
You know who you are, you value your own beliefs
& boundaries by disagreeing with others whenever

30
00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:00,090
the case necessitates.

31
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,310
The second common symptom is trying to be
nice everlastingly.

32
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:07,200
You see these guys striving to act accordingly
all the time.

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,000
They have like this quota of good deeds for
the day.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,799
They'd walk around serving favors, free drinks
& what not.

35
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:18,400
Now there are two possible causes for this
over-niceness.

36
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,760
The first one is selfishness.

37
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:24,108
If you dig into it, Your niceness is a means
to an end.

38
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:28,760
A tool you use regularly to get your dose
of approval out of people.

39
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:34,259
You've hit an extreme point where your sense
of self-worth is based on how many good deeds

40
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:35,739
you do on a daily basis.

41
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:42,500
and so if you try to act normal (aka not nice)
your self-esteem declines.

42
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,159
You do more & more favors, you nod your head
to everyone so you can feel good about yourself.

43
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,668
This is number one, number two is FEAR:

44
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:56,049
Your people-pleasing is interwoven with preconceptions
about how the world ought to be.

45
00:02:56,049 --> 00:02:59,919
You presume that life will often be on your
side if you act nicely.

46
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,719
You think niceness is going to ward off bad
circumstances.

47
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:07,150
You people-please because you fear getting
criticized.

48
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,039
You live up to people's standards so they'd
see you as an ally.

49
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:16,689
and by behaving nicely day in, day out, you
really expect others to do the same.

50
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:21,699
A cancerous assumption as when bad things
happen, you fall depressed.

51
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:24,979
You're caught off guard with unforseen pitfalls.

52
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:29,100
The Machievallian truth is that the world
doesn't work the way you think.

53
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:33,448
You can be the nicest person on the planet,
yet still get hated & frowned upon.

54
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:38,510
You can do a thousand good deeds a day, yet
still have bad shit happen to you.

55
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:44,189
There are cases where you have to be bad,
to show anger to shield your boundaries & values.

56
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:50,120
If satisfying others is a priority, you'll
live enslaved to their infinite wants & needs.

57
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,810
(1.5)

58
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,840
It's cristal clear now that people-pleasers
experience life through a utopian lense.

59
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,039
Their preconceptions about how life ought
to be are world's apart from how life is in

60
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:02,709
actuality.

61
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:08,079
To break this irrational pattern, slowly acclimate
yourself with the belief that life is unfair.

62
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:14,000
Nature has its own rules, its solely based
on randomness, chaos & sometimes callousness.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,439
Nature has been functioning by these rules
for eons.

64
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:22,189
You can't just show up now & be like "you
know what nature, I'm going to be nice to

65
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:24,668
everyone & you will make my life amazing"

66
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:27,698
(giggles) yeah good luck with your preconceptions
buddy.

67
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:32,939
Now, This is not a call to becoming an asshole,
okey.. I'm just trying to snap you back to

68
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,319
reality.

69
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:37,230
You have to position yourself in the midst
of the spectrum.

70
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:41,150
Use niceness or badness only when the case
necessitates.

71
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:45,060
after all, nice is just a word.

72
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,420
You don't want to identify yourself with one
word.

73
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,480
Your character is far more richer than that.
