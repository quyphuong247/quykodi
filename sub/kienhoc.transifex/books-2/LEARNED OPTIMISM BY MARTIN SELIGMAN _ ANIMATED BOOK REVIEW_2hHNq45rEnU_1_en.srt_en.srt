1
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,218
Imagine you take two dogs
and put them in two different areas...

2
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:18,118
You shock the first dog
and you give him an option to escape.

3
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:22,339
He tries to escape, he's successful,
and he gets away from the shocks.

4
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:25,570
The second dog however,
you put in a place where no matter what he

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,179
does,
he cannot escape the shocks.

6
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:30,820
He soon figures out that there's nothing he
can do,

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,238
he gives up,
and he'll just sit there and accept the shocks.

8
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,359
Now you take these two dogs and put them in
two new areas again,

9
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:42,000
but this time they can both escape.
The first dog, who had learned that he was

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,609
able to escape,
will get out of there like usual.

11
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:48,070
But the second dog will just lay there and
accept the shocks,

12
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,520
even though in this new environment he could
just escape.

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,230
This is what is known as learned helplessness,
and you probably know people who act like

14
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:58,219
the helpless dog.

15
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:03,219
The opposite of this is learned optimism.
Learned Optimism is basically the idea

16
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:06,650
that you can learn to be optimistic, and positive,
and happy.

17
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,969
You can cultivate these things.
And this is exactly what Seligman was trying

18
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:12,188
to do,
by running a workshop.

19
00:01:12,188 --> 00:01:16,408
The results of the workshop were promising...
Thirty-two percent of the students in the

20
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,850
control group
had a moderate to severe episode of depression

21
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:23,879
in contrast to 22 percent of the group that
was in the workshop.

22
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:29,179
Also... 15 percent of the controls
had an episode of generalized anxiety disorder

23
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,830
versus only 7 percent of people who took the
workshop.

24
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:36,298
They also found that it was the change from
pessimism to optimism

25
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,810
that caused the prevention of depression and
anxiety.

26
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,189
And these studies are great,
but even when I look at my own life,

27
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,390
happiness, positivity, optimism...
These are the things that I've had to learn

28
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,329
and that I have to keep cultivating.
When I was a kid,

29
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:54,769
I hated my life.
I was constantly depressed and anxious.

30
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:57,679
I had suicidal thoughts for the majority of
my childhood.

31
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,040
But that's all gone now and my life just keeps
getting better,

32
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,790
but this is something that you need to put
effort into.

33
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,250
This is something that can be learned.

34
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:11,310
So now let's look at the benefits of optimism...
Optimists on average achieve more,

35
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,280
have better overall health,
and just lead a more enjoyable life.

36
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,400
Pessimists, on the other hand, are more likely
to give up,

37
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,599
are more likely to suffer from depression,
and just lead a not really enjoyable life.

38
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:25,340
And the big difference between pessimists
and optimists

39
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,669
comes from their explanatory styles about
whether things are permanent, pervasive, and

40
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:32,159
personal...

41
00:02:32,158 --> 00:02:36,138
So let's say you walk up to a girl,
and you just get humiliated and rejected...

42
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:37,950
If you're a pessimist you'll think that it's
permanent:

43
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:42,658
"I'll never be able to attract a girl."
If you're an optimist, you'll think that it

44
00:02:42,658 --> 00:02:45,718
isn't permanent:
"There are going to be plenty of girls who

45
00:02:45,718 --> 00:02:48,269
like me."
If you're a pessimist you'll think that it's

46
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:52,299
pervasive:
"I'm just not an interesting person."

47
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:55,159
If you're an optimist, you'll think that it
isn't pervasive:

48
00:02:55,158 --> 00:03:00,388
"It was just one isolated situation.
It doesn't mean that I'm not interesting."

49
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,950
If you're a pessimist you'll think that it's
personal:

50
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:06,108
"I'm ugly. Of course she's going to humiliate
me."

51
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:08,510
If you're an optimist, you'll think that it
isn't personal:

52
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:11,239
"Well, she might have been in a bad mood..."

53
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:16,438
And I've seen this so many times.
If you have a pessimistic explanatory style,

54
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:21,229
you're going to have your soul crushed.
Every single friend I've had who was good

55
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:24,858
with women
always had an optimistic explanatory style.

56
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:29,498
So optimism is much more helpful to you
than pessimism but you also NEED BALANCE,

57
00:03:29,498 --> 00:03:34,028
Just like with everything else, YOU NEED BALANCE…
Otherwise, you can get really delusional

58
00:03:34,028 --> 00:03:37,998
and actually end up hurting yourself.
Imagine if you have a really bad business

59
00:03:37,998 --> 00:03:40,748
idea
and you’re just a naïve optimist…

60
00:03:40,748 --> 00:03:43,198
The business isn’t going anywhere and you
say,

61
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,169
“Well, this isn’t permanent...”
And you keep wasting resources on a stupid

62
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:49,209
idea.
You’ve put in six months already

63
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:52,968
and it hasn’t gone anywhere and you say,
“Well, it’s just this part of the project

64
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:55,959
that’s slow,
but the project as a whole is amazing.”

65
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:58,139
Or you try to get support and no one wants
to go along

66
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:02,299
with your terrible idea and you say,
“Well, they were probably just in a bad

67
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:03,129
mood today.”

68
00:04:03,128 --> 00:04:06,528
I don’t know if I would call this person
an optimist or just an idiot.

69
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,519
The biggest problem with optimism
is when it’s not balanced,

70
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,688
because you might end up
not taking responsibility when you need to.

71
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:18,909
So I would absolutely recommend being optimistic
but at the same time balancing it out with

72
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,630
pessimism,
or not even pessimism in my opinion,

73
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,288
but just simply realism.
