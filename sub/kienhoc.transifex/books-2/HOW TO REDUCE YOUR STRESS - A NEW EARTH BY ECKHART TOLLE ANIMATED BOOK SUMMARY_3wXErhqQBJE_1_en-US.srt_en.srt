1
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:20,299
" i think therefore i am"
descartes

2
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,859
descartes was trying to prove his existence
he wanted to find thyself.

3
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:29,609
ended up concluding that his incessant stream
of thoughts was the only proof

4
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,049
thereby the source of self for him was thought.

5
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:35,768
now is this 100% valid ?

6
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:36,539
maybe

7
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:37,878
but let's verify

8
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:41,619
if we zoom in on your day to day thought patterns
we will find this:

9
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:46,789
i need to get my work done , i think i'm hungry
i need to take out the trash

10
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:52,048
i forgot to pay the bills, oh now i feel lonely
should i buy apples or vodka

11
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:55,338
what if i die today
oh i forgot to do the laundry.

12
00:00:55,338 --> 00:01:00,530
this is a sample from your daily thought patterns
i mean to some extent right

13
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:05,430
but we cannot deny that your thoughts are
always changing and are conflicting

14
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,618
most of the time.

15
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:10,079
now if you still think that the "source of
self" is your thoughts

16
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,670
as descartes concluded

17
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,500
then you are no different than a crazy guy
running naked down the streets talking to

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,099
himself

19
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:20,359
the only difference is that he verbalises
his thoughts out

20
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:21,200
loud.

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,040
you, verbalize them inside your head.

22
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,810
if you identify your self as thought
you will never be able to experience calmness

23
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,109
and inner peace.

24
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:32,810
because your thoughts are in a continious
state of change

25
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,719
and what you are looking for is a constant
state

26
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:39,090
of no-change calmness and stillness.

27
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,280
if you're following descartes notion then
your sense of self

28
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,060
is attached to a non-stop loop of alternating
thoughts.

29
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,920
and when your thoughts are changing every
two seconds

30
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,299
your emotions are impermanent as well.

31
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,640
your feelings are constantly switching back
and forth from negative to positive

32
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,760
and this is the cause of mood swings, unease
and discontentment.

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,978
now we need to delve deeper into this to get
a clearer understanding.

34
00:02:02,978 --> 00:02:06,030
the human being is made up of two main components
:

35
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,669
the first is form wich is the body, the physical
layer.

36
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:14,500
the second component is formlessness wich
is the soul, the consciousness

37
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,759
the watcher as echart tolle calls it and it
is the spiritual layer .

38
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:22,199
from here we can conclude that there is an
actual space

39
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:25,030
between the self and your thoughts ,

40
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,449
your thoughts and emotions are objects
just like any other external object

41
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:34,419
and these forms are not permanent they are
stuck in a loop of alternation

42
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:37,488
the only thing that is constant is conscousness

43
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:40,049
now you're probably wondering, what do i benefit
from knowing about this

44
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:44,868
this sounds like too crazy/phylosophical/ too theoratical

45
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:47,400
but here's how you can put it into practise:

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,870
if you start perceiving your self as constant
conisousness.

47
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,920
you detach your sense of self from these alternating
thoughts.

48
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,340
and when you do that, anytime a negative thought
arises

49
00:02:57,348 --> 00:03:00,778
you start seeing it no different than a car
passing by

50
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:03,128
while you're walking down the streets.

51
00:03:03,128 --> 00:03:07,608
because now you are aware
that you are seperate from your thoughts.

52
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:10,310
does this mean that you shouldn't be thinking
at all

53
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,759
live in a cave, surround yourself with rabbits

54
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,688
and meditate 24/7 for the rest of your life
?

55
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:17,568
No, of course not.

56
00:03:17,568 --> 00:03:23,929
the point here: it's okey to have thoughts
it's okey to feel emotions, positive or negative.

57
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:29,129
but be aware of when you get lost in them
you shouldn't be identifying youself with them

58
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:35,389
the moment you remind yourself of the space
that sperates you from your thoughts

59
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:38,489
any negative emotion subsides .

60
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:46,218
there was an ancient middle eastern king
who had all the wealth a man could ever dream of.

61
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:48,259
a very well guarded castle.

62
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:49,979
and a powerful kingdom.

63
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:54,500
but the only thing the king had lacked was
of more value than that.

64
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,719
what is it ?

65
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,520
inner peace.

66
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,600
he was unable to maintain feelings of joy
and fulfillment.

67
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:03,790
as he was hyper reactive and extremely sensetive.

68
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:07,288
the slightest problem would provoke an intense
reaction in him.

69
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:14,100
the king's biggest wish was to gain control
over his inner world and to learn how to curb his temper.

70
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,100
so he called upon a man whose known to be wise

71
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,439
and asked him the secrets of his non-reactiveness
and serenity.

72
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,850
the man's response was to agree and to offer
the king a gift

73
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,840
that would be of great help to him but he
must be patient for it.

74
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,168
the king agreed and awaited for the wise man's
return.

75
00:04:32,168 --> 00:04:38,968
after a period, the wise man arrived and gifted the king   a box made of precious exquisite things.

76
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:42,519
as he opened the box
a golden ring were to be found inside

77
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,919
with 3 words engraved on it.

78
00:04:44,928 --> 00:04:49,839
the inscription on the ring says: "this, too,
shall pass"

79
00:04:49,848 --> 00:04:54,329
the wise man bowed to the king
as he held the ring with both hands and asked

80
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:58,939
"wise man, what do these words represent ? i
do not understand.

81
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:04,120
the wise man araised and said:
"my lord, wear this ring wherever you go"

82
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,870
"do not take it out"

83
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:11,139
"and when sth bad happens to you
before you call it good or bad"

84
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:13,620
"read the inscription on the ring"

85
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:15,100
"that way"

86
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,840
"you will always be at peace".

87
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,589
most people do not have the patience and the
will to maintain their wellbeing

88
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,649
while going through adversity.

89
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:29,639
the emotions are so intense
that is why we tend to loose ourselves in the event.

90
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,439
but when we bring to mind that spaciousness
and the idea that nothing is permanent.

91
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:38,199
all of a sudden, a great relief araises inside
of us .

92
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:40,579
if you find yourself going through a hard
time.

93
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:44,639
do not resist, let those emotions flow through you.

94
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,900
experience that sadness as if it was true joy.

95
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:52,628
and keep in mind, every moment of your
life is transient.

96
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:56,629
this too, shall pass.

97
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,699
there are many many causes for discontentment.

98
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:03,719
and the most common one is the belief
that you deserve to be treated well

99
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:08,610
and that the universe should be providing
you with safety and happiness.

100
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,629
"why is it raining, my hair is messed up"

101
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:12,800
"i don't like this guy"

102
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,439
"why is this happening to me"

103
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:16,139
"i hope this will happen"

104
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:17,419
"i hope that will happen"

105
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,000
all these expressions can be translated into
one meaning:

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,699
i do not deserve this, i deserve to be treated better.

107
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:26,319
i deserve more than this.

108
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,180
so you reject the reality that's in front
of you and you wish for something that isn't

109
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,000
you probably knew someone who behaves this way.

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,779
the thing is they did not accept
the fact that there is no such thing

111
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:41,739
as a reality of no pain.

112
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,740
they forgot that pain is an actual tool for growth.

113
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,840
they categorize pain as sth bad.

114
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:52,979
if you accept however, that the world is full of paradoxs

115
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,780
and expect good and bad things to happen to
you on a regular basis.

116
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:03,500
you set your self free from resistance and
you begin to see reality as it is .

117
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,800
the reason we forgot the true nature of reality
is perhaps because of our digital age.

118
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:11,000
look around you, everything is perfect.

119
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:16,908
websites, phones, facebook profiles, cloths
and even food is carefully designed and decorated.

120
00:07:16,908 --> 00:07:20,579
everything is perfectly crafted in a way to please you

121
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:22,359
and to make you feel comfortable.

122
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,400
you feel disgusted when you see a poorly designed
website nowadays .

123
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,279
and this is why you're uncomfortable with
the outside world.

124
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:36,378
because the real world is not that organized
for one thing, it is a total mess.

125
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:39,799
because they can't handle that instability
most people established

126
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,180
a utopian model of reality for themselves.

127
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,519
a 'perfection' filter to perceive things through it

128
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:49,498
a label designed to conceil the pain

129
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:53,739
and to convert what is, to what isn't.

130
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,100
truth is the world is black and white, good
emotions and bad emotions.

131
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,930
death and life.

132
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,709
pleasant experiences and unpleasant experiences.

133
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:04,978
that is how it's supposed to be.

134
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,960
if you're paranoid about what is going to
happen tomorow

135
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,098
or still mad about what happened today.

136
00:08:10,098 --> 00:08:14,878
this conveys that: you did not welcome yet
reality as it is .

137
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,959
you are still hoping for a reality of no pain.

138
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:24,219
and you are still living in a mental utopian fantasy.
