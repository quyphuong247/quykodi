1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,429
Imagine that you are walking back from work…
excited that another successful day has gone

2
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:13,349
by… when all of sudden you realize you never
called mike… he is your best friend and

3
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,740
today is his birthday… but you were so busy
the whole day that you never had a chance

4
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:19,739
to call..

5
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:24,599
“no problem” you think to yourself - “as
soon as I get home I’ll wish him happy birthday”

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,539
but when you get home, a pile of unopened
mail greets you by the door, unwashed dishes

7
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:36,679
are calling your name and you get distracted
by other exciting house chores…

8
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:42,039
The next morning, feeling like a horrible
friend, you wonder “how can something so

9
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:44,579
important slip my mind”

10
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:50,829
The reason is simple - your brain is for having
ideas, NOT for holding them.

11
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:56,439
With a never-ending stream of demands for
you attention, both at home and at work, things

12
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:58,789
are bound to slip through the cracks.

13
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:05,010
Only when your mind is clear and your thoughts
are organized can you achieve effective results.

14
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,189
This is where Getting Things Done, or GTD
for short, comes into play.

15
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:16,120
It is a framework designed to help you keep
track of tasks, ideas and projects.

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:25,400
The Getting Things Done system is made of
5 simple steps - capture, process, organize,

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,910
review and engage.

18
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,379
Everything begins with “capturing” all
ideas, tasks, projects, to-do items and other

19
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:38,329
random bits of information that come your
way every single day.

20
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:43,090
These are things like emails, letters, calls
and action items that come from talking to

21
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:50,960
other people or they can be ideas and tasks
that are born in your own creativity and imagination.

22
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,890
Wherever that information comes from, you
need to capture it, or externalize it so you

23
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,640
don’t have to keep it in your brain.

24
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,010
Now that you have all this information captured,
it is time to make sense of it so you can

25
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:07,590
actually move forward with your goals, instead
of wanting to pull your hear out from the

26
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,490
information overload.

27
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:14,129
Step number 2 in GTD is processing.

28
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:20,500
For every item that you captured ask yourself
the following question - is it actionable?

29
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,620
The possible answers are two - YES or NO.

30
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,069
If the item is actionable, like an email from
a colleague asking you about an update for

31
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:35,840
the project you are working together on, ask
yourself a followup question - would it take

32
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,569
2 minutes or less to complete?

33
00:02:40,568 --> 00:02:45,339
If the answer is “yes”, go ahead and do
it.

34
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,120
If the answer is “no”, you need to put
this action off for later by adding them to

35
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,069
an action items list (more on that in step
3).

36
00:02:54,068 --> 00:02:58,259
If it will take you 30 seconds to reply to
your colleague’s email, it makes sense to

37
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:00,389
take care of it on the spot and move on.

38
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:06,429
If you need to have a 20-minute conversation
on the topic, it is best to schedule it.

39
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,020
If the item you are processing is “not actionable”
- like a confirmation of a payment you made

40
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:17,409
for your monthly internet bill - you have
2 choices - discard it or keep it as reference

41
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:21,650
in case you need that info down the road.

42
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,599
Repeat the same process for every piece of
information

43
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:30,840
You’ve processed the information, things
are already looking up for you, now you need

44
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,569
to organize it.

45
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:35,519
This is where the magic happens.

46
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,260
You have an action list from all the actionable
items that you did not already do in the previous

47
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:42,259
step.

48
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:46,870
Now you need to organize and prioritize them
based on the following 3 criteria:

49
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:52,090
- by project, by time and by context

50
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,849
Actions related to particular project, such
as building a deck for your next presentation,

51
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:03,269
or organizing the halloween party for your
kids, can be grouped together.

52
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:08,569
Actions that have some sort of a deadline,
or a time specific (like Mike’s birthday)

53
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:15,458
should go on your calendar so you can take
care of them when the time is right.

54
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:20,488
You can also group actions by context, such
as phone calls you need to make or groceries

55
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:24,198
that you need to pick up.

56
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:29,249
Of course you can also mix and match and put
things in more than one category - like that

57
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:36,759
video you need to create on Friday, the 17th.

58
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,710
This is where you need to tweak and personalize
GTD to fit your needs.

59
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:46,758
You know best how to group and prioritize
your items.

60
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:57,379
One thing to always keep top of mind though
is this question - what is the next action?

61
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:02,100
If you sit down to call Mike for his birthday,
but don’t have his number, you aren to being

62
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,219
very efficient.

63
00:05:03,218 --> 00:05:08,430
The next action should’ve been “find Mike’s
number”, not “call Mike”.

64
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:14,209
Asking yourself that question will help you
sequence things better.

65
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:21,948
Now, you’ve organized your action items,
the sun is shining brighter and the world

66
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:23,590
is a happier place.

67
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,818
But what about the non-actionable items?

68
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:26,879
That’s easy.

69
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,699
They can either be kept for reference - like
that manual for your TV that you don’t need

70
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:36,400
until your kid turns on the spanish closed
captioning and you need to figure out how

71
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,579
to reverse it.

72
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:43,318
Or they can be deferred for later - like that
idea for a business that you would like to

73
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,580
keep and revisit in 6 months when you have
more time - add it to a “someday maybe”

74
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:54,008
list and create an action item to review this
list in 6 months.

75
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:55,009
Done!

76
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:56,009
High five!

77
00:05:56,009 --> 00:06:01,649
All the random information is now organized
and you are ready to take over the world.

78
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:05,009
The next step is Review.

79
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:09,400
With so many demands for your attention, things
are bound to go out of place.

80
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:12,718
This is where the review comes into play.

81
00:06:12,718 --> 00:06:16,899
Every week, review your items and make any
adjustments if needed.

82
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:18,718
Is everything where it supposed to be?

83
00:06:18,718 --> 00:06:23,990
Is there a pile of information somewhere that
you need to process?

84
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:29,460
A weekly review is essential to keeping everything
running smoothly.

85
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:32,948
Every month, take some time to review your
short-terms goals.

86
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:37,119
Are your action items moving your towards
your goals, or are you just keeping yourself

87
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:38,119
busy?

88
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:42,819
Are you saving for that car, are you learning
the Spanish you want or are you in reaction

89
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,490
mode?

90
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:48,990
Schedule these regular reviews and reflection
periods so you can ensure the train is heading

91
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,038
down the right tracks.

92
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:55,408
The last part step in GTD is called “engage”.

93
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:59,060
This is where you actually roll up the sleeves
and get cracking.

94
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,639
You calendar should contain all the tasks
that you need to do today.

95
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,829
Your project list will tell you what you need
to do to move a project forward.

96
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:11,968
Your contexts will help you batch things together.

97
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:17,649
As you go about your day, crossing all of
those items, next information is bound to

98
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:18,829
come you way.

99
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:24,418
Now you know what to do with it - capture
it, decide if it actionable, if the answer

100
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:30,490
is yes and you can get it done in 2 minutes
or less, do it, if not add it to the appropriate

101
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,490
action list.

102
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:37,889
If the information is not actionable, it gets
stored or ends up in the trash.

103
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:38,889
Nothing to it.

104
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:44,150
You are now as cool, calm and collected as
a buddhist zen master deep in meditation.

105
00:07:44,149 --> 00:08:05,498
Now, Mike will never have to spend another
birthday without wishes from his best friend.

106
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:07,499
And if you want more video such as this one
