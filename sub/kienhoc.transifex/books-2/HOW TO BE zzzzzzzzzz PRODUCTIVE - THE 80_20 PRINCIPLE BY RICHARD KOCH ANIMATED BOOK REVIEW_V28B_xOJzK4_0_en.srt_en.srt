00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:10,259
About 20% of a carpet gets 80% of the wear.
About 20% of beer drinkers drink 80% of the

2
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:16,608
beer in the world.
About 20% of a company’s customers account

3
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:20,240
for 80% of the complaints.

4
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:27,239
This principle shows up over and over again
in almost every field and is called the 80/20,

5
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:33,500
or the Pareto principle. The ratios might
vary from one example to another, but try

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:40,500
to focus on a deeper meaning of the principle:
the majority of the effects come from the

7
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:48,439
minority of the causes. So let’s take a
look at how this works in business, social

8
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:50,799
interactions, and relationships…

9
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:52,919
Here’s how it works in business…

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,090
A few months ago, I had built a website and
was getting my visitors from social media,

11
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:04,019
like Reddit, Pinterest, Twitter, and other
social media and forums. In fact, this took

12
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,780
so much time that I was unable to write as
many articles as I wanted to. So I decided

13
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,780
I was going to make the process more efficient.
I looked into my data and guess what I found?

14
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,799
For every 1000 visitors I got from Reddit,
I got only about 60 from Pinterest, 20 from

15
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:30,679
Twitter, and a few more 20s from other forums
and social media. I thought I’m an idiot,

16
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,530
I’m spending the same amount of time on
all these platforms yet look at the results.

17
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:42,370
So I basically completely cut out the ones
with the least effect, and it freed up so

18
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:48,590
much time for me to write actual articles
that people were interested in. And that made

19
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:53,320
a huge difference in how my website performed.

20
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:56,029
Now let’s take a look at social interactions…

21
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:02,879
In college, I dedicated roughly the same amount
of time to the top ten people I hung out with.

22
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:08,368
But I realized that the majority of the value
and happiness brought into my life only came

23
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:14,009
from two or three of those people. So I thought,
“I’m an idiot. What am I doing?” I decided

24
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:19,780
to dedicate my time to the two or three of
those people, and that freed up so much time

25
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:25,419
for me to read, meditate, go to the gym, and
to really develop myself.

26
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:28,030
Let’s look at relationships…

27
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:34,419
A boyfriend or a husband comes home from work.
After five hours of spending time with her

28
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:40,458
girlfriend or wife, she complains, “You
don’t spend any time with me!” The guy

29
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:47,459
has no idea what is going on. He just spent
five hours with this woman. But did he really?

30
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:53,289
In those five hours even though he talked
to her and was physically with her, his focus

31
00:02:53,289 --> 00:03:00,289
was also on watching TV half of the time and
the rest, checking his Facebook and his phone.

32
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:06,289
Another guy could have worked longer hours,
come home and only spent an hour, literally

33
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:11,799
a single hour, with her and she would never
complain, because he would make that one hour

34
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,900
all about her.

35
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:20,900
And that is the 80/20 principle applied to
business, social interactions, and relationships.

36
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:27,030
As a final thought, ironically what I have
done with my video follows the 80/20 principle

37
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:34,750
as well. I have shared about 80% or even more
of the value found in the book, in 20% or

38
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,590
even less time.
