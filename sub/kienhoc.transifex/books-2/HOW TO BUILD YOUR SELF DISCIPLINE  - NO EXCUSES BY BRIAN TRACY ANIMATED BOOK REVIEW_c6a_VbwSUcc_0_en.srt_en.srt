1
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:18,949
I have to admit that Most people have no workethic.

2
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:23,019
do you recall the time when you've got work
to do but you just couldn't force yourself

3
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:23,699
to do it ?

4
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,339
Or maybe you were productive, but you've lost
momentum.

5
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:29,109
Don't worry you're not the only one.

6
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:31,949
That was me, for the past 5 years of my life.

7
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,289
I couldn't even get out of bed in the morning.

8
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:39,339
I remember I had watched some motivational
videos but nothing seemed to pan out.

9
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,470
It wasn't motivation that I was lacking.

10
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:43,229
It was discipline.

11
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:44,889
And I want to share with you today,

12
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:51,020
what I did step-by-step to turn myself from
lazy slug; zombie mode, infront of the T.v

13
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,740
all day, into a productivity machine.

14
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,719
First off motivation is bullshit

15
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,659
the word motivation is just a word you say
to yourself to rationalize your laziness.

16
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:07,039
"Why Am I not doing the work ? it's because
I'm not motivated" You're just using your

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,390
lack of motivation as an excuse.

18
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,750
When you say "i'm not feeling motivation"

19
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,640
you're just saying " I don't feel like doing
the work " That's it

20
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,469
Do you think that I need to to feel motivated
to make these videos ? well

21
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:24,189
To some extent yes, but I realize that motivation
is like a wave. it comes and goes. If I rely

22
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:28,060
on it, I won't be able to achieve anything
of significance.

23
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,640
The only drive that keeps me going is self-discipline.

24
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,769
And unlike motivation, discipline is a muscle
that can be built and maintained if you apply

25
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:39,709
what i'm about to show you.

26
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:44,618
Brian tracy talks about personal excellence
and the importance to invest in yourself.

27
00:01:44,618 --> 00:01:47,069
I totally resonate with this.

28
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:51,279
Personal excellence simply means, you need
to start perceiving yourself as a nation or

29
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,349
acountry.

30
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:56,399
And for that country to flourish and grow
prosperous, it needs investment.

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,159
"Just like a country, you can invest in yourself"
You do this by harnessing certain qualities

32
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,400
in your character.

33
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,299
Self-Discipline is one of them.

34
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:07,670
so here's what I did to get more of it.

35
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,140
For the past five years, I was emprisoned
in my room playing video games, wasting my

36
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:14,679
life and I knew I had to change.

37
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,620
Everytime I want to do something different,
other than my usual unconscious routine.

38
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,338
The mind gets in the way and he's like " Ohoy
hold on buddy, what do you think you're doing

39
00:02:24,338 --> 00:02:26,218
? you want to eat healthy now?

40
00:02:26,218 --> 00:02:30,120
Nah you can't do that, video games are easier
and more fun"

41
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,930
And then the mind starts to flush sensations
of lethargy into my body and in a fraction

42
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:35,989
of a second.

43
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,810
I'd completely loose interest in doing meaningful
tasks.

44
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,068
That's how powerful habits can be.

45
00:02:42,068 --> 00:02:47,438
However, there came a day where I began experimenting
with different techniques to build self-discipline

46
00:02:47,438 --> 00:02:49,848
and the best one I could find was
Challenge & commitment.

47
00:02:49,848 --> 00:02:53,729
Here's how it goes.
You're going to pick a challenge and then

48
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:55,399
decide to beat it.

49
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,099
I know this sounds boyish and banal like "pick
a challenge and beat it" but believe me, it

50
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,418
works. I tried this myself.

51
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:07,760
Example: Decide that you will stop using facebook
for a whole month.

52
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,149
the next thing is "commitment"

53
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,340
Tell yourself that you're going to commit
to the challenge.

54
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,120
You're not going to use facebook no matter
what for a whole month.

55
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,539
Make sure to Start off with easier challenges
because you probably have no willpower to

56
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:22,039
make bigger jumps.

57
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:27,068
And this is basicly what I did.
I was in a horrible situation. My first challenge

58
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:29,948
was to learn how to quickly get out of bed
in the morning.

59
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:34,010
I found out that
Discipline in it's core, is an accumulation

60
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:35,709
for good habits.

61
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:38,069
How do you build these habits in the first
place ?

62
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:40,848
you build them, through challenge and commitment.

63
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:44,209
if you promise yourself that
This week, you're going to meditate for 10

64
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:45,158
minutes a day.

65
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:49,198
In your mind, It's already done. You don't
have think about anymore.

66
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,389
You Have to be a man of his word.

67
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:55,909
It's funny how people get frustrated when
others break their promises but what's worse

68
00:03:55,908 --> 00:03:58,598
than that is tricking your own self.

69
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:01,338
"oh i'm going to do the work" and then you
procrastinate.

70
00:04:01,338 --> 00:04:06,158
"i'll be doing this, i'll be doing that" but
then nothing happens.

71
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,128
Just like you made a promise to beat that
videogame.

72
00:04:09,128 --> 00:04:12,698
You make a decision to invest yourself. that's
it.

73
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:17,109
It's funny how I began perceiving life as
a video game where you keep getting stronger

74
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:20,798
and stronger every time you pass a new stage
or a kill a new boss.

75
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,759
But then I realized, life is no different
than a video game.

76
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,370
You need to be continuously evolving.

77
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,418
What happens if you stop challenging yourself
?

78
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:33,120
Well, I guess it's game over. but in real
life, your life is over.

79
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,870
No challenges equals comfort. Period.

80
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,840
you'll notice that the more challenges you
overcome, the prouder you get to feel about

81
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,729
yourself.

82
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:46,189
And the more pride you feel, the further you'd
want to challenge yourself.

83
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:51,569
It's a self-fulfilling cycle. and that cycle
is called self-discipline.

84
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:57,459
You don't get disiplined by watching the news
all day. Discipline is a mere by product of

85
00:04:57,459 --> 00:04:59,649
continual challenge.

86
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:05,009
The more you chill and play videogames, the
more you'd want to keep doing the same thing.

87
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:09,409
I have no interest in playing ideo games right
now but if I start playing.

88
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,030
I know that I'll get hooked and it will be
extremely difficult for me to turn it around

89
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:15,129
later on.

90
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:17,750
The point being is to start right now.

91
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,319
Start small, one challenge per month. No more
than one .

92
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:25,329
For example, this month you'll be doing thirty
days of cold showers.

93
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:29,310
Next month is the no-internet or the no-facebook
challenge and so on.

94
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,430
After a while,

95
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,370
you realize that the further you stick to
these challenges, the more good habits you

96
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,610
build along the way.

97
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:42,650
And these habits will accumulate to form what
we call a self-discplined person.

98
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:47,000
Discipline itself becomes a habit for you.
A self generated act.

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,410
I want you to keep in mind that no one is
different than you are.

100
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,580
We're all the same.

101
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:55,310
The only distinction is how we think and act
on a daily basis.

102
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,810
You literally become what you do.

103
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,889
Ask yourself, what are the actions that i
took, that got me to where I am today ?

104
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:07,300
you'll find that the answer is pretty simple
yet shocking at once.

105
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:13,850
Every little dicision you made yesterday,
a month ago or even a year before. Resulted

106
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,460
in who you are, today.
