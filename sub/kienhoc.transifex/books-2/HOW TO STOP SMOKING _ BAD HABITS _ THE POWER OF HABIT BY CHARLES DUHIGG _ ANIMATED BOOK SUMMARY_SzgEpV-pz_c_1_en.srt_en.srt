1
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,309
This is the practical part of The Power of
Habit.

2
00:00:13,308 --> 00:00:17,599
Well, how do you change a habit? The first
thing is always wanting the change. The more

3
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:23,379
it matters to you the easier it'll be.
Here's the 3 steps of how a habit plays out.

4
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:29,399
The cue is what reminds you or what makes
you feel the urge to, say, smoke a cigarette.

5
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:34,820
The reward is whatever satisfies that urge
or need you feel. In this scenario, it's the

6
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,488
cigarette itself or the addicting nicotine
in it, that little buzz, that little high

7
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:42,689
you get from it.
The routine is the process of consuming that

8
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:47,179
reward, like taking that cigarette box out
of your jacket, picking out one of the cigarettes,

9
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:51,988
maybe even smoking with a co-worker on a 5
min break, and taking that first hit.

10
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:56,289
That's basically the cycle. The cue could
be as simple as seeing someone else smoke

11
00:00:56,289 --> 00:01:01,548
or as I said one of your co-workers or fellow
students asking you to join them for a smoke.

12
00:01:01,548 --> 00:01:04,969
This is where I see a lot of people become
entrenched in it, when it becomes a social

13
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:09,548
sort of ritual, where the other person expects
you to continue and when you want to stop

14
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:14,580
there's crab-bucketing / "Oh I see you think
you're better than us" and you now stop seeing

15
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:19,400
that person, because they're not in your department
or class and maybe now you feel like you can't

16
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,219
do that and so you may even go with them,
but "you're not going to smoke" and then they

17
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:28,319
ask you if you're sure with a cigarette sticking
out of their box directly in your face and

18
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,750
of course, you give in, because you haven't
replaced any of these steps. You just stopped

19
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,799
consuming the reward, you stopped the routine
by not smoking, but you still do feel the

20
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,429
urge and a cigarette is still what would satisfy
that need.

21
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,200
So, it's a damn tricky thing, getting out
of a bad habit. I truly recommend you stop

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,280
smoking, if any of you are and if not, then
stay away from it. I've had friends who I

23
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,140
would laugh with at that old joke of people
saying "I can stop whenever I want, but I

24
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,780
don't want to." and "I'm only doing X on the
weekend." And those very friends who laughed

25
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:07,689
with me at those people got into not only
cigarettes, but went even further and it all

26
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:12,229
started with "Oh, it's just once a week, bro,
chill the fuck out, like I appreciate you

27
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:18,009
looking out for me, man, but you really don't
have to. I got this man, don't worry." and

28
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:23,608
when they tried to stop, they couldn't. I
wasn't surprised and I wasn't around to tell

29
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:27,700
them "I told you so.", because all they wanted
to do when we hung out at that point was drugs

30
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:34,869
and alcohol. I had thought they knew better.
And so I distanced myself from them, got into

31
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,989
working out and martial arts, thinking about
taking up boxing or BJJ someday and through

32
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:46,099
those activities I met a lot of new, like-minded,
healthy friends who wouldn't drag me down,

33
00:02:46,098 --> 00:02:50,699
but help me improve and get up to their advanced
level. You don't wanna hang around losers,

34
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:54,568
trust me and I realize I went off on a little
tangent, but I think that's a very important

35
00:02:54,568 --> 00:02:59,988
life lesson. Be careful who you surround yourself
with. Bad habits form fast, easy and destroy

36
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:05,109
your life, while good habits are hard to come
by, but they're sure as hell worth maintaining.

37
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:09,590
It's what we do on a regular basis that leads
us to excellence or misery.

38
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,019
And one thing that the book isn't talking
about enough is social aspects like peer pressure

39
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:17,980
and group think. In my martial arts class
there's about 50 people helping eachother

40
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:22,699
grow and it's not like in the gym, where you
can skip a session. You've got to be there.

41
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:26,468
Everybody's counting on you. One of us can't
do the pushups long enough, the whole group

42
00:03:26,468 --> 00:03:31,158
gets to do 20 more. So, of course it's easier
for me to keep up in that environment, but

43
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:36,340
the exact same thing applies with the destructive,
bad habits. Staying around people who don't

44
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,989
help you grow, but limit your potential and
waste everybody's time is a difficult, if

45
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:45,789
not impossible place to develop yourself in.
So, all that in mind, let's change your bad

46
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:48,769
habit, whatever it may be.
The Cue

47
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:52,680
Whenever you feel the urge for your habit,
ask yourself 1) what time it is, 2) where

48
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,778
you are, 3) who else is around you, 4) what
you just did and 5) what emotions you are

49
00:03:57,778 --> 00:04:02,609
feeling. Atleast one of these is the cue for
your habit. Look for consistencies to spot

50
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:08,849
them when wanting a cigarette, junk food,
drugs, video games, porn, what have you.

51
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:12,058
The Reward
What craving are you satisfying?

52
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:17,350
You've got to figure out how you can substitute
the harmful reward, with a neutral or positive

53
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:22,360
reward that will still lead to satisfaction.
For heavy smokers there's things like nicotine

54
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,300
chewing gum, called nicorette. By chewing
those instead of smoking you protect your

55
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,629
lungs, while still receiving that nicotine
your body has become addicted to. Now that

56
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:35,939
is not ideal, since you're not fighting the
addiction, however it's better than breathing

57
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:40,579
in harmful substances. There's also electronic
cigarettes that do less harm to your body,

58
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:44,359
I'm not a doctor, so I don't know, but they
basically allow smokers to feel like they're

59
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,430
smoking a normal cigarette, but as I mentioned
earlier, maybe the craving you're satisfying

60
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,139
is that little buzz you get from a cigarette
that little high and you could try and substitute

61
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:59,189
that with the high that you get from running
a few miles or doing a few pushups and situps.

62
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:01,680
It does work.
The Routine

63
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,389
Once you've identified the cue and the reward
you can insert a new routine. You choose an

64
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:11,199
activity that is triggered by the old cue
and delivers the old reward. In my example,

65
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,610
the whole cigarette isn't the reward, the
nicotine or "the act of smoking", or that

66
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:20,430
little buzz is the reward. The new routine
then could be the nicotine chewing gums or

67
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,009
the electronic cigarette that could help you,
but if you're really serious about quitting

68
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:29,259
for good, you have to stop telling everybody
that "you're trying to quit" and tell them

69
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:34,479
"you quit, that's it, you're a non-smoker"
and when you feel that urge for nicotine,

70
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,860
you distract yourself. Your new routine might
just as well be brushing your teeth instead

71
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:44,300
of smoking, chewing actual chewing gums, or
tic tacs. I love tic tacs. When you feel like

72
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,129
smoking, you might drink a glass of water
instead and that becomes your new reward.

73
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:53,020
Never forget to breathe, as well. After 10
days of not smoking you've overcome the worst

74
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,938
part.
I like to keep track of my progress. For every

75
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:02,439
workout exercise there's a tick and after
a few weeks of training that plan looks pretty

76
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:08,159
satisfying to me. You could print a calendary
and cross every day you've gone without smoking.

77
00:06:08,158 --> 00:06:13,269
The longer that chain becomes the stronger
your determination to keep it growing.

78
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:17,430
I hope this has been helpful to you, even
if you're trying to lose fat, stop maturbating,

79
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,478
start working out etc. - I've found a great
flowchart that summarizes how to change a

80
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:26,188
habit, you'll find it in the description box
below and as always thanks for watching. Talk

81
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:26,759
to you soon.
