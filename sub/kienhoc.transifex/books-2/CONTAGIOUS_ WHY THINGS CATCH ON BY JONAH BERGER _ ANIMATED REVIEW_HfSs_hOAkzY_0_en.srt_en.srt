1
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:16,028
So there’s a place in Philly called Barclay
Prime and their cheesesteak costs a $100.

2
00:00:16,028 --> 00:00:21,410
Now the average cheesesteak costs about $5
but Barclay Prime has been really successful.

3
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,210
And of course there are many factors as to
why, but one of the factors is social currency.

4
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:32,189
And the idea with social currency is that
people share whatever makes them look good.

5
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,659
So if anything makes you look good, or smart,
or cool, you’re much more likely to share

6
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:38,759
it.
So let’s say you’re in Philly and you

7
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:42,899
get a regular $5 cheesesteak… That’s probably
not something that you’re gonna want to

8
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,929
tell everyone about. But imagine if you go
out for dinner and get the $100 cheesesteak…

9
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:51,429
That’s probably something that you’re
going to tell all your friends about. And

10
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:55,159
if you’re like most people and can’t enjoy
good things without posting a picture of it

11
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:58,919
on Facebook or Instagram, you’re probably
going to share a picture of the cheesesteak

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,570
as well just to show us that you’re still
really cool and you eat really expensive things.

13
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,829
So the first principle is social currency,
and the idea here is… If sharing your idea

14
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:14,379
or product makes someone look good, they’re
much more likely to share it.

15
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:18,250
And there are also five other principles that
Jonah Berger has identified for why things

16
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:23,780
catch on and why they go viral. And he has
a PhD from Stanford, he teaches at Wharton,

17
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:29,210
and he’s basically an expert on viral marketing.
And after all his research, he’s identified

18
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:34,899
these six factors that he calls STEPPS. So
moving on to factor number two…

19
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,899
Triggers… How are you reminded of the idea
or the product?

20
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:42,159
So you’ve probably seen the song Friday
by Rebecca Black which has millions of views

21
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,719
on YouTube. And again there are many reasons
for why it got so many views, but one reason

22
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,759
is that it has a really good trigger. So if
you actually take a look at the stats on YouTube

23
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,299
for how people watch that video, you’ll
see a spike in views every Friday.

24
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:59,070
Now imagine if the song was about the first
day of school or something like that… Same

25
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:03,389
amazing lyrics, same amazing vocals, same
everything. A lot of people might still watch

26
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,728
it on the first day of school, but people
probably aren’t going to watch it two weeks

27
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:11,599
after the first day of school, or a month,
or three months after. So Friday is actually

28
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,500
a really good trigger because it happens every
week…

29
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,949
And Kit Kat did the same thing in 2007. Their
sales were declining every year and they needed

30
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:24,130
an effective marketing campaign. And what
they did was they decided to link Kit Kat

31
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:29,120
to coffee. So in all of their advertisements,
Kit Kat was always presented with coffee.

32
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,400
Now to someone who doesn’t understand the
power of triggers, the coffee might not mean

33
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,209
anything. It’s just part of the advertisement;
they had to put something in there so they

34
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:41,349
just put coffee in there. In fact, why don’t
we advertise it with hot chocolate? It might

35
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:45,418
taste even better with hot chocolate… But
that’s not the point! The point is that

36
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:50,419
we want to link Kit Kat to something that
gets consumed all the time like coffee, so

37
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:55,139
every time a person thinks of coffee, he also
thinks of Kit Kat. And yes, it might taste

38
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:58,549
even better with hot chocolate, but again
that’s not the point, people don’t drink

39
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:03,310
as much hot chocolate as coffee.
And Kit Kat’s sales had been declining 5

40
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,389
percent every year, but in the next twelve
months after the campaign, its sales actually

41
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:11,180
were up by a third.
So the second principle is triggers, and the

42
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,930
idea here is… People need to be reminded
of your idea or product, and you can help

43
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,739
them by providing a strong trigger.

44
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,469
The third principle is Emotion. When people
feel strong emotions, they want to share.

45
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:28,829
So think of Susan Boyle’s performance on
Britain’s Got Talent. Strong emotions like

46
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:33,229
awe or happiness get people to share. Even
strong emotions that aren’t positive like

47
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:37,410
anger and anxiety get people to share. And
this is really what the media relies on now.

48
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:41,060
The angrier and more anxious they make us,
the more we share.

49
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,569
So strong emotions are good, but the emotion
you want to stay away from is sadness. People

50
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:48,909
don’t really like to share something if
it makes them sad.

51
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:52,590
The fourth principle is public, or what’s
usually known as social proof. And the idea

52
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,530
here is that our decisions are affected by
what everyone else around us is doing. So

53
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,689
if you actually take a look at car buying
behavior, one of the factors that affects

54
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:04,849
whether someone will buy a new car or not
is whether his neighbors and community are

55
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:09,599
buying new cars. And if they’re all buying
a new car, he’s much more likely to buy

56
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,228
a new car as well.
And Apple had this dilemma with their laptops.

57
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:17,629
The apple logo actually used to face the owner
of the laptop when it was closed. And that

58
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:21,540
was a convenience for the user because it
was easier to orient the computer once you

59
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,810
got it out of your bag. But the problem is
that once the laptop was opened, the logo

60
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,629
was upside down to everyone else in the coffee
shop or wherever you were.

61
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:34,310
So a decision had to be made whether the owner’s
convenience was more important than everyone

62
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:39,899
else looking at the laptop. And they actually
decided that the public image was more important.

63
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:45,189
So the fourth principle is public, and the
idea here is… Can people see when others

64
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:48,430
are using our product?

65
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,310
The fifth principle is practical value. If
you can actually offer someone something that

66
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,439
really helps them, they’re gonna want to
share it with the people they know.

67
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,100
So one of the shortest, easiest videos I’ve
ever made was a two minute video about my

68
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,990
new favorite way to read. And there were so
many people who liked that video. And it’s

69
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:09,090
been shared so many times. And the reason
for that is because if you use that method,

70
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:13,589
you could actually read this book in only
three hours. Now a lot of people take weeks

71
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:17,649
to read one book, so if someone shares with
you a way where you can read a book in three

72
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:22,500
hours instead of three weeks, there’s practical
value in it. And if you know someone who wants

73
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,220
to read more and has been struggling with
it, of course you’d share it with him.

74
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,650
So the fifth principle is practical value.
Anytime you can actually help people and make

75
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:35,589
their life better, they’re gonna want to
share it and help their friends and family

76
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:37,589
as well.

77
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:42,509
And finally the sixth principle… Stories…
So in 2004 in the Olympics, this guy snuck

78
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:47,420
into the diving area and belly flopped into
the pool. And he also had a name of a casino

79
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,670
written across his chest. Now that’s a great
story and it got covered and people talked

80
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:56,250
about it but the story has nothing to do with
the casino. You can tell that story without

81
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:02,050
saying anything about the casino, so it wasn’t
really the most effective advertisement.

82
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,780
On the other hand, some companies do this
much better. So Blendtec is a blender company

83
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:11,029
that makes a video series called Will It Blend?
And they make videos where they’ll put weird

84
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:15,369
things like a brand new iPhone into their
blender and blend it into powder. Now that’s

85
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,340
a cool story. If you saw that, you might want
to share it with your friends, but notice

86
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:24,549
how the product is an integral part of that
story. You can’t tell that story without

87
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,650
the blender.
And especially technically-oriented people

88
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:31,319
have a really hard time understanding that
most people don’t talk about weird specs

89
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,409
and details, they share stories. When you
hang out with your friends, you’re probably

90
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:39,650
not going to tell them about how there’s
a new blender with improved revolutions per

91
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:44,629
minute on its blades, but you might share
the story of how you saw the new iPhone got

92
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:48,409
blended into powder.
So the sixth principle is stories. Most people

93
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,760
don’t care about specs and details, they
share stories. What you have to figure out

94
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:58,089
is how your product or idea can be a relevant
part of a cool story.

95
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:01,489
And your product or idea doesn’t have to
have all of these six principles. Some of

96
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,759
these might not even be very applicable to
certain products and ideas. So obviously the

97
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,939
more the better, but there are plenty of products
or ideas that have a couple of these factors

98
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:15,129
that are very strong and they do really well.
So to recap the STEPPS again…

99
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:19,540
Social currency: does sharing the product
or idea make you look good?

100
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:24,480
Triggers: how are you reminded of the idea
or the product? Is there a good trigger?

101
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,700
Emotion: when people feel strong emotions,
they want to share.

102
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:32,719
Public: can people see when others are using
our product?

103
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,620
Practical value: is your idea or product actually
useful or helpful?

104
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:41,750
And finally… Stories: people communicate
through stories. What you have to figure out

105
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:46,259
is how your product or idea can be a relevant
part of a cool story.
