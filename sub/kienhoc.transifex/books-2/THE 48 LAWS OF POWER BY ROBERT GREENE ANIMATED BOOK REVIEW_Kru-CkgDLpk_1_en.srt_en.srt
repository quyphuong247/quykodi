1
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:10,109
Never outshine the master. What do most people
do? They try to impress their master as much

2
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:16,519
as they can. And you want to communicate that
your competent, but you want to know your

3
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:22,719
threshold. If you're a 20-year-old guy and
you're working under a 40-year-old guy, you're

4
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:28,890
much smarter and more competent than he is,
guess what? Do not communicate that. As soon

5
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,590
as you communicate that, what is the person
going to do? He is going to get insecure and

6
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,550
get rid of you, because you're going to be
substituting him. This is a mistake that people

7
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:43,939
make all the time. Display your competence
but make sure you know what your threshold

8
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:50,939
is. Never outshine the master. Win through
your actions, never through argument. Michelangelo

9
00:00:53,390 --> 00:01:00,390
had just finished a perfect sculpture. Soderini,
an arrogant man, walked in, he looks at the

10
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:07,979
sculpture and he says, "Well, the nose is
a little too big." Now Michelangelo knew that

11
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,150
it was the perspective from which Soderini
was looking at the sculpture that the nose

12
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,670
looked too big from, but did he say anything?
Of course not! He said, "Very well." He picked

13
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:24,599
up a tool and he secretly picked up some of
the dust that had been laying there from previous

14
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:30,048
work. He went to the nose, and he started
hitting the nose. Of course he wasn't changing

15
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:35,310
anything, but at the same time, he let some
of the dust fall. While Michelangelo was doing

16
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,868
this, he said, "Hey, go look at it from there.
See if you like it now." Soderini went over

17
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:47,920
there, looked at the sculpture and said the
nose looked perfect now. Of course, Michelangelo

18
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,799
kept his wages and kept his reputation as
an artist, and didn't get destroyed by an

19
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,799
arrogant man. Again, win through your actions,
never through argument. Law 10: Infection!

20
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:09,139
Avoid the unhappy and unlucky. If your friends
introduce negativity into your life all the

21
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:15,719
time, guess what, cut them out. If they're
getting arrested all the time, guess what,

22
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:21,989
cut them out. This is the number one principle
probably of power, success, and just creating

23
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:28,989
an extraordinary life in general. Law 13:
When asking for help, appeal to people's self-interest,

24
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,370
never to their mercy or gratitude. I had a
friend who I'd drive around all the time when

25
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:41,379
he needed it. He would run out of money, and
I would just loan him money and never even

26
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:46,689
get it back. Wouldn't even ask for it. I remember
one time being stuck in a really bad situation,

27
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:53,009
and I called him and I said, "Hey, can you
please come get me?" He gave me that two seconds

28
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:57,509
of hesitation, and he was about to start an
excuse. And of course, I remembered the law

29
00:02:57,509 --> 00:03:02,989
and I said, "Okay, I gotta switch this around,"
and I said, "And actually I have some extra

30
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:08,409
money." Like, what is extra money? But I said,
"I have some extra money, and, you know, if

31
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:12,989
you come pick me up, we can use it to fill
up your tank. And on the way back, we can

32
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:17,939
stop and eat and I'll pay for that too." And
in two seconds he said, "Okay, I'm coming."

33
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:24,939
Again, Law 13: When asking for help, most
of the time you'll have to appeal to people's

34
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:32,250
self-interest instead of their mercy or gratitude.
Law 16: Use absence to increase respect and

35
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,940
honor. A lot of young guys come to me and
they say, "Well, my parents don't respect

36
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:43,348
me at all. They tell me what I'm going to
be, they tell me what my hobbies are going

37
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,719
to be, they tell me who my friends are going
to be, they tell me who my girlfriend is going

38
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:53,439
to be." And again, why is that? It's because
of a very well-known economic principle of

39
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:59,139
scarcity. You're spending 24 hours a day with
your parents, they're the ones feeding you,

40
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:04,929
they're going to dictate that. Now, what's
the harder but the better version of it? Become

41
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:10,549
independent. Once you're independent, and
again, we're creatures of habit, so what are

42
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:15,409
we going to do? We're going to resist that.
But if you become independent, guess what?

43
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:19,608
You're working on a lot of stuff now. You're
chasing your purpose, whatever that is. You

44
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:25,228
don't have much time for other things. Well,
a month passes and your mommy starts to miss

45
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:30,959
you. She calls you and says, "Hey, how are
you?" And she's going to be a lot more understanding

46
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,399
now. Again, as soon as she starts to introduce
that negativity, you say, "Well, you know

47
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:39,758
what, I'm sorry. I don't have time. I gotta
go work on this." And guess what? Over time,

48
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,848
she's going to be conditioned to it where
when she calls you, she's not going to be

49
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:49,889
introducing any of that negativity. And if
she does, you'll be cutting it out. Use the

50
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:56,889
economic principle of scarcity to increase
your respect and honor. Law 38: Think as you

51
00:04:57,788 --> 00:05:04,740
like, but behave like others. It's funny if
you take a look at the United States Congress.

52
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:11,740
535 people, very powerful, and not a single
one of them an atheist. Now, you don't have

53
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:19,338
to be a statistical genius to know that that's
pretty much impossible. But again, why is

54
00:05:19,338 --> 00:05:26,338
that? Because they know the power of law 38:
Think as you like but behave like others.
