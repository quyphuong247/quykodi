1
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:12,690
So one of the most frequent questions I get
is,

2
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:16,070
"How'd you grow your channel so fast in a
few months?

3
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:21,390
You haven't even posted that many videos..."
And basically what I'm going to try to explain

4
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,390
is the strategy for what makes you successful
in social media.

5
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:32,090
And it's called, "Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook..."
Which means "Give, Give, Give and then Ask..."

6
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:38,020
And it's actually a lot more like
jab 20 times or 50 times or a 100 times and

7
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,250
then right hook,
And I think Gary would agree

8
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,030
but that just doesn't really make a good book
title.

9
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,859
Now you might be saying,
"Well, who cares about what makes you grow

10
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:53,289
in social media?"
And the answer is - basically everyone should.

11
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:56,339
If you're an entrepreneur or connected to
business in any way,

12
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,380
you better know how this works.
If you do anything creative,

13
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,448
you better know how to create a following.
If you want to know what makes people respond

14
00:01:04,448 --> 00:01:06,450
to you
in the 21st century,

15
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,170
where the average person gets hundreds of
people

16
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:14,109
just like you shoved onto his computer screen,
you better understand this.

17
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:16,790
And basically, if you plan on doing anything
great today,

18
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,900
you better understand how social media works.
And that I hope includes everyone watching

19
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,140
this.

20
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,750
So this video's all about strategy.
There are a million different tactics.

21
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,590
For example,
you might watch my Rich Dad Poor Dad video,

22
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,900
and see that it's titled,
"How to get rich."

23
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,549
Now, under no circumstance would I want to
name my video something so banal,

24
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:44,970
but that's just what people search for.
And I just did a search for "how to get rich,"

25
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:49,150
which gets searched for all the time,
and my video came up first.

26
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:54,228
Now, there were also about 4 million other
results.

27
00:01:54,228 --> 00:01:57,259
So the 4 million people knew what to title
their video,

28
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:03,450
but 99% of those videos will never get viewed.
So you can know every tactic there is,

29
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,269
which I would encourage you to learn about,
but if you don't have the right strategy,

30
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:10,128
it's all going to be useless.

31
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:14,158
So let me break down the strategy.
And I'm not doing this to be like,

32
00:02:14,158 --> 00:02:17,709
"Oh, look guys! Look how great my channel
is or whatever."

33
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:21,239
I'm basically taking a step back and objectively
analyzing

34
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,459
why this particular channel
has grown the way it has,

35
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:27,049
and why it's going to be one of the most successful
channels

36
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:30,278
in the books and personal development niche.

37
00:02:30,278 --> 00:02:34,739
So let's get into it...
Let's say John and I both decide that we want

38
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,590
to do a book review
on The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,

39
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,848
which is one of the most famous books in personal
development.

40
00:02:41,848 --> 00:02:45,679
And let's say we also want to make some kind
of a sale.

41
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,459
And let's pick a pretty easy one which would
be an affiliate sale.

42
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,878
So basically one of those Amazon links
that you see under videos.

43
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,009
If you buy through the link,
you're not paying any extra or anything,

44
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,798
but the person gets a commission from Amazon.

45
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:04,769
Now John and I both have a choice.
We can either sit down in front of the webcam

46
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:09,539
and make a two minute video saying,
"Hey guys, this is a great book.

47
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:13,188
It will make you successful.
Oh and there is a link below if you want to

48
00:03:13,188 --> 00:03:14,168
buy it..."

49
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:18,639
Or... We have another choice:
Buy audio equipment.

50
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,989
Learn how to edit your sound.
Buy animation software.

51
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:26,949
Learn how to animate.
Write a meaningful script that will actually

52
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:30,639
teach people things.
Combine that with a hundred other steps I'm

53
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,359
not mentioning,
and then ask,

54
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:35,180
"is this actually going to help people?"

55
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,479
Alright, so the difference between those two
approaches

56
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,529
is this...
The first one takes about two minutes.

57
00:03:42,528 --> 00:03:45,370
The second one can take weeks and months to
research,

58
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,248
and it can take you twenty hours to animate
just one video

59
00:03:49,248 --> 00:03:51,120
when you're starting out.

60
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,968
Now when people look at those two alternatives,
guess what 99% of the people want to pick?

61
00:03:56,968 --> 00:04:02,289
Yes, they want to pick the two minute option.
But here's what that means...

62
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:06,088
You just picked an option where you give absolutely
nothing

63
00:04:06,088 --> 00:04:09,688
and you ask for something.
So basically you just want to walk into the

64
00:04:09,688 --> 00:04:12,789
ring,
right hook, and then come out.

65
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:17,060
And if you know anything about boxing,
that's not really how it works.

66
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,810
So as soon as you do that
you end up in the 99% of the people

67
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,709
who'll end up on the 100th page of YouTube
and whose video will never be viewed.

68
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:29,870
Again, if you search for
The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,

69
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,209
which is one of the most searched books,
the first two videos will be by FightMediocrity.

70
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:39,120
Why? Because it's the results of what I'm
talking about right now...

71
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,728
So let's look at it from the viewers perspective.
I'm on YouTube because I want to learn something,

72
00:04:44,728 --> 00:04:47,469
and I just watched a two minute video that
told me,

73
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:52,979
"This is a great book, it will make you successful,
buy it through my link below."

74
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:56,219
So I basically wasn't given anything,
it's actually worse,

75
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,060
because you just wasted my time,
and now you're asking me to do something for

76
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,459
you.
So I'm going to have a reaction like,

77
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:05,839
"Yeah, no thanks."
I'm going to exit you out

78
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,579
and never watch anything from you ever again.

79
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:14,430
Now let's take a look at this channel.
I just watched eight videos in a row

80
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,280
that I learned a lot from.
I'm starting to love the channel,

81
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,549
and I want to see more videos in the future.
And let's say I also decide I want to buy

82
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,400
Gary's book.
If there's an affiliate link below,

83
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:28,529
why wouldn't I buy through the link and support
the channel?

84
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:32,198
Now here's the thing...
I don't even have affiliate links on my channel,

85
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,218
but if I did put them up,
people would buy through them.

86
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:38,288
Why?
Because if I've been given 10 videos

87
00:05:38,288 --> 00:05:41,019
that let's say I really enjoyed
and learned from,

88
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:44,609
I'm much more likely to respond
to being asked for something.

89
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,189
This is why not a day goes by,
when I don't get an email from someone saying,

90
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:50,949
"Hey, I just watched your videos and loved
them.

91
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:54,098
I want to buy the book,
but I can't find the affiliate links on your

92
00:05:54,098 --> 00:05:57,550
channel.
I really want to support your channel."

93
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,460
That right there is where you want to be!
You want to do well today?

94
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:03,448
That is the kind of reputation you should
be building.

95
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:07,629
You want to be giving so much
that when you do ask for something,

96
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:10,379
people almost feel bad to not help you out.

97
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:14,490
We got this whole thing upside down.
And this is honestly more of a life lesson

98
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,668
than a social media lesson.
And it boils down to this...

99
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:22,128
If you want to do really well in life,
if you want to really stand out,

100
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:24,189
STOP CONSTANTLY ASKING FOR SHIT.

101
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:25,810
Everyone can ask for something,
and they do,

102
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,718
but how many people try to actually give something?
I get a 100 emails a day,

103
00:06:30,718 --> 00:06:34,748
and 99 of them ask for something.
Just one persons offers to give something

104
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:37,659
that is actually valuable.
Just one!

105
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:39,718
You want to do well?
You want to stand out?

106
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:42,788
Be that one person!
Seriously, be that one person.

107
00:06:42,788 --> 00:06:46,089
Yes, you'll get stuff back,
this isn't some zen lesson you don't want

108
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:48,418
to hear about.
But give a hundred times,

109
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:52,098
and then ask,
and you'll be amazed at how well people respond.

110
00:06:52,098 --> 00:06:57,199
And like I said this is more of a life lesson,
but it's just so much worse with social media,

111
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,110
and here's why...
When I was a kid,

112
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:05,120
my friends didn't come up to me and say,
"Hey, my aunt has an old fridge and wants

113
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,709
a nicer one,
do you want to donate?"

114
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:10,098
Why?
Because you're going to feel like an idiot.

115
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:14,639
You're going to feel uncomfortable asking.
But hey, it's the 21st century,

116
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,710
just put it on GoFundMe
and drop it on Facebook,

117
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:21,658
no problem.
You're so detached that it doesn't make you

118
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:23,620
feel bad.
But here's the thing...

119
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:28,110
There's an actual person behind that computer
screen.

120
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:32,718
There are a hundred other people asking him
to fund them every day.

121
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:36,998
Like it's so bad today that
you could have a horrible form of cancer,

122
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:41,370
and a person will look at your sick pictures,
and it won't phase him at all.

123
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,699
He sees something like that a hundred times
a day,

124
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:48,650
and is just desensitized now.
If you think you're going to sell your mediocre

125
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:52,138
product
in a market like that by doing what everyone

126
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,749
else is doing,
you have to be out of your mind!

127
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:59,319
Again, you want to do well in life?
You want to stand out?

128
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:02,090
Don't be the guy asking for a new fridge.

129
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:05,149
Now, a few days ago I created a Twitter for
FightMediocrity,

130
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:09,149
and I followed Gary
and I wanted to follow a bunch of other authors

131
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:12,758
that I like.
Now remember, these are authors that have

132
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,710
best-selling books.
Pretty smart people.

133
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:19,778
And I take a look at their Twitter,
and it sucks, it's not doing well.

134
00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:23,439
So I take a look at their tweets,
and it's like tweets every two weeks saying

135
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,129
something like,
"buy my book here..."

136
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:28,979
or,
"giving a speech here, so buy tickets here."

137
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:32,288
It was seriously like right hook, right hook,
right hook.

138
00:08:32,288 --> 00:08:35,000
Forever... :)
Of course their Twitter isn't doing well,

139
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,899
and I didn't want to follow them either.

140
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:41,750
How do you give value in a 140 characters?
I remember I followed Gary,

141
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,078
and one of his recent tweets literally said,
"Hope you guys have an awesome day. That's

142
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:47,588
it."
Or something like that.

143
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:51,690
Now, pretty simple right?
But even that is a form of giving.

144
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,940
He's giving you positive emotions.
When he does that,

145
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,709
and gives you something in another 99 tweets,
and then he asks for something,

146
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,838
yes, you start to want to give back.

147
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:07,630
So again, remember you need to jab a lot
before you right hook.

148
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:11,559
Everyone's asking for stuff...
You don't stand out by being yet another person

149
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:15,559
who asks for stuff.
You won't even register on people's radars.

150
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:21,028
They're completely desensitized to it.
You stand out by giving, cause no one's doing

151
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:23,559
it.
And you realize that the more you give,

152
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:27,559
the higher your chances of when you eventually
ask,

153
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:28,859
people are going to reciprocate.
