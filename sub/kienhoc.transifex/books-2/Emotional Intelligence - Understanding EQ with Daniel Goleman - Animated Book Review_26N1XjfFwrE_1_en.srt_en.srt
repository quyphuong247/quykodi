1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,469
so what's the difference between
intellectual intelligence and emotional

2
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:10,830
intelligence now there are actually
eight different intelligences that have

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,009
been categorized but today we're going
to be looking at emotional intelligence

4
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:18,420
specifically the book written by daniel
goleman so why is emotional intelligence

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,560
so important

6
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:22,679
well you can tell the difference between
a robotic person who knows a lot but

7
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:26,460
they have very little emotions and a
charismatic intellectual who seems to

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,760
move a whole audience and you can also
tell it in the bank account friends and

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,210
love lives as well in fact Daniel
Goleman says that those who have just

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,320
enough IQ to get into a decent
university but have a stellar eq for the

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,090
ones who rake in the most cash

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,570
so how can you develop your EQ and what
can you do to cultivate it so there are

13
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,710
five areas of growth you can work on to
increase your EQ score developed by

14
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,160
daniel goleman i'm going to go over some
topics that revolve around them and how

15
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,369
you can work on increasing your
emotional intelligence today so the

16
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:56,459
first is self-awareness the second is
managing emotions

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,359
the third is self motivation which
personally this is an area i can work on

18
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,978
the fourth is empathy and the fifth is
handling relationships so the first big

19
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:08,159
topic we're going to go into today is
called the ventilation fallacy

20
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,580
so there's a stereotypical thought in
modern society that to get over your

21
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,769
feelings or anger or something like that

22
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:17,368
we must talk about them and this helps
to some degree to cognitively think

23
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:22,140
about your subconscious feelings but
venting does not help yelling ranting

24
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,579
typing up essays over bitterness
flipping someone off cesspools of poison

25
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:30,090
as a status update or any other for
inventing method are according to

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,618
Daniel's theory wrong and technically
make the situation worse see venting

27
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,009
when you're angry prolongs your feelings
and doesn't help stop them

28
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,280
Goldman and many other studies have
proven this I think venting when you're

29
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,879
sad is ok because it's a great way to
find out why you're sad and thus you can

30
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,179
make the changes you need to to not be
sad anymore when you're angry

31
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,780
there's usually not much cognitive
thinking and it's usually mostly just

32
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,140
emotional lizard brain thinking that
happens to cause problems down the road

33
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,489
so try not to vent the next topic we're
going to go over is to try not to

34
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:03,390
ruminate over things instead try to find
distractions so in high school I used to

35
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,019
be very self-conscious about the things
i'd say to other people like was i funny

36
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:09,639
to did I sound smart

37
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,189
these meant a lot to me when I was in
high school and I thought about them a

38
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:12,699
lot

39
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:16,269
eventually I started a new hobby i
started weightlifting now this little

40
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,350
hobby lasted for probably four to six
months but I lifted good and almost

41
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:23,859
every single day and this was a great
distraction but it also built up my

42
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,030
physical stature which physiologically
made me more confident so i distracted

43
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,849
myself about what i would say $PERCENT
by weight lifting

44
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:34,659
it's kind of hard to explain but my
confidence increased and I didn't worry

45
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:38,500
about as much of what i said i know some
people do with depression and negative

46
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,550
thoughts every day

47
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,390
in fact I dare to say lots of people do
and there's a way around this because

48
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:46,238
I've been there and I know the
environments and thoughts and fears and

49
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,800
pain they only sell feed and they grow
and it's hard to get out of so negative

50
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,800
thoughts keep you in the negative
mindset and just like the confirmation

51
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,080
bias they will confirm your sad feelings

52
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,040
according to the availability virus
things that you ruminate on things that

53
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:03,069
you're constantly thinking about will
stick around easier and they won't go

54
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:06,969
away on their own so you need to fill
your head with new ideas instead get

55
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:10,719
some hope by starting a business gain
some confidence by working out do

56
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,959
something physically active to distract
your brain and raise it to a higher

57
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:16,479
energy level it can be done

58
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,389
you just have to have the motivation to
do it which is also very important to

59
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:23,439
emotional intelligence and like
willpower can be strengthened over time

60
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,310
so the next big topic is going to be
self motivation so self motivation is

61
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,939
obviously closely tied to full power and
you can cultivate it most of the time

62
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:34,780
passion will drive you to do something
so find that find something that you

63
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,159
have passionate and you'll likely have
tons of self motivation for me at times

64
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:44,049
it has been web development playing with
lasers weightlifting and now it's making

65
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:47,739
awesome helpful videos so the important
thing to this is you have to be very

66
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:50,799
self-aware you have to know what you can
do to motivate yourself

67
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:54,849
I'm gonna go into a little subcategory
most people are motivated by one of four

68
00:03:54,849 --> 00:04:00,159
things they all start within money
mating momentum or mastery of course

69
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,419
money as material things and gaining
wealth mating is sexual or romantic

70
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:08,708
desire and this helps if you want to
lose weight weight lift or get in better

71
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:13,060
shape momentum is basically freedom
doing what you want where you want and

72
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,769
always growing for me this channels
momentum is huge i love waking up and

73
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:21,608
seeing 300 new subscribers or a couple
facebook messages about how I have

74
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:22,909
changed someone's life

75
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:26,780
it drives me to make more videos knowing
are making a difference in so many lives

76
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:30,979
in the last is mastery which is
basically status and being able to tell

77
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,160
others you're a great leader or you know
how to program and eight programming

78
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,810
languages or speaking 14 or you're in
8th degree black belt find what

79
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,389
motivates you and use it to your
advantage

80
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:43,729
so if you've never heard of the
marshmallow story i'm going to sum it up

81
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,569
pretty quickly

82
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:47,480
basically they take a whole bunch of
little four-year-olds and bring them

83
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,350
into this room and they give them two
options one they can eat the marshmallow

84
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:55,760
right now or two they can wait until the
researcher gets back and have two

85
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,839
marshmallows and they actually videotape
this study so they did after it probably

86
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,560
15-20 years they started and they went
back to these people and they were

87
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,949
trying to figure out the people that
waited and got the two marshmallows and

88
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:11,479
they practice delayed gratification were
they more successful when they found was

89
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,770
the after graduation waiting having this
ability to delay gratification was a

90
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:20,750
better predictor than IQ of their s80
scores it is also a huge factor of

91
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,560
emotional intelligence and future
success so there's also studies that say

92
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,430
you can strengthen your willpower and
your ability to delay gratification just

93
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,490
like a muscle and also that it gets week
throughout the day and the more you use

94
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,900
it also like a muscle so the next topic
I'd like to go over is that emotions are

95
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:39,500
contagious so there was this study where
they took a volunteer with a high energy

96
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,980
level that is they were super excited
pumped up exuberant and they put him

97
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,390
with another volunteer with a low energy
level as they were almost depressed and

98
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,329
they set them in a room for a couple
minutes to talk before they talk they

99
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:53,990
fill out a form giving them a
qualitative review of their moods a

100
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,150
couple minutes later and magic happen

101
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:59,060
they gave the form back to both people
and what they realized was that most

102
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,980
people then stay the same energy level
in fact in most cases the high energy

103
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,730
level was transferred to the low-energy
person which means that if you're in a

104
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:12,410
slump or right and you can't seem to get
happy or excited about life start

105
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,590
hanging around people with lots of
energy lots of drive lots of people who

106
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:18,649
are ambitious and happy about life
because it's contagious

107
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:22,250
on the other hand if you see one of your
friends in the dumps do them a favor and

108
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,209
help them out

109
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:27,049
start spending more time around them so
the next topic is going to be empathy so

110
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,410
empathy is the ability to feel and react
to the emotions of others

111
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,340
now this is a requirement for being a
great leader and you must know what

112
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:36,119
motivates other people and how to pick

113
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,269
one up effectively when they're in a rut
so knowing other people's feelings

114
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:43,049
especially if you know them better than
they do will give you an edge and you'll

115
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,710
be perceived as highly intelligent in
any field but the best advice I can give

116
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:50,189
you is a talk to lots of people about
their feelings on an emotional level and

117
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:54,029
finding out how they take the last topic
we're going to talk about is managing

118
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:59,129
relationships and this topic is kind of
hard to go into in this video so if you

119
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:02,728
want to check out my other videos also
check out Gary Vaynerchuk videos he had

120
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:07,500
some amazing videos on managing
relationships and empathy go check them

121
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,610
