00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,410
How Google Works by Eric Schmidt and Jonathan
Rosenberg

2
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:19,810
Eric Schmidt was the CEO of Google for ten
years. He became the CEO in 2001. At that

3
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:24,428
point it was a successful three year old internet
start-up, but was already preparing to compete

4
00:00:24,428 --> 00:00:28,729
with the giant Microsoft.
Google was different to other places Schmidt

5
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:35,049
had worked. Even as CEO he had to share his
office. The company was growing in size and

6
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:39,069
in 2002 Jonathan Rosenberg joined as Head
of Products.

7
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:44,289
The company’s early principles consisted
of focusing on the user, hiring as many great

8
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:49,329
software engineers as they could and give
those engineers freedom. Google was managed

9
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:52,719
with informal meetings of small engineering
teams.

10
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,969
In 2003 Schmidt and Rosenberg were charged
with creating a business plan to take on Microsoft.

11
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:02,800
To carry it out involved learning a new way
of managing these smart creatives who are

12
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,530
not shackled by organisation structures and
defined rules. They’ve been learning and

13
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,750
documenting these new management methods ever
since and this book gives us an insight into

14
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:17,938
how Google works, providing a series of steps
in the development of the company.

15
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:22,969
Culture
When starting a company, culture is an important

16
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:27,420
consideration. Smart creatives need to care
about where they work to produce their best

17
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,200
work. The culture should be defined by the
founders and the founding team. In Google’s

18
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,409
case, the culture of the company is the same
now as it was back then.

19
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,399
The office layout at Google is not typical.
It is deliberately crowded to encourage interaction

20
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,609
and reduce envy of other colleagues’ facilities.
Employees are not segregated in the office

21
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:53,349
by what they do; product managers sit with
engineers to increase integration. The office

22
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:58,319
is often messy (a by-product of innovation)
but the engineers are given access to as much

23
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,639
computing power as possible and Google’s
offices are packed with amenities, again promoting

24
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,060
more employee interaction and therefore more
chance of colleagues putting their heads together

25
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,449
and coming up with the next billion dollar
idea.

26
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:15,879
The organisational structure is relatively
flat. Each manager must have at least seven

27
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:21,009
direct reports. This helps the smart creatives
get stuff done and provides them with better

28
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:27,069
access to the people that make decisions.
Small teams working on breakthroughs are encouraged.

29
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:31,599
Jeff Bezos of Amazon had a “two pizza team”
rule, where the team should be small enough

30
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:38,138
to be fed by two pizzas. Larger teams should
take over as a product grows.

31
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:43,459
Establishing a culture of saying yes is also
important as saying yes starts things, which

32
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:47,719
leads to experiences, which in turn leads
to increased knowledge. Sir Richard Branson

33
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:52,879
has developed a nickname at Virgin due to
the number of times he uses the word – “Dr.

34
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,359
Yes”.
Strategy

35
00:02:54,359 --> 00:03:03,049
There are three principles to Google’s strategy.
1. Bet on technical insights, not market research.

36
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:09,290
A technical insight either reduces cost or
increases functionality of a product significantly.

37
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:13,969
Nearly every successful Google product has
them. Google Search was better than any previous

38
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:18,159
search engines because the founders worked
out how relevant a web page is to a search

39
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:26,120
query based on which other pages link to it.
2. Optimise for growth, not for revenue.

40
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,379
In order to achieve something big, you need
to be able to grow quickly and globally, in

41
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:36,060
other words, scale. The strategy must be to
grow big and quickly. Google resisted the

42
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,150
urge to make more money by putting adverts
on its homepage and instead focused on improving

43
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:45,439
and investing in the search engine.
3. Let great products grow the market for

44
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,269
everyone.
Keeping your product “open” by adhering

45
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:53,979
to standards and sharing computer code for
example, means losing some control but gaining

46
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:59,109
scale and innovation. It allows you to utilise
the talents of many thousands of people around

47
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:04,540
the world who may be willing to contribute.
Talent

48
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:09,539
No amount of business strategy can substitute
for talent. Google’s recruitment process

49
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:14,668
is carried out by a committee of the interviewee’s
potentially future peers. The committee make

50
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:19,889
the final decision. Sometimes people are hired
even if they don’t suit an available role.

51
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:24,819
The important thing is bringing in the best
possible people into the company.

52
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:30,269
A company full of great people attracts yet
more great people. One sought-after trait

53
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:35,459
is passion. Passionate people will often talk
at length about their passion, whether its

54
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:38,859
work related or not.
Intelligence is high on the list of priorities

55
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,189
too but as well as that they should have a
growth mindset or in other words, be willing

56
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:49,420
to learn. This is an especially important
trait in an industry such as information technology

57
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,730
as it allows the person to handle and enjoy
major change.

58
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:57,420
Other aspects of a person that are observed
are their character and how interesting they

59
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:01,860
are. Does the person treat others well? Would
you enjoy their company if you were stuck

60
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,780
with them for an hour?
If interviewing, preparation is required.

61
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:11,219
Interviews need not be longer than thirty
minutes as most interviewers can make a call

62
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,970
in that amount of time. The candidate should
be pushed with questions that are challenging

63
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:21,340
but not overly stressful. Using the same questions
on different candidates is helpful to compare

64
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:25,339
responses.
When a person joins the company, they should

65
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:30,229
be paid appropriately. Great people should
be paid greatly, but the pay should start

66
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:35,360
low and performance should be rewarded.
Decisions

67
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,060
There’s more to decision making than just
making sure you’ve made the right one. The

68
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,280
timing of when the decision was reached, the
process of getting to a decision and the way

69
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:49,888
the decision is carried out are just as important.
At Google decisions are made based on data

70
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:55,470
– and lots of it. Decisions are consensus
driven. That means that everyone rallies around

71
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:00,670
the best idea for the company. It doesn’t
mean that there is unanimous agreement necessarily.

72
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:06,310
Conflict, debate and dissent are all encouraged
and help to ensure the right decision has

73
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,810
been made.
All these principles were utilised for Google

74
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:14,430
to come to a decision to enter the Chinese
market and create a localised site, google.cn

75
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:20,199
in January 2006. They were again used when
Google withdrew from China, taking the site

76
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:26,310
down in March 2010 after investigating hacking
attacks on its products.

77
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,329
Communications
Effective leaders today share information

78
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:35,990
rather than keeping it to themselves. As a
leader, knowing the details is key too. This

79
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:41,050
requires asking the right questions. An environment
must be created where tough questions can

80
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,759
be asked and the truth can always be told
– even when the truth is not good news.

81
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,209
When it comes to email, aim to respond quickly.
As a result you’ll be more likely to be

82
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:56,169
included in decisions and discussions that
are important. Emails should be clear and

83
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:01,610
to the point. There shouldn’t be any content
in there that people can skip.

84
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,040
Innovation
iOS, the operating system that runs on Apple’s

85
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,400
iPhones and Android, Google’s OS that runs
on many other smart phones are two innovative

86
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:16,519
products created by two of the most innovative
companies around today. However, whilst similar

87
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:21,299
in some ways, they highlight two differing
approaches to innovation.

88
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,110
Android is open-source. Anyone can use the
software’s code for free and anyone can

89
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:31,090
sell apps that run on Android devices without
approval. Apple’s approach is different

90
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:35,259
with iOS code being closed and apps requiring
approval.

91
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:40,860
Google defines an innovative product as being
new, surprising and radically useful – Google’s

92
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,189
driverless cars being a textbook example,
but how does a company become innovative?

93
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:51,089
The environment needs to be right. It should
encourage people smart enough to come up with

94
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:54,789
new ideas and also encourage those who want
to join that individual.

95
00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:02,220
The company focus should be on the user. In
2004, Google bought a start-up called Keyhole.

96
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,560
Using Keyhole’s technology they launched
Google Earth. It did not offer any direct

97
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,870
impact to the company financially, but it
was a tremendous hit with the user.

98
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:16,389
Thinking big is essential and provides the
advantage of giving smart creatives more freedom.

99
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:22,550
Big challenges also tend to attract big talent.
Google also runs a program where its engineers

100
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:28,139
can spend 20% of their time working on whatever
they want. It has spawned some valuable features

101
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:33,250
from Google’s search engine suggesting search
queries as you type, to adding bus and train

102
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:38,820
information on Google maps.
The current age is one where many industries

103
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,930
are feeling the effect of the disruption caused
by technology. Gone are the days where people

104
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:48,809
only watch video on a television for example.
There are economic impacts to these industries

105
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:53,449
due to this, so what can we do to survive
this period?

106
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,060
Businesses should utilise new platforms to
their advantage which will enable them to

107
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:03,028
produce great products. The social web, where
users can share things and talk about them

108
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:07,350
has emerged. Companies should ensure that
their products and services compliment the

109
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,360
social web.
Think not only about your company, but the

110
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,990
future as well. What could be true five years
from now and how will it affect the landscape?

111
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:21,899
Schmidt and Rosenberg believe that with enough
data and ability, any challenge can be solved.

112
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,600
Computers will continue to make lives easier
and better but for yet more people. Speed

113
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,970
will continue to increase, as will the amount
of collaboration thanks to the free flow of

114
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:36,570
information. The future is bright as technology
will transform practically every industry

115
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,290
or field.
