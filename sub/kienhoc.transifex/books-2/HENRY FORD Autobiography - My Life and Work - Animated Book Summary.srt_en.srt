00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:12,951
My Life and Work by Henry Ford
Born on a farm in Michigan on 30th July 1863,

2
00:00:12,951 --> 00:00:19,400
as a youngster seeing all the hard, manual
work taking place on the farm drew Henry Ford

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,570
into mechanics.

4
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,710
He got an apprenticeship at a machine shop
and after completing it, concentrated on designing

5
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,39
and developing a steam engine that could pull
a plough or wagon.

6
00:00:30,39 --> 00:00:33,370
It was only when he realised that people were
more interested in travelling on the roads

7
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,959
than working on farms that he switched his
focus to road cars.

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,739
He abandoned plans to run a road vehicle by
steam due to the danger for the driver but

9
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:46,529
didn’t give up the dream of a horseless
carriage.

10
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,739
He would work as an engineer and machinist
during the day and work on his engine in the

11
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:54,239
evenings, once he’d built a workshop at
the back of his house.

12
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,169
His first motor car was completed in 1892,
a two-seater, and after a year of tweaks and

13
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,379
adjustments, Ford was finally happy with what
he had made.

14
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,820
His first car scared horses and caused traffic
jams as people gathered round to see the only

15
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,610
car driving around Detroit.

16
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:17,850
After driving it approximately 1000 miles,
he sold it for $200 in 1896 and immediately

17
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,329
began working on a second model, which would
be slightly lighter.

18
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:28,38
Despite working his way up to chief engineer,
he quit his job in 1899 to focus on selling

19
00:01:28,39 --> 00:01:30,39
cars.

20
00:01:30,39 --> 00:01:34,780
Ford founded his first car company with a
group of men but resigned after three years

21
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,899
as the cars they sold were just copies of
the initial model he had made and the focus

22
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:42,929
was just on making money rather than improving
the car.

23
00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:48,670
He spent a year experimenting, which included
building race cars designed purely for speed.

24
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,960
One of them he created won a three-mile race
by half a mile.

25
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,100
The race garnered some publicity and the following
week he formed the Ford Motor Company.

26
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,699
The first car the company built was the “Model
A”, which cost $850.

27
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,170
In their first year, they sold 1,708 of them.

28
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:13,730
The aim was to make a simple, reliable car
for everyday use that was also cheap and he

29
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,730
succeeded.

30
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,679
It was advertised as a useful utility, rather
than just a pleasurable item.

31
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:27,80
In year two, they made three models, the Model
A (which was now $900), the Model F for $1000

32
00:02:27,80 --> 00:02:29,50
and the Model B for $2000.

33
00:02:29,50 --> 00:02:32,960
In total, they sold 1,695 cars.

34
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:43,270
In 1906 they built a new manufacturing plant
but sales for 1905-1906 were only 1,599.

35
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:48,910
Ford thought this was due to the high price
of the car and in 1906-1907 built cars that

36
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,520
ranged in price from $600 to $750.

37
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:00,280
His theory was proved correct as they sold
8,423, five times the number of the previous

38
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,50
year.

39
00:03:02,50 --> 00:03:06,10
After five years of experimenting with the
models, they were starting to sell cars as

40
00:03:06,10 --> 00:03:08,290
far as Europe.

41
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:13,30
All Ford’s experimentation and work was
ultimately done to create a universal car

42
00:03:13,30 --> 00:03:18,150
that was built with quality materials and
was simple, powerful, reliable, light and

43
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,340
easy to control.

44
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,810
Henry Ford achieved this with his next car,
the “Model T”.

45
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,680
Its simplicity made it easier to make so that
production of the car would be high.

46
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,180
When starting with a good idea, Henry Ford
believed in working on perfecting it rather

47
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,650
than looking for a new idea.

48
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,850
Almost all the features of the Model T were
already contained in at least one of the previous

49
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,890
eight models of car Ford had built.

50
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:50,730
It was sold in 1908-1909 and Ford sold over
10,000 that season for the first time.

51
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,590
No other manufacturer had ever done that.

52
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,800
Ford decided at that point that the Model
T would then be the only car they would make.

53
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,220
He built an even larger car factory outside
of Detroit to cope with his expected production

54
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,140
requirements.

55
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,899
In the following two years, cars sold were
18 thousand while the plant was being built

56
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,470
and 34 thousand once it was up and running.

57
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:17,889
The company went worldwide with branches from
England to Australia.

58
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:22,289
Henry Ford pioneered assembly lines, leading
to a significant reduction in the time it

59
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:26,300
took to produce an automobile and an increase
in production as a result.

60
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,159
He was obsessed with developing the best car.

61
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:34,490
His company bought one of every car that was
produced by other car makers just to see if

62
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:39,629
there were any features that were better than
the features in the model they currently produced.

63
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:43,569
As well as improving the car that was produced,
Ford’s other obsession was to reduce the

64
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:45,949
price as much as possible.

65
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:49,620
He believed that it was better to sell a large
number of cars with a small profit margin

66
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,419
on each, than a smaller number of cars with
a larger margin of profit.

67
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,719
This would result in a greater number of people
being able to enjoy using the car as well

68
00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:03,360
as more people being employed on a decent
wage producing the car.

69
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,520
As well as a car, Ford was also designing
and constructing a tractor.

70
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,210
Production of this tractor actually started
a year earlier than intended due to a food

71
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,799
crisis for the Allies during the First World
War.

72
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,550
In three months from the end of 1917 into
1918, the Ford Motor Company sent over 5,000

73
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,520
tractors to England and it was mainly women
that operated them, helping to plough and

74
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,740
cultivate the land.

75
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,340
The tractors were versatile and inexpensive.

76
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:37,30
After they were successful in England, they
were sold in America for $750 in 1918.

77
00:05:37,30 --> 00:05:41,289
Utilising the same principles of efficiency
and economies of large-scale production as

78
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:46,370
was used when constructing the motor car,
by 1922 the tractor was being offered at a

79
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,120
price of $395.

80
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,840
Henry Ford was a firm believer in self-reliance
over charity.

81
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,138
He built and funded a trade school that taught
boys how to be productive.

82
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:03,219
He also funded a private hospital with a capacity
of 600 beds.

83
00:06:03,219 --> 00:06:09,710
Ford also took over a railroad in March 1921,
The Detroit, Toledo & Ironton Railway.

84
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,620
Ford purchased the railroad as it interfered
with his plans.

85
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:18,80
It was in poor condition but after rehabilitation
of the track, buildings and trains, it was

86
00:06:18,80 --> 00:06:22,719
soon transporting freight quicker and cheaper
than ever.

87
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,139
Henry Ford started the Ford Motor Company
with next to nothing.

88
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:30,330
There were no favourable conditions or good
fortune that helped establish the company

89
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,258
as a car giant.

90
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:37,360
It was achieved with hard work and Henry Ford
keeping the faith in his principles.

91
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,870
The breakthrough occurred when they took having
an automobile as a luxury and made it a necessity.

92
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:49,110
On 31st May 1921, Ford produced its five millionth
car.

93
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,39
This was accomplished by adhering to a creed
of four principles:

94
00:06:53,39 --> 00:06:57,509
An absence of fear of the future
A disregard of competition

95
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:02,120
The putting of service before profit
and Treating manufacturing as the process

96
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,90
of buying materials fairly and transforming
them into a consumable product and distributing

97
00:07:07,90 --> 00:07:08,340
it to the consumer.
