00:00:01,078 --> 00:00:06,588
A few days ago, I wake up to the coldest and
snowiest day we’ve had. I go outside to

2
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:12,570
warm up the car, and my first thought is “This
sucks!” But after a few seconds, another

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,089
thought enters my head: “How cool is it
that you’re going to warm up the car, so

4
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:22,679
that when your girlfriend comes down, she
won’t be cold? You couldn’t do that if

5
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:28,000
it wasn’t freezing.” And I thought, “Wow,
this is an opportunity for me to really live

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,439
the ideas I’ve been reading about in positive
psychology lately.” So I get into the car

7
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:39,469
and turn the key, but now it won’t start.
I’m freezing and the battery is dead. And

8
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:43,390
again, my initial instinct kicks in and I
want to say, “This is the worst morning

9
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:48,609
I’ve ever had!” And then another thought
comes to my mind: “This is awesome. It’s

10
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:53,390
another opportunity for you to show that you
can fix any problem, especially something

11
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:59,030
this small. Can you convince a stranger to
help you jump start the car?” And I thought,

12
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,030
“Okay, that’s kind of cool.” And by
that time, my girlfriend comes out, and of

13
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,000
course I use her to convince a male stranger
to help us. When he pulled up his car, he

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,900
might have been slightly disappointed to see
that the cute girl also had a boyfriend, but

15
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,050
we actually got to know each other, and it
turns out I have a really cool neighbor. So

16
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,319
I hook up the cars, and in two seconds I have
a working car. And for some reason, when I

17
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:27,659
get back in the car, I feel like the happiest
man alive. That is, until I start driving

18
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,209
the Mustang and realize that I’m swerving
and sliding everywhere like crazy. And at

19
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:37,629
this point, I really really want to be negative,
but I look over at my girlfriend and surprise

20
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:43,060
myself with what I say, “How cool is it
that I get to practice driving a Mustang in

21
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:48,799
this weather? If I can drive this, I can drive
anything.” And she said, “Yeah, that’s

22
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,519
a really cool way to look at it,” and that
turned out to be one of the happiest mornings

23
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,048
I’ve ever had. And even though I mess up
with this constantly, even with stupid little

24
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:03,100
things like spilling something on my shirt,
I had done it right that morning. I had turned

25
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:08,750
the worst possible morning into one of the
happiest mornings of my life.

26
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:13,379
Every great thinker will tell you that there
is only one way, literally only one way to

27
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:18,199
attain happiness and positivity, and here
it is in the words of Eckhart Tolle from A

28
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:25,199
New Earth, “The primary cause of unhappiness
is never the situation but your thoughts about

29
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:30,719
it.” I have seen this applied to everything
from my example to my friends who lose their

30
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:36,620
job to my friends who get cancer. Viktor Frankl’s
masterpiece, Man’s Search for Meaning, has

31
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:43,590
similar ideas of how some people are capable
of doing this even in concentration camps.

32
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,659
It’s pretty safe to assume that almost every
one of us has much better circumstances than

33
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:55,060
found in a concentration camp, so there is
no excuse! There is literally no excuse for

34
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:00,959
why we shouldn’t all have happiness in our
lives! No matter how much we optimize our

35
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,348
lives, we will never have control over the
stimulus; however, the one thing no one can

36
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:11,159
ever take away from you is your ability to
choose your response.
