1
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:25,410
since my childhood My For playing guitar never ceased to grow . despite the difficulties that

2
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,009
i faced learning music theory and genres 
i've never lost the motivation because

3
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:35,170
i had a dream that one day I'm going to be
on stage in front of thousands and

4
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,948
thousands of other people . as I was
growing my playing got better and better

5
00:00:39,948 --> 00:00:43,558
and i thought to myself : hmm i'm actually getting good at this

6
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:48,679
maybe I'll try to write a song . so I go
online to look up some advice , I type

7
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:54,448
something like : how can I write a song
similar to my favorite artists single/album

8
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:59,048
i was very discouraged by getting these
bullshit results like : Hey man are you

9
00:00:59,048 --> 00:01:03,588
crazy or What , that's a maaaasterpiece
You make something similar to that

10
00:01:03,588 --> 00:01:09,359
give up , you don't have enough creativity . and
this is the problem with the majority of

11
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,810
all the amateur artists out there .
thinking that master pieces can't be

12
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,670
reproduced by normal individuals they
still see DaVinci

13
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:24,469
Van Halen Van Gogh like Greek gods with
superpowers blesseds creative with ideas and

14
00:01:24,468 --> 00:01:29,089
that creativity is just for quote on quote
lucky people ..

15
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:35,090
The shocking truth this book reveals
about creative work , is that ,  creativity

16
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:39,159
NEVER was the act of generating ideas out of
nothing

17
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:44,000
True creative work is learning how to
steal ideas like an artist and by

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,789
Stealing Here Austin kleon means ; embracing
influence instead of running away from it

19
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:53,810
here's an example that explains all of this :
The artist that wrote your favorite song

20
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,950
you're probably thinking of him as a
genius or a magician , truth is , when he

21
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,228
sat down to write that masterpiece , ideas didn't came up to him from nowhere

22
00:02:02,228 --> 00:02:06,828
He used and copied all of the scales , the lyrics and the melodies that his favorite

23
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:12,959
artists were using before him . he
dissected his role models work , learned

24
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,539
what it needs to be learned , then he tried to make something similar .

25
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:20,859
Also this video as an example , it's
inspired by a favorite channel called

26
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,180
Fightmediocrity the guy who came up with the idea
of transforming books into animation :)

27
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,370
guess what ? he didn't generate the idea
out of nothing

28
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,989
the materials are already there , He
just knew how to match them up together

29
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:36,159
to create something original .

30
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:42,969
And the idea is that nothing is 100%
original , everything is a mashup a remix of

31
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:47,620
what came before it . so if you want to
come up with creative ideas don't be the

32
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,539
guy who sees every piece of Art as original ..

33
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:54,989
Start looking at your influences as an
opportunity to steal ideas from , and

34
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,370
insert them in your work .. for this, you have
to be willing to chose your influences

35
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:06,599
carefully . Follow the best mentors online
and offline , also Hang out with only the people who are

36
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:09,439
better than you ..

37
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:19,139
This is Cody . Cody has a friend who's
really into video games

38
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:20,769
he would sit down all day long

39
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:25,250
playing video games following several
gaming channels, cody came up to him

40
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,669
one day and asked him if you could start
to YouTube channel himself . he said :

41
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:36,699
sure man .. I think i can do that but I'm not
ready yet , look these guys on YouTube

42
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:41,159
they seem to have a very unique style
capable to captivate your attention throughout

43
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:46,930
the whole  video .. I don't know man ..
everyone experiences resistance before starting

44
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,200
out any kind of project . Am i good
enough to start ? what if i get

45
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:57,000
alot of negative feedback ? there are others who
are already better than me ..

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,229
This ind of decease is called "imposter Syndrome". As Kleon refers to it in this book :

47
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:06,379
it's a psychological phenomenon that makes you
feel like you have no idea what you're doing

48
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:10,939
when you're starting .. to get 
yourself out of this mental torment

49
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:16,100
you have to follow these two key principles:
1 - pretend to be something you're not Until you are , fake it

50
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,320
successful until everybody sees you the way you want them to

51
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:25,009
the way you want them to . the second principle is :

52
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:29,129
2- pretend to be making something until you actually make something , the idea here :

53
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:33,668
is to make things know thY self don't wait to know
you are to get started

54
00:04:33,668 --> 00:04:42,629
fake it until you actually make it .

55
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:48,600
the not so secret formula to get success with your creative work is
a two-step long-term thinking based process

56
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,040
1- do good work , make stuff everyday
embrace failure and learn from experience .

57
00:04:55,379 --> 00:05:00,329
2 -share it with others , put it on
the internet share all of your secrets online.

58
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,980
share valuable ideas that will actually work
and help others , people will appreciate it

59
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,030
when you put yourself out there and
go all out .

60
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:13,669
also you need to place and constraints on
yourself that is the only way you are going

61
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:19,939
to get things done. don't wait to buy
that highly equiped computer to start working on your project

62
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:23,550
don't wait for your friends , do what you can
with the stuff and the materials that

63
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:28,520
you have at hand , don't wait to move to
Europe , America or anywhere to start your work

64
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:31,289
do your job and share it online ..

65
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:40,180
the world has already became a small
town .

66
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,689
i remember the day when a friend of
mine was starting out as a painter .

67
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:48,339
she came up to me for advice and of course a
gave since i was an artist myself.

68
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:55,429
however , after six months in , i got a call
from her telling me that she gave up on her passion

69
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:01,038
of course i asked her why , she said : i became very
good at painting thx to you but , i failed

70
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:05,349
to come up with my own style .. and i understood that moment she gave up on

71
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,449
painting because she was trying to
discover her style on her own without

72
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:15,710
copying from mentors in fact she had no
role models . and the big idea here that

73
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,430
when you feel like you've established a good
bit of influences you need to start

74
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:24,728
copying from them . Don't just steal the
style , steal the thinking behind that style.

75
00:06:24,728 --> 00:06:30,069
Austin Kleon says : an artist is a collector
not a hoarder so your job is to

76
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:34,750
collect as much big ideas as possible
from your role models and your influences .

77
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:41,529
beware not to copy from one person otherwise it's plagiarism , plagiarism is : trying to pass

78
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:47,529
someone else's work off as your own . copying is about reverse engineering . So

79
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:52,989
copy from all of your heroes , this way your theft will be unnoticeable and your work

80
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:58,470
will seem original . Gary Panter says : if you
have one person you are influenced by

81
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:04,510
everyone will say your next whoever . but
if you rip off a hundred people , everyone

82
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:10,709
will say your so original . another favorite example of mine to sum up all of this is public

83
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:14,948
speaking . if you're starting out as a
public speaker you're probably not thinking

84
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:19,090
about free-styling it for sure . you'd be
looking up seminars and watching the

85
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:24,429
best speakers online . after a period of
practice , your own unique style will come out

86
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,949
as all of your favorite speakers
comedians and movie characters combined .

87
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:35,699
as our old friend Francis Ford Coppola would say : we want you to take from us ..

88
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:42,879
we want You .. at first to steal from us .. because you
can't steal .. you will take what we give you

89
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:48,810
and you will put it in your own voice .. and that's how
you will find your voice .. and that's how

90
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,079
you begin ..

91
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:54,109
and then one day ... someone steal from you .
