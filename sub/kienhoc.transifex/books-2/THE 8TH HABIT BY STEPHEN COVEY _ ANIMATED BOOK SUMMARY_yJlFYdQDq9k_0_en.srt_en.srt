1
00:00:10,808 --> 00:00:14,888
As I've alluded to in my review of the 7 Habits
of Highly Successful People, Stephen Covey

2
00:00:14,888 --> 00:00:19,820
has written an upgrade book about the additional
habit number 8 - Find your voice and inspire

3
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,359
others to find theirs. Again, this is something
highly successful people do consistently.

4
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,910
Let's dive into what Covey calls the 4 intelligences
by taking a subjective look at what is commonly

5
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,238
referred to as the rat-race.
We're the average employee and we sit in an

6
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:39,070
office chair all day, so let me cross that
one out, "Physical" hmm, perfect.

7
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:44,158
We're writing e-mails, scanning and printing
paper, writing down notes, working in an Microsoft

8
00:00:44,158 --> 00:00:48,920
excel sheet and all in all everything is set
and done. We're supposed to do our step-by-step

9
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,908
process until the shift is over. If problems
come up we're expected to solve them, but

10
00:00:52,908 --> 00:00:56,890
that rarely pays off. We know what happened
last time when I tried to fix things while

11
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,268
Susie conciously made an effort to have lunch
for 2 & a half hours. "Intellectual."

12
00:01:01,268 --> 00:01:06,908
When's the last time my hard work was acknowledged?
Wait, let me think for a moment. Well, I guess

13
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:11,900
gratitude just isn't my bosses thing. "That's
what the money's for!" as Don Draper would

14
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,978
say. Oh, oh, but I almost forgot. I get paid
half the minimum wage, because I'm an intern

15
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:21,349
and therefore not as valuable as Christie,
who's sick every Monday and reminds me every

16
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:26,078
5 minutes that she's got 20 years of experience
doing this job, while I'm fixing things she

17
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:32,339
fucked up. "Emotional."
If I have to do this until I'm 65, as it stands

18
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,109
now, probably even longer, please just shoot
me now. This is only going to get worse. "Spiritual."

19
00:01:38,108 --> 00:01:42,349
Okay, Nenad, I get it, you're frustrated,
we all are, but what does that mean, why did

20
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:46,468
you cross those 4 words out?
These 4 Intelligences are heavily suppressed

21
00:01:46,468 --> 00:01:50,498
under the economic system we live in. Hence,
it shouldn't come as a suprise, that we're

22
00:01:50,498 --> 00:01:56,039
facing a serious increase in cases of severe
depression and suicide rates, when we deny

23
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:02,179
our true nature. Being civilized used to mean
something good. Now, it's just an ad-hominem

24
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:07,950
to throw in for someone who's losing an argument.
Like "How about you be more civilized?!"

25
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,709
As we all know, as humans, we're very susceptible
to the influence of others, especially when

26
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:16,890
they're trying to drag us down. You might
be having a great day and someone negative

27
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:21,729
ruins it by letting their frustration out
on you. It spreads like a disease and so Covey

28
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:25,889
lists 5 Cancerous Behaviors that inhibit us
from greatness:

29
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:31,289
Criticism, Complaining, Comparing, Competing
and Contending

30
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:35,289
And guess what, the office is chuckfull of
it. Having a traditional job as your main

31
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:39,709
income source is fairly common, but in today's
world we can't merely rely on our company's

32
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:44,840
loyalty towards us to keep our employment,
even more, because those cancerous behaviours

33
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,938
are slowly, but surely making us miserable.
We need to establish income sources and build

34
00:02:49,938 --> 00:02:54,739
or aquire assets that will soften, if not,
prevent our fall from grace.

35
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:59,549
You, I and everybody else on this planet are
able to discover our voice, because of three

36
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:04,500
gifts we are all born with:
1. You were born with the freedom to choose

37
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,829
I remember learning about the middle ages
in elementary school and how lucky I felt

38
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:13,310
that we lived in an age where you can decide
for yourself what profession you want to pursue.

39
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:18,680
I read about stories of farmers who were born
in poverty, without so-called royalty in their

40
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,998
blood. They weren't allowed to become knights,
pursue a life of luxury and had very hard

41
00:03:22,998 --> 00:03:27,769
& short lives without many of the great things
we all enjoy today. You may not be a priviledged

42
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:32,019
child of incredibly rich parents, but you
sure can accumulate wealth on your own and

43
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:37,658
live the life you desire, if you truly want
to. Plus, since necessity rules the world,

44
00:03:37,658 --> 00:03:42,568
those rich kids have no need to work hard.
In a strange way, you've got the upper hand

45
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:45,578
for not having everything handed to you. It's
a blessing.

46
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:52,819
2. You were born with natural principles like
Fairness, Kindness, Respect, Honesty, Integrity,

47
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:57,979
Service and Contribution. These laws of nature
are what makes us human. They influence our

48
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:01,968
decision-making for the better.
3. You were also born with the four intelligences

49
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:07,530
as mentioned earlier. Mental, physical, emotional
and spiritual. Each of them is unique and

50
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,680
yet they're heavily linked to eachother and
work best in synergy.

51
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,390
You, like all the great achievers in history,
can express your voice through

52
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:18,680
developing your mental energy into a vision
through developing your physical energy into

53
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,209
discipline
through developing your emotional energy into

54
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,060
passion
and through developing your spiritual energy

55
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,589
into conscience, which is your sense of right
and wrong and your drive towards discovering

56
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:32,508
the secrets life has to offer and sharing
them with everyone else.

57
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:36,990
This is what many modern-day masters, such
as Gary Vaynerchuk, Tim Ferriss and Seth Godin

58
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:42,509
refer to as "Story-Telling." It is one of
the most important skills we can aquire, regardless

59
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:47,169
what human interaction you are indulging in
like dating, selling or going to a job interview.

60
00:04:47,168 --> 00:04:51,609
It's finding your voice, learning to channel
it in the most expressive way possible and

61
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,939
then getting others to find their own voice,
which in and of itself is a very noble and

62
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:00,449
selfless cause.
