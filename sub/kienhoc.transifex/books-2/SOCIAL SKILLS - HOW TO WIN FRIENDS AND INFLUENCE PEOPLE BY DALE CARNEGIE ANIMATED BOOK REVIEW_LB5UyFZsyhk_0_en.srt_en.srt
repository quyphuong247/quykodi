1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,610
The first big idea I want to talk about is
the importance of remembering that a man’s

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:11,809
name is to him the sweetest and most important
sound in any language.

3
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:17,528
I used to meet people and I was so concerned
about all the social pressures and expectations,

4
00:00:17,528 --> 00:00:22,528
that I would miss the most important part.
And that part is when the person tells you

5
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:27,759
his name. I would hear it, but in about 30
seconds I would realize I had no idea what

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,929
that person’s name was. Not only did that
make my interactions awkward, but it also

7
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:37,559
made me unable to connect with people on a
deeper level.

8
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:41,939
And unless you have some kind of flawless
memory, you probably identify with this. So

9
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:48,318
what I started doing was not only focusing using
on the name more, but using a helpful technique.

10
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:53,489
When the person says, “Hey, my name is Bill.”
Instead of saying, “Nice to meet you,”

11
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:58,599
try saying, “Nice to meet you, Bill.”
You have just repeated his name back to him

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,558
and that helps tremendously with actually
remembering the person’s name. You will

13
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:08,390
also start to notice that people feel more
connected to you and respond better when you

14
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:14,560
use their name, and it is because a man’s
name is to him the sweetest and most important

15
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,769
sound in any language.

16
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:19,810
Now, the following story combines two big ideas:

17
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,899
Big idea 2: If you are wrong, admit it quickly
and emphatically.

18
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:27,450
and
Big idea 3: Make the other person feel important—and

19
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,840
do it sincerely.

20
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,228
A few years ago, I went out with my friends,
and by the end of the night they were all

21
00:01:33,228 --> 00:01:38,170
drunk and I was driving them back. They are
all yelling and screaming the whole way, and

22
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,868
suddenly they all decide they are hungry and
want Taco Bell. So I take the exit on the

23
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:47,468
highway, and I have no idea where I am, it’s
3AM in the morning, and I see I’m going

24
00:01:47,468 --> 00:01:52,149
the wrong way and need to turn around. All
of a sudden I have to make a split-second

25
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:57,549
decision, I’m about to turn around but then
I see the no turnaround sign. I still turn

26
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:02,960
around. I drive to Taco Bell and as I approach
to order, I see police lights in the rear

27
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,489
mirror.

28
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:08,280
The policeman comes up and says, “Hey, how
are you doing tonight?” And I said, “I’m

29
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,419
doing well, sir, how are you?” He says,
“I’m doing well, too,” and asks me if

30
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:17,818
I know why he pulled me over. Now, in the
next second, my social conditioning kicks

31
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:22,689
in. I want to say no. I want to say I didn’t
know where I was. I want to say it’s really

32
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:27,269
late, there are no cars around anyway. I want
to say I didn’t see the sign. I want to

33
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:31,840
say I’m being responsible, and my friends
are creating all this chaos in the car, and

34
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,759
I couldn’t think straight. Once that second
is up however, Carnegie’s principles kick

35
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:44,149
in and I say, “Yes, sir. I turned even though
I saw the no turnaround sign. I panicked and

36
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:50,930
made a poor decision.” As I said this, his
face changed completely. It looked so confused

37
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:56,650
like he had never heard anything like this
before. After some silence, I said, “I know

38
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,319
I made a mistake and I’m willing to face
the consequences for it. Thank you for doing

39
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:08,208
your job.” And he kept looking back in confusion
and amazement, then smiled like he had never

40
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:14,269
been that happy in his entire life and said
this while he handed me my driver’s license,

41
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:19,310
“Thank you for being responsible and taking
care of these guys and I hope you have a good

42
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,878
night.”

43
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:25,628
Now some people might hear this and say, “Okay,
you admitted you were wrong. Good. You made

44
00:03:25,628 --> 00:03:28,798
him feel important. Good. But you weren’t
being genuine.”

45
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:35,019
And look, could I have pulled this off without
being genuine? Possibly. But I do really appreciate

46
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:40,269
that policeman doing his job. I really do.
I appreciate him just like I would appreciate

47
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:46,438
him if he pulled over a huge SUV with a bunch
of drunk guys in it, before they crashed into

48
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:51,859
my girlfriend’s car and killed her while
she’s driving on her way home.

49
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,200
So the three big ideas are:

50
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:58,030
Big idea 1: Remember that a man’s name is
to him the sweetest and most important sound

51
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,968
in any language.

52
00:03:58,968 --> 00:04:02,840
Big idea 2: If you are wrong, admit it quickly
and emphatically.

53
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,169
Big idea 3: Make the other person feel important—and
do it sincerely.
