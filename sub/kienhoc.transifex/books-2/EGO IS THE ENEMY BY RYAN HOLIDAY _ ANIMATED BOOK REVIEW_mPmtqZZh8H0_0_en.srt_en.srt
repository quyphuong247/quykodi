1
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:12,469
Most of us are plagued by a cancerous attitude.

2
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,890
oftentimes When we attempt to practice a new
skill, we expect that we're going to be good

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,500
at it from the start.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,629
we don't want to think that we still have
so much to learn, We don't want to feel inferior,

5
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:23,679
we don't want to see someone better than us.

6
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,640
And so we distance ourselves from the truth,
that is we actually suck & still have a lot

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,030
to work on.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,629
If however, we make a little bit of progress,
we delude ourselves that we don't need to

9
00:00:34,628 --> 00:00:40,599
practice anymore, that we're now good enough
& thus turn a blind eye on our weaknesses.

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,630
This dangerous attitude is rooted in the ego.

11
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,980
Your ego is continuously looking for signs
of boastfulness from your part.

12
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:52,659
be it comments like "I'm above the process"
or "NOw that i've learned a couple tricks

13
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:54,750
& techniques I think I'm good enough"

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,759
The second you stuff yourself with these delusions,
the second you start showing off, ego will

15
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,649
come into play & create an identity around
your pride.

16
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:08,289
From there you'll start thinking that progress
is for losers or beginners.

17
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:13,280
You cease to practice & the next thing you
know, your skill gradually atrophies & you

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,989
find yourself back to square one.

19
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:20,189
To prevent this process from happening, you
must cultivate the ability to realistically

20
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,039
evaluate your progress.

21
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,110
In your early stages of practice, you have
to have a harsh look on your self from time

22
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:26,859
to time.

23
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:31,079
You must Admit that you really suck in some
areas & need improvement.

24
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,188
This is the only way to hinder your ego.

25
00:01:34,188 --> 00:01:38,618
Your motives for practicing shouldn't be to
get to a certain level so you can relax & show

26
00:01:38,618 --> 00:01:39,560
off.

27
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,478
Remaining humble, realistic, & retaining a
firm tolerance to face your weaknesses without

28
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,000
getting fazed by them IS What's going to push
you ahead.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,129
The ego doesn't want learn more, ego wants
to settle down & feel superior with the little

30
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:54,750
things it has accomplished.

31
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,959
And so While others are stuck in beginner
stages as they pride themselves for minor

32
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:05,239
triumphs, you have the upper hand if you course
correct on the regular & sustain self-detachment

33
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,859
from your tiny achievements.

34
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:11,439
Pat yourself on the back not for what you
have learned today or yesterday.

35
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,519
but only when you have accomplished something
big.

36
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:21,219
While creating a youtube video, I tell myself
that there will be a defect in the video after

37
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:22,109
it's done.
(sound effect)

38
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:26,439
I don't know yet what will be the problem
in this upcoming video but I won't be able

39
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:31,500
to recognize my mistake unless I admit beforehand
that I'm going to make a mistake.

40
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,519
I acknowledge that there will be a flaw before
I'm even finished creating the video because

41
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:40,189
I know that nothing is perfect, everything
is subject to improvement.

42
00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:42,840
This is the mindset you should be operating
on.

43
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,189
Every time you make a new product, a new song,
painting or whatever,

44
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:52,159
repeat it to yourself aloud "this is not the
best I can do" "it's obviously better than

45
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,668
previous but I can do better"

46
00:02:54,669 --> 00:03:00,030
When you continually acknowledge that every
new product you make is imperfect, you leave

47
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,709
no room for your ego to fill in the blank.

48
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:10,289
You know, I can burst with rage & bite back
when people leave negative comments on my

49
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:10,638
channel.

50
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,480
But I simply, ignore & let them be.

51
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:18,358
because I know that that person commenting
like that, is a clear sign of boyishness from

52
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:19,060
his part.

53
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,009
He's unable to provide feedback in a manly
manner.

54
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:29,000
People alike own zero control over their emotions
& so they can't help but walk around emanating

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,069
negative vibes.

56
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:32,739
You shouldn't take their unconsciousness personally.

57
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:38,159
If someone ridicules or criticizes you harshly,
you can react in two dissimilar ways:

58
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,280
Option A. you can burst with rage & fight
back, wich conveys that his remark had its

59
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,699
effects on you & that you're insecure.

60
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:52,930
Option B. Smile & ignore; this reaction conveys
that you are secure with yourself, you know

61
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,389
your worth & that no one else can tell you
who you are but yourself.

62
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:01,669
Ego will seduce you into striking back to
protect your jeopardized self-image.

63
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:06,239
You will hear the ego saying: "dude this guy
said this & this about you, you should bite

64
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,930
back, show him what you're about"

65
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,949
Remember, Only the insecure will bite back.

66
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:18,000
The guy who has tamed his ego, embodies a
certain degree of self-control that enables

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,829
him to respond to any kind of negativity with
sheer poise & non-reactiveness.

68
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:32,158
He knows what he's about & realizes that no
one else can define his worth but himself.

69
00:04:32,158 --> 00:04:36,949
I want you to spot the difference between
doing actual work & talking about your work

70
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:38,000
on social media.

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,699
For example:
I could waste six hours on facebook talking

72
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:47,960
about how cool my next upcoming video is going
to be like, OR spend those six hours WORKING

73
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,138
on my next video.

74
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:54,900
A boxer can spend a month Talking on facebook
about how he's going to win the championship

75
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:58,060
or he could spend a month TRAINING for that
championship.

76
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,908
ya see the differance ?

77
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:01,240
let's say you're a blogger.

78
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,199
now wasting time watching videos about blogging
is not considered work.

79
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,889
Ego is constantly looking for ways to trick
you into thinking that you're actually working

80
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:13,860
when you're doing things "related" to your
work,

81
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,430
such as responding to emails, sharing status
updates & quotes on your fanpage, twitter

82
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,038
page, watching videos related to your field
etc.

83
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,430
Ego wants to feel superior with these tiny
achievements.

84
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,240
now there is no magic potion for this,

85
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,740
Simply replace pretending to be creative with
being creative.

86
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,259
You're not going to compose your next song
by watching a thousand videos about composing.

87
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:40,550
You must sit down & actually compose.

88
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:46,280
You're not going to write a book by talking
on social media about how awesome it's going

89
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,168
to turn out.

90
00:05:47,168 --> 00:05:55,258
at the end of the day, it's not going write
itself.

91
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,710
Oftentimes When you do accomplish something
great,

92
00:05:57,709 --> 00:06:00,180
Ego intertwines itself with your success.

93
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,319
You then start identifying yourself with your
triumphs.

94
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:10,259
You're no longer john per se, you're now john
the rock star, john the CEO, the rich or whatever.

95
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:15,288
Your motives are no longer about building
a great company or producing awesome music,

96
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:19,438
you now continue to work to feed & reinforce
that self-image you've built.

97
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,789
like "I no longer go to work because I enjoy
working, I go to work because I'm the boss

98
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:27,218
& being the boss feels good"

99
00:06:27,218 --> 00:06:32,110
the consequences for this cancerous attitude
is when your business fails, when your empire

100
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,919
collapses, when you're no longer that famous
rock star,

101
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:41,959
that powerful image of yours you've been toiling
to feed & protect, shatters to the ground.

102
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,248
You will then turn insane.

103
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:47,969
you'll literally go nuts because you're now
left with no identity whatsoever.

104
00:06:47,968 --> 00:06:50,658
this is how dangerous ego can be.

105
00:06:50,658 --> 00:06:55,319
To break or prevent this egocentric image
for forming in the first place, you need to

106
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,759
revise your motives on a daily basis.

107
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:03,639
why are you in it in the first place? what's
your purpose behind working?

108
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:09,999
Recognition, promotions, fame, approval, big
bucks, all of these are short term egocentric

109
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:10,469
motives.

110
00:07:10,468 --> 00:07:15,550
this kind of motivation is always about me,
me, me; it's about what can I take, what's

111
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,740
in it for me.

112
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,218
Your purpose should be grounded in contributing,
sharing, growing, helping & building something

113
00:07:22,218 --> 00:07:22,538
great.

114
00:07:22,538 --> 00:07:27,370
Am not saying you shouldn't aspire for money
& power, that's totally fine.

115
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,939
but if that's your sole incentive.

116
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:34,499
it's going to show off in your work & your
product or content is going to suck.

117
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:39,719
You should balance your motivation with higher
aims like okey, I want to be powerful so I

118
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:42,089
can teach others to be more powerful.

119
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:46,128
I want to rise to the top so I can help others
rise as well.

120
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:51,090
always make sure your motives are selfish
& sefless at once.

121
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:53,109
balance is key.

122
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,759
ego is the enemy.
