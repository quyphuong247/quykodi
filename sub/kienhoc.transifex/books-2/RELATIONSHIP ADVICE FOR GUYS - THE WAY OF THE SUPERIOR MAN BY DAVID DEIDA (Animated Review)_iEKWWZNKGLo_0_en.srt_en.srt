1
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,618
achillus was a fierce warrior.

2
00:00:23,618 --> 00:00:27,609
who dreamed of becoming the strongest swordsmen
in his entire kingdom.

3
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:32,368
therefore he practised the sword everday for
12 hours to manifest his dream..

4
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:37,709
one day, the warrior fell in love with a women,
she was of great beauty and humble character.

5
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:41,249
however, something went wrong after their
marriage..

6
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:46,240
achillus began procrastinating on his training,
when the wife exclaimed for his reasons.

7
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,369
he said : "you know, i was planning on training
for the whole week but you're so mesmerizing"

8
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:55,729
"i've never had a girlfriend or a wife before,
i wish to spend more time with you"

9
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:58,968
"just please don't leave me, you're the only
thing that i live for now"

10
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:04,570
the woman heard that and a few weeks later,
she divorced him and ran away with a pirate.

11
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:08,829
the warrior's fault was nothing but to make
the woman his purpose.

12
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:11,368
and that is so off-putting for the feminine.

13
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:16,129
the main reason a women got attracted to you,
is because she felt that sense of purpose

14
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:17,609
radiating from you.

15
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:21,519
she saw that you were on your own journey,
bettering your self as a person, pursuing

16
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,450
your goals.

17
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,700
if you stop doing all those things and make
the women your purpose.

18
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,978
neediness will manifest itself through you
and the feminine will lose attraction.

19
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:36,539
yes you have to give her attention, yes you
have to show her genuine love and affection.

20
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:38,259
but at the same time

21
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:41,728
you don't need her to keep on existing.

22
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:48,069
and this is basicly how you maintain attraction.

23
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:50,789
don't cry over your mistakes, fix them.

24
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:54,929
when your women is pissed off because you
made a big mistake in the relationship.

25
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:57,170
the last thing you'd want to do is say:

26
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:02,618
uh i was depressed, i didn't mean to, i was
tired from work and all" okey.

27
00:02:02,618 --> 00:02:07,459
what she wants to hear you say is : "hey,
this is what i did wrong and this is what

28
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:09,069
i'm going to do about it"

29
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:14,589
she wants to see you fixing your own mistakes
in the moment instead of showing your weakness.

30
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,700
it's okey to err and make mistakes, we all
do.

31
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:20,979
the life of a superior man is like an on-going
mistake.

32
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:25,068
and the woman wants a man who's willingly
brave enough to make mistakes.

33
00:02:25,068 --> 00:02:34,139
and more willing to course correct without
collapsing.

34
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:37,908
the feminine does not want to make decisions.

35
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:41,889
the biggest life mistake a man would make
is not learning how to make decisions.

36
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:43,658
here's jhon with his girlfriend:

37
00:02:43,658 --> 00:02:48,060
"hey jhon, should we buy a new car this month
or save our money to start a business ?"

38
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:55,859
then jhon is like: "I donno suzi do whatever
you want,I dunno"

39
00:02:55,859 --> 00:03:01,409
like seriously, what are you doing here ? as
a man you are the one responsible for making

40
00:03:01,408 --> 00:03:02,498
decisions.

41
00:03:02,498 --> 00:03:05,799
do not expect the feminine to move the relationship
forward.

42
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:11,849
of course be open to her suggestions. Don't
be a jerk like "oh i'm the one who's in charge

43
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:12,568
in here"

44
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:17,729
but keep in mind, the masculine is the one
responsible for the relationship.

45
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:21,419
this is called leading
she wants a leader that she can rely on.

46
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:24,388
your women will look forward to seeing you
make decisions.

47
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:30,049
if you're not man enough to lead and to take
responsiblity, the relationship will suffer

48
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:31,730
drasticly.

49
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:39,378
because the feminine does not want to make
decisions.

50
00:03:39,378 --> 00:03:48,568
I see alot of guys saying "you know what dude,
I don't need women in my life i can live on

51
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:49,789
my own"

52
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:54,289
and there's alot reasons to why these guys
deny their desire for the feminine.

53
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:58,340
the most common and promulgated, is the fear
of interacting with women.

54
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,259
also known as "approach anxiety" so instead
of breaking through that fear

55
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:05,408
they rationalize that they's good enough living
on their own.

56
00:04:05,408 --> 00:04:09,959
personally, i've never seen a guy who's good
with women and simultaneously denies his desire

57
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,609
for women. it's impossible.

58
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:16,480
I wholeheartedly believe that one of the reasons
why guys switch on to pornography

59
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,549
is because they haven't been exposed to feminine
energy for a while.

60
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:25,668
their sexual energy is so restrained within
them, so watching porn is mostly a way for

61
00:04:25,668 --> 00:04:29,289
them to decharge and release their inhibited
desire.

62
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:33,710
the biggest misconception that guys have is
that porn can replace an actual women.

63
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:36,180
"oh i don't need women, i have my porn"

64
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,098
but what are you actually doing when you reach
out to porn every night?

65
00:04:40,098 --> 00:04:43,029
you're craving woman that's why you watch
porn.

66
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:48,750
Craving pornography is a signal from the body,
from the mind that you are lacking a certain

67
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,978
element in your life.

68
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:55,199
now I'm not dogmaticly emphasizing that you
need a partner or that you need a relationship.

69
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,199
this speech is primarly forwarded to the people
who need to stop lying to themselves.

70
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,020
and acknwoledge their lack of feminine energy

71
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:08,680
and the main idea here: you will always feel
attracted to the feminine.

72
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,819
you cannot deny your desire. it's an innate
biological quality.

73
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:17,840
even if you decide to unplug from society
and live in a cave for eternity.

74
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:23,228
sooner or later, your desire will find a way
to manifest itself. and it will make you go

75
00:05:23,228 --> 00:05:24,068
crazy

76
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:26,460
unless you become a monk or something.

77
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:32,019
if it isn't the case then
your attraction to the feminine is inevitable.
