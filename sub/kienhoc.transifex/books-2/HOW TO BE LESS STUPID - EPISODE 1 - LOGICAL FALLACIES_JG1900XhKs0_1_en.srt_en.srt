1
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:07,940
You tell your friend that eating fats can
be part of a healthy diet and he gets mad

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,170
and starts yelling at you, “Oh, so you want
me to eat McDonald’s all day?!

3
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:14,269
You want me to eat trans fats all day?!

4
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:16,429
Is that what you call healthy?!”

5
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:18,910
In his mind, he’s somehow rebutting your
argument.

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,760
However, what he’s done is essentially twisted
what you said into something that you didn’t

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,740
say, and now he’s attacking his own little
constructed argument.

8
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:31,570
You tell him that you were thinking more along
the lines of nuts and seeds, but for some

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:40,409
reason, he continues to be very angry with
you.

10
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:45,229
You and your friend are debating the complex
question of how taxes should be collected.

11
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:49,509
You’re more fiscally conservative while
he’s more fiscally liberal.

12
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:54,259
And so far, the argument has been going great
but all of a sudden he brings up Donald Trump

13
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:57,429
and all the bad things Trump has done in his
life.

14
00:00:57,429 --> 00:01:01,759
He goes on and on about Trump maybe thinking
that he’s somehow strengthening his position,

15
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,459
but he’s essentially introduced something
that’s irrelevant to the debate, and his

16
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:10,309
argument of whether Trump is a good guy or
a bad guy really says nothing overall about

17
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:15,829
the merits of fiscal conservatism just like
whether Hillary is a sketchy lady or a nice

18
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:22,079
lady says nothing about the merits of fiscal
liberalism.

19
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:29,349
You’re debating your friend about a topic
and you bring up some very valid points.

20
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:33,328
And instead of addressing those points, he
gets angry and starts telling you how you’re

21
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:37,959
wrong because you’re an asshole or because
you’re ugly implying that your character

22
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:49,179
or your physical attributes somehow have anything
to do with the validity of your argument.

23
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,979
A friend of yours asks you to explain in detail
everything since the start of the universe.

24
00:01:54,978 --> 00:01:58,459
You tell him that even though we know quite
a bit, we don’t know every single detail

25
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:02,798
about everything but we’re looking for evidence
constantly and working on putting the puzzle

26
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,270
together.

27
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:05,450
He laughs in your face.

28
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,530
See, you have no answers but he does.

29
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,489
He tells you that the spaghetti monster created
everything with his loving tentacles.

30
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:17,480
You’ve just been served an argument from
ignorance.

31
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:27,589
We don’t know certain things for sure, therefore
it must be the spaghetti monster.

32
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,150
Your friend tells you that he saw on TV that
if he eats some crazy herb every day, he won’t

33
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,260
get cancer anymore.

34
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:37,469
And you’re kind of skeptical and ask for
more evidence, and he tells you that it’s

35
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:44,221
true because the guy who said it on TV is
this famous doctor and he also has a PhD.

36
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:47,370
Unfortunately, just because someone has a
PhD doesn’t mean that they’re not full

37
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,370
of shit.

38
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:55,360
And also unfortunately, a lot of people don’t
seem to understand this.
