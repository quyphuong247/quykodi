1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:07,099
My grandma’s favorite story was about how
everything cost two cents when she was young.

2
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:14,779
But now, everything constantly got more expensive.
And it was all because of the government.

3
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:21,719
These uneducated pigs didn’t know how to
control prices. When I was privileged to hear

4
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:26,839
this story, her complaining would last for
hours.

5
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:33,259
And that is exactly what reactive people do.
They always focus on the things they cannot

6
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:40,259
control. It’s not possible that a concept
like inflation would exist. And if it did,

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,829
it’s impossible that they wouldn’t know
about it!

8
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:49,670
On the other hand, proactive people realize
that even if their complaining were completely

9
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,670
objective, it does not help them. So, they
focus on what they can control. If a proactive

10
00:00:56,819 --> 00:01:03,389
person owns a business where he sells a product,
instead of focusing on how people these days

11
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:09,879
don’t appreciate good products and how the
government has horrible regulations, he thinks,

12
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:16,879
“How can I improve my product, so my customers
can’t live without it?”

13
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:22,199
Do you realize how much responsibility, how
much dedication, how much hard work comes

14
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,820
along with asking that question? And what
do you think our effort-minimizing brain is

15
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:34,819
going to pick as default? And that is exactly
why most people focus on the things they cannot

16
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,118
control rather than focusing on the things
that they can.

17
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:47,118
Therefore, habit number 1 is, be proactive.

18
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:53,240
Imagine you’re at a funeral, but this one’s
different from all the funerals you have ever

19
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:59,519
been to. You’re standing over the casket
and you see yourself. What do you have to

20
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:05,489
say about yourself? This is one of the most
powerful questions you could ask.

21
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:10,109
Are you doing the things in your life which
are aligned with what you want to be able

22
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:16,520
to say? Do you want to say that you were a
good spouse? If that’s the case, how does

23
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:23,110
coming home and instantly being negative towards
your spouse affect that? Do you want to be

24
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:29,860
remembered as a person who added value to
society? If that’s the case, are you doing

25
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:36,420
the things that will allow you to say that,
or are you scared of failure and choose comfortable

26
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:39,539
mediocrity?

27
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:46,539
Almost every one of us will have to readjust
how we live when we ask this question.

28
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:53,900
Habit number 2 is: begin with the end in mind.

29
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,950
If I were to ask you, “What are the most
important things to you?” The most common

30
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:04,419
answers I would get would be either your wellbeing
or your relationships—your family, your

31
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:11,419
spouse, your children. You would never ever
say, “Organizing papers or watching TV…”

32
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:19,719
But how many of us spend more time organizing
papers and watching TV than planning our nutrition

33
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:24,580
and going to the gym, or cultivating a healthy
family environment?

34
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:31,580
There’s a horrible disconnect between what
we say and how we actually allocate our time.

35
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:40,050
Habit number 3 is: put first things first.

36
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:45,770
Imagine you’re an author, and I’m an author.
We both write interesting books and we both

37
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:52,280
have access to an audience of about a 100,000
people. I read your book and I love it. So

38
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,259
I decide to share it with my audience. As
a result, you now have 1,000s of people buying

39
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:04,359
your book and reading your ideas. You see
this and think, “Who is this guy? Let me

40
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:11,360
look at his book.” You start reading my
book and think I have ideas that are valuable.

41
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,660
So you decide to share it with your audience.
As a result, I have 1,000s of people buying

42
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,170
my book and reading my ideas now.

43
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:27,490
Notice how different this is from my creating
a little, creepy Amazon account, finding your

44
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:33,689
book and leaving a bad review, hoping that
this will deter a few people from buying your

45
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:40,689
book which will in turn somehow get them to
buy my book.

46
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:47,899
Habit number 4 is: think win-win. Stop thinking
of everything as a zero-sum game. For you

47
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:55,540
to win, another person does not have to lose.

48
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:01,560
Something I want my viewers to do is to subscribe
to my channel, but you will never hear me

49
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:08,560
say “Well, I worked really hard. I dedicated
so many hours to this. Please subscribe.”

50
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:18,459
Who cares if I worked hard? Who cares if I’ve
spent days creating this video? The real questions

51
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:25,459
are does it offer value to you? Why should
you dedicate your precious time to subscribing

52
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,920
when you could be doing anything else you
want?

53
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,889
Habit number 5 is something that I use literally
every single day, with every interaction that

54
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:42,889
I have, and with every comment that I reply
to, and it is this: seek first to understand,

55
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:48,870
then to be understood.

56
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:55,870
Imagine there are two people and a tree with
five apples on it. They are both too short

57
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:02,580
to reach the apples, but if one of them sits
on the other’s shoulders, he can reach all

58
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:09,579
five of the apples. This is called synergy.
The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

59
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,759
Now I’ll be the first one to admit that
you can’t achieve this with everyone, but

60
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:23,759
you should always be striving for synergy.
With every synergistic opportunity you create,

61
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,918
you can gather many more apples than you otherwise
would by yourself.

62
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:37,168
Habit number 6 is: Synergize.

63
00:06:37,168 --> 00:06:42,699
A man has been trying to cut down a tree for
hours. After a while his neighbor can’t

64
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:48,418
take it anymore, goes over and says, “You
know, if you sharpen the saw, you’ll be

65
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:55,418
able to cut it down faster.” And the man
replies, “But, sharpening the saw is going

66
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:59,060
to take time.”

67
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,310
We laugh at this story yet we do the same
thing all the time. We can’t find 45 minutes

68
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:12,310
a day, 4 times a week to go to the gym. Our
health deteriorates to a point where we’re

69
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:18,490
physically incapable of being effective. We
can’t read a book for 15 minutes a day and

70
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:24,819
mentally stimulate ourselves. We don’t build up our home environments, and we end

71
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:31,819
up with toxic families. We don’t cultivate
friendships. These things take too much time!

72
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:39,668
And then we have the audacity to ask for little
tips and tricks on how to be effective. It’s

73
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:45,399
like telling your engineer, “Don’t worry
about the foundation, where can we get the

74
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:50,029
magic bricks that float in the air?”

75
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:54,219
Habit number 7 is: sharpen the saw.

76
00:07:54,220 --> 00:08:00,300
And these are the 7 habits of highly effective
people by Stephen Covey.
