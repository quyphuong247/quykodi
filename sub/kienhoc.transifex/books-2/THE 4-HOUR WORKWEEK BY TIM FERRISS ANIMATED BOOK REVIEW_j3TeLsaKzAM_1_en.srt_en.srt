1
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:10,070
The subtitle of the book is, "Escape 9-5,
live anywhere, and join the new rich." Uh,

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:15,719
a little, perhaps, too good to be true, a
little scamy, but is this possible? Absolutely.

3
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:19,649
How do I know this? Because I have plenty
of friends who do the exact same thing, and

4
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:23,640
I could actually do this myself right now,
granted I wouldn't be able to live in the

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,899
United States. So is this possible? Absolutely.
But, are most people going to be able to do

6
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:35,390
this? Absolutely not. But, I feel like a lot
of people take that and use it as an argument

7
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,469
for why this book sucks, or why this book
isn't good, or why this book is scamy. And

8
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:45,510
it's like, look, can you become in charge
of your response? So imagine you wake up and

9
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:48,878
you spilled coffee on your favorite shirt
in the morning and then you go down to your

10
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,119
car and it doesn't start. Can you become in
charge of the response and still be happy?

11
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:58,019
Of course. Are most people going to be able
to do that? No. But, I don't sit here saying,

12
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,559
"Well, you know, that means that Viktor Frankl's
Man's Search for Meaning sucks and uh, Stephen

13
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:09,000
Covey's The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People
is a scam." But, with that said, there are

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,879
certain things that you don't want to be naive
about. And I actually do have plenty of experience

15
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,658
with this, so I do want to clear some of those
things up, so let's get into it. So imagine

16
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:23,330
I come to you and I say, "Hey, I make $30,000
a year. Here's my friend John. He makes a

17
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:29,658
$150,000 a year. Who's richer?" You'll say,
"Well, of course John's richer. I mean, he's

18
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:35,170
five times richer than you are." But is that
true? Okay, let's look into that. What if

19
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:42,170
I told you, "I work 10 hours a week, and John
works 80 hours a week." Ooh, what is it now?

20
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:48,700
Turns out that John actually makes about $36
an hour, and I make $58 an hour. Starting

21
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,719
to get interesting. Well, what if I tell you
John lives in New York City and that's where

22
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:58,149
his job is. He can't live anywhere else because
then he won't be able to make that money.

23
00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:02,519
But me, I don't have to live anywhere. I could
be anywhere around the world and still be

24
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:06,798
making that money. Well guess what, John's
in New York now and he wants to take his girlfriend

25
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,930
out to a fine dining place. He's going to
pay $200. But, in the country that I'm in,

26
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:19,409
when I take my girlfriend out, that's only
going to cost $20. Who's richer now? Well,

27
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:24,430
in this case, I'm richer than John is. So
I really want to emphasize this point, so

28
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,680
let me exaggerate it a little bit. If I told
you, "Hey, come work for me in Breadville

29
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,260
and I'll pay you $5M." You might say, "Yay,
I'm going to be making millions!" But then

30
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:39,620
you come to Breadville and a single piece
of bread costs $1M, you're not really rich.

31
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,989
So this is really the foundation of the book.
Yes, in absolute income, John is five times

32
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:50,159
richer than I am, but in relative income,
I can be way richer than John is. So what's

33
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,878
the basic idea? Well, you create a product,
and then you sell it - basic entrepreneurship.

34
00:02:54,878 --> 00:03:00,329
The idea is that great things happen when
you earn in dollars and spend in pesos or

35
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:07,330
bahts. So instead of explaining some obscure
example of a sketchy supplement that he sold,

36
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:11,408
let me give you an example that you'll resonate
with really easily. So you're watching this

37
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:17,348
video right now. It's basically an animation
video about a self-help book. Take the exact

38
00:03:17,348 --> 00:03:21,768
same concept, you don't have to reinvent the
wheel, take this exact same concept, and if

39
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:25,599
you want to know how you can contact me and
I'll be more than happy to help you, but take

40
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:30,969
this concept and apply it to, let's say, philosophy.
That's what you enjoy. You know a lot about

41
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:36,158
philosophy. Take concepts and explain them
in a fun and educational way. I can actually

42
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:41,598
see that becoming a great success. Grow it
a little bit, and then just through ad revenue,

43
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:46,530
just through affiliate marketing the resources
that you're getting the information from,

44
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,959
and maybe creating a little product, you can
be there. I can actually see that as a great

45
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,628
success. Now here's how that's misleading
and the book does the exact same thing. I'm

46
00:03:56,628 --> 00:04:01,259
not lying, but I'm coming from my perspective.
What I have to keep in mind is that the average

47
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:06,209
person doesn't even know how it's possible
to make money online. So when I'm coming to

48
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:09,719
you and saying, "Hey, you could do that in
a few months, and I can totally see that becoming

49
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:14,049
a great success," that's with the experience
and knowledge that I have. So guess what,

50
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:18,180
for a person who hasn't done that, it might
be hard to make a product that's going to

51
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,160
sell. Or a person who has no idea how stuff
works on YouTube, it might take more than

52
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,990
a few months to start a successful channel.
So make sure you're not naive about that,

53
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,600
but also realize that there is nothing that
I have that you couldn't get to. You could

54
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,000
do plenty of research, you could get plenty
of experience. So yeah, it might not be in

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,970
six months, but guess what, you start a channel,
it takes a year and it's a complete disaster,

56
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,130
and you learn so much from it, and then it
takes another year for you to build a successful

57
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:50,449
channel. That's two years, even if it was
three years, what's the alternative? If this

58
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:56,050
is what you want to do, the alternative is
working for someone as a slave for 40 years.

59
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,550
Now here's the next big thing and a really
important part of the book. Things don't take

60
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:06,110
as much time as we think they should. So I
was actually a part of a well-respected, successful,

61
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:12,129
one of the best organizations in the world.
And they would take people and literally have

62
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:17,089
them somewhere for 8 hours and be wasting
their time when if they had done that individually,

63
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:21,709
they could have done it in a single hour.
So two huge things that you want to keep in

64
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:26,849
mind when you want to be effective. One's
elimination and the other one's outsourcing.

65
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:32,240
So here's how I could use those two principles
to turn working on my channel all day for

66
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,720
seven days a week into only two hours a week,
only two hours a week, and basically the same

67
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,470
results. A big part of the elimination process
is the 80/20 principle, and I actually have

68
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,620
a whole video about that. But the idea is
very simple... I used to spend hours and hours

69
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,709
every day becoming a part of every website
and everywhere I could put my video on, and

70
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:57,638
then I realized, "Dude, what are you doing?
There's only one website that's sending you

71
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:02,850
most of your traffic." So literally, I turned
something that I did for hours and hours into

72
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:07,910
something that I do in 5 minutes now and I've
kept the majority of the results. The second

73
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:12,340
part is outsourcing. And the book talks about
virtual assistants, basically people who'll

74
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:16,638
do everything for you, schedule things for
you, do your email, all of that. And people

75
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,470
get really upset about that, "Well, what about
my safety?! What about the security of my

76
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:26,000
information?!" And it's like, look, first
of all, what were you expecting? Your increasing

77
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,970
your reward, so obviously your risk in going
to increase. But even with that, you could

78
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:34,600
do that really smart, but if you're not going
to do that exact same thing, forget the details,

79
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,310
think about the bigger picture. Outsourcing.
Focus on that. So in my case, the only reason

80
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:44,110
I haven't outsourced the animation process
for my videos is because I've actually enjoyed

81
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:49,710
it. So when I create an animation, the audio
recording takes about an hour, and then the

82
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:56,038
animation takes about ten hours. That's a
lot of time. And look, I don't even have to

83
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:01,110
go overseas to outsource that. I could outsource
that to a kid here that goes to high school

84
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:06,939
that has extra time. And I could pay him less
than 5% of what the video is going to generate

85
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:11,959
for me. And now each video only takes me an
hour to make. So if I'm going to put out two

86
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:18,519
videos a week, that would be two hours of
recording and you know, a few minutes of marketing

87
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:23,129
on just one website. That's it. But when I
first started I had no idea, and I would literally

88
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:29,180
spend all day every day doing those things,
and I've kept all of those results but now

89
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,509
it's only going to take me about two hours
a week when I start outsourcing. And get into

90
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:39,379
the habit of outsourcing, even if you don't
need it, start doing it. Often times, I'll

91
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:46,149
meet a person, just a fully grown man, a 40-year-old
man, and he'll brag about how he cut the grass

92
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:50,370
all day yesterday and saved the money. And
I'm sitting there thinking, "So your entire

93
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:56,019
day is worth $20, that's it?" So get into
the habit of this even if you don't need it.

94
00:07:56,019 --> 00:08:00,930
The experience coming from it will be invaluable.
You'll learn when you outsource it to the

95
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:05,030
wrong person, and well, they're not doing
the job right, or they didn't get it done

96
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:09,719
by the deadline. You'll learn so many things
but get into the habit of outsourcing things.

97
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,240
So in conclusion, this is a great book. I
mean I know a lot about this topic, but I

98
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,360
still learned so much, so I would definitely
recommend reading it. But, don't be naive

99
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,430
about, and I've addressed some of the things
that can be a little bit misleading. But,

100
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,110
at the same time, don't take that as, "Well,
I can't do it and someone else can." You know,

101
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:32,029
is this possible? Absolutely. Are most people
going to be able to do it? Absolutely not.

102
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:37,069
Just like most people won't be able to become
in control of their response to negative stimuli

103
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,629
around them, actually that's probably harder
for most people. But, that's not a good enough

104
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:48,629
reason to say why something doesn't have merit.
