1
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:17,670
Before vying to become President of the United
States of America, Donald Trump wrote a book

2
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,250
nearly thirty years ago that became one of
the most successful business books of all

3
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,039
time.
Trump starts by taking us through a week in

4
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,189
his life back in 1987 when he’d just turned
40.

5
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:33,619
There are a distinct lack of formal meetings
but a large amount of phone calls usually

6
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:39,099
between 50-100 a day, that are short and to
the point. Interspersed between these are

7
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,750
a dozen or so impromptu meetings. After leaving
the office at 6.30, the calls continue into

8
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,799
the evening and all weekend.
It’s clear that there is a strong woman

9
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:54,409
behind Trump, his wife Ivana looks after their
three homes and raises their three children.

10
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:58,449
She even helps out on the business side by
running Trump’s Castle, the second hotel

11
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:04,009
and casino complex Trump bought.
When it comes to the specifics of deal-making,

12
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:09,209
Trump aims very high and then pushes relentlessly
to try and get it.

13
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:13,559
His ability to think big gives him a great
advantage as many people fear decision-making

14
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,950
and success. He doesn’t just run a hotel;
he runs a large hotel with a huge casino attached

15
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,179
to it.
Any decisions he has to make are made only

16
00:01:22,179 --> 00:01:26,649
after asking lots of questions and getting
the opinion of everyone who is involved. Knowing

17
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:31,179
the market is essential.
To make a product valuable, getting the word

18
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:35,978
out is crucial. Generating interest and excitement
is needed and Trump thinks it’s better to

19
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:39,689
do it himself than having public relations
people to do it for him.

20
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:45,709
He’s bold, controversial and sometimes outrageous.
This causes the press to write about him both

21
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:49,990
positively and negatively, but from a pure
business viewpoint, the pros of being written

22
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:55,259
about far outweigh the cons.
However, no amount of promotion, excitement

23
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,679
and hyperbole will help if you can’t deliver
the goods. You can’t con people for long.

24
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:05,599
You need to have a great product.
Trump’s greatest influence growing up was

25
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:10,348
his father. His father built rent-controlled
property in New York and taught him toughness

26
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:15,439
in business as well as competence and efficiency
in an industry where profit margins were so

27
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:21,068
low. Costs had to be kept down so he learnt
how to negotiate hard with suppliers. His

28
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:25,268
father also promised reliability in payment
and the promise of future work as a way of

29
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:30,129
getting suppliers to lower prices. These were
strategies that his son followed when he moved

30
00:02:30,128 --> 00:02:35,919
into the upper market real estate business.
At the age of 13 Trump enrolled in a military

31
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:41,009
school and later attend Wharton School of
Business. Whilst studying he worked with his

32
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:46,929
father on an apartment complex they purchased
in Cincinnati, Ohio, which contained 1,200

33
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:52,019
properties. They increased the occupancy rate
to 100% by improving the look and cleanliness

34
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:58,329
of the complex and then sold it for a profit.
Trump moved to Manhattan in New York and started

35
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:04,069
working on larger projects. In 1974 he became
interested in buying the Commodore hotel,

36
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:08,608
a dark and dingy place that was losing money
but in a good location next to Grand Central

37
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:13,489
station and the subway.
Trump soon got some designs for the new architecture

38
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:18,840
of the hotel and entered a deal with the Hyatt
hotel chain where they were equal partners.

39
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,019
Trump would build the hotel and Hyatt would
manage it once built.

40
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:27,680
It took several years of negotiation and renovation
but when the hotel reopened in September 1980,

41
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:34,129
they increased the room rate from $20.80 in
the old Commodore, to $115 at the new Grand

42
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:40,370
Hyatt, with over 80% occupancy.
At the same time Trump was negotiating a secret

43
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:45,539
deal to buy some land in a prime location
on 5th Avenue to build a giant glass skyscraper

44
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:50,459
that would become Trump Tower. The taller
and bigger it was, the more apartments he

45
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:55,539
could put in there and the more money he’d
make. In the end the city planning commission

46
00:03:55,539 --> 00:04:00,888
approved a 68 storey building, the tallest
residential building in New York City at the

47
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:04,249
time.
The glamorous tower attracted many stars to

48
00:04:04,248 --> 00:04:10,079
purchase apartments, from Steven Spielberg
to Liberace. Trump moved into one of the penthouse

49
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,980
apartments on the top floor with his family
in 1983.

50
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:22,779
The entire Trump Tower project cost $190million.
Sales of the apartments generated $240million.

51
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:27,769
Trump also received $10million in sales commission
plus more profit from rental of retail and

52
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:32,478
office space.
Trump then moved into the casino business,

53
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:37,918
building the Trump Plaza in 1984. He had gone
into a 50-50 partnership with Holiday Inn

54
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,519
but after disagreements in the partnership,
Trump bought out Holiday Inn and owned the

55
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:48,639
whole building by 1986. Once in sole charge,
he tried to improve the profit of the casino

56
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,710
by hiring his competitor’s employees. His
policy was:

57
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:58,758
1. Hire the best people from your competitors
2. Pay them more than they were earning

58
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:03,449
3. Give them performance based bonuses and
incentives.

59
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:09,620
The result was a profit of $20million more
than was projected.

60
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,430
Soon after Trump Plaza had opened, Trump managed
to turn a potentially negative situation into

61
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:19,180
a positive and profitable one.
Hilton hotels had started building a huge

62
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:25,329
casino-hotel in Atlantic City to rival Trump’s
facility. Eager to start making a profit,

63
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:30,050
they started construction at the same time
as applying for a gaming licence. Unfortunately

64
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:35,410
for them, they were rejected a licence just
as construction was nearing completion.

65
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:40,849
Trump started negotiating with chief executive
Barron Hilton and negotiated a cut price deal

66
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:47,639
of $320million to purchase the facility. In
1985, Trump’s Castle opened and took a gross

67
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:53,410
income of $131million for the six months it
was open that year.

68
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:58,539
In May 1986, Trump was in his apartment in
Trump Tower, overlooking Wollman Ice Skating

69
00:05:58,538 --> 00:06:03,659
Rink in Central Park. The rink was supposed
to be closed and rebuilt in two and a half

70
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:09,780
years by the city. Six years later and after
nearly $13million spent, they were no nearer

71
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:14,228
to completing the job.
Trump wrote to the mayor and offered to rebuild

72
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:20,019
the rink in six months, putting up the $3million
dollars himself. After being rejected at first,

73
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:25,408
the letter leaked to the press, who all sided
with Trump. The negative publicity caused

74
00:06:25,408 --> 00:06:30,459
a u-turn from the mayor and a deal was struck,
with Trump getting paid back the $3million

75
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:35,579
only on completion of the project.
Implementing some strong leadership by checking

76
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:41,948
on progress daily, Trump oversaw the rink
fully built in four months and $750,000 under

77
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:46,139
budget.
Donald Trump spent the first two decades of

78
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:51,180
his working life accomplishing things that
many said could not be done. At the end of

79
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,908
his book, he promised to continue to put two
of his best skills to good use: overcoming

80
00:06:55,908 --> 00:06:59,370
obstacles and motivating people to do their
best work.
