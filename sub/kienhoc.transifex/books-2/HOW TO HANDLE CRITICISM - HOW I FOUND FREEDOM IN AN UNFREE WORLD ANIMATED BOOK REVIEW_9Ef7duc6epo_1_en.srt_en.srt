00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,980
A couple days ago

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,320
i went hiking with a friend of mine.
As we progressed deep into the mountain

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,740
My friend asked me to stop: Hey stop stop
there's someone behind that tree

4
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:30,559
He looks dangerous and now we have to pass right
next to him, to continue our hike.

5
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:35,379
i responded: yeah what's the problem let's
go say hi and keep hiking our own way.

6
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,620
He held me by the hand and said: ahm .. I don't
know i think we should get back home

7
00:00:40,628 --> 00:00:45,659
maybe the guy has a knife or something.
And this is what prevention focused people

8
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:52,519
concentrate on, they always expect the
worst outcome ever, so i said: Oy ! your mind

9
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,500
is playing tricks on you, Even if
something bad were to happen we can still

10
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,149
run back to our campsite, also think
about all the beautiful places we could

11
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:06,219
Explore on the other side of the
mountain. let's just go there and see what happens.

12
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:11,129
So on the other side of the spectrum
promotion focused people concentrate on

13
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:16,500
what there is to gain in every situation.
a promotion focused person is very good

14
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,700
at taking risks. as for prevention focused
people, they will do anything to get back

15
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:28,780
to safety if something bad happens,
So they're very good at protecting themselves.

16
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:35,400
The question now is: why do some people
have a promotion focused mindset while others don't ?

17
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:39,909
maybe this has to do with our
conditioning. harry browne sheds the light on

18
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:44,580
different traps that society uses to
keep us from striving for what we want

19
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:49,859
one of these traps is the identity trap.
the identity is one of the most reasons

20
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:54,640
why people grow up with a prevention
focused mindset. let's say that you've

21
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,219
decided one day to let your hair grow
long. your family had no problem that

22
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:04,920
they soon got used to your cavemen hairstyle. 
but the great challenge was the outside world

23
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,099
you keep hearing the same old comments
every single day from your friends and colleagues.

24
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:14,620
you know what ? i think you should
go shave the hair bro. others might say to you:

25
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,500
nah keep the hair, it suits you. but you know what suits you better ?

26
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:24,419
dreadlocks, yeah, you go do that yeah
The comments made you insecure about yourself.

27
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:28,359
So you thought that maybe
A haircut could solve the problem

28
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,040
but it didn't. things got worse. I think you
got the point here: anytime you allow

29
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:39,389
someone else to determine what you think
and be. you are in the identity trap.

30
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:43,449
This results in adopting a prevention focused
mindset from a young age.

31
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:47,139
you try and live up to others expectations.

32
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:50,640
thinking that you're going to prevent
them from disliking you.

33
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,139
to avoid the trap just keep this in
mind: what others say should be is either

34
00:02:55,139 --> 00:03:01,599
based upon what they are, or upon the way
they feel you'd be of more value to them.

35
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:08,550
be open to suggestions but never forfeit
the power to make the final decision yourself.

36
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:13,150
Only then can you act in ways
that will bring you happiness.

37
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,950
The identity trap is some sort of a comfort zone.
you rely on others to make decisions for you.

38
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:23,649
what happens if you try to break free from
a comfort zone then ? resistance kicks in.

39
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,560
i thought to myself, if we can get a
clearer understanding on the nature of resistance

40
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,439
from Howard falco's book. we can
probably help you to break free from an identity  trap

41
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:40,719
And therefore
change your mindset to a More promotion focused person

42
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,080
this is Sally. Sally's
having trouble sleeping these days

43
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,420
researching the problem on the internet
didn't bring up any relevant solution

44
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:53,919
other than: try to drink a cup of milk or
do some stretching before sleep

45
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,879
While experiencing insomnia for several days
she noticed that she was engaging

46
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:01,359
in a particularl negative thought loop
whenever she tries to sleep

47
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,100
the thought loop goes something like
this: oh god i need to work on that project tomorrow

48
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:09,180
it will be as tiring as it
was today. And i have to do the

49
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:14,289
laundry too. and i don't feel like going
on that date tomorrow, what am i going to say to him ..

50
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:19,370
from your own perspective Sally's resisting future
events and that's what's keeping her

51
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:25,639
from falling asleep but what she's
actually resisting is the nature of time itself

52
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,519
lying down in bed is comfortable. sally wants that comfortable reality to stay the same.

53
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:34,039
she's operating from a prevention focused mindset

54
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,700
where staying
comfortable and safe is her only priority for the moment

55
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:43,550
Reality is infinitely demonstrating that
everything is changing. To resist this

56
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,819
constant state of change is to resist being
in harmony with nature of the universe.

57
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:55,019
So let's recapitulate really quick.
First we saw that prevention focused people's attention

58
00:04:55,019 --> 00:05:00,159
is always on the cons of
things. they concentrate on what there is to be lost

59
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,580
rather than on what there is to be gained like promotion
focused people do. but i think it's better

60
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:11,269
to keep your focus balanced. it's like
take the risk but be careful at the same time.

61
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:15,089
Second we dug deeper into what
could've conditioned us into adopting

62
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:21,099
A prevention focused mindset. the identity
trap is one of the conditioning that weigh

63
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:26,100
on our will to seek freedom. it program's
us in a way that we are constantly seeking

64
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:31,310
feedback from the external.
As a result we live up to others expectations

65
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:36,470
To preserve their approval of our identity.
Trying to get out of the trap creates

66
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,690
alot of resistance because the Trap is
comfortable. why would someone want to

67
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:44,810
get out of a trap if everybody
around him is enjoying it right ?

68
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,750
So we tried to get a clear understanding on
the nature of resistance. becoming more

69
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:54,519
effective at dealing with resistance, gives
us an advantage to do the things that we

70
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:59,139
want to do in our lives, either be
flipping the coin into a more promotion

71
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:04,319
focused mindset or striving for freedom
in an unfreeworld

72
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,379
to be nobody else but yourself in a world which is
doing it's best night and day

73
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:16,079
to make you somebody else, means to fight the hardest battle wich any human being can fight

74
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,339
And to Never

75
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:18,599
Stop

76
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,180
Fighting
