1
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:19,480
Glenn Greenwald is a former law and civil
rights attorney. He is now a journalist and

2
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,380
author. His first communication from Edward
Snowden was on 1st December 2012. At the time

3
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:31,519
Snowden did not reveal who he was, simply
signing off emails as ‘Cincinnatus’. Cincinnatus

4
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,570
was the Roman farmer who was appointed dictator
of Rome, defeated all her enemies before voluntarily

5
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,030
giving up all power and returning to farming.
Snowden would also not divulge any information

6
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,109
until Greenwald installed PGP encryption for
his emails. Eventually in May 2013 they spoke

7
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:53,799
online using OTR chat, an encrypted chat program
for talking online securely.

8
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:58,629
Snowden asked if Greenwald would go to Hong
Kong to meet him. He agreed. Snowden said

9
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:03,250
his goal was to spark a worldwide discussion
about privacy, internet freedom and the dangers

10
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:08,149
of state surveillance. He also wanted to identify
himself as the person behind the disclosures

11
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:11,820
he was making.
Before travelling to Hong Kong, Greenwald

12
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:16,339
wanted to see some documents so he finally
installed PGP with some other encryption software

13
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,289
and received what were highly confidential
communications from the NSA. He showed them

14
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:25,468
to selected people from the Guardian newspaper
to get them on board and set off for Hong

15
00:01:25,468 --> 00:01:32,509
Kong with Laura Poitras, the independent filmmaker
and Ewan MacAskill, a long-time Guardian reporter.

16
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:37,159
On the plane Greenwald read several other
documents, including one secret court ruling

17
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,979
which allowed the NSA to secretly and indiscriminately
collect telephone records of tens of millions

18
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:46,819
of Americans. These files documented clear
proof that NSA officials had directly and

19
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:52,259
repeatedly lied to congress about the agency’s
activities. It was on the plane in one of

20
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,629
the files Greenwald first learnt his source’s
name – Edward Joseph Snowden.

21
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:04,149
On Sunday 2nd June they arrived in Hong Kong.
They met Snowden the next morning at his hotel;

22
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:08,729
he revealed he would be carrying a Rubik’s
Cubed to identify himself. The initial meeting

23
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,500
took place on the 10th floor after Snowden
had led them to his hotel room. He advised

24
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,259
them to remove the battery from any mobile
phones they had, claiming the U.S. government

25
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:22,000
can remotely activate phones and use them
as listening devices. If unable to remove

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,919
the battery he said they could put a phone
in a fridge or mini-bar to muffle any sound,

27
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,059
which they did.
Greenwald initially asked questions for five

28
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:35,378
hours straight. Snowden’s answers were intelligent,
rational and clear. After 9/11 he had become

29
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:40,429
more patriotic and enlisted in the army in
2004. After breaking both legs in a training

30
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,230
accident he had to leave the military. During
his time in the military he had become disillusioned

31
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:50,018
about the real purpose of the Iraq war, hearing
more talk about killing Arabs then about liberating

32
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:56,819
people. He went to work for a federal agency,
first as a security guard, and then in 2005,

33
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:04,548
a technical expert for the CIA. Between 2007
and 2010 he worked in Geneva for the CIA,

34
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:08,290
deployed undercover. Here he learnt and saw
things that made him realise that what the

35
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:12,509
U.S. government really does in the world was
very different from what he’d always been

36
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:15,858
taught.
In 2010 he returned to the NSA working for

37
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:20,998
Dell as a contractor for the agency in Japan.
Here he was really disturbed by what he saw.

38
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:26,938
He could watch drones in real time, and watch
entire villages to see what everyone was doing.

39
00:03:26,938 --> 00:03:30,560
He also saw the NSA track people’s internet
activity as they typed.

40
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,489
In 2011 he again worked for Dell, this time
back for the CIA in Maryland, USA. Here he

41
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:42,109
realised that the NSA were building a system
whose goal was the elimination of all privacy,

42
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:46,950
globally. It was this realisation that made
him determined to be a whistle-blower. He

43
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:52,209
was moved to Hawaii where in 2012 he downloaded
documents for the world to see and took another

44
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:57,620
job in 2013 with Booz Allen Hamilton, a defence
contractor, which gave him access to other

45
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,590
sets of documents related to NSA spying and
secret monitoring of the entire telecommunications

46
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,579
infrastructure in the USA.
Edward Snowden asked Glenn Greenwald and Laura

47
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:12,170
Poitras to vet all material carefully and
to use their journalistic judgement to only

48
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,798
publish the documents that the public should
see, and that can be revealed without harm

49
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,798
to any innocent people.
Greenwald wrote four separate stories for

50
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:24,519
immediate publication:
1. A secret order forcing Verizon to hand

51
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:30,959
over all telephone records of all Americans
2. The history of the Bush warrantless eavesdropping

52
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,870
program
3. BOUNDLESS INFORMANT (NSA’s data tracking

53
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,769
program)
4. The PRISM program

54
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:44,629
As soon as the Guardian published the first
story the impact was instant and enormous,

55
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:49,098
becoming the lead story on every national
news broadcast that evening. An unnamed senator

56
00:04:49,098 --> 00:04:53,469
confirmed the Verizon telephone record handover
had been happening for years and concerned

57
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,389
all major telecommunication companies, not
just Verizon.

58
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:01,889
The next story that was published was on PRISM:
the program that allowed the NSA access to

59
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:08,250
customers’ communications from companies
such as Google, Facebook, Apple, Yahoo!, YouTube,

60
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:13,199
Skype and others. The secret arrangements
between the companies and the NSA were denied

61
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,000
by the tech companies, despite documents showing
the program was in operation since 2007.

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,279
On Thursday, day 5 in Hong Kong, a security
device in Snowden’s Hawaii home had alerted

63
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:29,279
him to the fact that two NSA employees had
made a visit, searching for him. It was decided

64
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,500
to release an article introducing Edward Snowden
to the world which was published on Sunday

65
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,589
9th June by the Guardian, including a twelve
minute video interview with him. The article

66
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:43,750
not only told his story but conveyed his motives.
It was only a matter of time until reporters

67
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,800
found Snowden’s hotel – and him – in
Hong Kong. With the help of two human rights

68
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,348
lawyers, Snowden attempted to leave the hotel
undetected. He managed to change his appearance

69
00:05:53,348 --> 00:05:57,228
and get to a safe house. He was now the world’s
most wanted man.

70
00:05:57,228 --> 00:06:02,689
As of mid-2012, the NSA was processing more
than 20 billion communications events from

71
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:08,079
around the world, every day. This includes
intercepting 1.7 billion communications from

72
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:13,689
Americans. Britain’s GCHQ also collects
large quantities of communications data, upwards

73
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:19,300
of 50 billion events per day, and growing.
The NSA has indicated in one of the documents

74
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,478
that they have inserted malware called ‘Quantum
Insertion’ on over 50,000 computers, allowing

75
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:29,408
them to view every keystroke and each screen
viewed on the affected machines. The New York

76
00:06:29,408 --> 00:06:34,430
Times have claimed the NSA has infected over
100,000 computers. It can manage to infect

77
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,699
the computer even if it is not connected to
the internet.

78
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:41,919
The NSA works closely with the other members
of the Five Eyes group (Australia, Canada,

79
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:48,269
New Zealand and the United Kingdom). They
share most of their surveillance activities.

80
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:54,269
NSA’s closest ally is the British GCHQ.
Over 3 years, the U.S. government has paid

81
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:59,818
£100million to GCHQ as an incentive for them
to support the NSA’s surveillance agenda.

82
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:04,439
As well as warrantless mass surveillance of
whole populations, the NSA has spied on heads

83
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:09,120
of state, including targeting the personal
phone of German chancellor Angela Merkel and

84
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,949
using a program to get the UN secretary general’s
talking points prior to a meeting with President

85
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:17,550
Obama.
Among other devices, NSA intercepts and tampers

86
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:22,060
with routers and servers built by Cisco to
direct internet traffic to the agency’s

87
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,079
repositories.
Since 2007, the NSA have been using a program

88
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:30,818
called X-KEYSCORE which allows you to target
any person for monitoring, providing you know

89
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:35,879
their personal email address. This includes
all content of their emails, and any they’re

90
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,449
cc’d in or mentioned in, in the body of
the text.

91
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:44,000
The NSA can also view any user’s information
on social networks such as Facebook or Twitter,

92
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,610
including messages, chats and private posts.
GCHQ also paid special attention to weaknesses

93
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,930
in Facebook allowing them to view information,
despite users locking down their accounts

94
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,740
using privacy and security settings.
Many ordinary citizens who dismiss the value

95
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,829
of privacy express contradiction by having
passwords on their email or social network

96
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:07,990
accounts, locks on their bathroom doors and
seal the envelopes containing their letters.

97
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,579
Many who say privacy is for people who have
something to hide are not keen to have video

98
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:16,098
cameras in their own homes.
The desire for privacy is shared by all, even

99
00:08:16,098 --> 00:08:21,709
hypocrites disparaging it. Privacy is a core
condition of being a free person.

100
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:25,750
Everyone has something to hide but privacy
is relational so it is dependent on your audience.

101
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,620
You don’t always want to tell your boss
you’re job hunting. You don’t want to

102
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,029
spill about your love life to every family
member.

103
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:36,759
When it comes to whistle-blowing, an old ploy
that often works is to discredit the messenger

104
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:41,538
as a misfit to discredit the message.
Glenn Greenwald was discredited by numerous

105
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:44,689
people, including questions over his occupation
as a journalist.

106
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,670
There are formal and unwritten legal protections
offered to journalists, not available to anyone

107
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:54,309
else. Being labelled an activist could have
criminal consequences.

108
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:58,729
Edward Snowden was also discredited.
For many months Glenn Greenwald received calls

109
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,840
and emails from almost every U.S. TV program,
news personality and famous journalist asking

110
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,790
to talk to Edward Snowden. He refused all
media invitations, wanting to keep the focus

111
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:14,329
on NSA surveillance, not him: strange behaviour
for a so-called narcissist.

112
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:17,850
The Guardian had only a fraction of the full
archive Edward Snowden had passed on in Hong

113
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:23,670
Kong. Despite this, GCHQ officials had travelled
to the Guardian newsroom in London to seize

114
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:28,519
the archive and learn what Edward Snowden
had passed on. Instead the Guardian agreed

115
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:34,000
to destroy all relevant hard drives, with
GCHQ officials overseeing the process. The

116
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,200
Guardian intended for all this to be done
without reporting it. The alternative was

117
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,150
to force out the threat from the government
who were trying to shut down the paper.

118
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:46,629
The one fear Edward Snowden said he had about
coming forward, was that his revelations would

119
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:50,519
not interest anybody and that he would have
risked imprisonment and changing his life

120
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,250
for nothing. The effects from this story have
meant that his fear has not been realised.

121
00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:00,830
He has reminded us all of the effect one ordinary
person in all outward respects can have to

122
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:04,520
change the world. His revelations through
his whistle-blowing have helped promote the

123
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:09,870
human capacity to make decisions and reason.
His single act of conscience has changed the

124
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,549
course of history.
