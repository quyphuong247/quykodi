1
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:20,539
Edward Bernays persuaded women to smoke. He
convinced the public that bacon and eggs were

2
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:26,660
the true all-American breakfast. He also facilitated
the successful overthrow of a democratically

3
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:33,049
elected Guatemalan president. How did one
man achieve these remarkable accomplishments?

4
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:39,828
The methods used to accomplish these astonishing
events are explained in his book, ‘Propaganda’.

5
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:46,489
What is propaganda? Propaganda nowadays is
now seen as a synonym for lies. It implies

6
00:00:46,488 --> 00:00:53,658
half-truths, selective history, bias, misleading
information and other tricks. However, it

7
00:00:53,658 --> 00:00:59,439
can be used in a positive manner. For example:
a campaign to improve public health through

8
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:04,609
vaccination. When used in such a constructive
way, it can be a progressive force, capable

9
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:12,840
of improving and benefiting every life and
every home.

10
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,650
Specific propaganda should be seen as good
or bad depending on the merit of the cause

11
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:22,618
urged and the correctness of the information
published. Modern propaganda is a consistent

12
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:28,060
and continuing effort to create or shape events
to influence public relations on an enterprise,

13
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,219
idea or group.
Edward Bernays worked for the Woodrow Wilson

14
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:38,328
administration in the First World War, using
a propaganda model promoting America’s war

15
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:44,468
efforts as ‘bringing democracy to Europe’.
After swaying the public across the world

16
00:01:44,468 --> 00:01:52,269
with this slogan he set to work on employing
propaganda in peacetime. Due to negative implications

17
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:56,828
surrounding the word propaganda because of
its use by the Germans in the war, he promoted

18
00:01:56,828 --> 00:02:07,178
the term ‘Public Relations’.
A public relations expert is concerned with

19
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:12,229
bringing an idea to the awareness of the public,
using modern media communications and group

20
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:19,379
formations of society. They act as an advisor
to their client. Edward Bernays had an impressive

21
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:25,199
list of these clients, ranging from media
companies such as Time Inc., CBS and NBC through

22
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,018
to individuals such as the President of the
United States.

23
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:35,400
He was not just a propagandist. He was concerned
with courses of action, policies, systems

24
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,099
and opinions, and the securing of public support
for them. His responsibilities even included

25
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:46,759
discovering new markets. The most famous new
market Bernays was asked to uncover was that

26
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:55,649
of women smoking cigarettes in the late 1920s.
Up until then women smoking in public was

27
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,530
seen as a social taboo. Bernays set about
removing this taboo to potentially double

28
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:07,110
tobacco companies possible clientele. First,
he contacted a psychoanalyst to understand

29
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:13,730
the societal perceptions that dissuaded women
from smoking. He found that for feminists,

30
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:18,908
cigarettes were like ‘torches of freedom’
that symbolised their nonconformity and freedom

31
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:25,729
from male oppression. He used this information
to formulate a strategy and got a group of

32
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:33,968
stylish women to march in an Easter Day parade.
Prior to the parade, he had told the press

33
00:03:33,968 --> 00:03:40,400
that a group of women's rights marchers would
light ‘torches of freedom’. On his cue,

34
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,349
the women lit up their cigarettes in front
of the eager photographers. The result was

35
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:49,649
press coverage in several major newspapers
including the New York Times which helped

36
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,400
to break the taboo against women smoking in
public.

37
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,599
The study of mass psychology has brought to
light the fact that a group can have certain

38
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:06,889
mental characteristics distinct from that
of an individual. Learning how the masses

39
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:11,889
are influenced by various factors allows us
to effect change in public opinion with a

40
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:17,669
fair amount of accuracy.
However, propaganda will never be an exact

41
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:22,750
science, in the same way psychology or sociology
isn’t, because they deal with humans.

42
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:29,560
If you can influence leaders, you automatically
influence the groups they rule or have authority

43
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,870
over.
The group mind has impulses, emotions and

44
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,810
habits rather than thoughts as such. It makes
up its mind by impulsively following the example

45
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:45,350
of a trusted leader or authority figure. If
this is not available, the herd ‘thinks’

46
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:52,699
by clichés or images that stand for a group
of experiences or ideas.

47
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:56,560
An old propagandist would treat the human
mind as an individual machine and rely on

48
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,709
certain stimulus often repeated creating a
habit. Similarly they would reiterate an idea

49
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:08,739
to create conviction with individuals. For
example, to advertise bacon and eggs, adverts

50
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,930
would contain phrases along the lines of ‘eat
more eggs’, ‘bacon is good for you’

51
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:20,860
and ‘bacon and eggs are cheap and healthy’.
A new propagandist such as Bernays who understands

52
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:26,979
group psychology would first look at who influences
eating habits. The answer is doctors and physicians.

53
00:05:26,978 --> 00:05:31,649
They would then suggest to these doctors and
physicians to publically state that eating

54
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:36,659
bacon and eggs is good for you. The propagandist
knows that a large number of people will follow

55
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:42,270
the advice of their doctor due to the psychological
relationship between a person and their doctor.

56
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:48,469
A doctor signifies health which in turn signifies
long life.

57
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:52,000
Bernays used these exact methods of leader
influence to convince the public that bacon

58
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,579
and eggs was the true all-American breakfast.
Bernays sold more bacon, not by telling Americans

59
00:05:57,579 --> 00:06:02,189
that bacon is tasty, but by asking doctors
the question: ‘Is it more healthy to eat

60
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:08,199
a hearty breakfast or a skimpy breakfast?’.
His advertisements then said, ‘Nine out

61
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,139
of ten doctors recommend a hearty breakfast
like this one’ with a photo of bacon and

62
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:18,470
eggs.
An old advertiser would try to persuade an

63
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:24,440
individual to buy an item immediately, for
example: ‘Buy this piano – NOW’. Using

64
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:28,348
reiteration and emphasis directed upon the
individual, the advertiser tries to break

65
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:33,459
down sales resistance.
A new advertiser would instead of directly

66
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:38,068
penetrating sales resistance, try to remove
it by creating circumstances that will swing

67
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:43,900
emotional currents that will build purchaser
demand. For example, a new advertiser when

68
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:48,628
selling a piano would try to develop acceptance
of the idea of a music room in the house,

69
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:52,849
perhaps by arranging an exhibition of music
rooms by well-known designers, inviting key

70
00:06:52,848 --> 00:06:59,000
people of influence with regards to buying
habits, i.e. famous musicians. The music room

71
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,269
will be accepted and people with a music room
will naturally think of buying a piano, believing

72
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:08,500
it comes as their own idea. Instead of saying
to the purchaser ‘please buy a piano’,

73
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:14,009
they have caused the purchaser to say ‘please
sell me a piano’.

74
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:19,150
All these methods and techniques were used
for Bernays’ most extreme propaganda campaign:

75
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:23,948
the overthrow of the Guatemalan government.
The government had introduced labour laws

76
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:28,490
that allowed workers to strike if their demand
for higher wages were not met. The United

77
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,930
Fruit Company had been the largest landowner
and employer in Guatemala for several years

78
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,900
and these laws would affect their profits.
Edward Bernays was hired by the United Fruit

79
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:44,250
Company to persuade Americans that the then
Guatemalan president Jacobo Arbenz was a communist,

80
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:50,769
when in reality he was a liberal capitalist.
Bernays ran an intensive campaign of misinformation

81
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:54,889
to portray the company as the victim of the
government for several years including taking

82
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:59,408
American journalists to Guatemala and arranging
for them to interview only those who opposed

83
00:07:59,408 --> 00:08:06,389
Arbenz. Bernays’ involvement led to US President
Eisenhower to intervene and ultimately Arbenz

84
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:11,800
was overthrown in a US-sponsored coup designed
to make the world safe for large U.S. corporations.
