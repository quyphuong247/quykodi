Anything You Want: 40 Lessons for a New Kind
of Entrepreneur by Derek Sivers

2
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,868
Derek Sivers started a hobby that a decade
later turned into a business that he sold

3
00:00:19,868 --> 00:00:25,320
for $22 million. Unusually for an entrepreneur,
when Sivers decided to sell his company in

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,160
2008, he transferred ownership of the company
to a charitable trust which then sold the

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,189
company on his behalf. The money kept in the
trust pays Sivers only 5% of the trust’s

6
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:39,750
value (the lowest figure legally possible),
with the remainder of the money going to charity

7
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,109
for music education upon his death.
This act of generosity is in keeping with

8
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:49,280
Sivers’ philosophy in business and in life.
These philosophies and the lessons he’s

9
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,010
learnt are explained with stories from his
ten years at the helm of his company, CD Baby.

10
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:59,479
Anything You Want is packed full of real-world
experiences of a musician turned entrepreneur,

11
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:04,500
including the successes and mistakes that
all contribute to give a truly honest account

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,078
of life in charge of the largest seller of
independent music on the web, and the thought

13
00:01:09,078 --> 00:01:12,718
process behind some of the key decisions along
the way.

14
00:01:12,718 --> 00:01:17,108
Sivers explains that in order to reach the
end of your life without regret, it is important

15
00:01:17,108 --> 00:01:21,649
to know your own personal philosophy. Everyone
is different and imitating other people will

16
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:26,368
not necessarily make you happy. You need to
pursue your dreams and whatever it is that

17
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:31,030
makes you happy.
Derek Sivers was a 27 year old musician back

18
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:37,950
in 1997, not rich but surviving. Nobody would
sell independent music online so he decided

19
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,189
to set up his own online store to sell his
own CD. Initially the site consisted of not

20
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:47,608
much more than a ‘Buy Now’ button but
when a fellow musician found out, they asked

21
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:52,919
if Sivers could sell their CD on his site
too. Another couple of friends asked the same

22
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,179
and then friends of friends started calling.
Eventually what was initially a favour to

23
00:01:57,179 --> 00:02:03,129
a friend became a small business, all started
by accident. Sivers created a mission statement

24
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:07,668
for his company, now called CD Baby, which
was based on how he would want to be treated

25
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:12,409
if he was selling his music on the site:
1. Paid every week

26
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:19,039
2. Show the names and addresses of people
who bought his music (i.e. his fans)

27
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:25,908
3. No penalty for not selling enough
4. No paid advertising, treating every artist

28
00:02:25,908 --> 00:02:30,620
equally.
The business plan consisted of a $35 setup

29
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,340
fee and a $4 cut of every CD sold regardless
of price. This simple business plan lasted

30
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,239
six years.
As his business increased in size, Sivers

31
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,230
learnt many lessons along the journey. His
success came from constantly inventing and

32
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:49,598
improving, not persisting in repeating things
that don’t work. The lack of funding was

33
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:55,119
treated as an advantage with no money wasted
due to having little of it to begin with.

34
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,650
He believes that ideas are worthless without
adequate execution and built his business

35
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,400
on lots of small clients rather than a few
large ones. This meant that he didn't have

36
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,590
to worry about any one client leaving or please
any one client who makes unreasonable demands.

37
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:13,718
A big plan or vision for the business is not
needed; Sivers says you should stay focused

38
00:03:13,718 --> 00:03:18,848
on helping people today. In providing a good
service to customers, you must care about

39
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:23,848
them more than you care about yourself. When
it comes to satisfaction, it is often the

40
00:03:23,848 --> 00:03:28,048
little details that thrill customers and encourage
them to tell their friends about the company,

41
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:33,530
rather than the large action plans. These
little things make the difference. In CD Baby’s

42
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,530
case, it was a funnily worded confirmation
email that customers received that got them

43
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,530
talking.
As the business grew, Sivers made sure that

44
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,209
his processes within the company could cope
with double the existing workload to be prepared

45
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:52,459
for expansion. This allowed CD Baby to double
in size for the first six years of its existence.

46
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:57,009
As a self-employed person, Sivers made sure
he didn't get stuck doing everything himself

47
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:01,608
and delegated appropriately. He attempted
to make himself not necessary to the successful

48
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:07,459
running of the company. Instead of just answering
colleagues’ questions, he also explained

49
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:10,680
the philosophy and thinking behind his answers
so that they could answer similar questions

50
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,998
in the future themselves. Once all the questions
were answered, Sivers was free to improve

51
00:04:15,998 --> 00:04:21,279
the company rather than just running the company.
Trust in his colleagues was important, as

52
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,709
was the process of verifying the work when
delegating.

53
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:29,199
Eventually, Derek Sivers decided to sell his
company as he realised that he’d prefer

54
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,250
not to have the responsibility of 85 members
of staff and had many new ideas for new projects

55
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:40,000
he wanted to execute. The company was sold
for $22million. He’d had enough and gave

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,199
his company away to charity because he didn't
need or want the money and wanted others to

57
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:49,000
benefit from the lucky streak he’s had in
his life. He lives a simple but comfortable

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,730
life which gives him the freedom and happiness
he wanted. Ultimately, the goal you choose

59
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,000
for your business whether it’s being as
profitable and possible or as large as possible

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,029
or simply working alone and anonymously should
reflect what you want as Sivers believes you

61
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:05,729
should do only what makes you happy.
