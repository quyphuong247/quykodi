1
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:31,939
"Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals
him to himself."

2
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:37,460
Usually when confronted with hardship, a common
tendency among the majority is to contract

3
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,140
and dwell on the negatives.

4
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,200
this is why most of us will miss out on what
these events can teach us about ourselves.

5
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,600
let's Imagine for instance, that you've been
involved in a fight on your way home and got

6
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,509
beatin up badly.

7
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:55,359
most people are likely to feel sorry for themselves
"oh i lost my teeth, i couldn't deffend my

8
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,920
self. poor me, i'm a victim".

9
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,000
this kind of interpretation will teach you
nothing but to torture yourself internally

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,430
everytime something bad happens.

11
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,618
Fact is, your interpretation can be sculpted
and reframed in any way you want and the interpretation

12
00:01:11,618 --> 00:01:13,349
that you'd want to have is :

13
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:17,839
"okey today i couldn't deffend myself. this
is something that i need to learn, maybe i

14
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,960
should take a martial art class so next time
i won't loose my teeth".

15
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,548
The reason why this interpretation is better,
it's because not only it

16
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:30,270
conveyed an acknoledgment of the weakness
that the event revealed in your character

17
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:34,349
but also a commitment to improve upon that
weakness.

18
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:39,428
the first interpretation however, lead to
nothing but heighten and intensify the negative

19
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:43,100
emotions caused by the event.

20
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:47,538
-now let's say your girlfriend dumbed you,
apply the same concept to it.

21
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:48,429
instead of complaining

22
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:53,629
Ask yourself "why did she run away?" to figure
out what weaknessess the event might convey

23
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:54,458
about yourself.

24
00:01:54,459 --> 00:02:00,329
"oh i guess i lost my purpose, i became very
needy and attached in the last couple days"

25
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:04,349
Good. Lastely, express your willingness to
fix your incompetence:

26
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:09,758
"maybe i should figure out how to fix this
neediness therefore prevent the reoccuence

27
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,068
of the same problem with my next partner"

28
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:17,810
I'm aware that the problem might not always
be you in all cases, sometimes it's out of

29
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:18,719
your control.

30
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,370
but concidering that it is
the big idea in this context would be:

31
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,459
these so called unlucky situations you find
your self in, are exposing weaknessess in

32
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:30,150
your character.

33
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,010
every distress that you're confronted with
in your outer-reality, unveils distortions

34
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:40,449
in your inner-world that needs to be delt
with within yourself.

35
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:45,280
With a strong commitment to continually seek
out these weaknessess and proactively strive

36
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:52,789
to improve upon them; you set yourself on
the process of shaping a stronger character.

37
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:58,239
"Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals
him to himself."

38
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,450
I want you to Imagine a guy who's in a constant
negative state.

39
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:08,449
Always whining about his low wage and hoping
for the government to fix his financial problems.

40
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:12,699
Now i want you to imagine that same person
but this time we're going to take his brain

41
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:16,188
out and transplant a millionaire mind in it's
place.

42
00:03:16,188 --> 00:03:20,629
now we have a poor person with a millionaire
mind, what do you suppose he'll be thinking

43
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:21,359
?

44
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,000
i'd say, the guy will reconcider his miserable
situation again, and start thinking reasonable

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,598
thoughts

46
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,078
that puts the blame on himself and no longer
externally.

47
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:36,750
"oh i'm an alchoholic, maybe i should replace
this bad habit so the money wasted on drinking,

48
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,650
can be saved.

49
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,549
"maybe a couple books about business, perhaps
that will help"

50
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:46,319
"also i might want to start a small online
project on my spare time and see where it

51
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:47,250
goes"

52
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,968
Did you see that? Finally he's thinking plausible
thoughts!!

53
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:55,098
Earlier, before we could implement the new
brain, his thoughts were scrambled. He wouldn't

54
00:03:55,098 --> 00:03:56,798
have gotten anywhere with them.

55
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,459
those foolish thoughts wouldn't have allowed
him to think up solutions.

56
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:04,509
He was mostly victimising himself and blaming
others for his situation.

57
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:11,639
"A man cannot directly choose his circumstances,
but he can choose his thoughts, and so indirectly,

58
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:19,439
yet surely, shape his circumstances."

59
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:29,420
"the outer world of circumstance shapes itself
to the inner world of thought"

60
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,020
this is a big one.

61
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:35,529
imagine a guy in university, he finally received
his degree after 5 years.

62
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:41,000
but not only was he a good student, he spent
most of his spare time fixing his weeknessess,

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,500
reading and learning social skills.

64
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,410
now imagine another guy, same thing, he got
his degree and what not.

65
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:53,410
but for the past 5 years, he's never put
the extra effort to develop any social skills

66
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,500
or learn things byhimself.

67
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,160
he merely followed the rules and was never
exposed to stressful situations that could've

68
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,010
strenghthened his character.

69
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:06,339
Now back to the present, both guys went to
a job interview together.

70
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:10,069
the first guy wasn't nervous at all, since
he literally spent half a decade

71
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:12,790
sharpening his vibe and communication skills.

72
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,230
the way he answered questions seemed unreluctant,
natural and charismatic

73
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,140
therefore he got the job offer easily.

74
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:23,279
unlike the confident guy, the second man,
was overwhelmed by anxiety:

75
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,689
"oh why is he looking at me, should i answer
this way or that way" he was nervous as hell

76
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:31,889
and it resulted in him not getting the job
offer.

77
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:36,779
after that, the two man crossed each other
& the anxious guy commented:

78
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:42,509
"oh man you're so lucky, i didn't get the
job . Congrasilations to you"

79
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:48,009
the idea here is that the anxious guy completely
misunderstood the reason for the confident

80
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:49,789
man's success.

81
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:55,189
there is no such thing as "luck" or "chance"
when it comes to shaping circumstances, here's

82
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,540
why:

83
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,689
Both man, as i said, started college naturally
introverted.

84
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:02,310
the only distinction is that the second student

85
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,670
was willing to challenge his limitations aside
from following the rules and over the years,

86
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:13,250
he's gone through a major life transformation.--
thereby every situation he encounters today,

87
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,060
simply reflects what he is on the inside.
his personality.

88
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:22,899
and the contruct of his personality, is the
sum of all the experiences he's gone through

89
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:23,839
up until today.

90
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,289
today's circumstance reflect only his character
and how much he spent hardening it.

91
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:24,460
there is no luck involved.

92
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:28,649
put another way, let's say, the confident
guy didn't fix his weaknessess and remained

93
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:31,779
an anxious person just like the other guy
did.

94
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:35,239
Would you think that after 5 years of remaining
the same

95
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,240
he'll be able to convey a confident character
in the face of harships and attract better

96
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,460
opportunities? Hell no.

97
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:46,979
The core principle here is one of my favourite
big ideas:

98
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:52,129
"the outer world of circumstance shapes itself
to the inner world of thought"

99
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:56,589
in other words:
"Men do not attract that which they want,

100
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:59,079
but that which they are."

101
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:03,409
For instance, you wish to have a meaningful
relationship with a women, but you suffer

102
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,189
sever social anxiety that needs to be deal
with

103
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:10,019
before you could skillfully interact with
the opposite sex.

104
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:14,269
so your current inner state(anxiety) will
hinder you from acquiring what you want at

105
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:15,129
the moment.

106
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:22,409
in essence, your outer world can only reflect
and provide back what's already present within

107
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:22,880
you.

108
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:29,649
and so again "Men do not attract that which
they want, but that which they are."

109
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:35,439
as you commit to banish the weaknessess dwelling
in your heart and strengthen that character

110
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:37,819
of yours throughout your journey

111
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:53,750
you will beautify your circumstances as well.
