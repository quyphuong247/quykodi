00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
welcome to another episode of
productivity game insights I recent read

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,969
the book originals by author Adam grant
Adam starts up the book by explaining

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,799
that there are two routes to achievement
conformity originality conformity means

4
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,310
following the crowd than a conventional
path and maintaining the status quo

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,830
originality is taking the road less
traveled champion a set of novel ideas

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,250
that go against the grain but ultimately
make things better

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,810
it's ok to simply conform but you want
to be a leader if you want to leave this

8
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,190
world better than you found it you need
to find a way to be original but you may

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,669
think I'm not the creative type or I
just don't have the guts to go against

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,540
the grain but adam says after spending
years studying them and interacting with

11
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,829
them originals that is i'm struck that
their inner experiences are not any

12
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,960
different from our own they feel the
same fear the same doubt as the rest of

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,489
us what sets them apart is that they
take action anyway they know in their

14
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:02,10
hearts that failing would yield less
regret and failing to try to chart the

15
00:01:02,10 --> 00:01:06,960
course towards originality you need to
hone your creativity after reading Adams

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,789
book i gather five ways

17
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,490
anyone can use to foster their
creativity first question the default

18
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:21,990
second protect your downside third get
domain experience and then brought forth

19
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:28,798
become an idea machine and lastly
procrastinate on purpose an economist

20
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,229
named Michael hausman looked over data
of 30,000 customer service agents at a

21
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:38,700
call center and he found something
peculiar he found that the customer

22
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,759
agents who used the web browsers firefox
and chrome were much more likely to have

23
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,189
increased job satisfaction have better
customer satisfaction and to stay in

24
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,869
their jobs longer as well as Miss fewer
days of work how is it possible that a

25
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,710
browser selection would be an indication
of increased job performance and

26
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,600
increased job satisfaction

27
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,979
well it turns out of your chrome user or
Europe Firefox user then you're

28
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,609
naturally going away from the default
you see when you get a windows pc when

29
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,649
you get a macbook

30
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:14,840
you're given a browser by default
Windows Explorer for Mac its safari the

31
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,370
simple act of not accepting the default
browser was an indication for how they

32
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,140
approach their work in general

33
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,828
Adams is that the hallmark of
originality is rejecting the default and

34
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:29,450
exploring whether a better option exists
i've spent more than a decade studying

35
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,129
this and it turns out to be far less
difficult than i expected the starting

36
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:39,18
point is curiosity pondering why the
default exists in the first place

37
00:02:39,19 --> 00:02:43,489
adam says that when you remember that
the rules and systems were created by

38
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:48,139
people it becomes clear that they're not
set in stone and you begin to consider

39
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:52,489
how they can be improved the second step
to finding your creative and original

40
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:55,370
self is protecting your downside

41
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,989
now what do you think of when I say the
word entrepreneur will personally when I

42
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:03,680
first encountered entrepreneurs I
thought they were rebellious risk-takers

43
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,549
going against the grain really standing
out it's either they they made it or

44
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:11,720
they busted in fact the word
entrepreneur literally means bearer of

45
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,169
risk so it's not uncommon to think this
way

46
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:19,400
so what do you think the results were of
a 14-year study that compared five

47
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,629
thousand entrepreneurs some of which are
risk-takers and some of which were

48
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:28,970
risk-adverse who is more successful
Indian those who are risk-adverse for

49
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,829
those who put it all on the line

50
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:34,669
well the study showed that the
entrepreneurs who kept their day jobs

51
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:38,690
who protected their downside have
thirty-three percent lower odds of

52
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,870
failure than those who quit their day
jobs some of the most successful

53
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,949
entrepreneurs in history have elected to
play it safe and keep their jobs as they

54
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:47,900
pursue their original ideas

55
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,310
bill gates for example you may think of
him for being famous for dropping out of

56
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:56,389
Harvard to start microsoft but adam says
that when gates old a new software

57
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:00,859
program as a sophomore he waited an
entire year before leaving school even

58
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:05,720
then he didn't drop out but balances
risk portfolio by applying for a leave

59
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,99
of absence that was formally approved by
the University and having his parents

60
00:04:10,99 --> 00:04:16,399
bankroll him google founders had a solid
search algorithm in 1996 but they didn't

61
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:21,19
leave their graduate studies at Stanford
until $MONTH 1998 they said we almost

62
00:04:21,19 --> 00:04:22,230
didn't start google

63
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,400
because we were too worried about
dropping out of our PhD program Henry

64
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,710
Ford state working for Thomas Edison for
two years after making the carburetor an

65
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,799
invention that should have propelled him
to start a business but he remained

66
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,700
cautious

67
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,80
why are these so-called risk takers so
risk-adverse their advantage came from

68
00:04:40,80 --> 00:04:44,580
having psychological insurance giving
them permission to be wild and original

69
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,229
in one part of your life while having a
solid fallback plan in case their ideas

70
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,400
didn't work out

71
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,510
adam says that we should embrace danger
in one area and exercise caution in

72
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,590
another he says if you're about to bed
aggressively in blackjack you might drop

73
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,909
below the speed limit on your way to the
casino i allow myself to be created by

74
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,500
needing less i'm satisfied with just a
laptop some books a roof over my head

75
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,300
and some money for food

76
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,380
sure I may want more but i don't
actually need more and I accumulate more

77
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,10
than enough savings before taking any
career Lee or pursuing a creative

78
00:05:17,10 --> 00:05:20,760
project i don't have to worry about my
financial situation and this sets my

79
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,120
mind free to completely focus on
generating something original

80
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:31,380
next you must gain domain expertise but
then learn to broaden your views the

81
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,520
active being creative is the act of
recognizing patterns and combining

82
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,320
things in a novel way to do so we need
to trust our intuition our pattern

83
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,300
recognizing supercomputer but Nobel
prize-winning psychologist Daniel

84
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,460
Kahneman and decision expert Gary Klein
explain intuitions are only trustworthy

85
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,349
when people build up experience making
judgments in a predictable environment

86
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,600
Adam gives us an example of what happens
when we fail to do so back when the sega

87
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,700
way was coming out steve jobs and jeff
bezos through the most brilliant minds

88
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,380
in the technology field they invested
heavily in the segway the inventor of

89
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:16,620
the segway projected 10,000 sales week
after six years but only sold 30,000 so

90
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,360
how good jobs and visas be so wrong for
an original idea to be a success

91
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,940
it must be both novel and practical jobs
and beezus were so rich and so out of

92
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:31,50
touch with the average consumer would
find practical their intuitions mislead

93
00:06:31,50 --> 00:06:31,590
them

94
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,760
they weren't creators in the
transportation space and therefore they

95
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,710
couldn't accurately predict a creative
idea to be creative in a given field you

96
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,859
must have experience trying to create
something in that field

97
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,820
much like the saying to be in business
you need to be in business only an

98
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,920
interaction with the real landscape can
allow you to see creative solutions and

99
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:58,290
opportunities for innovation but rice
professor eric dane says that the more

100
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:02,130
expertise and experience people gain the
more entrenched they become in a

101
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,240
particular way of viewing the world he
points to studies showing that expert

102
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,580
bridge players struggle more the novices
to adapt when the rules were changed and

103
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,380
that expert accountants were worse than
novices that applying a new tax law as

104
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,280
we gain creative expertise within the
domain we become prisoners of our

105
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,119
prototypes to combat this we need to
broaden our interests

106
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,580
a recent study comparing every Nobel
prize-winning scientist from 1901 2005

107
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,140
and that scientists who are engaged in
the arts are much more likely to win the

108
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:38,340
nobel prize drawing and painting made
you seven times more likely to have a

109
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,390
creative breakthrough to win a Nobel
writing plays or short stories made you

110
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:46,740
12 times more likely to have the
creative breakthrough and performing or

111
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,630
dancing made you 22 times more likely to
have the creative breakthrough to win a

112
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:56,580
Nobel Prize one of the best physicist of
our time Richard Feynman was also a

113
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,560
stand-up comedian a bongo player a
drawer and a safecracker over the last

114
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,190
years I've seen the amount of ideas i
can generate go up dramatically ever

115
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:09,420
since I started cooking playing the
guitar and writing on a regular basis

116
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:16,230
next become an idea machine in the realm
of creativity quantity equals quality

117
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:21,480
Shakespeare over the span of two decades
produce 37 plays a hundred fifty-four

118
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,510
signs mozart composed over 600 pieces
before he was 35 Einstein wrote papers

119
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:33,179
on general and special relativity that
transport physics but he also had 248

120
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,569
publications that have minimal impact

121
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:40,190
adam says that it's widely assumed that
there's a trade-off between quantity and

122
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,690
quality if you want to do better work
you have to do less it but this turns

123
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:50,510
out to be false in fact when it comes to
idea generation quantity is the most

124
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:55,160
predictable path to equality it's best
to think of yourself like a baseball

125
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:02,270
batter as Randy comas are puts it if I'm
hitting 318 yiss so get in the habit of

126
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,660
writing down ideas i take notes on my
phone all day long

127
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,360
whenever I think of something
interesting I just make a note and

128
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,500
continue on my day all average about 20
notes a day at the end of the week

129
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,490
overview those notes and realize most of
them are complete garbage but there's

130
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,000
always at least five gems that I can
explore and develop during the upcoming

131
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,380
week and the last step to systematically
becoming more creative ways to

132
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,60
procrastinate on purpose

133
00:09:26,60 --> 00:09:30,199
Adam tells a fascinating story about
Martin Luther King Martin Luther King

134
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,000
didn't start writing his I have a dream
speech until 10pm the night before as

135
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,410
you approach the stage who is still
scribbling down edits to a speech it

136
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,610
made Adam wonder was the act of
procrastination the reason why King gave

137
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,630
such an original speech Adam and one of
his doctoral students tested this

138
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,650
hypothesis they collected a group of
people they had them learn about a

139
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,490
creative task and then play a game
called minesweeper to procrastinate

140
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,420
before actually doing the task but they
found that those who played the game

141
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,260
those who procrastinate on purpose had a
twenty-eight percent increase in

142
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,800
creativity it turns out that if you are
intrinsically motivated to solve a

143
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,240
problem and you start working on that
problem but then take a break

144
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,780
you are much more likely to have
creativity because of what is called the

145
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:20,390
Garnock effect in 1927 Russian
psychologists blue matzo Garnock

146
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,920
demonstrated that people have a better
memory for incomplete incomplete tasks

147
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,680
once a task is finished we stop thinking
about it but when it is interrupted and

148
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,839
left undone it stays active in our minds
thus allowing you to make more lateral

149
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,560
connections to different information you
encounter throughout the day

150
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,969
adam says that procrastination maybe the
enemy of productivity but it can be a

151
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,720
resource for creativity

152
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,189
if you dare to the original and creative
question the default remember the

153
00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:54,240
correlations who didn't accept the
default browser protect your downside

154
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,649
remember gates and Ford who played it
safe gates got to leave of absence and

155
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:04,110
Ford kept his job get domain experience
then broaden remember Steve Jobs failure

156
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:08,310
of intuition and the increased success
of the Nobel Prize winners who were

157
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:13,739
engaged in other activities become an
idea machine if you're batting 304 doing

158
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,319
great and procrastinate on purpose

159
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:20,490
