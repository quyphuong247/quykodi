Hatching Twitter: A True Story of Money, Power,
Friendship, and Betrayal by Nick Bilton

2
00:00:15,538 --> 00:00:20,839
The social media giant Twitter had humble
beginnings. It was formed by four co-founders:

3
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:27,539
Ev, Noah, Jack and Biz.
Evan Williams was 25 when he moved to California

4
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:33,260
during the tech boom in 1997. He worked for
companies such as Intel and Hewlett-Packard

5
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:37,869
and then moved to San Francisco, where he
started a company with friends, building software

6
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:43,140
to increase productivity in the workplace.
One of the tools Ev built with a colleague

7
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,659
was a web-based diary to keep track of work
progress. When he released it to the world

8
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:52,828
in 1999, he gave it the name “Blogger”
with the aim of allowing anybody to create

9
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:58,808
a web log or blog as its now called.
Blogger’s popularity steadily grew but the

10
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:04,019
start-up Ev was part of split up, leaving
him in charge of Blogger on his own. By 2002,

11
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,679
he was making some money through donations
and adverts. He had also hired some programmers,

12
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,880
moved to a small office and blogger stored
over 1 million people’s blogs. Ev was even

13
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,479
starting to get written about in the tech
press.

14
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:23,109
Ev’s neighbour Noah Glass was reading Fortune
magazine one day and recognised Ev from a

15
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:27,689
picture in a feature that was written about
him. Noah introduced himself and they became

16
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:33,750
close friends. Blogger headquarters had moved
from their office into Ev’s apartment temporarily

17
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,500
and Noah often popped round and helped out.
One day Ev confided in Noah that Google was

18
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:45,739
interested in buying out Blogger and in 2003
the deal went through. Ev had gone from being

19
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:49,780
often broke to receiving tens of millions
of dollars.

20
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,859
Blogger moved to Google’s campus but Ev
didn’t enjoy it and soon sold all of his

21
00:01:53,859 --> 00:02:00,120
Google stock and left the company. He financed
Noah’s audio blogging project, which allowed

22
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,500
voice based blogs recorded from a phone, in
exchange for becoming the CEO of a newly formed

23
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,979
company. It would give Noah’s project a
big name in Silicon Valley associated with

24
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,910
it and Ev a chance to prove he was not a one
hit wonder.

25
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:20,500
Noah and Ev’s new company was called “Odeo”
and developed into an audio-podcasting business.

26
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,139
One day Jack Dorsey, a computer programmer
was working in a coffee shop near to Odeo’s

27
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:31,059
offices and recognised Ev queuing to be served.
Jack emailed his CV and was soon hired to

28
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,330
work as a freelancer for Odeo. He proved to
be an excellent programmer.

29
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,780
The fourth co-founder, Biz Stone was a Google
employee. Biz wanted a job at Blogger and

30
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,340
after some interviews and discussions with
Ev, got a job there after the Google buyout,

31
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,870
despite not having any programming experience.
Ev was his direct boss but they built a strong

32
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:58,270
friendship too. When Ev left Google in 2004,
Biz didn’t enjoy working there without him

33
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:03,920
and left to start work at Odeo in 2005 with
Ev and Noah, sacrificing over $2 million in

34
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:09,869
Google stock options in the process.
All four guys were now at Odeo, but the company

35
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,349
was going nowhere. There were conflicts between
Ev and Noah on nearly everything and not even

36
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:19,150
the people that worked there used its podcasting
service. The nail in the coffin came in June

37
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:25,430
2005 when Steve Jobs announced that Apple
was adding podcasts to iTunes. Ev and Noah

38
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:31,040
spoke about shutting down Odeo but also looked
into reinventing it. Jack had the idea of

39
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,370
a “status” concept based on another blogging
service where people could write small status

40
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,230
messages on their blog to tell people what
they were doing. Jack thought this status

41
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:45,009
update idea could be created as its own standalone
website.

42
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:49,689
Noah thought the idea could connect people
and make them feel less alone. Ev suggested

43
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:54,250
stopping the audio part of Odeo and focusing
on a messaging platform where friends can

44
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,520
follow each other and Jack’s status idea
fit well with this. Biz had a suggestion of

45
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,909
utilising mobile phones to create the statuses
and between them the outline for what was

46
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:07,409
to become twitter (a name picked by Noah),
was born.

47
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:12,818
The four of them soon set about developing
twitter with a small team of colleagues. The

48
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:17,629
site showed statuses in chronological order
with a date stamp so people knew when they

49
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:24,189
were posted. After a couple of weeks’ work
Jack sent the first official Twitter update.

50
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:28,459
Before Twitter became successful, Odeo was
at a point where Ev had to start laying people

51
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:34,529
off. After a few months, Ev asked Noah to
leave the company. Many people in the company

52
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:39,319
were not happy working with him and Jack had
given Ev a “him or me” ultimatum. Noah

53
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:44,180
resigned two weeks later and left Odeo and
Twitter for good, two companies he helped

54
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,959
form.
Twitter was officially launched to the public

55
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:54,349
at the Love Parade – a techno music festival
in San Francisco – in September 2006. They

56
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:59,820
handed out flyers in exchange for free shots
of alcohol but the launch didn’t go as planned.

57
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:03,730
Most of the flyers were lost over the course
of the night and Jack who was leading the

58
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,900
Twitter development, had one too many vodka
and red bulls, fell over and had to go to

59
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:14,089
hospital with a cut on his head. Overall they
got under 100 new signups for Twitter.

60
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:19,310
They improved the service by making it simpler
and more friendly for new users. When a small

61
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,379
earthquake hit San Francisco, for the first
time people tweeted about something bigger

62
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:28,680
than the individual, bigger than themselves.
It was a sign of things to come, when Twitter

63
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,030
would be used as a news network as well as
a social network, highlighting the speed at

64
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:38,539
which information could be posted.
Twitter began to grow at a good pace. They

65
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:44,390
put up some plasma screens at the 2007 South
by Southwest technology conference in Texas,

66
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:48,490
which showed people their live tweets along
with their names and faces as well as information

67
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:54,210
on how to sign up. The conference attendees
loved it, including the investors and it got

68
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:59,509
lots of attention on all the tech blogs on
the web. Signups skyrocketed and Twitter won

69
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:05,039
the prize for best start-up in the blog category.
A few months after the conference, Twitter

70
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,979
passed 100,000 signups.
Jack had made several important decisions

71
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:15,728
in Twitter’s development such as limiting
all tweets to 140 characters or less and Ev

72
00:06:15,728 --> 00:06:21,139
asked him to be the CEO. Ev wanted an active
role himself but was also involved in other

73
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:27,670
projects. Jack accepted the role.
In June 2007, Twitter had grown to almost

74
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:33,949
250,000 active users. Yahoo! wanted to acquire
the company despite no revenue or business

75
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:39,970
model as yet. Yahoo! offered $12 million which
was way below what Ev, Jack and Biz would

76
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:45,639
sell for, so they decided to raise venture
capital to expand and grow.

77
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:50,829
Twitter users introduced the use of two characters
naturally. The @ symbol was used, followed

78
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:56,269
by someone’s username to reference someone
in a tweet. The # symbol was used to create

79
00:06:56,269 --> 00:07:00,289
“hashtags” – a way to organise and group
tweets.

80
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:04,500
Twitter kept growing at such a pace that it
often couldn’t cope. The site was still

81
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,550
built on what was originally a two-week prototype
and high demand was causing site outages.

82
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:16,800
As celebrities joined, they brought more followers
and signups with them, exacerbating the problem.

83
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,020
Some of the celebrities even visited the office
on occasion.

84
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:25,870
More investment money came in, including some
from Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, but the relationship

85
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:31,478
between Jack as CEO and Ev as Chairman was
deteriorating and Biz was often caught in

86
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:36,709
the middle. Many people at Twitter (and some
investors) thought that Jack was not up to

87
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:41,930
the job of CEO due to the site outages and
mounting financial costs with no revenue.

88
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:47,280
Add to this the fact that even in 2008 there
was no backup of the database, meaning all

89
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:54,509
tweets and users could be lost and Jack was
soon fired as CEO, being replaced by Ev.

90
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:58,709
Facebook were interested in buying Twitter
at this point. Roughly a year and a half after

91
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:03,779
the Yahoo! offer of $12 million, Ev and Biz
had a meeting with Mark Zuckerberg where they

92
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:08,829
estimated Twitter was now worth $500 million
but ultimately decided they wanted to remain

93
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:14,758
an independent company.
By February 2009, Twitter had about 30 fulltime

94
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:21,270
employees and active users were increasing
by 900% per year. Even the site outages were

95
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:27,439
being reduced, but zero revenue meant that
monetisation was becoming a top priority.

96
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:32,729
In March, Ev and Biz met with Al Gore to discuss
how his TV network could show tweets in real-time.

97
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:39,000
He also proposed a merger of Twitter and his
TV network. Other celebrities such as Ashton

98
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,438
Kutcher and Sean “Puffy” Combs had also
tried to acquire Twitter. Ev politely declined

99
00:08:44,438 --> 00:08:48,639
all three offers.
In April, Ev appeared on the Oprah Winfrey

100
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,149
show to help Oprah send her first tweet and
gain yet more exposure for Twitter. Jack,

101
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:58,470
who was still technically working for the
company but did not do any development and

102
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:03,899
had no real power, went to Iraq. He travelled
with a delegation of influential tech stars

103
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:09,339
from Google, Twitter, YouTube and others to
speak to people such as the Iraqi President

104
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:12,740
about how to use technology to rebuild the
country.

105
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:17,709
Twitter’s exposure had reached all corners
of the globe. After claims of a rigged presidential

106
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:22,828
election in Iran, supporters of the opposition
candidates voiced their disapproval on twitter

107
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:27,698
and used it to coordinate protests on the
streets across the country. Officials from

108
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:32,438
the White House, 10 Downing Street and the
Kremlin were now monitoring Twitter as well

109
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:37,919
as security agencies such as the CIA and the
FBI to get better information about the potential

110
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:43,649
Iranian revolution. Scheduled maintenance
which would take Twitter offline temporarily

111
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:49,120
was postponed for fear of possibly making
a difference to what happens in the country.

112
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,818
Facebook again offered to buy Twitter but
despite a deal potentially making him a billionaire,

113
00:09:53,818 --> 00:09:59,899
it was not about the money for Ev and he declined
once more. Twitter was still growing and in

114
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:05,839
2009, 35 million tweets were sent per day.
After another round of funding it was valued

115
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,179
at $1 billion, still with less than 100 members
of staff.

116
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:16,990
In December 2009, Twitter made some revenue
for the very first time. It struck a deal

117
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:23,188
to display tweets on search engines. It received
$15 million from Google and $10 million from

118
00:10:23,188 --> 00:10:28,938
Microsoft. They also began experimenting with
advertising as a form of income.

119
00:10:28,938 --> 00:10:33,670
By this point with Twitter’s enormous growth,
what were small problems as a start-up had

120
00:10:33,671 --> 00:10:38,519
developed into large problems. Ev was focused
on completely redesigning Twitter and was

121
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:44,659
neglecting some of his responsibilities as
CEO. He was also very slow at making decisions,

122
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:52,528
frustrating colleagues. The board voted to
remove Ev as CEO. On 4th October 2010, Ev

123
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:57,458
announced to the company that he was stepping
down as CEO and taking a role as head of product.

124
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:01,518
He got straight to work on new features for
Twitter, but they were largely ignored by

125
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,159
the board, as was he. He soon realised he
had effectively been fired without being escorted

126
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:13,318
from the office.
In March 2011, Twitter had 450 employees and

127
00:11:13,318 --> 00:11:18,208
they welcomed a returning colleague. Jack
had re-joined the company as the Executive

128
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:23,539
Chairman. At near enough the same time, Ev
emailed colleagues to tell them he was leaving

129
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:30,019
his day-to-day role at Twitter. Biz followed
him out the door shortly after in June.

130
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:35,899
Twitter carried on increasing in size and
significance. In 2012 they had 600 employees

131
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:41,499
and a $10 billion valuation. It was making
$1 million a day in advertising income from

132
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:46,860
sponsored tweets. Jack interviewed President
Obama from the White House and it was streamed

133
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:53,300
live on the web and Twitter. In 2015, Jack
took over to once again become CEO of the

134
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:57,698
company.
Three of the four original founders have left

135
00:11:57,698 --> 00:12:02,618
the company, working on other projects and
chasing other aspirations, but the popularity

136
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:08,160
of the Twitter they helped build lives on.
Prominent figures ranging from Arnold Schwarzenegger

137
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:13,659
to the Pope regularly use the service, even
astronauts in the International Space Station

138
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:18,879
use this important communication tool to speak
with millions of people back on planet Earth.
