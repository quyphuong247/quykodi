Hey guys , today i'll be sharing with you

2
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,399
some lessons i've learned through my
porn recovery journey and hopefully

3
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:29,119
get some value out of it . let's start by understanding this bad habit

4
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,679
charles duhigg explains that a habit consists of
three main components:

5
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:41,759
1)Trigger 2)Routine and finally the reward. for porn users the triggers are pretty obvious

6
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,960
it's a time of the day , someday in the weekend
or when you're experiencing a general

7
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,520
feeling of boredom and stress .
The routine is the habit itself you see

8
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,200
the trigger and BAM! your brain goes on
autopilot anticipating a reward which is

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,560
orgasm .. now this is the cycle that you
want to break free from right ? Charles says that

10
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,240
To change a habit you have to Keep the routine and the triggers the same

11
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:12,479
Only change the routine .. Now this is possible for
most habits but for porn users

12
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,079
it's not that practical , if I were to change the
routine to reading books for example

13
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,640
am not going to get orgasm out of that (laughs) .

14
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,239
i was tracking down several triggers to
find out where do these urges actually come from

15
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,890
I discovered that the problem
was not only the habit itself

16
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:34,750
The problem is in the habits that are
interwoven with it .. like to call these

17
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:40,750
'Micro Habits' these micro habits are executed
unconsciously and triggered

18
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:45,519
Because Of a lack in basic human needs like
socializing or more importantly

19
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,060
A lack of feminine energy in your life

20
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,379
here's an example for 'micro habits' : so
i'd be surfing the internet calmly

21
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:58,560
Then i began to feel lonely and bored(trigger).. i go on
Facebook (routine) i get my (reward)

22
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,939
wich is : a relief from stress . this is a micro habit .

23
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,118
the question is : how does this relate to
porn ? well your intention was to go

24
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:12,239
chat for a little bit right ? but let's be
honest here(laughs) as a former Porn user myself

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,920
when they i a hot model's
picture on facebook my craving brain

26
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:18,949
will make me react automatically by clicking on it .

27
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:22,669
of course you can still argue that this
doesn't count as Porn !

28
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:27,069
But what you're not aware of.. is that your brain is
producing little shots of dopamine

29
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:32,069
Here and there from these micro habits and
that's how you get cravings for porn .

30
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:36,629
i describe 'micro habits' as : passive comsumption you're not actually exposed

31
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:41,039
to porn directly but you're getting
little shots of dopamine from these bikini

32
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,310
thumbnails on youtube  , or even a simple
kissing scene in your favorite movie .

33
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,400
here's what happens from there :
visualization kicks in .

34
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,700
you start fantasizing .. this is why you go
on Facebook and ten minutes later you find

35
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:00,560
yourself on a porn site . now I want to
point out that I am NOT against using

36
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,879
any social media platform ! you're free to
do whatever you want , I'm just sharing

37
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,079
out my personal experience here . we
arrived at the interesting part now

38
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,240
The solution . the solution is pretty simple if we cannot change the macro habit

39
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,959
we'll try to replace the micro habits .

40
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,420
this is not a quick fix or a magic pill but rather things i've tried personally

41
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:25,268
So here's what I did it : i took
the routine for every single micro habits

42
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:29,920
and replaced it , with flow state
activities , why ? because the only thing

43
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,439
that could produce huge amounts of
dopamine like orgasm

44
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,919
is a flow state so I replaced the
old routines with flow state activities

45
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:44,399
And with time , i got addicted on flow
rather than watching junk porn on my computer

46
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,080
By doing what i did you will
not only reduce your exposure to porn

47
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,719
you're going to be building a lot of
will Power :)
