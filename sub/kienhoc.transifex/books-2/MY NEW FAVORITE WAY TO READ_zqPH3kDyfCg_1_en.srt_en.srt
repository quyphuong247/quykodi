1
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:14,708
I'm pretty sure I've tried
every way there is to read by now,

2
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:17,960
but here's something that I've found
to be the most effective if you're going

3
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,589
for maximum productivity and effeciency.
Basically what I do is

4
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:28,618
I listen to the audiobook at twice the speed
while I look at the book and follow along.

5
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:31,809
And there are so many great things about that...
First of all,

6
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:34,979
it combines two senses,
seeing and hearing,

7
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:40,349
so you end up with really good comprehension
while being really effecient at the same time.

8
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,698
It's kind of like these videos...
Imagine if you were only hearing or seeing...

9
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:49,408
It just wouldn't be as effective,
so combining the two senses does magic for

10
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,158
comprehension.

11
00:00:51,158 --> 00:00:53,658
Another possibly even more important benefit
is that

12
00:00:53,658 --> 00:00:57,039
it keeps you in a straight line and keeps
you going.

13
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,469
So you're not going back and rereading things,
you're not taking all kinds of unnecessary

14
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,798
breaks and pauses,
your eyes aren't running around all the time,

15
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,830
and you're not getting distracted every two
minutes.

16
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:11,618
So again,
I'm pretty sure I've tried everything at this

17
00:01:11,618 --> 00:01:14,170
point,
and this is absolutely one of the best

18
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,310
and the most effective and effecient ways
to read.

19
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,250
You can take a book like The Richest Man in
Babylon

20
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,459
and finish it in literally only 2 hours.
You can take a book like

21
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:28,879
How to Win Friends and Influence People
and finish it in about 3.5 hours.

22
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:34,310
You can basically finish most books in 5 hours
unless you're reading Ayn Rand,

23
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,010
in which case, let's be honest,
you're screwed no matter what you do.

24
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,700
So let me just address one other thing...
Every time I talk about effeciency with reading,

25
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,340
someone always points out that you shouldn't
be rushing,

26
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,030
you should just enjoy the book.
And I actually sympathize with that because

27
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,549
I know what it feels like to just relax and
read,

28
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:54,890
and I absolutely love that feeling.
But at the same time,

29
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,310
I don't just read for pleasure.
Most of the time,

30
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,340
I read with the sole purpose of improving
my life,

31
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,340
and the more I read the better my life gets,
so there's absolutely a sense of urgency for

32
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,020
me.

33
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:09,228
Anyway... I really hope you try this out and
find it useful.

34
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,220
It has definitely been one of the best things
I've introduced into my life lately.

35
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:17,919
I don't have some crazy attention span,
so I get tired and distracted after a while

36
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,309
but this keeps me going and keeps me focused.
I think I've read one book a day

37
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,340
for seven days in a row now,
which is something that I definitely

38
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,479
wouldn't be able to do
if I wasn't using this method.
