1
00:00:03,178 --> 00:00:09,740
There are really three financial paths...
The sidewalk, the slowlane, and the fastlane.

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,419
The sidewalker is basically your average person
living from paycheck to paycheck.

3
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:18,429
No matter how much he earns, he'll match it
with how much he spends.

4
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:23,100
Sidewalkers can actually have a huge income.
Let's say someone like a professional athlete.

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,240
The problem with being a sidewalker however,
is having no financial intelligence or responsibility

6
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,149
whatsoever.
So if something goes wrong, if you lose your

7
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:36,000
job, if you aren't needed anymore, you're
basically screwed.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,350
This is why you'll see even professional athletes
who made millions at one point be completely

9
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,309
broke now.
Don't take the sidewalk.

10
00:00:43,308 --> 00:00:47,129
Then you have the slowlane.
This is basically your standard: go to school,

11
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,190
get a decent job, save 10%, invest it in the
stock market,

12
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:57,378
hope it grows at 7% interest annually. And...
When you're 65 (that is if you aren't dead

13
00:00:57,378 --> 00:01:01,699
and can still walk), you can be a millionaire.
Yay!

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,539
So why does the slowlane suck? Well, because
I don't want to drive around in my favorite

15
00:01:05,539 --> 00:01:09,400
car when I'm 65,
I want to do it while I'm still young.

16
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,659
It's also like selling your soul for 40 years,
so that when you're in a wheelchair,

17
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:18,190
you can finally start having fun.
Not that different from what people do on

18
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:22,239
a weekly basis actually...
Sell Monday through Friday, for two days at

19
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,899
the end of the week, and do that over and
over again.

20
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,790
With that said, I actually think that sadly,
this is the best strategy for most people.

21
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:35,229
Why? Because most people aren't capable of
meeting the demands of the fastlane.

22
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:39,408
And the slowlane is definitely better than
the sidewalk. More on this later.

23
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:44,118
Now let's talk about the fastlane.
The whole idea of the fastlane is this: the

24
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:48,569
more value you give to the world, the richer
you will become.

25
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:52,379
And I absolutely hated hearing those kinds
of quotes and things when I was young.

26
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:57,859
It sounds so esoteric. How do I get rich if
I give? It makes no sense.

27
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:01,739
The reason it made no sense was because of
how the principle was explained to me.

28
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:06,149
I thought, "Okay, let's say I go outside right
now and hand my money out, how will that make

29
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,209
me rich?"
And it won't. I was right. But, had it been

30
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,669
explained to me right, I wouldn't be so confused.
So if you went outside right now with a $1000

31
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:18,849
and gave 10 people a $100 each,
that would actually be one of the lowest forms

32
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:23,039
of giving possible.
The person will take that $100, engage in

33
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,150
mindless consumerism,
and basically end up in exactly the same situation

34
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,669
as when he started.

35
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:32,519
What would be a higher form of giving? Well,
if you went into your kitchen right now,

36
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,709
and created a pill that could cure cancer,
that would be one of the biggest things you

37
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:39,840
could give to the world.
That would be a higher form of giving.

38
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,549
And yes, you would be absolutely rich, well...
Assuming you weren't completely naive and

39
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:48,900
knew how to protect your invention.
The general rule is this: the more value you

40
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,569
provide to more people, the better you will
do.

41
00:02:52,568 --> 00:02:57,119
Sounds great right? So why do I say that the
slowlane is actually a good strategy for most

42
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,259
people?
Well, because realistically speaking, most

43
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:04,269
people have not developed themselves
where they can give something of true value

44
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:05,579
to the world.

45
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:11,019
The biggest criticism this book gets is, "Well,
but MJ, you're misleading people.

46
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:16,650
Most people can't create a successful product.
Most people can't create a successful business."

47
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,430
And every time I read something like that
I get nauseous. No! No! Like, NO!

48
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,150
Stop blaming MJ. Stop blaming the book. Stop
blaming anyone else!

49
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:31,248
If you aren't capable of giving tremendous
value to other people, that is your fault!

50
00:03:31,248 --> 00:03:35,709
Take some goddamn responsibility! If you want
to be in the fastlane, stop watching Netflix

51
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:37,248
and go the library.

52
00:03:37,248 --> 00:03:41,388
Speaking of Netflix and the library, that
was my life for four years in college.

53
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:45,219
Classes would end and I would head to the
library, pick up a book that I was going to

54
00:03:45,218 --> 00:03:47,789
read that night,
come back to my room, and my roommate would

55
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:51,418
watch Netflix for the next 8 hours while I
read.

56
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:55,588
What did that do? Well, that put me in a position
where I have given value to over 10,000 people

57
00:03:55,588 --> 00:03:59,180
in a few months.
What if my roommate decided he wanted to start

58
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,760
a YouTube channel?
What would he start it on? He has nothing

59
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,948
to give.
That's not MJ's fault. That's not the book's

60
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:06,889
fault. That's my roommate's fault.

61
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:11,180
So why would I personally never pick the slowlane?
First of all, I would have to sell my life

62
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,998
in the form of time, the most valuable commodity
I have.

63
00:04:14,998 --> 00:04:21,719
And, I know I can give value to the world,
and a 7% return is just ridiculously small.

64
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,560
On my investment into FightMediocrity this
year, I'm going to get a 10,000% return.

65
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,560
Yes, not 7%, 10,000%. And that's being conservative
and assuming I don't put out a product.

66
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:36,949
That's another huge benefit of producing instead
of consuming.

67
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:40,020
There is no limit to how much you can grow
your business.

68
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:44,508
You can easily double your business in months,
but can you easily double your salary in months?

69
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:47,009
Haha...
Yeah, go into your boss' office and say,

70
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:54,009
"Hey, I would like to go from $20/hr to $40/hr
in the next 3 months," and see how that goes.

71
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:59,060
Sadly, with all this said, the best option
for most people is still the slowlane.

72
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,699
But, being in the fastlane isn't impossible.
Even if you aren't really in the position

73
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:07,478
to give anything to the world right now.
As long as you're developing yourself the

74
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:11,418
right way, you can be.
The more people you help, and the bigger the

75
00:05:11,418 --> 00:05:14,878
magnitude of your help, the richer you will
be.

76
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,030
This is why Bill Gates is rich and the cashier
at your store isn't.

77
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:25,059
It's very simple, Gates has provided bigger
value to more people than the cashier has.

78
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,139
But again, remember, if you want to be in
the fastlane, if you want to be able to give

79
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:31,769
to the world,
you're going to have to spend a little more

80
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:34,399
time in the library and a little less time
in front of the TV.
