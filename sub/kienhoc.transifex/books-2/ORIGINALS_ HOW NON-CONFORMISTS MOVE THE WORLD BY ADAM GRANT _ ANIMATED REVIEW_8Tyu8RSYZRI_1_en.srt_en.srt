1
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,650
at the peak of a great mounatin, there lived
a humble viking named agarth.

2
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:35,579
his village was very wellknown for his remarkable
sword makers and agarth was one of them.

3
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,859
in yet another cold day, agarth decided to
be different and to impress the yarl of the

4
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:44,089
village by making a new kind of swords.

5
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,690
golden swords he said was to be his unique
idea.

6
00:00:46,689 --> 00:00:50,789
so instead of the conventional way of going
about it, agarth used

7
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,789
golden material instead of steal

8
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:56,140
after three days of non-stop work, his original
idea

9
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,000
saw the light of day.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,558
he forged his first golden sword and rushed
sprinting to

11
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,420
the yarl of his village as he thought it would
take his breath away of awe.

12
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,269
"yarl dough, take a look at this golden sword,
nobody had thought about this before

13
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:18,069
if our viking warriors were to use it, the
saxons will have no chance of fighting against

14
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:19,029
us".

15
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,060
the yarl took the sword
tested it's balance then said : "this is a

16
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:28,200
very well made sword but i think it's
too heavy to be yielded by our warriors".

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,530
"no one would want to buy a
golden sword if it of no use agarth".

18
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:37,820
agarth, with a disapointed look on his face,
took his sword and went back to his forge.

19
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:42,298
his idea was different and creative but he
didn't concider it's weaknessess'.

20
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,820
this is called the confirmation bias :

21
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:49,078
when we come up with something unique, we
overexagerate expecting that it is going to

22
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:51,429
shake the market and get success.

23
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:56,229
and the big idea here, when you came up with
sth original, it doesn't mean that it's going

24
00:01:56,228 --> 00:02:01,658
to be successful just because it seems unique
to you, concider the market's needs first

25
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:03,789
and your audience's prefrence.

26
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:08,409
-be your own judge , study where you fall
short and course correct from there before

27
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:11,079
you put out anything in public .

28
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,870
agarth could've thought about mixing the gold
with other materials like steel to make the

29
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,620
sword
lighter but he was so blinded by his overconfidence

30
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,120
to notice the inadequacy of his idea .

31
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,939
risking everything he had , agarth emptied
all his resources to buy the necessary equipment

32
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,539
to forge that golden sword.

33
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:33,219
now he's left poor with nothing to eat.

34
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:39,460
"succesful originals take extreme risks in
one arena and offset them with extreme caution

35
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,860
in another"

36
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,510
when you're about to engage in business venture,
ensure a stable source of income first.

37
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:50,629
don't go on full risk mode like agarth, selling
all his stock of steal hoping to get

38
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,620
more back with his uniqueness .

39
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,170
put your original idea out there.

40
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:56,379
wait for it to blosom.

41
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:00,719
if it didn't work, no problem, you have your
job anyway.

42
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,389
bill gates, who's known as one of the world's
great risk takers.

43
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:08,539
didn't dropped out of harvard even when he
started microsoft.

44
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:14,009
he didn't quit university although he knew
that his microsoft idea was going to be a

45
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:15,340
big hit .

46
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:25,480
"creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes,
art is knowing wich ones to keep"

47
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:31,590
agarth, stranded without a home, unable to
cope with the cold of the mountains, had nothing

48
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,979
left but to quit life and throw himself in
the great lake .

49
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:37,590
as he was looking at the fish.

50
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,780
he felt sth strange, an idea came up to him.

51
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,620
he remembered, that most of the vikings were
likely to catch seasickness while traveling

52
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,759
on a boat for long periods of time.

53
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,229
his idea was to create a potion that will
cure the viking's illness.

54
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:57,099
so he began experimenting, mixing fish and
fish eggs with other stuff

55
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:59,139
and trying out the potions himself .

56
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:03,069
after a few weeks, he visited the yarls house
again, and presented him

57
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:04,489
to his potion.

58
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,969
luckily, there were vikings that day who were
about to go fishing.

59
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:10,699
and who suffered from severe sea sickness.

60
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:15,569
the yarl trusted the fishermen to try the
potion while on board and see if it works.

61
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:20,849
this time, it was a success, the potion was
of great help, people came from around

62
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:26,870
the world to buy agarth's potion, this time
his originality served him well.

63
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:32,620
and the idea here, is to never put all of
your trust in one single original idea.

64
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:38,370
if you want to be sucesful with your originality,
triple the quantity of ideas you generate.

65
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:43,250
when you put out many original ideas, you
will have higher chances of succeeding.

66
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,430
whereas, if you bet on a single one, you limit
your chances of success.

67
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,530
and this completely reverses the notion of
quality versus quantity.

68
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:57,559
in terms of generating originals ideas. quantity
equals quality.

69
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,620
if you go on amazon and take a look at a best
selling author's profile

70
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,930
you will notice that he had to write many
average books to be able

71
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,900
to produce a best seller.he had to publish
many failures , and one of these failures

72
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:12,339
turned out as a masterpiece.

73
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:16,060
so
"creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes,

74
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,769
art is knowing wich ones to keep"

75
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:27,769
"strategic procrastination"

76
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:35,189
1503 leonardo da vinci, began working on his
masterpiece the mona lisa.

77
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:40,939
the thing that was intriguing for most historians,
is that he was working on and off on that

78
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:47,129
painting, he didn't finish the monalisa until
close to his death in 1519 .

79
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:51,969
no one would of thought that leonardo was
procrastinatin with other tasks.

80
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,570
he said : genius's sometimes accomplish most
when they work the least, for they are

81
00:05:56,569 --> 00:06:01,709
thinking out inventions and forming in their
minds the perfect idea"

82
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:05,769
what he meant was basicly : it's not about
going full procrastination mode.

83
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:12,000
you have to procrastinate strategicly to benefit
from what psychologits call, the zeigarnik

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,680
effect.

85
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,100
russian psychologist bluma zeigarnik demonstrated
that: once a task is finished, we stop thinking

86
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,810
about it.

87
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,199
but when it is interrupted and left undone,
it stays active in the back of our minds(the

88
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:27,029
subconscious) while we engage in other activities.

89
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:31,719
and ideas are more liable to manifest the
moment we resume our work.

90
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,570
so again this isn't about mediocre procrastination,
it's about

91
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:37,409
strategic procrastination

92
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,900
do not procrastinate before working.

93
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,418
otherwise you won't get that same effect.

94
00:06:41,418 --> 00:06:46,109
the task has to be registered in your memory
before you take a pause.

95
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:52,550
that way; when you disengage from work.
you will benefit from the zeigarnik effect.
