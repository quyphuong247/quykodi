00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,429
Sir Richard Branson has strived for success
as a businessman and in his life in general.

2
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:23,309
In this book he shares nine tips on how to
achieve your goals and become as successful

3
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:27,710
as possible in life.
1. Just Do It!

4
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:32,579
Branson’s nickname from his staff is “Dr
Yes”, because he can’t say no. If you

5
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,340
want to do something, he believes you should
just do it, even if people say it can’t

6
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,910
be done.
When he was 15 years old and still at school,

7
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:45,479
Branson started a magazine called “Student”
despite people saying he couldn’t do it.

8
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:51,000
He wasn’t good at school and left at age
16 to work on it full time. Branson worked

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,558
hard and wrote hundreds of letters to sell
advertising space and get interviews. The

10
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:59,549
hard work paid off and the magazine was a
success with interviews from Mick Jagger and

11
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:03,718
John Lennon.
He branched out into selling records by mail

12
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,710
order. Then he hired some spare space in a
shoe shop and made it a trendy place for students

13
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:13,899
to hang out and buy his records. One store
led to a second and third and eventually there

14
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:19,450
was one in every big town in England... and
he wasn’t even 20 years old.

15
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,310
Branson always wanted to live life to the
full and attempted record attempts in speedboats

16
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,590
and hot air balloons. “Screw it, let’s
do it” is literally what he said as he can’t

17
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,000
resist a challenge. He was first to cross
the Atlantic in his balloon with his colleague

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,280
– a world record.
2. Have Fun

19
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,810
Branson says his keys to success have been
hard work and full belief in himself, but

20
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,019
he also tries to have fun.
In 1976, Branson was working hard on Virgin

21
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:52,618
Music. They had just signed the Sex Pistols
and another of their artists was just used

22
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:58,769
on the Exorcist soundtrack. By 1977 he needed
a break. He heard that if you’re looking

23
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:03,989
to buy a house on the British Virgin Islands
you get a grand tour free of charge. Branson

24
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:07,629
spoke to an estate agent and off he went with
his girlfriend.

25
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:12,139
He had no intention of buying a house there
but later in life he bought one of the entire

26
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:16,798
islands, Necker Island.
On the way home their flight was cancelled

27
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:21,900
so Branson chartered a plane for £2000, divided
that by the number of people stranded and

28
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:28,370
wrote on a borrowed blackboard: VIRGIN AIRWAYS
£39 SINGLE FLIGHT TO PUERTO RICO. Thus the

29
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,789
idea of Virgin Airways was formed whilst on
holiday having fun. To Richard Branson, when

30
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:37,729
something stops being fun, it’s time to
move on.

31
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:42,590
3. Be Bold
Branson believes in being bold but not gambling.

32
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,870
As a child Branson knew the pilot and war
hero Douglas Bader who lost both legs in a

33
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,759
flying accident but learned to walk and fly
again. You should try and avoid risks but

34
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:57,649
protecting yourself 100% of the time is impossible.
You have to chase your goals and follow your

35
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,688
dreams Branson says.
One occasion where he was bold was deciding

36
00:03:02,688 --> 00:03:06,739
to start an airline as it would cost a large
amount of money. Despite no one thinking it

37
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:11,998
would last more than a year when it launched
in 1984, Virgin Atlantic has been a roaring

38
00:03:11,998 --> 00:03:16,418
success. He took a risk but the odds were
good as instead of offering a cheaper service

39
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:20,959
than the other, larger airlines that could
undercut them, Branson offered a better service,

40
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,378
which they couldn’t match.
The next big move for Branson was Virgin Trains

41
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:31,058
in 1996, getting the idea while on the bullet
train in Japan. The newspapers said it was

42
00:03:31,058 --> 00:03:35,489
a bold move but again it was a success and
they created the world’s most advanced leaning

43
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:40,620
train.
4. Challenge Yourself

44
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,489
Something to aim for is needed by everyone.
The challenge to reach that aim makes you

45
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:50,468
grow. Branson has two main challenges in life:
To do the best he can at work

46
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:55,789
To seek adventure.
Branson challenged himself from a young age.

47
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:59,888
From learning to swim by jumping in a river
to overcoming dyslexia at school and winning

48
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:05,028
an essay contest. Later in life his challenge
was to fly over the Atlantic and then the

49
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:10,799
Pacific Ocean in a balloon.
5. Stand on Your Own Feet

50
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,079
Branson’s parents taught him from a young
age to think for himself and get things done.

51
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,840
Once he was woken up by his mother and sent
on a 50 mile bike ride to visit a relative

52
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,299
with only a packed lunch and an apple. He
and his siblings were constantly found useful

53
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,590
tasks to do. He tried to bring his children
up the same way.

54
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:34,719
6. Live the Moment
In 1999, Branson bought a game reserve in

55
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,289
South Africa and built a house there where
he spends time with his family. He limits

56
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:44,180
himself to only 15 minutes of business a day
while he’s there. He manages this by making

57
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,840
every second count, in both his business and
personal life.

58
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:53,938
As his company is worldwide, he finds he needs
to be awake a lot of the time. One vital skill

59
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:58,879
he’s learnt is to nap, catching a couple
of hours sleep at a time. This is also something

60
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,599
Winston Churchill was good at and is a good
way to “switch off”.

61
00:05:03,598 --> 00:05:09,598
7. Value Family and Friends
Branson is part of a very close knit family

62
00:05:09,598 --> 00:05:14,399
and treats his staff at Virgin like family
too. He’s a strong believer in teamwork,

63
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,859
with it being instilled in him from a young
age. His family have helped him and have always

64
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,479
been there for him, something really important
when he was first starting out in business.

65
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:28,810
His auntie gave him a £7,500 loan to buy
an old manor house so he could build a recording

66
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,509
studio there. What he didn’t know at the
time was that she didn’t have the money

67
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:37,830
to spare but took out a mortgage on her house
because she had such faith in him.

68
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:43,000
8. Have Respect
It is important to treat everyone well, not

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,339
just those you want to impress. You never
know who might hear or see you and people

70
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:53,359
talk and gossip. Your reputation is everything.
Branson’s advice for anyone starting out

71
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,819
in business is to “be fair in all your dealings.
Don’t cheat – but aim to win”. If you

72
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:03,330
can’t sleep at night because of it, don’t
do it.

73
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:07,448
9. Do Some Good
Branson was brought up to think anyone could

74
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:11,900
change the world. When he started his own
magazine, he wanted to use it as a platform

75
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:17,899
to change things. He then spent years building
up Virgin and earning money along the way.

76
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:23,158
Money is not necessarily the root of all evil,
it can be used for good. Rich men and women

77
00:06:23,158 --> 00:06:27,490
have started some of the biggest charities
in the world. For example, Ray Kroc created

78
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,538
McDonald’s and his company give over $50million
a year to charity.

79
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:36,038
Branson himself has helped in the past by
sending a jumbo jet to Jordan when the Iraq

80
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:41,468
War was taking place to help the refugees
there. The plane contained medical supplies,

81
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:48,998
tons of rice and 40,000 blankets.
In 2004, Branson set up Virgin Unite which

82
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:54,020
provides a way for Virgin staff to work together
to solve tough social problems around the

83
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:58,359
world. As a businessperson you can do a great
deal of good if you use your power wisely

84
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,949
Branson says.
These have been Sir Richard Branson’s lessons

85
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:07,900
in life, his goals and the things he believes
in. Each one of these lessons can be applied

86
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:08,709
to all of us.
