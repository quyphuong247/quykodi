00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,170
hello and welcome to another episode of
productivity game insights i recently

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,360
read the book essentialism by Greg
McEwen Greg starts up the book by

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,889
telling us a personal story his story is
intended to warn us of the dangers of

4
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:19,350
not adopting an essentialist mindset one
day after his baby daughter was born and

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,130
his wife was laying in the hospital he
was pressured to attend the client

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,330
meeting

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,38
he says instinctively I knew what to do
it was clearly a time to be there for my

8
00:00:29,39 --> 00:00:34,170
wife and my newborn child so when asked
whether i plan to attend the meeting i

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,420
said with all the conviction I could
muster

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,850
yes he left his wife in the hospital and
attended the meeting his colleague

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,930
assured him that he was doing the right
thing but when he got to the meeting the

12
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,519
clients looked at him perplexed as if to
say what the heck are you doing here

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,550
greg says that he said yes simply to
please and in doing so he hurt his

14
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,449
family his integrity and even his client
relationship

15
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:03,629
nothing came out of that meeting it was
a fool's bargain

16
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:08,399
this is a fool's bargain that many of us
fall trap to saying yes to everything

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,700
it's a tactic that led to our success at
one point but now it's leading to

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,290
failure overstating the point in order
to make it the pursuit of success can be

19
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,150
a catalyst for failure success can
distract us from focusing on the

20
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,680
essential things that produce success in
the first place as work piles up the

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,720
responsibilities build the demand start
to increase were busy but we're not

22
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,740
productive

23
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,740
most of us don't realize we're falling
into this trap until it's much too late

24
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,939
until we've completely burned out and
have no choice but to stop but engaging

25
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,39
this behavior isn't very uncommon we
simply lose sight of our ability to

26
00:01:47,40 --> 00:01:51,780
choose to realize that we have the power
to choose great relays a study in his

27
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,340
book to explain learned helplessness
which is essentially being conditioned

28
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,350
in a negative way which causes us to
lose sight of our ability to choose the

29
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,548
study involved three dogs who are all
connected to harness the first dog was

30
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:10,170
shocked but a lever was placed in front
of them and he could press it stopped

31
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,299
the shock a second dog was also being
shocked

32
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,720
but this time the lever didn't work
every time he pressed it

33
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,20
nothing happened and a third dog was not
shocked at all

34
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,600
all three dogs were put into a box on
one side of the Box there's a pad that

35
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,859
was administering intermittent shocks on
the other side there's a pad that didn't

36
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,120
shock them with the dogs were all placed
on the side that administered

37
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,620
intermittent shocks only the first and a
third dog became aware enough to move

38
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:44,620
over to the side that had no shocks the
second dog just stood there helpless he

39
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,850
must have figured what's the point I
don't really have a choice anyway we

40
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,720
first need to realize that we aren't
helpless that we have a choice to

41
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,730
realize that we have a choice

42
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:59,170
we need to recognize the trade-off
inherent to every situation we quickly

43
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,640
get into the trap of making default
decisions and sadly those default

44
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,589
decisions are typically short-term
comfort for long-term dissatisfaction

45
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:13,60
Greg says that we say yes just because
it's an easy reward but we run the risk

46
00:03:13,60 --> 00:03:18,400
of having to later say no to a more
meaningful one we can either say no and

47
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,320
regret it for a few minutes or you can
say yes and we get for days weeks months

48
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,820
or even years for the longest time
obvious trading the certainty of a

49
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:33,100
paycheck for long-term discontent I
wasn't growing in my job anymore and

50
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,430
need to realize the trade-off i was
making every day I went to work

51
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:41,110
recognizing that trade-off allowed me to
regain my ability to choose and make the

52
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,480
tough decision to leave my job

53
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,230
we are presented with hundreds of
options a day an essentialist looks at

54
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,660
those options by asking him or herself
what trade-offs am I willing to make i

55
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,10
know i can't have it all

56
00:03:54,10 --> 00:03:59,140
so what problem do I want to solve Greg
explains two examples of some of the

57
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:05,619
best strategic choosers of our day true
essentialists warren buffett & Herb

58
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,360
Kelleher of Southwest Airlines great
relays a quote from the towel of warren

59
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,769
buffett Warren decided early in his
career it would be impossible for him to

60
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:18,940
make hundreds of right investment
decisions so he decided that he would

61
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:24,250
invest only in the businesses that he
was absolutely sure of and then bet

62
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,860
heavily on them he was ninety percent

63
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:32,319
his wealth to just 10 investments
sometimes what you don't do is just as

64
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,819
important as what you do break
summarizes this is saying he makes big

65
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:41,139
bets on the essential few investment
opportunities and says no to the many

66
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:45,789
merely good ones on a scale of one to
ten there are many things that come in

67
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:48,969
at seven or eight they're good
opportunities and we hate to let them

68
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:54,310
pass but we need to adopt what Derek
server says a hell yes or a No approach

69
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,39
either this is an amazing opportunity

70
00:04:57,39 --> 00:05:00,520
hell yea or no sorry I don't do that

71
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,479
greg says we need to learn the art of
letting go of sevens and eights to only

72
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,8
do nines and tens warren buffett once
said that for every 100 opportunities

73
00:05:09,9 --> 00:05:14,379
that are brought to me I say no to 99 of
them to be one of the best investors of

74
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:19,000
all time you need to be selectively you
need to home and be proud of your

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,560
ability to say no

76
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,909
Herb Kelleher of Southwest Airlines
treated every know as a yes for his

77
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:29,469
company when he would say no he was
considered a strategic trade off saying

78
00:05:29,469 --> 00:05:34,270
no to one thing enabled him to say yes
to something else to say yes to his

79
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:39,698
company culture to say yes to standing
out amongst the other airlines have said

80
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:44,319
you have to look at every opportunity
and say well no I'm sorry we're not

81
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,979
going to do a thousand different things
that really won't contribute much to the

82
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:52,779
end result that we're trying to achieve
her maid southwest the dominant airline

83
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:57,639
because he said no to destinations at
work . a . he said no to serving meals

84
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:03,69
he said no to first-class those noes
were made deliberately and they made all

85
00:06:03,69 --> 00:06:04,389
the difference

86
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:10,300
greg says quote at first southwest was
lambasted by critics naysayers and other

87
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,379
non-essential lyst who couldn't believe
that his approach could possibly be

88
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:15,339
successful

89
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:19,810
first they mocked him then they copied
him after reading Greg's book have

90
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:24,550
adopted three core ideas to live more
essentially to be more selective and

91
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,529
have the courage to say no

92
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:31,330
first I'm learning to see no in a new
way second i'm learning habits to

93
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:36,39
prevent the non-essential from entering
my life and third and protect my ability

94
00:06:36,39 --> 00:06:39,789
to prioritize and reserving time for
things that are truly essential

95
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,740
in learning to see no in a new way i
first need to realize that when i say no

96
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:50,650
to someone i'm saying no to the request
we commonly confused this we associate

97
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,60
the rejection of the request to mean the
rejection of that person I need to

98
00:06:55,60 --> 00:06:59,140
realize that my saying no doesn't have
to damage the relationship in fact it

99
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:03,190
could strengthen that if i come across
in a sincere way and i'm able to

100
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,900
articulate my priorities and have
conviction in maintaining them people

101
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,169
respect that that person may even be
inspired by that

102
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:16,300
next I need to realize that everyone is
selling that's just this today's age

103
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,600
there on the internet or walking down
the street

104
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,530
everyone's trying to sell you something
and we're feeling this constant guilt

105
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:28,239
over and over again when we say no to
things but that guilt is outdated that

106
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,710
guilt stems from a time where hunters
and gatherers living in tribes that if

107
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,460
we had social discomfort it meant that
we were close to being kicked out of the

108
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,510
tribe which meant death so it's
important that we make the distinction

109
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,190
that in the modern age

110
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,820
it's okay to say no in fact it's
essential that we say no

111
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:50,860
otherwise we will die another form of
death a death of burnout exhaustion and

112
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,120
checking out of life

113
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,170
Greg's help me adopt new habits that
prevent the non-essential things from

114
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,850
creeping into my life

115
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,810
first I learned to be more diligent
about keeping a journal that sounds

116
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,140
pretty basic and it doesn't sound like
it can do much but having the ability to

117
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:10,570
set aside time to take that bigger view
to be a journalist of your life allows

118
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:14,50
you to identify patterns of what really
is essential

119
00:08:14,50 --> 00:08:18,100
what really matters to you day after day
because we are easily disillusion by the

120
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,600
media by our environment we need to
really check in with ourselves and make

121
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,10
sure that we are on track and journaling
is one of the best tools to do this to

122
00:08:27,10 --> 00:08:31,30
journal often simply leave your journal
on your bed or on the couch from the

123
00:08:31,30 --> 00:08:34,89
kitchen table someplace we're always
going to run into it we can just jot

124
00:08:34,90 --> 00:08:38,890
down a few words a few ideas that you
can reflect on the second habit of the

125
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:43,600
essential list is learning the art of
the awkward pause if you're about to

126
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,310
instinctively say yes to a request just
pause for a little bit longer 324

127
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,239
seconds

128
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,910
what that does is let the person know
that you're seriously considering it

129
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,649
also gives you time to

130
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:57,220
think of the trade-offs that you're
going to make by saying yes if you say

131
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,9
yes to that what are you saying no to

132
00:09:00,9 --> 00:09:04,629
lastly to ensure that our priorities
remain our priorities we need to make

133
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:09,430
space in our day to strengthen our
ability to be selective and recognize

134
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:14,439
the trade-offs first we need to reserve
time to think we need space in our day

135
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:18,819
to allow us to differentiate between the
options that we have protecting your

136
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:22,868
thinking time could involve reserving 15
minute blocks throughout the day between

137
00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:27,399
meetings and before key events it's a
time where you think strategically how

138
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,490
you're approaching your life you
consider what you're currently saying no

139
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:34,569
to and what you should be saying no to
the second thing we need to protect his

140
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:39,519
playtime a study of over 6,000 people
concluded that play leads to brain

141
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,490
plasticity adaptability and creativity
nothing fires up the brain like play

142
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,850
greg says it helps us to see
possibilities we otherwise wouldn't have

143
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,899
seen and make connections we would
otherwise not have made it opens our

144
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:57,69
minds and broaden our perspective it
helps us challenge old assumptions and

145
00:09:57,69 --> 00:10:02,410
makes us more receptive to untested
ideas so play during conversations with

146
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:07,809
friends and family play by picking up a
new sport or activity play by making up

147
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:12,610
and engaging in games a third essential
thing we need to protect his sleep time

148
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:17,50
bill clinton was quoted as saying every
major mistake that I've made has

149
00:10:17,50 --> 00:10:21,339
happened as a result of sleep
deprivation sleep affects our judgment

150
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:25,300
and our awareness the less sleep we get
the more not essential things are able

151
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,839
to creep into our life if you're willing
to take the challenge of carving out

152
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:33,370
time to make sure you have a good sleep
you'll see that your awareness of choice

153
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,850
dramatically goes up and you have the
ability to identify the trade-offs and

154
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,769
make tough decisions throughout the day

155
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:43,689
Greg leaves us with a basic value
proposition of essentialism only once

156
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:48,129
you give yourself permission to stop
trying to do it all to stop saying yes

157
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:52,689
to everyone can you make your highest
contribution towards the things that

158
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:53,949
really matter
