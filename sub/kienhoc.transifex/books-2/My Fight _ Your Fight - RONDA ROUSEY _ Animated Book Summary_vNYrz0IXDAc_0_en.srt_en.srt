1
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,660
Ronda Rousey has been fighting her whole life.
On the day she was born on 1st February 1987,

2
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,640
she had the umbilical cord wrapped around
her neck and had to fight for her first breath.

3
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,500
She fought to communicate as the lack of oxygen
at birth affected her ability to speak and

4
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,480
be understood as a child.
At three years of age, Ronda’s family moved

5
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:42,238
from California to North Dakota and she began
intensive speech therapy.

6
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,390
When in North Dakota one winter, her father
suffered a severe back injury from an accident

7
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:53,159
on a sled. After narrowly escaping death he
spent over five months in hospital. He eventually

8
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,640
left but his spine was disintegrating and
the pain was excruciating. He committed suicide

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,269
when Ronda was eight years old.
Ronda moved back to California and her mother,

10
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:08,590
who was a former judo world champion, caught
up with her old judo friends and started working

11
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:14,090
out at their club. Ronda went along too and
after one month of judo training, on her 11th

12
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:20,450
birthday she entered a tournament. She fought
and won... the whole tournament.

13
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,930
Despite competing with injuries such as a
broken foot and recovering from a torn ACL,

14
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,720
Ronda worked her way up to a national level
and became the number one woman in her weight

15
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:35,548
class in the United States, aged only 16.
It was at this age that she moved to New Hampshire

16
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:41,170
to live and train with ‘Big Jim’, the
renowned judo coach Jim Pedro. Big Jim lived

17
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:47,530
in the middle of nowhere and for a year leading
up to the 2004 Olympics, all she did was eat,

18
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:52,239
sleep and train. At the Olympic trials she
fought and won a place on the Olympic team

19
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,750
and two months later, aged 17, she was off
to Athens, the youngest judo competitor in

20
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,789
the field.
Unfortunately Ronda lost in the first round

21
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:06,030
to the eventual silver medal winner, but did
end up finishing 9th after fighting in the

22
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,629
consolation bracket to compete for bronze.
Over the next couple of years Ronda left the

23
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:17,590
Pedros’ club and trained at various places
around North America: New York, Chicago and

24
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,129
Montreal in Canada, before returning to train
with the Pedros (that’s Big Jim and his

25
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:28,310
son ‘Little Jimmy’), in Massachusetts.
It was during this time at the age of 21 that

26
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,830
she saw her first female Mixed Martial Arts
match on the TV. She thought about fighting

27
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,330
and winning in the octagon but pushed the
thoughts out of her mind as she was focused

28
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:43,050
on the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
The year before the Olympics, Ronda competed

29
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:48,530
in the 2007 World Championships in Rio De
Janeiro, where she narrowly missed out on

30
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:53,840
gold, losing on points in the final.
Once at Beijing, she won her first two matches

31
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,509
before losing the third in overtime. Ronda
was once again in the bronze medal consolation

32
00:02:58,509 --> 00:03:03,370
bracket, but this time she won her next three
matches to win the bronze and become the first

33
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,730
American woman to receive a medal in judo
at the Olympics since it became an official

34
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:14,090
sport in 1992. As she looked up into the stands
immediately after her bronze medal match,

35
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,729
Ronda saw her mother holding up the American
flag. The same flag that had been placed on

36
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:22,609
her father’s coffin at his funeral, 13 years
previously.

37
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:29,130
After the Olympics, reality sunk in. Ronda
had no job, no home and no prospects. She

38
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:34,099
got a job as a bartender and after a few nights
sleeping in her car, leased a small studio

39
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:39,359
apartment. She took a year off from judo training
and spent most of it bartending and drinking

40
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,550
heavily.
Eventually she began training with her old

41
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:48,380
judo friend Manny Gamburyan. Manny had moved
from judo into MMA and they grappled once

42
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:53,840
a week. She briefly made a comeback to judo,
but after four months, realised that it wasn’t

43
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,700
making her happy. She began to train in MMA
fulltime and her mother, despite being sceptical

44
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:04,199
gave her, her blessing.
To compete in MMA, Ronda needed to improve

45
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:09,139
her striking. She started training at Glendale
Fighting Club and her striking coach was the

46
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:15,269
owner, Edmond Tarverdyan.
On 6th August 2010, Ronda made her amateur

47
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:21,009
MMA debut, winning in 23 seconds by submission.
She fought two more amateur fights, winning

48
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:26,960
both with neither lasting more than a minute.
With her record at 3-0 in the amateur ranks,

49
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:33,489
she decided to turn professional.
On 27th March 2011, Ronda made her pro debut

50
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:39,590
with the prize money being $400 to fight and
double that if she won. Ronda won in 25 seconds

51
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:44,839
with an armbar submission hold. Her second
fight was in Calgary and also ended with an

52
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:51,829
armbar victory, this time in 49 seconds, which
earned her $1000. After this fight she was

53
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:55,788
called up by Strikeforce, the biggest MMA
organisation with a women’s division at

54
00:04:55,788 --> 00:05:00,930
the time and was asked to join them.
Her first fight in Strikeforce was on 12th

55
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:10,348
August 2011. It ended in another victory by
armbar, in 25 seconds. It earned Ronda $8000.

56
00:05:10,348 --> 00:05:14,038
Another quick victory followed and it put
Ronda in line for a title shot.

57
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:21,568
In Columbus, Ohio on 3rd March 2012, Ronda
Rousey became the Strikeforce women’s Bantamweight

58
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:27,449
champion, again by submission in round one.
As champion, her first defence was another

59
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:33,870
first round win. Then she received a phone
call from UFC president, Dana White. The Ultimate

60
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,449
Fighting Championship is the biggest MMA organisation
in the world and Dana had previously said

61
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:43,689
women would never be in the UFC. After meeting
Ronda at a restaurant he told her “you’re

62
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:49,259
going to be the first woman in the UFC”.
In a press conference Ronda was introduced

63
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:55,270
as the women’s champion and would be in
the main event at UFC 157. On 23rd February

64
00:05:55,269 --> 00:06:00,978
2013 in Anaheim, Ronda won the match and was
still the champ.

65
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:04,779
After the fight, Ronda was asked to star in
‘The Ultimate Fighter’, a reality show

66
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:09,418
where two coaches train teams of fighters,
before the two coaches themselves fight against

67
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:13,948
each other on a UFC event. Ronda was one of
these coaches.

68
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:19,310
Prior to The Ultimate Fighter, Ronda had been
laying some groundwork for an acting career,

69
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:25,158
signing with an agent, meeting producers and
getting an acting coach. Her agent got her

70
00:06:25,158 --> 00:06:29,278
a meeting with Sylvester Stallone and after
several more meetings; she was cast in a role

71
00:06:29,278 --> 00:06:34,550
in the new Expendables 3 movie.
She filmed in Bulgaria for eight weeks before

72
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:40,300
immediately flying to Atlanta to film a different
part in Fast and Furious 7. She then returned

73
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:45,038
to train for her upcoming fight in just over
six weeks against her rival coach on The Ultimate

74
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:51,168
Fighter and former opponent, Miesha Tate.
The rematch took place six months after filming

75
00:06:51,168 --> 00:06:56,528
The Ultimate Fighter at UFC 168. The fight
turned out to be a new experience for Ronda,

76
00:06:56,528 --> 00:07:01,759
as it went beyond the first round, but she
won again, this time in the third.

77
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:08,120
Less than two months later, Ronda fought again,
at UFC 170 and won for the first time by TKO

78
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,658
with a knee to the liver.
In between this fight and her next, she filmed

79
00:07:12,658 --> 00:07:18,699
in the Entourage movie. Then at UFC 175 in
Las Vegas, she fought her 10th professional

80
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:25,069
contest and won by TKO in 16 seconds.
She went one better in her next fight, winning

81
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:30,930
with her trusty armbar in only 14 seconds
– the fastest submission in UFC history.

82
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:37,059
Ronda Rousey has been described as many things:
a judoka, a medallist, an actress, a champion

83
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:42,229
but perhaps the most appropriate description
one could give her is that she is simply a

84
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:42,558
fighter.
