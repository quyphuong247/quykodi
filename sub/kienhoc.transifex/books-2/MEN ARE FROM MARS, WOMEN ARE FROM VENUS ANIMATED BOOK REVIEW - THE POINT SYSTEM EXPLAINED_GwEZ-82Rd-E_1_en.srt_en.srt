00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:07,849
A husband comes home with a huge check for
the month, but his wife isn’t happy. She

2
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:13,419
thinks, “I didn’t get any attention the
entire month so that he could bring home this

3
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:19,500
check?” He thinks, “I worked hard the
entire month, so that I could bring home this

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,649
check and make us happy, and she doesn’t
appreciate it.”

5
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:30,140
This has become the standard narrative in
relationships, and simply stems from ignorance

6
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:37,140
about how men and women assign points. Think
of these as, I guess, happiness points.

7
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:43,140
If Britney gets one video game for Bill, he
assigns that one point. If Britney were to

8
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,870
get him ten video games, he would be really,
really happy and assign it ten points. But

9
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:55,338
what Bill doesn’t realize is that the opposite
is not true for how Britney assigns points.

10
00:00:55,338 --> 00:01:02,088
If Bill gets Britney one rose on his way home,
that will be one point for her. If Bill got

11
00:01:02,088 --> 00:01:07,359
ten roses for Britney, guess what, it would
still be one, just one point. Maybe if he

12
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:12,700
got fifty roses, then it would be two points,
but the big idea is that she assigns points

13
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:19,120
very differently. Little things are assigned
just as much value as big things.

14
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,090
I can make my girlfriend her favorite coffee
in the morning, send her a flirty text on

15
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,670
lunch break, come home and show her how excited
I am to see her and give her a kiss, and she

16
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,159
will be much happier than if I had completely
disregarded her feminine need, and simply

17
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,909
brought home an expensive gift at the end
of the day.

18
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:44,920
Now with this said, let’s address that one
guy. There is always that one guy who tells

19
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,960
me, "What you say sounds nice but you’re
wrong, that’s not what girls really want."

20
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,659
The problem isn’t that what we’re telling
him is wrong. The problem is that he can’t

21
00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:01,250
do the little things meaningfully. His kiss
actually does not generate that one point

22
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:06,500
for her. None of his little attentions do
because he has no understanding of the feminine.

23
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:12,000
So, guess what, the girl is obviously going
to pick a gift or whatever, that is at least

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,189
guaranteed to give her a point. It also becomes
obvious that the she isn’t with him for

25
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:23,939
the right reasons, but then again, they will
both settle for now, until their next codependently

26
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:25,759
mediocre relationship.
