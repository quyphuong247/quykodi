00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:12,410
Alibaba: The House That Jack Ma Built by Duncan
Clark

2
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:17,740
Jack Ma is an English teacher turned Internet
entrepreneur who founded the Chinese e-commerce

3
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,259
company called Alibaba.

4
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:25,60
It is the Amazon of the East, but it has more
impact on the retail sector of China than

5
00:00:25,60 --> 00:00:27,890
its rival has in the USA.

6
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:32,231
More people make purchases on Alibaba’s
websites per year then there are people in

7
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:35,860
the United States of America.

8
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:41,000
Alibaba is a dominant force today thanks to
what Jack Ma describes as the “Iron Triangle”

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,510
– strength in e-commerce, logistics and
finance.

10
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:48,260
E-commerce
Alibaba’s websites carry no inventory.

11
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,940
One of them, called Taobao, is simply a platform
to serve as a marketplace for individuals

12
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,210
and traders, nine million of them in fact.

13
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,610
No fees are charged for a buyer or seller
to use Taobao; the company makes its money

14
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,120
from advertising on the site.

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,80
The process of buying a product online with
Alibaba is very similar to buying an item

16
00:01:07,80 --> 00:01:08,140
in real life.

17
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:14,690
You can chat with the vendor to haggle a price
or you can peruse the product via a webcam.

18
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,560
Alibaba also have another website called Tmall.

19
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,250
Tmall contains a number of luxury brands and
big retailers.

20
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:27,50
They pay Alibaba between 3-6% commission on
their products and the website has proved

21
00:01:27,50 --> 00:01:32,399
extremely popular, becoming the 7th most visited
site in China.

22
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,860
Between the two sites, Alibaba makes $10 billion
a year in revenue.

23
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,170
Online shopping is more popular in China than
in the West, accounting for more than 10%

24
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:47,150
of all retail purchases in the country, compared
to only 7% in the US.

25
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:52,390
It’s equivalent of Cyber Monday is called
“Singles’ Day”, which occurs on 11th

26
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,880
November every year.

27
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,149
Sales on that day in 2015 reached $18 billion.

28
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,200
More than 40% of consumers buy their groceries
online in China.

29
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,69
That figure is only 10% in the United States.

30
00:02:08,68 --> 00:02:11,599
Alibaba caters for people from every financial
background.

31
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,420
Cars are popular items on the website.

32
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,630
Even entire islands are for sale for the superrich.

33
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,760
Logistics
For this e-commerce revolution to take place,

34
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,49
you need couriers, and lots of them.

35
00:02:23,50 --> 00:02:27,530
They’re on foot, on bikes, on trucks and
on trains.

36
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:32,170
To keep costs low, ingenious shortcuts are
performed such as passing packages over subway

37
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,950
barriers to avoid paying extra tickets.

38
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:40,420
Whilst the couriers are private and not owned
by Alibaba, they do have a stake in a logistics

39
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,530
firm that provides a platform to interlock
together couriers, distribution centres and

40
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,920
warehouses.

41
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,429
This logistics network provides maximum efficiency.

42
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,820
Finance
Financially, a tool that gives Alibaba an

43
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:58,250
edge is Alipay, its PayPal equivalent, but
it handles three times more in terms of online

44
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,140
transactions.

45
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:05,488
Alipay was owned by Alibaba but is now controlled
personally by Jack Ma with its value estimated

46
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:08,80
at $45 billion.

47
00:03:08,80 --> 00:03:12,770
In 2015, Jack launched an internet-only bank.

48
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,900
Alibaba offers credit to many customers and
with full access to their customers trading

49
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:22,280
history, it has an advantage over traditional
banks when assessing credit risk.

50
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,940
Surprisingly, Jack Ma has no background in
technology.

51
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:31,90
He does have charm and charisma which often
allows him to get his own way, similar to

52
00:03:31,90 --> 00:03:34,909
Steve Jobs and his “reality distortion field”.

53
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:39,489
His ability to speak fluently in both English
and Chinese as well as a sharp wit make him

54
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:41,180
an excellent communicator.

55
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:47,440
Jack’s mantra puts the customer first, employees
second and shareholders third.

56
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,900
This allows him to focus on long term ambitions
without having to sacrifice them to satisfy

57
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,90
the shareholders with profit in the short
term.

58
00:03:56,90 --> 00:04:02,210
Born in 1964 in a city 100 miles from Shanghai,
when Jack was born China was isolated from

59
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:06,220
the world with most industrial production
being controlled by the state.

60
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,239
When Jack was a teenager, China opened its
borders to tourists and he gave them free

61
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,209
tours in exchange for being taught English.

62
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:19,879
He did this for nine years and it was a tourist
who recommended the English name, “Jack”.

63
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:24,610
Jack struggled with mathematics but did scrape
into a local, not particularly prestigious

64
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,400
university.

65
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,900
He graduated with a degree in English in 1988
and began to teach the language.

66
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:37,99
He also worked part-time on his new business
focusing on translation, called “Hope”.

67
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,740
The venture was not particularly successful
and he started to sell goods on the street

68
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,339
to supplement its income.

69
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:47,580
His expertise in speaking English led to him
being asked by a Chinese county government

70
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,139
to go to America to assist translating a business
deal dispute.

71
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,219
It was here he first used the internet.

72
00:04:55,219 --> 00:04:58,699
After being told you could find information
on anything, he discovered there was next

73
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,240
to no information on China.

74
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,970
This inspired him to create his second business
venture, China Pages, an online directory

75
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,869
of Chinese businesses seeking overseas clients.

76
00:05:09,869 --> 00:05:14,970
Jack quit his teaching job on his return to
his home country to focus on China Pages.

77
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:20,319
However, despite early success it struggled
financially as it was simply a listings directory

78
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,930
with no means to purchase products so the
amount they could charge businesses was restricted.

79
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,900
Eventually Jack was squeezed out of the company
after partnering with a larger firm to ease

80
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,409
cashflow problems.

81
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:38,240
In 1999, Jack founded his third entrepreneurial
attempt called Alibaba, a business to business

82
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,120
trading platform.

83
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,849
He picked the Arabic name because it was well-known,
easy to pronounce in many languages and appeared

84
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:47,979
near the top of any alphabetical listing.

85
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:54,430
The launch coincided with huge growth in internet
users in China and a fall in the cost of PCs.

86
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:00,409
Jack and a small team including his wife worked
on Alibaba 24/7 in his second-floor apartment

87
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:02,80
in Hangzhou.

88
00:06:02,80 --> 00:06:07,248
He raised an initial $5 million investment
from Goldman Sachs and other financial institutions,

89
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:10,409
giving away 50% of his equity.

90
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:15,438
By offering its e-commerce services for free,
Alibaba’s popularity grew.

91
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,979
Further investment followed and a year after
the company was founded, there was $25 million

92
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,39
of investment.

93
00:06:22,39 --> 00:06:25,630
The money would prove invaluable when the
dot-com bubble popped.

94
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:30,110
Jack was strangely optimistic after hearing
the bubble had burst, seeing it as an opportunity

95
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,189
for Alibaba.

96
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:36,689
Having only spent five of the $25 million
raised and venture capitalists now refusing

97
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:41,919
to fund competitors, Alibaba expanded, hiring
more foreign workers to increase its appeal

98
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,330
to overseas buyers.

99
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:49,198
Jack toured the world promoting the company;
his speeches proving particularly popular.

100
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,909
However, 2001 and 2002 were still very tough
years.

101
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:59,479
Jack’s motto at the time was to “be the
last man standing” to eventually win.

102
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:05,339
In 2002, Alibaba prepared to enter the consumer
e-commerce market.

103
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:10,50
This would mean taking on eBay in China head
to head, even though they had 90% of the consumer

104
00:07:10,50 --> 00:07:12,789
e-commerce market at the time.

105
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:16,930
Jack was worried that eBay could move into
the business to business market.

106
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:22,869
The Taobao website, which means “hunting
for treasure” was launched in 2003.

107
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:27,710
Despite the David Vs Goliath battle, Taobao
did have some advantages over eBay’s China

108
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,119
site.

109
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:33,610
Its site was built specifically for the Chinese
audience, rather than having to adopt eBay’s

110
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,789
global branding which was alien to users.

111
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,500
Taobao also had a different business model
which meant that it didn’t charge merchants

112
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,709
and shoppers any fees directly, unlike eBay,
which attracted more people to the site.

113
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:52,749
At the end of 2005, eBay only had a third
of the market share while Taobao had 60%.

114
00:07:52,749 --> 00:07:57,789
eBay sold off its Chinese business, which
soon disappeared completely.

115
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:02,128
Another company that tried and failed to crack
the Chinese market was Yahoo!.

116
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:08,69
After acquiring two businesses in China without
much success, in 2005 Yahoo! let Alibaba take

117
00:08:08,69 --> 00:08:10,839
over control of China Yahoo!.

118
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:15,659
They also gave Jack $1 billion for a 40% stake
in Alibaba.

119
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:21,429
The money helped Jack finish off eBay with
Taobao, as Taobao wasn’t yet profitable.

120
00:08:21,429 --> 00:08:26,628
After eBay left the Chinese market, Taobao
increased its users from 30 million to 170

121
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:29,270
million in three years.

122
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:34,568
Sales grew from $2 billion to $30 billion
in the same period.

123
00:08:34,568 --> 00:08:38,718
After Alibaba.com the original business to
business platform was launched on the stock

124
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,979
market, demand caused it to be valued at $26
billion.

125
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:49,180
The global financial crisis reduced the share
price significantly, but Alibaba survived.

126
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:56,469
In 2012 Alibaba bought back 50% of Yahoo’s
stake in the company for $7.1 billion.

127
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:02,550
In 2014, after Jack Ma turned 50, Alibaba
went public on the US stock market with its

128
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,89
initial public offering.

129
00:09:05,89 --> 00:09:11,430
It was the biggest IPO in the USA in history,
with the company valued at over $230 billion

130
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,579
after the first day’s trading.

131
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,690
So, what will the future hold for Jack and
Alibaba?

132
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,740
There are three factors that will cause the
company to grow.

133
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,430
Cloud computing
Alibaba has invested $1 billion into its cloud

134
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,819
services which currently only provide 3% of
the revenue for the business.

135
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:32,99
Rural market expansion
Only a quarter of the 700 million rural inhabitants

136
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,270
of China are online.

137
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:39,420
This figure is going to increase, unlocking
potential new markets of merchants and consumers.

138
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,790
Globalisation
Cross-border trading has been a focus of Alibaba’s

139
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,810
for a while, with the Chinese government encouraging
companies to “go global”.

140
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:51,979
It has increased its physical presence in
Europe and the United States.

141
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,470
In addition to these factors, Alibaba has
also been investing in health and happiness,

142
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,519
buying pharmaceutical companies as well as
making entertainment investments in sports

143
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:02,940
teams and film studios.

144
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:10,319
Jack himself has also created a philanthropic
trust focusing on health care and the environment.

145
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:16,139
Jack Ma has built Alibaba into a worldwide
giant and amassed a fortune in doing so, but

146
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:20,899
Jack is still building and working to create
the means to accomplish even higher ambitions.
