1
00:00:03,138 --> 00:00:08,830
They took a school of violinists and divided
them into three groups. Teacher material,

2
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:13,570
the merely good, and world class. And they
asked them the same question, "Ever since

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:19,399
you first picked up the violin, how many hours
of practice have you put into it?" And a pattern

4
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:25,198
emerged. Teacher material had practiced about
4,000 hours, the merely good had practiced

5
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:32,189
about 8,000 hours, and the world class had
practiced about 10,000 hours. In study after

6
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:38,020
study with pianists, chess players, master
criminals, the same pattern emerged. And so

7
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:45,020
this became known as the 10,000 hour rule.
So the conclusion was the following: As long

8
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:51,570
as you're good enough to get into the school,
the number of deliberate hours of practice

9
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:57,600
would be the only thing that would really
differentiate you from your competitors. Now,

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,230
Outliers is an extremely interesting book,
but it doesn't really tell you how to become

11
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:07,849
an outlier. So I've picked out three huge
implications of the book about success that

12
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:13,239
should help all of us. The first one, and
my favorite: when you're on your first few

13
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:20,239
hours of doing something, stop expecting to
be good! I remember when I put out my first

14
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:26,530
animated video, some people said, "Well, your
animation sucks, your voice-over sucks." And

15
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,049
I took that and I said, "Oh, okay, this is
great. People are telling me what I need to

16
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:35,479
improve on." But at the same time, I realized
that that was completely natural, and it didn't

17
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:40,950
affect me at all. But again, what is people's
though process? I've put in a few hours into

18
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,228
something, I'm going to be good. It's like,
Oh! It's really surprising that I'm not as

19
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:53,228
good as an entire team of animators that have
put in 1,000s and 1,000s of hours into their

20
00:01:53,269 --> 00:01:59,769
craft. Work together, and that's literally
all they do, and charge $5,000 for a single

21
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:06,358
minute of animation, and my little first animation
isn't as good as their's. But that's literally

22
00:02:06,358 --> 00:02:11,560
how people think. Someone starts a business,
and it's like, "I've had losses in the first

23
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,310
few months," which is completely normal for
a business! But what is going to say? "Well,

24
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:20,060
maybe I'm not so good at this business thing,"
and quit. You take someone to the tennis court,

25
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,568
and they play tennis for the first time, and
they hit the ball ten times and it hits the

26
00:02:23,568 --> 00:02:28,810
net every single time. And what do they say?
"Oh, well, maybe this isn't really my sport."

27
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:34,650
And it's like, "Do you know how long it took
me to play my first tennis game?" Took me

28
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,819
probably 10 hours of practice to play the
most miserable tennis game ever played in

29
00:02:40,818 --> 00:02:46,810
the history of mankind. And it consisted of
three hits of both players back and forth,

30
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:53,810
and that was it. The second big implication
is that talent is overrated. In the studies

31
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,989
that they did, there were no "naturals," meaning
a person with only 4,000 hours of practice

32
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:05,269
that was world class. There were no "grinds"
either, meaning a person with 10,000 hours

33
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:09,719
of practice and being a teacher material.
And I don't have to look at those studies

34
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:16,250
to know that talent is overrated. Most of
the time, what gets labeled as talent is hours

35
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:21,269
and hours of practice that isn't seen. So
how do I know this? Because I've been put

36
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:26,469
on that pedestal before. When I was in college,
I remember taking this slightly complicated

37
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:31,769
statistics class. And people were really struggling
with it, and the average would usually be

38
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:37,438
a 50 on the exams. And I would get a 100 basically
every single time. Now at the same time, all

39
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:42,658
I did in those classes was sleep. That's it.
I just went there and slept. While people

40
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:47,438
sitting next to me would sit there and take
notes and try to work really hard. Now, when

41
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:52,680
the exams would come back, they would look
at me and they would say, "You're a genius!

42
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,579
Okay, you're a GOD!" Basically, I became this
god. How do you do this? All you do is sleep,

43
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:04,409
and look, you got a 100, I got a 50. But again,
what was the reality? And the reality isn't

44
00:04:04,408 --> 00:04:09,598
going to be disclosed because the person with
success has way too many things that are cool

45
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,548
going on in his life. So I had a great social
circle, I was doing great things, I wasn't

46
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:19,090
going to sit there and explain what happend.
But what happened? Well, here's the actual

47
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:25,569
truth. So when we'd go back, I would spend
hours and hours every night doing every single

48
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:31,589
problem. That's by the way why I was so tired
the next day in class. What they did was they

49
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:36,899
would take those notes, those mediocre notes
the took in class and maybe spend 30 minutes

50
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:41,810
or an hour in their room. And that's really
where the difference came from. Now, not only

51
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:47,780
was it that, but it was accumulated advantage.
Even if we had gone years back, when we were

52
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:53,199
in middle school, I would've been the one
putting in the hours and they wouldn't. And

53
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:59,949
over time, it's 100s and 1,000 of hours of
advantage. But again, in college, what is

54
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:06,579
it? Some people are good at math, some people
aren't good at math. The third big implication:

55
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:13,579
as long as you're good enough, deliberate
practice is what will set you apart. Now,

56
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:19,529
let's break down that "as long as you're good
enough" part. I think if you're 40 years old,

57
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:22,479
have never kicked a ball in your life, and
you say, "Well, I want to be a professional

58
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,790
soccer player," that's not going to work.
But I think most of us have realistic goals.

59
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:32,439
I think most of us are good enough. But, what
we're lacking is the deliberate practice.

60
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:36,879
Again, if I go back to the college example,
what those people would do when they would

61
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:43,430
come into class would be, "Oh, I studied all
night last night..." And again, what did they

62
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:50,430
mean? Out of every hour, I spent 50 minutes
eating, talking to my roommate, being on Facebook,

63
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:56,840
and then 5 to 10 minutes actually doing the
work. You have to put in that deliberate amount

64
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:02,459
of hours of practice where you're solely focusing
on getting better at your craft, and if you

65
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:09,459
do that, that is what is going to set you
apart.
