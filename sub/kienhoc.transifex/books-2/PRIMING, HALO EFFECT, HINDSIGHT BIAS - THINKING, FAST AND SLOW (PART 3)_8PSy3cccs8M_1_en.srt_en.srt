00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:13,820
1. Priming.
If I talk to you about food and then I show

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,250
you this, you’ll put the letter “U”
in there. If I talk to you about cleanliness

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,859
first and then I show you this, you’ll put
the letter “A” in there. This is what

4
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,489
is called priming. By simply priming people,
you can significantly affect their decisions.

5
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:33,429
There was a study where a wine store played
French music on some days and German music

6
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:37,609
on others, and the customers of course would
never think that this would affect anything,

7
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:42,729
but they tended to buy more French wines on
the days when French music was played, and

8
00:00:42,729 --> 00:00:46,969
more German wines on the days when German
music was played.

9
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:50,810
This is also one of the reasons why when you
walk into a store that promotes health and

10
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:56,750
freshness like Whole Foods, you’ll probably
be greeted with fresh flowers and fruit. It

11
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,899
primes you for freshness. The first thing
you see will never be canned tuna, even though

12
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:05,900
you can definitely buy plenty of canned stuff
in there.

13
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:12,740
2. The halo effect.
If we really like someone, we tend to really

14
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:17,248
like everything they do and say. If they say
something average, we might think that it’s

15
00:01:17,248 --> 00:01:21,310
the best thing we’ve ever heard, and if
they say something stupid, we tend to just

16
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,649
go along with it anyway. And you probably
have someone you really admire and if they

17
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:30,429
do something stupid you’ll say, “Oh whatever…
Everyone makes mistakes…” But then if

18
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:35,359
someone you didn’t like did the exact same
thing, you’d be outraged.

19
00:01:35,358 --> 00:01:40,828
And the attractiveness of a person along with
other irrelevant factors plays a huge role

20
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:45,728
in how much we like what they say and do.
If we’re presented with two women who committed

21
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:50,670
the same crime, we’re much more likely to
give a lighter punishment to the more attractive

22
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,748
one. And of course, that doesn’t make sense!
They committed the same crime! But that is

23
00:01:55,748 --> 00:02:00,739
the halo effect. So next time an attractive
person or someone you’ve put on a pedestal

24
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:05,798
is trying to give you advice, ask yourself,
“Is this advice valuable because it’s

25
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:11,390
actually valuable, or am I blinded by how
he looks, or how big his house is, or how

26
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:12,389
much I like him.”

27
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:20,559
3. The Hindsight Bias.
You probably know people who constantly feel

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,039
the need to say, “Well, I knew that was
going to happen…” “I knew that stock

29
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,459
was going to fall…” “I knew that we
were going to lose that war…” “I knew

30
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:34,330
that stock was going rise…” This is called
the hindsight bias. We tend to be experts

31
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:39,600
at events after they have already occurred.
It’s really weird how you know exactly which

32
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,379
stock is going to rise and which stock is
going to fall because you’re completely

33
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:49,259
broke. If you actually knew that information,
you’d be a really rich person by now.

34
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:54,789
And the hindsight bias can go from just annoying
to simply dangerous when we start to blame

35
00:02:54,789 --> 00:03:00,569
other people for not being able to see something
so obvious. You blame the government for making

36
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:04,590
a certain decision and think, “How could
they not see that?” Your girlfriend hits

37
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,430
a pothole and you get a flat tire and you
get all pissed off, “How did she not see

38
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,520
that pothole?” Well… Because if you were
in government, you might have thought that

39
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,850
the decision was actually a good decision
at the time it was made, and if you were driving

40
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:22,739
and looking in the mirror so you could make
a turn, you might have not seen the pothole

41
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,469
yourself.
So don’t be that annoying person who feels

42
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:31,479
the need to tell everyone how you knew exactly
who was going to win the finals and how the

43
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:36,319
stock was obviously going to rise. And definitely
don’t blame others for something that seems

44
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:42,530
so obvious just because it’s already happened.
Of course it’s obvious now, but it wasn’t

45
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:48,560
obvious before it actually happened.

46
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,870
So the 3 big ideas are…
1. Priming. Realize the power of even the

47
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,039
simplest suggestions and what that does to
people’s behavior.

48
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:03,780
2. The halo effect. Stop thinking everything
someone says is pure gold just because you

49
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,909
really like them. Chances are everything they
say isn’t that flawless.

50
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:15,400
3. And the hindsight bias. Realize that anyone
can be an expert after an event has already

51
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:28,879
occurred.
