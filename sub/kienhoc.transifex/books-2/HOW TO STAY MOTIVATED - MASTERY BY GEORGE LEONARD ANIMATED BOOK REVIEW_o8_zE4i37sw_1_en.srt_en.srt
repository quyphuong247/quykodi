1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,950
When I first got into lifting weights, I couldn’t
stay motivated at all. I made sure my lifting

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:11,509
routine and nutrition were pretty much perfect,
but I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t

3
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:16,640
progressing. I would lift my personal record
one week, then perfectly stick to my routine

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,760
and nutrition, and I would come back one or
two weeks later and guess what, lift the same

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,870
weight or even less. This literally discouraged
me to a point, where often I would completely

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:33,250
disregard the gym for a few weeks because
I felt like I needed to change everything

7
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,560
about my diet and routine.

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:41,260
And then I read Mastery by George Leonard,
one of my biggest role models and a person

9
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:46,359
who knew a thing or two about Mastery. And
he said, “Look, the reason you feel that

10
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:51,950
way is because of what you’ve been taught.”
My mommy told me, “Hey, just work hard,

11
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:57,430
you’ll get better and better every day.”
And I bought into that so the mastery curve

12
00:00:57,429 --> 00:01:04,209
in my head looked like this… I thought over
time, I would see constant progress. And Leonard

13
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:10,059
said, “That’s the stupidest, most unrealistic
thing you could expect on your path.” Your

14
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:16,180
path is actually going to look something like
this. And here you have the most important

15
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:23,180
idea of a “plateau.” Most of your journey
on your path to mastery is spent on that plateau.

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,549
And it is after dedicated time on this plateau
that you see progress and possibly even slight

17
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:37,280
regress afterwards, but the big idea is that
the new plateau is higher than your previous

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,710
one. And that is how real growth happens.

19
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:45,819
So I’ve literally used this idea with everything
ever since I first read Leonard. Do you think

20
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:51,548
I look at how my channel is doing today compared
to yesterday or a week ago? Why, why would

21
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:57,130
I do that? I look at… Is my routine and
nutrition optimized or in this case, am I

22
00:01:57,129 --> 00:02:03,589
offering as much value as I possibly can and
am I constantly trying to improve my content

23
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:09,118
for my viewers? And the answer is “yes.”
So there is no reason for me to lose motivation

24
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,789
when my channel isn’t doing better than
it was, I don’t know, yesterday or a week

25
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:20,789
ago, because I know that in six months my
channel will be kicking ass compared to today.

26
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,390
And I will be on yet another plateau, diligently
putting in the work to get to the next one.
