00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:15,339
Nikola Tesla: Imagination and the Man that
Invented the 20th Century by Sean Patrick.

2
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:19,990
This book is about a man many have called
the father of the modern world. His imagination

3
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:24,070
led him to dare to dream about inventions
that for many seemed impossible.

4
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:30,359
In 1882 Nikola Tesla was struck by a vision
of a working motor that produced an electric

5
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,620
alternating current. He had suggested direct
current generators could be modified to produce

6
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:40,559
alternating current seven years previously
whilst attending college, but he was ridiculed

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,730
by his professor and he left college a year
later.

8
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:49,869
To make his dream of an alternating current
motor a reality, he moved to Paris from Budapest,

9
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:55,599
taking a job at the Continental Edison Company,
installing lighting systems. During his time

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,710
in the job he built a prototype of his motor
and tried to get a wealthy businessman to

11
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:04,640
become an investor in his invention. He was
rejected by all the businessmen he spoke to

12
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,689
as they didn't understand the device and didn't
see the value in it. Eventually, Tesla decided

13
00:01:10,688 --> 00:01:14,908
that another extraordinary mind would appreciate
his work and travelled by boat to New York

14
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:21,079
City to meet with Thomas Edison.
Edison and his financial backer, J.P. Morgan

15
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:25,099
were making large amounts of money from their
direct current so when Tesla described his

16
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:29,780
alternating current solution, claiming it
was the future of electricity, Edison dismissed

17
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:35,579
the idea as unnecessary. He did however like
Tesla and hired him to work on repairing lighting

18
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:42,118
systems initially. A few months later Tesla
became one of Edison's most valuable engineers.

19
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:48,429
In 1885 Edison promised Tesla $50,000 if he
could back up his claim that he could redesign

20
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:54,539
elements of Edison's direct current generators
and improve efficiency and durability. Tesla

21
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:58,379
delivered on his promise but when he asked
for payment, Edison claimed to have been only

22
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:04,739
joking about the financial reward and instead
offered him a raise of $10 a week. Tesla resigned

23
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:09,568
immediately and so began a feud that would
last a lifetime.

24
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:15,958
Tesla was forced to take a job digging ditches
for $2 a day (he was previously on $18 a week).

25
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,378
When people learnt that a genius was digging
ditches to survive, several investors approached

26
00:02:20,378 --> 00:02:25,628
Tesla and asked him to develop an arc lighting
system. In return they would finance his new

27
00:02:25,628 --> 00:02:31,348
company, the Tesla Electric Company. He accepted
their offer. The company would start making

28
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:35,969
a profit but Tesla was swindled out of most
of the money and eventually ejected from the

29
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:40,000
company.
Two other men approached Tesla and agreed

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,310
to invest in his alternating current project,
building him a laboratory in New York. Here

31
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:50,949
Tesla built complete systems of generators,
motors and lighting. He filed and was issued

32
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:57,719
with seven patents for his inventions. He
split the profits 50-50 with his investors.

33
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,609
Tesla was asked to lecture at the American
Institute of Electrical Engineers and his

34
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:05,620
visionary presentations caught the eye of
businessman George Westinhouse, who wanted

35
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:11,079
to provide electricity for the entire United
States of America. He believed Tesla's alternating

36
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:17,670
current system was the way to do it.
Westinghouse offered Tesla $25,000 in cash

37
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:22,889
and $50,000 in stock in his company for his
patents as well as a royalty of $2.50 per

38
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:28,119
horsepower of alternating current motors sold.
Tesla agreed and spent the money building

39
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,769
a new lab and researching radiant energy.
His research led to his discovery of X-rays

40
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:39,310
and how to use them. He didn't make his discoveries
widely known which eventually led to X-rays

41
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,938
being attributed to somebody else at a later
date.

42
00:03:43,938 --> 00:03:48,310
Thomas Edison and J.P. Morgan knew that if
Tesla's alternating current network took off

43
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,979
it would kill their own direct current network,
and the money they were making from it. They

44
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:56,709
launched a huge propaganda campaign saying
alternating current in a home would kill a

45
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:02,468
customer in six months. Edison also electrocuted
animals to demonstrate the danger of Tesla's

46
00:04:02,468 --> 00:04:07,658
work. Tesla countered these exhibitions by
demonstrating the lighting of lamps by letting

47
00:04:07,658 --> 00:04:13,568
alternating current flow through his body.
Tesla continued with his research and invented

48
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:18,969
what became known as the Tesla coil. He used
this to invent a high-frequency fluorescent

49
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:24,300
lamp which was also highly efficient. Tesla
tuned two of his coils to resonate at the

50
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,439
same frequency and it enabled him to send
and receive signals. This was the world’s

51
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:35,439
first radio transmitter and transmission.
In 1891 Tesla discovered that energy could

52
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:40,469
be transmitted through the air and proved
it by lighting lamps wirelessly. He believed

53
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,699
that high frequency energy could provide free
electricity to the entire world.

54
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:49,460
The direct and alternating current battle
came to an end when Tesla and Westinghouse

55
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:56,109
were offered the contract to illuminate the
Chicago World Fair in 1893. Tesla used fluorescent

56
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,699
tubes which he bent to spell people’s names
and as a result created the first neon signs

57
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:06,250
in the world. The crowds were amazed at the
100,000 lamps switched on by the president

58
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,589
and Tesla himself wowed the crowds by firing
lightning bolts from his coils.

59
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:15,799
Seeing that alternating current was the future
of electricity, J.P. Morgan tried to strike

60
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,569
a deal with Westinghouse to control the electricity
but the offer was rejected. Morgan responded

61
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:26,960
by spreading rumours about Westinghouse’s
company which led it to near bankruptcy. On

62
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,318
hearing this, Tesla spoke to Westinghouse
saying that the $1 million he owed him in

63
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,770
royalties and any future royalties could be
waved and this allowed Westinghouse to stay

64
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:40,639
in business. If Tesla has received all the
royalties owed to him in his lifetime, he

65
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,168
would have been the world’s first billionaire.
Further work from Tesla led to him inventing

66
00:05:46,168 --> 00:05:51,990
spark plugs for engines and in 1898 he discovered
a way to remotely control machines using radio

67
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,829
waves. He demonstrated this by driving a small
boat remotely, causing people to think he

68
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:02,329
was controlling it with his mind. Another
time the people did not believe him was when

69
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:06,948
his powerful radio receiver picked up strange
signals that he concluded were communications

70
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:11,689
from the stars.
Tesla’s genius and ability to think big

71
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:16,478
meant that many others could not comprehend
some of the plans he had for the future. In

72
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:22,370
1900 he wrote an article for a magazine stating
his objectives to tap into the sun’s energy,

73
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:27,199
control the weather with electricity, use
machines to make war impossible, transmit

74
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,728
power and radio signals around the world wirelessly,
participate in interplanetary communications

75
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:38,659
and build robots that could behave independently
of any operators. The most amazing piece of

76
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,539
the article claimed that as well as believing
all this could be accomplished, he already

77
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:47,550
knew how to do it.
Tesla was again contacted by J.P. Morgan who

78
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:53,509
wanted him to build a worldwide wireless communication
system. Tesla agreed to work with Morgan who

79
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:57,658
loaned him money to build a power station
and equipment but the money ran out before

80
00:06:57,658 --> 00:07:02,579
Tesla’s complex designs were completed and
the facility was shut down leaving Tesla bankrupt

81
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:08,209
due to taxes he owed. He spent much of his
time after this nursing injured pigeons to

82
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:13,709
health in New York parks and the public thought
he’d lost his mind.

83
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:18,519
In the First World War, Tesla proposed using
radio waves to detect German U-boats and other

84
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:23,709
ships. His ideas were again described as absurd
and the world had to wait nearly twenty years

85
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,219
before radar was invented, using Tesla’s
principles.

86
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:34,470
In 1928 at 72 years of age, Tesla received
his last patent, this time for Equipment for

87
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:40,190
aerial transportation. He had designed a flying
machine that was a cross between a helicopter

88
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:44,969
and aeroplane that could take off vertically
and then swivel its engines to fly horizontally.

89
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:49,699
Unfortunately, Tesla did not have the funds
to build any sort of prototype but it was

90
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:54,189
a precursor for what is now known as Vertical
Short Take-off and Landing planes such as

91
00:07:54,189 --> 00:08:00,729
the Harrier Jump Jet or the F-35.
At the age of 75, Tesla claimed to have discovered

92
00:08:00,728 --> 00:08:05,408
a new source of energy. The following year
he was commissioned to build an electric motor

93
00:08:05,408 --> 00:08:11,639
for a car. He built a black box 40 inches
by 30 inches in size, connected to a small

94
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:18,329
12-volt battery. The car reached speeds of
90mph in testing but Tesla did not allow anyone

95
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:23,990
to inspect the black box. After claims of
some sort of black magic from the public,

96
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:29,038
Tesla returned to New York City with his box
and didn’t mention it again.

97
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:34,610
Tesla then focused on creating a super weapon
to end war. It consisted of an invisible wall

98
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,009
that sent concentrated particle beams through
the air. It was claimed that it could bring

99
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:45,990
down 10,000 aeroplanes from a distance of
250 miles. After more criticism for Tesla

100
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,769
and little interest in funding for a prototype,
he decided to send the plans to allied nations

101
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:56,629
prior to the Second World War. No one wanted
to fund the project but the USSR did test

102
00:08:56,629 --> 00:09:02,120
part of Tesla’s plan and sent him a cheque
for $25,000 despite not revealing details

103
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,940
of their tests or taking the work any further.
In 1937, Tesla claimed to have finalised a

104
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,860
dynamic theory of gravity while also criticizing
Einstein’s theory of relativity but ultimately

105
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:22,050
it was never revealed to the world. On 5th
January 1943, Tesla put the “do not disturb”

106
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:26,708
sign on his hotel room door in New York and
two days later was discovered passed away

107
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:33,719
in his bed due to a blood clot in his heart.
He was 86. The FBI ordered Tesla’s belongings

108
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,550
to be seized and many of his papers were pronounced
top secret.

109
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:43,338
In his lifetime Tesla received over 800 patents
and was the inventor of several inventions

110
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:49,240
that changed the world. He was a true visionary,
far ahead of his time and his ground-breaking

111
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,759
scientific discoveries indicate just what
a genius he was.
