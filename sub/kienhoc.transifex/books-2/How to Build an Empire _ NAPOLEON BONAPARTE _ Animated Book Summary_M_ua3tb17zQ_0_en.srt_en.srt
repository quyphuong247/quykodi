1
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,320
Napoleon Bonaparte was powerful for only a
decade and a half but his impact lasted until

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,599
near the end of the 20th century, nearly 200
years after he died.

3
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:31,390
He was born on 15th August 1769 on the island
of Corsica, the second of eight children.

4
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:37,350
At the age of ten, Napoleon and his older
brother Joseph left for mainland France. They

5
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,469
spent a year at a preparatory school in Autun,
followed by five years at military college

6
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:47,558
and a year at the officer academy in Paris.
By the end of these seven years, Bonaparte

7
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:52,750
was a professional French soldier.
His brother left to become a lawyer but Napoleon

8
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,219
became a second lieutenant in the artillery
regiment. Their father died when they were

9
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:00,070
young and Napoleon aged only 15 took over
as head of the family.

10
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:07,879
He had a talent for mathematics and was a
great map reader. These talents made him not

11
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:15,079
only a tactician, but a strategist. He became
first lieutenant in 1791. He read intensively

12
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:20,370
whilst in the artillery, including Plato’s
Republic. He also read biographies and books

13
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:25,439
on histories – English history in particular
– as he believed it to be a successful country.

14
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,579
During the start of the French Revolution,
Bonaparte was promoted to Captain and then

15
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:36,459
skipped the ranks of Major and Colonel to
be promoted to Brigadier after showing intelligence

16
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:41,419
and courage in equal parts whilst reorganising
the artillery in Toulon for the French Republic

17
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:46,960
against the Royalists.
In a battle called 13 Vendémiaire, Bonaparte

18
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,109
quelled a Royalist revolt using cannons and
the victory led to him becoming Commander

19
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:57,069
in chief of the interior troops and in command
of the Italian Army too. This led to his invasion

20
00:01:57,069 --> 00:02:03,309
of Italy in 1796 which was his first strategic
campaign. It was a military triumph despite

21
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:08,439
limited resources.
Aged 28, he was now seen as the most powerful

22
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:13,969
man in the Republic in military terms but
somewhat of a loose cannon. Therefore politicians

23
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:19,310
wanted to keep him away from the capital,
Paris. He hatched a plan that appealed to

24
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,539
everybody: the conquest of the Orient. He
wanted to play a modern Alexander the Great

25
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:29,798
and acquire provinces heading east.
His expedition to Egypt managed to avoid Lord

26
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:33,938
Nelson of Britain, who was commanding the
Mediterranean and they captured a fortress

27
00:02:33,938 --> 00:02:38,870
and naval base in Malta before putting the
island under French rule in less than a week.

28
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:45,989
They continued onto Alexandria in Egypt and
took it on 2nd July 1798. Then they marched

29
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:51,539
south to Cairo before Bonaparte declared himself
overall ruler of Egypt.

30
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,489
Meanwhile Nelson had destroyed the entire
French fleet in the harbour in Alexandria

31
00:02:55,489 --> 00:03:01,859
leaving Bonaparte’s army marooned and Turkey
also declared war on him. Bonaparte responded

32
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:08,519
aggressively by invading Syria and taking
Gaza. However, he failed to take Acre in Turkey,

33
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:14,450
his first major military defeat and decided
to return to Egypt and then France.

34
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:18,459
After travelling to Paris he took part in
a coup where he implemented the forceful side

35
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:24,019
of matters. After the coup was successful,
he made himself Consul for Life on 4th August

36
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:31,879
1802 and Emperor on 18th May 1804. He justified
his vast power by personally leading an army

37
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:37,408
back to Italy which had been partly re-conquered
by the Austrians, and retook it.

38
00:03:37,408 --> 00:03:43,179
Bonaparte was now Emperor and a dictator with
the title of Napoleon I. A new constitution

39
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,659
was published and he was the first dictator
to produce fake election figures. His coronation

40
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:54,729
was staged on 2nd December 1804 at Notre Dame.
One of Napoleon’s greatest victories was

41
00:03:54,729 --> 00:04:01,090
the Battle of Austerlitz on 2nd December 1805,
which saw French troops in Austria under Bonaparte’s

42
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:06,209
personal command take on the main armies of
Russia and Austria, who had joined forces.

43
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:14,449
The opposition had 90,000 men and 280 guns
whilst Bonaparte had 73,000 men and 139 guns,

44
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:18,549
however he made the allied command believe
he had only 40,000 men and they let him take

45
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:23,859
up a defensive position. Bonaparte’s triumph
was down to three reasons:

46
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:30,930
1. Complete unity of command. The opposition
had authority divided, not allowing a unified

47
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:37,199
tactical plan to be carried out.
2. The poor conditions meant orders were misunderstood

48
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,129
or miscarried but less so by the French as
Bonaparte knew exactly what he was doing.

49
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:48,930
3. French units operated more efficiently.
The artillery were particularly resourceful,

50
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,639
firing red hot shot onto the frozen ponds
Russians were trying to escape over, causing

51
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:59,939
the ice to break and 2,000 Russians to drown.
All in all this resulted in 27,000 losses

52
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:05,889
for the allies and only 9,000 for the French.
Austria agreed to peace soon after.

53
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:11,360
There were further battles with Prussia and
Russia in 1806 and decisive victories for

54
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,110
the French forced both Prussia and Russia
to sign a peace treaty in 1807. This left

55
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,629
Britain as Bonaparte’s only opponent. As
a military man, Bonaparte enjoyed extraordinary

56
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:26,879
success.
Bonaparte was married twice in his life. His

57
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:32,080
first wife, Josephine, was older than him
and infertile. Because of this he divorced

58
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:38,448
her and married Marie-Louise, who bore him
a son, Napoleon II who briefly succeeded him.

59
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:42,620
However his heir came late in his life and
therefore he did not treat his empire as a

60
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:47,668
long term investment up to that point. He
was quick at overturning governments and setting

61
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:52,459
up new administrations but none lasted more
than a few years.

62
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:57,430
The most successful aspect of his dictatorship
was his promotion of French culture. With

63
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:02,079
the help of key men in his empire, he restored
France’s reputation as a leading producer

64
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,978
of luxury goods and vast amounts of money
was spent on sprucing up Paris, which was

65
00:06:06,978 --> 00:06:12,288
designated as the capital of civilisation.
Bonaparte’s downfall began as a result of

66
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:17,848
Britain not willing to accept his conquests
as legitimate. Their navy blockaded French

67
00:06:17,848 --> 00:06:24,050
empire ports and stopped any contraband goods
arriving or leaving the ports. Bonaparte hit

68
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,408
back by laying down decrees excluding British
goods and services from the French empire

69
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:34,319
and wherever France held influence. Governments
not directly controlled by France made little

70
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,840
to no effort to enforce these decrees which
angered Bonaparte and led him into two wars

71
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:43,750
against the Spanish and the Russians.
The reasons both wars were huge failures for

72
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,810
Bonaparte were both country’s climate, lack
of roads and bridges over rivers and small

73
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:53,658
economies that couldn’t support unsupplied
armies. Harsh summers and winters made life

74
00:06:53,658 --> 00:06:59,139
tough for troops without barracks.
In Spain, despite taking Madrid, uprisings

75
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:05,110
meant a large occupying army would be permanently
required. Bonaparte poured more troops in

76
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:11,249
and beat the Spanish army several times but
soon his troops had no food and no supplies.

77
00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:16,300
By January 1809 Bonaparte had had enough of
Spain and returned to other business in his

78
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,658
empire. The occupation of Spain was a failure
and was one of the reasons he instead began

79
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:27,870
a war against Russia, to compensate.
In January 1812, he began to mobilise a European

80
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:34,978
army, with troops from Germany, Italy, Poland,
Hungary, Austria, Bavaria, Netherlands and

81
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:41,218
Switzerland. He could call on 650,000 troops,
but the size of his army was its weakness,

82
00:07:41,218 --> 00:07:45,788
taking eight days to pass a particular point
and stretching out between 50-100km making

83
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:50,509
it an easy target.
The Russian plains in the summer were extremely

84
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:55,098
hot and marching through them caused thirst
and disease and halved the army’s effective

85
00:07:55,098 --> 00:08:00,079
strength. Both the Russian and the French
sides took heavy losses in a battle 80 miles

86
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:05,709
from Moscow. The Russians retreated and the
French moved in on Moscow on 14th September

87
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:12,348
1812, looting the Kremlin. With the heavy
winter snow imminent, Bonaparte could not

88
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:18,228
keep the route to Moscow open and retreated.
He was down to 95,000 troops and the majority

89
00:08:18,228 --> 00:08:24,310
of his horses were dead. The Russians counterattacked
and on 5th December, Bonaparte announced he

90
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:30,519
was off to Paris to secure the regime, leaving
his army and returning in only 13 days.

91
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:38,218
In March 1813, Prussia declared war on Bonaparte.
The Pope was the next ally to desert. The

92
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,849
Spanish army was under British control and
was threatening to turn the French out and

93
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:47,330
invade France. Along with a deteriorating
French army due to the many experienced officers

94
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:52,639
and fine horses lost in Russia, these were
some of the reasons for the downfall of Bonaparte.

95
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:58,870
He began a war for Germany but after a couple
of early victories refused to make peace.

96
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:05,169
Austria declared war on Bonaparte in August
1813. This led to the Battle of Leipzig fought

97
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:13,829
between 16th-19th October 1813. Bonaparte
had 180,000 men. The Austrians, Prussians,

98
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:20,070
Russians and others in the area had 350,000.
Bonaparte was forced to withdraw with heavy

99
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:25,210
losses and many of his troops surrendering
or fleeing too. The French empire dissolved

100
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:30,600
in ruin and Bonaparte now had to fight on
French soil. French public opinion turned

101
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:37,259
against him. On 6th April 1814, Bonaparte
formally abdicated the thrones of France and

102
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:42,639
Italy. He was then offered a small kingdom
in Elba which he took, sailing to the island

103
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:50,179
on 28th April. He had gone from ruling 80
million people to a territory of about 25,000.

104
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:54,939
A combination of boredom, financial problems
and the failure of the French royalty to strike

105
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:59,440
any sort of rapport with the French people
convinced Bonaparte to make a comeback and

106
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:06,870
return to France. This he did on 26th February
1815, arriving in Paris on 20th March. He

107
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,840
had gathered support and troops en route and
as a result, the Royalty had left Paris the

108
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,519
day before.
The rest of Europe immediately formed a ‘stop

109
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,949
Bonaparte’ coalition with the Duke of Wellington
in charge. Bonaparte moved his army north

110
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:25,690
and clashed with Wellington’s allied army
and the Prussian’s army. This culminated

111
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:29,820
with the Battle of Waterloo where Wellington’s
army stayed resolute in defence for the whole

112
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:36,420
day before attacking in the evening. By 9pm
it was all over. The battle had brought an

113
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:42,829
end to the Napoleonic and revolutionary period.
Bonaparte abdicated on 21st June and gave

114
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:48,000
himself up to the British in July. He was
sent to the prison-island Saint Helena on

115
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,370
17th October 1815, aged 45. He lived on the
island for six years, dying on 17th March

116
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,580
1821.
Soon after his death a myth emerged Bonaparte

117
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:05,889
was a model ruler and a victorious soldier.
The truth is that he was one of the greatest

118
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:10,120
commanders in history whose military campaigns
are still studied to this day.
