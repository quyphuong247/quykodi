1
00:00:15,138 --> 00:00:21,809
Sam Walton built a business which now has
over 11,000 stores in more than 28 countries.

2
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:26,918
How did he build the world’s largest company
in terms of revenue, in the world?

3
00:00:26,919 --> 00:00:31,528
Founded over 50 years ago, Sam had many personal
traits that helped Walmart grow from a single

4
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:37,549
store to the largest retail outfit there is.
He was not reflective, there was no dwelling

5
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:43,128
in the past. The motivation for him was not
money, but he was motivated to be top of the

6
00:00:43,128 --> 00:00:48,179
heap. The number one element that made a difference
to Walmart was his passion to compete. This

7
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:52,869
passion kept him constantly on the go and
kept him looking ahead at all times… usually

8
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:59,768
looking ahead to the next store opening.
This is the unique story of Walmart.

9
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:04,879
Many of the individual qualities Sam spoke
about helped him to achieve what may seem

10
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:11,399
impossible to some people. Risk, entrepreneurship,
hard work, knowing where you want to go and

11
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:16,269
being willing to do what it takes to get there.
Believing in your idea even when others don’t.

12
00:01:16,269 --> 00:01:20,908
Sticking to your guns.
He believed there is no limit to what ordinary

13
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:26,140
people can achieve if given the opportunity,
encouragement and incentive to do their best.

14
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:31,659
So how did Sam Walton begin? He grew up during
the great depression and started selling magazine

15
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:37,090
subscriptions at around 7 or 8 years old.
It taught him the value of money: how much

16
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,368
hard work it took to get it and that when
you did it was worth something.

17
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:46,420
When it came to Walmart he readily admits
he was cheap. He’d stay at lower end hotels,

18
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:53,149
two to a room and eat at family restaurants.
Why? Every time Walmart spends a dollar foolishly,

19
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:58,670
it comes out of the customers’ pocket. Every
dollar saved puts Walmart one more step ahead

20
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,899
of the competition.
He had high drive and ambition. His mother

21
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:07,978
instilled the belief in him to try to be the
best he could at whatever he did. Consequently

22
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:11,109
he set high personal goals with a strong bias
towards action.

23
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:16,870
At a young age he learnt an early secret to
leadership: speak to people walking past you

24
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,560
before they speak to you. This simple but
effective technique was used later when he

25
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,939
introduced greeters to all his stores.
From a financial point of view, here’s a

26
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:32,530
key story on ‘how Walmart did it’:
If you buy an item to sell in a store for

27
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,870
80 cents, pricing it at $1 could sell three
times more than pricing it at $1.20. This

28
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:44,289
means that you’ll get half the profit per
item but a greater overall profit. This is

29
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,019
simple economics but the essence of discounting:
you cut your price to boost your sales to

30
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:53,739
a point where you earn more at the cheaper
retail price than by selling the item at the

31
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:59,789
higher price.
Sam’s first store had a lot of experimenting.

32
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:05,239
Even when business was good, he constantly
fiddled and meddled. This contributed to Walmart’s

33
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:10,640
later success. Every crazy thing tried didn’t
turn out well but he didn’t make any mistakes

34
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:16,079
that couldn’t be corrected quickly and none
were big enough to threaten his business.

35
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,430
After traveling on an all-night bus journey
to visit and observe two other stores and

36
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,280
how they ran their business, Sam’s next
store introduced checkout registers at the

37
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,439
front after seeing them work effectively.
Self-service replaced the clerks and cash

38
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,810
registers around the store commonly seen up
until then.

39
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:38,299
Soon he opened a second store and continued
innovating, experimenting and expanding. He

40
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:42,269
nosed around other stores looking for good
talent, luring them over with an offer to

41
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:46,870
earn a percentage of the profits and the option
of partnership. Colleagues have said that

42
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:51,730
he’s less afraid of being wrong than anyone
else they knew. Once he was wrong he just

43
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:55,908
headed in a different direction. He was always
looking for ideas and items to make his stores

44
00:03:55,908 --> 00:04:00,989
stand out.
Sam would drive to check out new locations

45
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:06,950
to build more stores to expand to. Then when
this started taking up too much of his time

46
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:10,959
and the places to see were further away, he
bought a plane and flew there.

47
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,158
Any money made in one store was put into another
one which led to rapid expansion. Up until

48
00:04:16,158 --> 00:04:20,129
this point all the stores were variety stores
that were franchises but after travelling

49
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:24,769
and observing competitors, Sam could see that
discounting was the future and opened his

50
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:31,240
first larger discount store called Walmart
in 1962. This was quickly followed by a couple

51
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,139
more. The stores were not attractive to look
at and highly promotional but sold merchandise

52
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:41,000
cheaper than others. Sam was experimenting
to see if people would shop there strictly

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,110
because of price. It turned out they would.
In the early days the focus was on low price

54
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,968
and satisfaction guaranteed. Customers could
be sure the product they bought was the cheapest

55
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:57,709
and if they didn’t like it, they could bring
it back. Mark up never went beyond a certain

56
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:03,158
percentage. It was imperative any good deal
Walmart got was passed onto the customer.

57
00:05:03,158 --> 00:05:08,209
What he initially lacked in experience and
sophistication he made up for by spending

58
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:12,588
as much time as possible checking out the
competitors. He’d tell his store managers

59
00:05:12,588 --> 00:05:17,848
not to focus on what the competition were
doing wrong but see what they were doing right.

60
00:05:17,848 --> 00:05:21,629
Any idea they got they must try to incorporate
into their own stores.

61
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:28,610
So in Sam’s eyes, what was the most important
single ingredient of Walmart’s success?

62
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,639
Taking care of the customers. If you want
the people working in your store to take care

63
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,310
of the customers, you have to make sure you’re
taking care of the people working in the store.

64
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,278
He enrolled in a computer class for retailers
and utilised them to control merchandise and

65
00:05:43,278 --> 00:05:47,550
logistics. He realised that he couldn’t
expand beyond the small amount of stores that

66
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:52,770
he had unless he had everything recorded to
control his operation. The expansion of Walmart

67
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:57,019
to what it is today would not have been possible
without the computer.

68
00:05:57,019 --> 00:06:00,838
Because of his strong belief in the company,
Sam had taken on a lot of personal debt to

69
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:04,829
expand the business. He’d borrowed as much
as he could and to continue increasing the

70
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:10,009
number of stores, the next logical step was
to take the company public which he did, issuing

71
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:17,088
stock on 1st October 1970. This reduced his
family’s ownership of Walmart to 61% but

72
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:21,449
all his personal debts were paid off and he
never had to borrow any money for Walmart

73
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:25,379
personally again.
He continued with the strategy of putting

74
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:30,699
discount stores in small towns that other
discounters were ignoring.

75
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:34,490
He called his employees, “associates”
and shared the profit of the company with

76
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,430
them. He believed the more you share with
them, the more profit the company will make,

77
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,098
due to the fact that the way management treated
associates is the way associates would treat

78
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:47,778
the customer. If the customers are treated
well, they will return again and again.

79
00:06:47,778 --> 00:06:52,250
This was one method of keeping associates
motivated and keeping them motivated will

80
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,990
allow them to do the best job possible.
He created a corporate culture within the

81
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:02,490
company that encompassed a “whistle while
you work” philosophy. He believed in doing

82
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,408
lots of work but having a good time doing
it and building spirit and excitement to keep

83
00:07:06,408 --> 00:07:10,740
people interested and make them feel part
of the family. No one was too big to be the

84
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,319
butt of the joke. In fact, Sam himself once
danced the hula in a grass skirt on Wall Street

85
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:23,098
after losing a bet.
In 1979 Walmart achieved a big milestone.

86
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:30,598
With 232 stores they had made $1billion in
sales. Around this time, Walmart participated

87
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:35,069
in acquisitions of other discount chains to
further expand their territory – in particular

88
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:44,649
the south of the USA. By 1984, there were
640 stores with sales of over $4.5billion.

89
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:48,949
Walmart is now the biggest retailer in the
world. However, in Sam’s view the bigger

90
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:54,269
Walmart got the more essential it was to think
small. They have become a huge corporation

91
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:59,399
by not acting like one. In a store they still
don’t forget to look a customer in the eye,

92
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:04,199
greet them and ask politely if they can help.
Here are some other ways to think small which

93
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:10,399
Sam implemented:
Focus on one store at a time. Each store does

94
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,689
not contain the same merchandise and the stock
is managed by the people there at the store,

95
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:20,810
not by decisions driven by the Headquarters.
Communicate. Good communication is necessary

96
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:26,769
in a big business. It allows you to spread
information that could lead to a competitive

97
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:31,870
advantage more quickly. Keep your ear to the
ground. A computer is no substitute for getting

98
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:36,120
out in the stores and finding out what’s
going on. It could tell you what you’ve

99
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,500
sold but it can’t tell you how much you
could have sold. Push responsibility and authority,

100
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:48,070
down. It gives people pride and fires them
up with ambition to move on up in the company.

101
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:53,450
Force ideas to bubble up. Invite ideas from
all colleagues. Often they are common sense

102
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,030
ideas that could save money that nobody picks
up on when they’re thinking about how big

103
00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:04,360
they are. Stay lean, fight bureaucracy. When
you grow fast, duplication builds up and there

104
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,590
will be areas of the business you no longer
need. Top management need to be constantly

105
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,810
thinking about this to ensure a sound future
for the company.

106
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:17,069
This way of thinking has allowed Walmart to
grow between annual rates of 30%-70% for the

107
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:22,610
first 30 years of its existence and then continue
to grow; leaving a legacy that changed the

108
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:35,889
way retail worked.
