1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,179
Jeffy is overweight.

2
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:08,580
& no matter how hard his friends say that
he can actually change,

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,370
he would always find ways to prove them wrong.

4
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:15,579
jeff is one of those people who think that
everyone else can do it except themselves.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:21,060
in order to elaborate this victim mentality,
we have to analyze his childhood.

6
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:25,168
IN his teenage years, Jeffy has gone through
many painful experiences.

7
00:00:25,169 --> 00:00:27,829
In highschool, he was very bad at math.

8
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:29,629
Every time he fails a math test.

9
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:33,719
His teacher would yell at him & call him a
failure in front of the whole class.

10
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,670
he would spend half an hour lecturing how
stupid jeffy is & how hilarious his exam paper

11
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,379
was.

12
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:43,509
The poor wretch would go home crying.

13
00:00:43,509 --> 00:00:47,349
As he grew up, every time he's confronted
with a challenge,

14
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,379
his brain associates it with his past painful
experiences.

15
00:00:51,378 --> 00:00:56,058
Jeffy now thinks he's unable to loose weight
because of that childhood scar.

16
00:00:56,058 --> 00:01:02,390
This is why no matter how hard his friends
contend that he can actually change, he will

17
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,370
justify his incompetence.

18
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,630
most of us have gone through the same thing.

19
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:10,429
If you were bullied as a kid, you grow up
with social anxiety.

20
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,360
If you were shamed a lot, you develop many
insecurities,

21
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:19,069
& your identity, your self image would revolve
around those insecurities.

22
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:21,429
You see the world through them.

23
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,600
the good news is, your identity is malleable.

24
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:27,959
The belief that you're unable to change is
just an illusion.

25
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,739
You can literally mold who you are into any
type of person you want.

26
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:35,879
This process entails two basic steps:

27
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:40,959
First: Realize & concede that your essence
is an empty shell.

28
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:46,019
As a little baby, you are born with no thoughts,
no beliefs, nothing.

29
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:48,089
Just utter hollowness.

30
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,640
You forgot about this truth.

31
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,650
Because these negative beliefs about yourself
are firmly ingrained through years of conditioning.

32
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,150
To reinvent your weakling self,

33
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:04,020
First, you have to reason that you were like
an empty container as child.

34
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:08,389
while growing up, you've been stuffed with
all sorts of fallacies.

35
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:11,509
through them, you've created a sense of identity.

36
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:16,209
Who you think you are feels so true to you
but scientifically speaking,

37
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:22,009
you're self-image is just a bundle of interwoven
ideas, facts, experiences.

38
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:27,378
You could've been loaded with dissimilar beliefs
& your self-image would've turned out completely

39
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:29,959
different from your current one.

40
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:31,989
But there is no time for regret.

41
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:35,209
What's important is the prospect of change.

42
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:38,120
No matter what sort of identity you have,

43
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,188
you can detangle all obsolete hard-wiring
& reinvent yourself.

44
00:02:43,188 --> 00:02:48,848
The first step is to Start perceiving your
mind as a container that can be emptied out

45
00:02:48,848 --> 00:02:51,578
& loaded with any beliefs you want.

46
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:56,780
Once you distance yourself from who you think
you are & accept that you are malleable, we

47
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,650
can then get to work.

48
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,629
Second step:

49
00:03:02,628 --> 00:03:05,429
Exploit the power of influence.

50
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,599
As a child you didn't have enough consciousness
to hamper

51
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:11,199
negativity from entering your head.

52
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,138
The fact of getting affected by your influences
was inevitable.

53
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:18,079
But now you're conscious enough to learn how
to filter

54
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,840
what you don't want to hear.

55
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,670
It's a vital skill but difficult to harness.

56
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:28,028
A great tool that will help you cultivate
this skill is brainwashing.

57
00:03:28,028 --> 00:03:33,278
You're literally going to brainwash yourself
with positive stimulus on a daily basis.

58
00:03:33,278 --> 00:03:35,028
The process is the following:

59
00:03:35,028 --> 00:03:38,650
Make it a habit to soak up self-help content.

60
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,950
Read books & biographies about successful
people.

61
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:44,369
Watch seminars, listen to audio-books wherever
you go.

62
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,658
I know this sounds platitudinous but this
is actually how change occurs.

63
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:54,759
You first identity was made through constant
exposure to negative influences.

64
00:03:54,759 --> 00:04:01,598
Likewise, your new identity is shaped through
that same process, use influences to your

65
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:02,498
advantage.

66
00:04:02,498 --> 00:04:06,658
If you look at musicians, they learn how to
play through imitation.

67
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:08,468
Self-improvement is no different than that.

68
00:04:08,468 --> 00:04:15,650
You've got all these basic pillars I.e emotional
intelligence, meditation, social skills etc.

69
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,858
When you absorb all of these & expose yourself
to them habitually.

70
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:25,709
Your current self-image will wither away,
you will literally transcend into someone

71
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:26,459
else.

72
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:28,000
So the basic gist of it:

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,410
Your self-concept is altered by influencing
the brain with beliefs that counteract the

74
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,439
old ones.

75
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:39,098
You should devote a specific time in the day
to soak up positive stimulus.

76
00:04:39,098 --> 00:04:43,159
also don't forget to Alternate between theory
& practice.

77
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,810
Reading books & watching seminars isn't enough.

78
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:51,129
you need to apply that knowledge so that it
gets firmly hard-wired into your psyche.

79
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:55,819
After a year or so, your self-image will re-enginer
itself.

80
00:04:55,819 --> 00:05:03,759
You'll literally transform from the inside
out.

81
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,030
In my humble beginnings on youtube.

82
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:08,068
With every new book I read, I would think

83
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:13,740
"oh this book is difficult to elaborate, it's
not like the other ones, I can't do this,

84
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,090
I'm not a native speaker, blba bla bla"

85
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:21,829
but when I look back now, I've always managed
somehow to write a script for every single

86
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:23,068
book i've read.

87
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:27,610
I would read it, take down notes then I'd
have to expand on them.

88
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,129
But I didn't know how I was going to it.

89
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:35,259
WHAT's intriguing however, I would start with
a blank paper, having no clue of what I'm

90
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:36,509
going to say

91
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:40,759
to writing a whole neatly organized script.

92
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:43,300
To me personally, it felt like magic.

93
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,740
in psycho-cybernetics, however, doctor Maltz
reveals plainly how this obscure phenomenon

94
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,079
works.

95
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:56,219
Remember that search engine you're using ? google
? bing or whatever.

96
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,449
well, you have a similar one inside your brain.

97
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:03,509
But your mental search engine is a thousand
times faster.

98
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:04,629
here's how it works:

99
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:07,430
When the brain is exposed to any kind of problem.

100
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,598
writing a book review for example.

101
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:12,240
your mental search engine is triggered.

102
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,930
A problem is basically unfinished information.
You have to fill in the gaps to solve it.

103
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:23,340
The second you're exposed to the task, your
search engine diagnoses the problem then scans

104
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:26,228
your memory for relevant information.

105
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:29,490
Most people get pissed off when confronted
with a challenging task

106
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,769
but what they're not aware of,

107
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:38,038
Frustration is a sign that your search engine
is trying to insert different types of data

108
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:40,228
inside the gaps of the problem.

109
00:06:40,228 --> 00:06:45,490
If something doesn't fit in, the mind will
keep scanning your memory for the right information

110
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,228
that will suddently, click.

111
00:06:48,228 --> 00:06:53,329
If you haven't yet found a solution & you're
experiencing some heavy headaches, it just

112
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,438
means your brain has to keep searching.

113
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:00,240
Retain your focus on the problem & Eventually,
the solution will pop up.

114
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,939
If you think back on your life,

115
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:04,949
there was no problem that you couldn't resolve.

116
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:07,829
You might have not found a solution to all
of them.

117
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:11,538
but you've managed somehow to ignore or get
past them.

118
00:07:11,538 --> 00:07:16,639
So the next time you're agonizing about something,
realize that you already have the solution

119
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,210
for it.

120
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:21,959
you just have to stop reacting emotionally,
and focus on fixing it.

121
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:28,658
Keep exposing the mind to the problem & in
one way or the other, something will click.

122
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:34,740
-How amazing it is to tackle any problem with
the idea in mind that you already have the

123
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,340
solution for it.

124
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:40,029
You can also rely on your search engine to
accomplish any goal.

125
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:41,799
from my personal experience.

126
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,270
The answer to how I've achieved some of my
goals is because I thought about them every

127
00:07:47,269 --> 00:07:49,079
single second.

128
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:54,968
That heightened focus on a particular task
is somewhat sufficient to make it happen.

129
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:58,718
without disregarding the critical component
of taking action of course.

130
00:07:58,718 --> 00:08:03,860
You can't just sit there, meditate on becoming
a millionaire & then somehow you're going

131
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,598
wake up with a lamborgini in your garage.

132
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:10,860
You concentrate on what you want, you work
hard,

133
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,199
and through that journey of hustling & maintaining
clean focus.

134
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,949
the mind will find lanes to clear up the way
for you.
