1
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:21,599
Alexander the Great was born in 356BCE, he
became king of Macedonia a mere twenty years

2
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:28,539
later, reigning until his death in 323BCE.
Once he was the king, he entered the territory

3
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:32,640
of the Persian Empire, leading an army and
taking control of an area of land that became

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,820
part of one of the largest empires of the
ancient world.

5
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,198
Alexander’s father, Philip II became king
of Macedonia after his brother died in battle

6
00:00:41,198 --> 00:00:46,920
against an invading army. Macedonia was at
the time an empire roughly the size of Yorkshire

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,460
in England or New Jersey in the United States,
but it was penned in by potential enemies

8
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,460
on all sides.
In less than three years using a combination

9
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,829
of diplomacy, military reorganisation and
a lot of skill, king Philip transformed Macedonia’s

10
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:05,718
fortunes and expanded his empire into Greece.
After increasing the number of troops in his

11
00:01:05,718 --> 00:01:10,949
empire, 10,000 men crossed from Europe into
Asia under his rule, with the aim of attacking

12
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,280
the Persians.
Alexander’s mother was Olympias. She gave

13
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,040
birth to Alexander while his father was fighting
against various Greek cities. Alexander was

14
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,950
educated under the guidance of the philosopher,
Aristotle.

15
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:28,700
Alexander was at his sister’s wedding in
Macedon and during a festival to celebrate

16
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,629
the wedding afterwards, his father king Philip
was killed. The assassin was one of Philip’s

17
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:39,359
bodyguards. He was arrested and then executed.
It meant Alexander became king of Macedon

18
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,099
and leader of the Greek expedition to gain
revenge against the Persians for previous

19
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:47,780
destruction they had caused.
His time in power consisted of near constant

20
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:53,049
military campaigning. First, he dealt with
uprisings in the west and northeast of Macedonia

21
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:58,920
itself. Then he attacked the Greek city, Thebes.
Later he moved into Asia and fought three

22
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,740
large battles against the Persians, one against
the Indians and other battles in Afghanistan

23
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:10,060
and Pakistan. In all his battles, he was always
triumphant and therefore, undefeated.

24
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,989
When beginning his campaign in Asia he joined
up with the force his father had sent over

25
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:17,579
two years prior.
The Persian army was thought to consist of

26
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:21,450
just under 100,000 men, although estimates
range greatly.

27
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:25,828
Prior to the battle of the Granicus River,
Alexander had marched from Troy where he’d

28
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:30,930
visited Achilles’ tomb. Alexander claimed
to be a descendant of Achilles and he took

29
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,099
from the tomb a shield used in the Trojan
War.

30
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:39,878
In late 332BCE, Alexander entered Egypt without
any resistance from the Persian governor,

31
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:45,408
who had too few soldiers at his disposal.
Legend has it that Alexander founded the city

32
00:02:45,408 --> 00:02:49,929
of Alexandria, which later became one of the
most important cities in the world in Roman

33
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,629
times. However, it is more likely to have
been formed shortly after his death, despite

34
00:02:54,628 --> 00:02:58,039
bearing his name.
Whilst in Egypt, Alexander visited the oracle

35
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:02,789
at the temple of Amun. He asked the oracle
if he would rule the world. The response from

36
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:06,729
the oracle was positive.
Drawings that have been discovered in the

37
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:11,238
temples in Egypt depict Alexander as a pharaoh
and described him as king of Egypt.

38
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:19,838
On 1st October 331BCE, Alexander defeated
the king of Persia, Darius III for the second

39
00:03:19,838 --> 00:03:24,799
occasion. This time it was at Gaugamela which
is near to where the city of Mosul in Iraq

40
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,870
stands in the present day. In doing so, it
gave Alexander rule over Asia.

41
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,699
When travelling through the world, Alexander
adapted and took on the role as leader of

42
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:39,439
a particular region according to the traditions
and protocols of that land. This included

43
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:42,739
everything from how he behaved, to how he
dressed.

44
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:47,528
Alexander had several wives, including the
daughter of Darius III. He used marriage as

45
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:51,259
a way of maintaining relationships with his
empire’s neighbours and to connect him with

46
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:58,068
families of previous kings and rulers.
In spring 330BCE, Alexander set off on a new

47
00:03:58,068 --> 00:04:03,128
campaign into the eastern parts of his empire
that would go on to last five years. He travelled

48
00:04:03,128 --> 00:04:08,308
into Afghanistan, initially to stop Darius
III from raising new forces. He initially

49
00:04:08,308 --> 00:04:13,639
had difficulty bringing the area under control,
but eventually did so. He continued further

50
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:18,060
east into what is now Pakistan and got to
a point where, according to frequently told

51
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,699
stories, his soldiers refused to accompany
him any further. Instead, he travelled south,

52
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:28,930
all the way to the Indian Ocean, which marked
an end to his successful campaign.

53
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:35,139
On his way back, Alexander returned to Babylon
in spring 323BCE, where he would eventually

54
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:39,430
die. He caught a fever and spent the last
few days of his life lying down whilst still

55
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,990
giving orders, before finally losing the ability
to speak. He is remembered as a creator of

56
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,079
one of the largest empires of the ancient
world, who was undefeated in battle and is

57
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:52,618
widely considered one of history's most successful
military commanders.
