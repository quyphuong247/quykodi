00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:12,939
Einstein’s Cosmos: How Albert Einstein’s
Vision Transformed Our Understanding of Space

2
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:19,210
and Time by Michio Kaku
If you ask somebody to name a genius, the

3
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,260
first name that would come to many people’s
mind is Albert Einstein. As well as being

4
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,368
one of the greatest scientists of all time,
he is now probably the most recognisable,

5
00:00:27,368 --> 00:00:32,689
but it is his contributions that he should
be most remembered for. His profound theories

6
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:38,320
and predictions led him to be named Time magazine’s
Person of the Century and many Nobel Prizes

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,558
are being won in the present day by scientists
proving the existence of things predicted

8
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:47,588
by Einstein nearly 100 years ago.
This book focuses on the pioneering work of

9
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:52,079
Einstein and describes the thinking process
behind some of his greatest achievements.

10
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,109
A notable personality trait of Einstein that
many people referred to was his humanity.

11
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,429
He was a lovable character who spoke in the
same way to beggars as he did to royalty and

12
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:09,680
was as gracious to children as he was to adults.
Albert Einstein was born on the 14th March

13
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,430
1879 in the city of Ulm in Germany, but was
brought up in Munich along with his younger

14
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,360
sister. His mother was cultured and encouraged
a young Albert to take up playing the violin,

15
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:25,280
something he enjoyed all his life.
At a young age he discovered magnetism and

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,030
became fascinated by invisible forces making
objects move. His father gave him a compass

17
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,609
when he was four or five years old and it
left a lasting impression on him.

18
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:39,379
From the age of eleven he became staunchly
religious practising the Jewish faith for

19
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:44,170
a short time but that soon changed when he
realised that science and religion collided

20
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:50,129
with many miracles defying the laws of science.
However, his brief liaison with religion led

21
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:54,310
him to appreciate the limitations of science
and human understanding.

22
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:59,670
He soon developed a passion for Geometry,
Mathematics and Philosophy, rarely playing

23
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,740
with friends his own age and but for the occasional
distraction of music, always reading. The

24
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:10,689
philosopher Kant influenced him greatly, for
example Einstein believed throughout his life

25
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:13,568
that world government was a way to end all
wars.

26
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:19,878
As a teenager, Einstein went to school in
Zurich, Switzerland. He enjoyed his time there

27
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:24,548
and would eventually become a Swiss citizen.
Here he changed from being introverted and

28
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:32,780
withdrawn to mature and independent. In 1895
he wrote his first scientific paper. Einstein’s

29
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,919
thinking was often in terms of simple physical
pictures rather than complex mathematics,

30
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:42,309
such as trains, clocks and rockets. He believed
that aside from their mathematical expression,

31
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,789
“All physical theories… ought to lend
themselves to so simple a description that

32
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:52,718
even a child could understand”.
In 1900 Einstein graduated with a degree in

33
00:02:52,718 --> 00:02:57,539
Physics and Mathematics. After struggling
financially and only finding some temporary

34
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:02,449
low paid teaching jobs, Einstein eventually
got a job as a civil servant, working as a

35
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:09,238
technical expert in the Bern Patent Office.
In January 1903, Einstein married Mileva,

36
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,459
a Serbian woman who was in the same class
as him when he was studying for his degree.

37
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:20,109
The following year they had a son called Hans.
In his job Einstein could often finish his

38
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:25,200
work, which involved finding the principles
underlying each invention, quickly. This left

39
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,709
him lots of time to daydream and think about
physics in the quiet confines of his office.

40
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:35,158
He wrestled with the two great theories of
physics at the time: Sir Isaac Newton’s

41
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:40,120
theory of forces where he thought space and
time were absolute and James Clerk Maxwell’s

42
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,980
theory of fields and light where the speed
of light was constant. Einstein thought they

43
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:50,818
were incompatible and contradicted each other.
When he was travelling home one night, he

44
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:55,479
looked at the clock tower in Bern and imagined
racing away in the car at the speed of light.

45
00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:00,108
He realised that the clock in the tower would
appear stopped as light cannot catch up to

46
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:05,400
the car but the clock in the car would tick
normally. He then understood that time can

47
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,760
move at different rates throughout the universe,
dependant on how quickly you’re moving.

48
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:15,158
He had arrived at his theory of relativity
and thus proving Maxwell’s theory correct

49
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:21,370
and Newton’s flawed. He wrote a paper on
the subject and those 31 handwritten pages

50
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:28,090
changed the history of the world.
Later in 1905, Einstein went one step further.

51
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:33,049
He stated that if clocks and rulers became
distorted the faster you moved, then everything

52
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:38,379
measured with clocks and rulers must also
change. This included energy and matter, which

53
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:45,259
are interchangeable. For example, the faster
an object moves, the more it’s mass increases.

54
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:51,529
By calculating how much energy was being converted
into mass, you could show that E=mc2, the

55
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:56,779
most famous equation of all time.
Further articles written that year by Einstein

56
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:02,059
on a quantum theory of light and proving the
existence of atoms led to 1905 being dubbed

57
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:07,110
an “extraordinary year”. All four papers
substantially contributed to the foundation

58
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,819
of modern physics and Einstein got his Ph.D.
from the University of Zurich the following

59
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:18,599
year, making him Dr. Einstein. Future experiments
provided evidence to confirm his ideas and

60
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:25,629
his recognition grew. He returned to the University
of Zurich later as a professor. Einstein had

61
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:30,509
a second son but his work caused him to become
estranged from his wife and children and she

62
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:35,439
left him while he was a director of the institute
of physics at Berlin University, the finest

63
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:41,129
research centre in Germany which in turn was
leading the world’s research in physics.

64
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:45,449
Einstein wanted to build on what he now called
his special theory of relativity as it did

65
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:51,519
not take into account gravity or the acceleration
of items. He published his general theory

66
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:58,039
of relativity in 1915 after years of exhaustive
work. This coupled with the stresses of the

67
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,410
outbreak of the First World War (which he
had strong objections to as a pacifist) led

68
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:09,060
to him collapsing in 1917 and near a breakdown.
He was diagnosed with a stomach ulcer and

69
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,089
advised to rest completely. He was nursed
back to health by his cousin, Elsa whom he

70
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:18,889
married in 1919.
Einstein’s latest work had moved him from

71
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:23,810
a prominent professor to a world figure, with
his gravitational-related discoveries viewed

72
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:29,399
as the greatest since Newton’s. He was rightly
viewed as a genius and nearly every newspaper

73
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:35,239
in the world wanted to interview him. Unfortunately,
as his popularity grew, so did the amount

74
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,439
of people trying to disprove his theory of
relativity. He decided to use his new found

75
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:46,949
fame to promote his other causes too, specifically
peace and Zionism. He went on a tour of America

76
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:52,149
to do just that. From there he travelled to
England and paid his respects to Sir Isaac

77
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:57,609
Newton by laying a wreath on his grave in
Westminster Abbey. From there he travelled

78
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:02,780
to Paris but with a growing rise in anti-Semitism
on the continent, and after receiving multiple

79
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:08,629
death threats, went on another tour, this
time heading East, to Japan and China.

80
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:12,810
It was while travelling to his latest tour
that Einstein received word he’d won the

81
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:18,819
Nobel Prize in physics. He gave the prize
money to his ex-wife as part of the divorce

82
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:23,029
settlement. Einstein had learnt his lesson
not to neglect his wife and took his current

83
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:28,699
wife, Elsa, with him to meet famous people
including celebrities and royalty. However,

84
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:33,079
despite now fully surrounded by the media
circus, he never lost focus and continued

85
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:39,029
his work analysing the laws of the universe.
He formulated his theory of gravity but then

86
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:44,269
moved onto an altogether more ambitious project:
the unified field theory, which would unify

87
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:48,279
his theory of gravity with Maxwell’s theory
of electromagnetism.

88
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:55,459
At the end of 1932, due to the rise of Nazism,
Einstein left Germany. When they took power

89
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:59,620
early the following year, they confiscated
his house and bank account, leaving Einstein

90
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:06,079
penniless. Many of his Jewish colleagues also
fled. Without a home, Einstein visited Sir

91
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,419
Winston Churchill in England. He received
several job offers from leading universities

92
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:16,410
and decided to move to America, becoming a
professor at Princeton University. While at

93
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:21,360
Princeton, Einstein investigated whether the
creation of an atomic bomb was possible. He

94
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,930
concluded it was, but when the Manhattan Engineering
Project was set up in 1941 and many of the

95
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:31,310
top scientists were contacted to work towards
the creation of such a bomb, Einstein was

96
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:37,129
left out. Declassified war documents show
that the FBI concluded that he could not be

97
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:41,700
trusted, due to his background and his relative
short stay in America.

98
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:47,050
During this time, Einstein began to age significantly;
he was affected deeply by the death of his

99
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:52,579
wife Elsa in 1936 and continued to work on
his unified field theory without ultimate

100
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:59,430
success. Even after his 70th birthday in 1949
he still lacked a guiding principle or physical

101
00:08:59,429 --> 00:09:04,829
picture that would light the way to his theory
and he struggled on the subject for over 30

102
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,379
years.
In 1952 after the president of Israel had

103
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:13,620
died, Einstein was offered the presidency
but declined. With his health deteriorating,

104
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:19,679
on the 18th April 1955, Albert Einstein passed
away.

105
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:25,089
Einstein’s legacy is a prophetic one as
many of his predictions such as the black

106
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:30,730
hole, have been proven to exist thanks to
modern experimentation methods. In 2002 it

107
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:36,180
was shown that a black hole exists in our
very own milky way galaxy. Even his work on

108
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:42,229
the unified field theory is being revisited
to this day thanks to the superstring theory.

109
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:46,509
Albert Einstein’s theories have revolutionised
our understanding of the universe and his

110
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:51,559
work has inspired many future generations
of physicists, astronomers and philosophers.
