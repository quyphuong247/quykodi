1
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,460
So every time I criticize how poor people
think,

2
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,189
people get really angry at me and tell me
that I shouldn't hate poor people.

3
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:21,469
And I'm like,
"Are you out of your mind?"

4
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:25,460
I don't hate poor people.
I was poor for the majority of my life.

5
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,469
And when I say poor,
I mean poorer than 99% of people watching

6
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:31,919
this.
I don't want to hear this bullshit of how

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,219
I hate poor people.
But what I do hate with my entire being

8
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:40,329
is the poor person mentality.
I hate it and I always have.

9
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:45,058
And that is exactly why I'm not
in that dark financial position anymore.

10
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:48,719
If you think like a poor person,
you're always going to be poor.

11
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,558
You need to change your mindset.
So here are some of the ideas

12
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:54,308
that really resonated with me from this book...

13
00:00:54,308 --> 00:00:59,018
4. Rich people think big.
Poor people think small.

14
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:01,478
Do you ever walk into a store
and spend a lot of time

15
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:05,890
making sure you get the best deals?
That's how a poor person thinks...

16
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:11,079
I'm going to spend an extra hour in here
so I can find a box of cereal that's cheaper

17
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:14,368
and save 30 cents on it.
And that's what he's going to do

18
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:16,299
for the rest of his life.

19
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:19,000
What does a rich person think?
Who cares?!

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,629
I'm not worried about this,
I'm worried about cultivating my value,

21
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:27,699
so an hour of my time can be worth a $1,000
instead of $3.48.

22
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:34,429
5. Rich people focus on opportunities.
Poor people focus on obstacles.

23
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:38,189
This is how a poor person thinks,
"Well, I would start this business,

24
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:42,008
but there's a lot of competition.
It probably wouldn't work."

25
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:45,840
A rich person would acknowledge the competition,
but at the same time focus on,

26
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,590
"Well, but is there any unique value
I can bring to the market

27
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,299
that's currently not there?"

28
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:57,409
6. Rich people admire other rich and successful
people.

29
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:00,899
Poor people resent rich and successful people.

30
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,998
This is a huge one.
I remember when I was little,

31
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:06,658
a nice car would drive by.
And everyone would say something like,

32
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,060
"Uh, look at that douchebag."
"Look at that douchebag."

33
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,959
"I wonder how many babies he had to kill to
buy that car."

34
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,300
And I never really felt that way.
I thought,

35
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,640
"I'm happy that guy has a nice car."
I'm going to grow up, and if I want a nice

36
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,109
car myself,
instead of bitching about it,

37
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,140
I'm going to pick up a book and learn how.

38
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:28,399
And this doesn't even have to do with money
specifically.

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,500
Poor people have a broken life ideology in
general,

40
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,110
and not having money is just one of the manifestations
of that.

41
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,610
It's like when a skinny fat person walks into
a gym

42
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,860
and sees someone who's jacked and in a great
shape,

43
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,820
and his first reaction is,
"Huh, look at that douchebag."

44
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:47,430
"I wonder what kinda steroids he's on..."
And it's like, look dude,

45
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,040
not everyone who's in a better shape
than you are is on steriods.

46
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,189
I know that's really hard to believe,
but just try.

47
00:02:54,189 --> 00:02:57,840
And even the guys who are on steroids,
have a 100 times better work ethic than you

48
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,770
do.

49
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,200
8. Rich people are willing to promote themselves
and their value.

50
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,149
Poor people think negatively about selling
and promotion.

51
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,189
This is a pretty crazy one.
I remember I started selling used phones at

52
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:13,409
about 12,
and I was actually making quite a bit of money.

53
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:17,430
And I think I was bragging to my dad once,
and he looked at me and he was basically like,

54
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,319
"What are you so proud of?
You're just selling stuff."

55
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,239
Like there's actually a demeaning word
for someone who sells stuff in my native language.

56
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,240
And I just stood there thinking,
"Hmm... This is weird."

57
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,540
So selling is something to look down on.
Making money is something to be looked down

58
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:35,429
on.
I mean of course it's not important,

59
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,740
but then I look at what you do all day,
and your entire day revolves around making

60
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,960
money.
You dedicate all your time to making something,

61
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,680
that I apperantely should be ashamed of making.

62
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,790
And I look around and everyone's still like
that.

63
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:54,349
Oh money's not important,
it's like almost taboo to talk about it.

64
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:56,599
Even my videos,
they get the most negativity if it's about

65
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:00,049
money,
yet this is the one thing that people sell

66
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,820
their entire lives for.
It blows my mind.

67
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:07,069
It's like talking to a teenager about sex
who constantly gets uncomfortable.

68
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:12,329
"Yes, honey, sex is a very important and enjoyable
part of life,

69
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,990
you don't have to be ashamed of it."

70
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:19,209
11. Rich people choose to get paid based on
results.

71
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:22,189
Poor people choose to get paid based on time.

72
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:26,379
I love this one.
I love hearing, "I DESERVE $15 an hour."

73
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:31,870
"I DESERVE $20 an hour."
Yeah, but that's not how the real world works

74
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,579
at all.
If I work on a business for a year straight

75
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:38,688
right now,
and I work 16 hour days every single day,

76
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:41,949
and I finally deliver a product that isn't
useful,

77
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,038
no one's going to give a shit.
Let me ask you,

78
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:48,360
are you going to buy my product
just because I put a year into it?

79
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,069
Of course not, that's not how the system works.
No one cares how much time you put into anything,

80
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:59,319
the real question is,
can you deliver real results and real value?

81
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:05,749
14. Rich people manage their money well.
Poor people mismanage their money well.

82
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:08,830
You know, with the amount that the poor people
complain

83
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:12,149
about their financial situation,
you would think it would make sense

84
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:16,068
to pick up a book and learn about the very
basics of money.

85
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:21,330
But no, almost every poor person I know
has no idea about even the very basics of

86
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:24,538
managing money.
They have no discipline with it,

87
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:27,259
they wait for that paycheck
and have no idea what they're doing once they

88
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:29,479
get it.
And that's it.

89
00:05:29,478 --> 00:05:34,329
Instead of being jealous and constantly criticizing,
picking up a book like The Richest Man in

90
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:37,370
Babylon
would be a great start.

91
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,680
15. Rich people have their money work hard
for them.

92
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,278
Poor people work hard for their money.

93
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:49,800
Again, going back to that thing of,
"I work hard, I deserve to be paid this much.

94
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,370
Look at that guy, he doesn't even work as
hard as I do,

95
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:58,050
and he makes a 100 times more than I do."
And I'm like, "That's the most normal thing."

96
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,150
That is how the universe works.

97
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:03,209
If you walked into the gym right now,
and you saw a bodybuilder

98
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:08,138
who had just worked out for an hour
doing exercises like squats and deadlifts.

99
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:11,538
And then you went on the elliptical
and did it for 5 hours,

100
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,870
you can't complain
about how you worked five times as hard as

101
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,689
that guy,
and are not seeing results.

102
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:20,909
No one gives a shit.
The universe doesn't give a shit about how

103
00:06:20,908 --> 00:06:24,870
hard you worked.
That guy's going to gain muscle and you're

104
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:25,728
not.

105
00:06:25,728 --> 00:06:32,199
17. Rich people constantly learn and grow.
Poor people think they already know.

106
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,278
This is one of the biggest obstacles right
here.

107
00:06:34,278 --> 00:06:38,610
When I was poor,
I said I don't know anything, I suck at this,

108
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,449
I'm going to pick up a book and learn.

109
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:45,249
But the problem is,
most people who are poor also think they already

110
00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:48,969
know everything.
And that's why they'll always be poor.

111
00:06:48,968 --> 00:06:53,228
I grew up in a post-soviet country,
and this was basically everyone around me.

112
00:06:53,228 --> 00:06:57,930
Some guy who read Tolstoy at some point
and got two degrees and now he thinks he knows

113
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,978
everything.
I mean, of course he wouldn't listen to some

114
00:07:00,978 --> 00:07:03,498
lowly person
who sells stuff.

115
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:07,400
Come on? Selling stuff?
He read Tolstoy when he was a kid, guys.

116
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:11,408
He's not gonna go that low.
Even though he does work as a manual laborer

117
00:07:11,408 --> 00:07:16,399
during the entire day so he can feed himself.
But learning about money and how it's made?

118
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,848
Come on. Please don't offend an intellectual
like him

119
00:07:19,848 --> 00:07:21,538
him like that.

120
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:25,218
This is like the biggest plague.
He doesn't even know the most basic concept

121
00:07:25,218 --> 00:07:27,228
of
paying himself first,

122
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:31,860
but he thinks he's this big genius
that's got the whole system figured out.

123
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,088
It's ridiculous.

124
00:07:34,088 --> 00:07:37,509
So there you go,
some of my favorite ideas from this book.

125
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:40,370
Again, please don't say something stupid in
the comments below,

126
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,379
about how I hate poor people or whatever.
But you're right,

127
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:47,120
I do hate HOW the majority of poor people
think.

128
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,579
It's like a disease
and I decided I was going to get rid of it,

129
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:56,348
and that's exactly why I've improved
my financial situation a 1000 times.

130
00:07:56,348 --> 00:08:00,610
95% of the people I grew up with
are going to stay poor for the rest of their

131
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,550
lives,
and it's because they didn't make that shift.

132
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:09,770
I would recommend hating the poor person mentality
with all your heart just as much as I do,

133
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:14,859
otherwise get ready to be a poor victim
who struggles financially for the rest of

134
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,399
his life.
