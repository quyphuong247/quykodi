1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,820
There was a poor man named bansir who lived in the city of babylon.

2
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,940
Bansir was building a new chariot

3
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,260
so he could deliver the goods and earn a few Shekels to feed his family's hunger.

4
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,080
but this day was not like any other day..

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,740
instead of building his chariot

6
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:33,539
He was sitting near his house all day long pondering about something

7
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:36,019
as his friend the lyre player "kobbi"

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,300
passed by greeting him from afar.

9
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:41,820
"Bansir my friend , you look pale , what troubles you?"

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,520
"And why aren't you working on that chariot today?"

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,000
"Ah i get it"

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,060
"The gods must have blessed you with a good fortune"

13
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,539
"perhaps a treasure was brought upon you"

14
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:52,979
"if it is true"

15
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:55,159
"then spare me a few shekels(coins)"

16
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:58,000
"Stop it with your nonsense"

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,500
"i don't even have one shekel for thyself"

18
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,679
"i'm undoubtedly poorer than you"

19
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:05,260
"and my purse is leaner than yours"

20
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,079
"you have no coins in your purse"

21
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:09,459
"yet sit here doing nothing!"

22
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:11,439
"why don't you go complete that chariot?"

23
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,599
"am i the one who's going to feed your children?"

24
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:15,019
"what's wrong with you today?"

25
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:16,280
"tell me ! tell me !"

26
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,859
"i had a dream yesterday"

27
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:21,040
"i was walking on piles of gold"

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,880
"i had my own castle"

29
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:24,959
"it's walls were made of silver"

30
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,399
"for one night, i felt truly rich"

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,460
"but"

32
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:32,039
"it was just a dream .."

33
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,680
"yeah .. just a dream"

34
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,980
bansir sighed deeply as kobbi patted him on the shoulder and said:

35
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,079
"i have an idea bansir"

36
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,079
"i remembered something important"

37
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,739
"i have a friend who goes by the name of Arkad"

38
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:46,659
"he is known to be very rich"

39
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:49,019
"how about we go seek knowledge from him"

40
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:51,780
"maybe he could aid us out from our misery"

41
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,620
The poor man went straight to arkad's mansion.

42
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,040
back in that time

43
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,880
Arkad was known to be the richest man in babylon.

44
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,439
"i salute thee old friend Arkad"

45
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,799
"do not be troubled !"

46
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,000
"we did not come begging for gold"

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,060
"yet we do seek a good friend's wisdom

48
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,340
for acquiring a fat purse".

49
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,460
Arkad greeted the two men with a smile then said:

50
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,860
"did any of you dream of gold ?"

51
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,460
"Yes ! yes ! bansir saw himself as one of the rich"

52
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,879
"fortunate indeed" replied arkad

53
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,460
"your dream is the first important lesson

54
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,080
for acquiring gold"

55
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,260
"My dream, a lesson ? how ?" -exclaimed bansir

56
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:35,319
"the desire for gold" -replied arkad

57
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:38,359
"for me it all started with a desire , a vision"

58
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,780
"and then i had to find the ways"

59
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,840
"for making it as real as it was in your dream".

60
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,840
Arkad continued with his teaching

61
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,400
he said that the second lesson was

62
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,539
to keep one-tenth from each earning one has acquired.

63
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:51,659
Algamesh, the man who taught Arkad

64
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:53,020
the secrets of wealth

65
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,960
insisted that he pays himself first

66
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,120
everytime he earned a sum of shekels from his job

67
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,659
even if he had to starve

68
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:01,659
he must save a portion for himself

69
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:04,680
if he truly desired, a fat purse.

70
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,760
pay yourself first before you pay others with your money

71
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,039
save ten percent and you will build a fortune in ten years

72
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:15,120
Now you're probably being skeptical about all this

73
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,300
"oh saving man and all, i'm a grown man"

74
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,000
"this is for the little kid who wants to buy a bike"

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,039
"and then he starts saving money for it"

76
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,039
"besides, i can't save money"

77
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,879
"my paycheck can barely keep up with my expenses"

78
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:28,960
Well guess what ?

79
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,460
if you can somehow stop spending money on bullshit

80
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,580
you get to have a portion that you can keep for yourself.

81
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,500
a man seeks advice for acquiring wealth

82
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,659
yet the lessons are infront of his eyes

83
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:44,819
unfortunately, he's too unconscious to see or to decide.

84
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,700
Arkad continued with his teaching.

85
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:50,699
he could clearly see the two men starting to think

86
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:52,259
as he was explaining.

87
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,039
if you do manage to save a big sum of shekels

88
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:13,019
engage in a profitable investment for Thyself

89
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,800
create a passive income that keeps flowing.

90
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,300
and when one has achieved a fat purse

91
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,300
one must not be fooled by his increase in income

92
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,300
many of wich whom gotten rich

93
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,960
began wasting their treasure in less valuable investments

94
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,060
"oh cool the business is doing well"

95
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,259
"time to buy a new car ! a new house ! yaay"

96
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:34,159
congratulations you are stupid.

97
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,060
Do not eat the children of your savings.

98
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,839
Make them work for you.

99
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:41,619
And make their children's children work for you.

100
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,180
until your fat purse is stable

101
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,160
no matter how much you spend.

102
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,120
as Algamish the master of Arkad once said to him:

103
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,600
"your money is your slave Arkad"

104
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,620
"you have to make it work for you"

105
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,000
"first one must create an army of golden slaves"

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
"and then many of a rich banquet may you enjoy"

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,220
"without regret"

108
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,939
"the story ends here my fellow friends"

109
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:07,699
"now go ! go seek out your own knowledge"

110
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:09,699
"this is easier said than done"

111
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:12,060
as the two men were about to leave Arkad

112
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,420
they were thankful to him

113
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,300
and commented that he was a very lucky man.

114
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,560
but how can they accuse someone of luck

115
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,139
when he spent his whole life failing to learn

116
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:23,939
and learning not to fail for him to achieve a dream.

117
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:25,759
it is indeed a long journey.

118
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,019
risky so to say

119
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:28,620
but what choice do you have ?

120
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,420
it is better to get lost in the journey toward freedom

121
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,720
than to be imprisoned for the rest of your life.

122
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,060
"i decided to my self that i would claim my share"

123
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,819
"of the good things in life"

124
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:41,620
" i would not be one of those who stand afar off"

125
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,759
"enviously watching, others enjoy"

126
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:48,279
-Arkad, the richest man in babylon
