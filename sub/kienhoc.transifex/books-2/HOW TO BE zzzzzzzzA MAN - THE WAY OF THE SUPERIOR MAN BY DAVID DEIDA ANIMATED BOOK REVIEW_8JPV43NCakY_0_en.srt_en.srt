1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:08,410
I remember growing up in poverty. There’s
basically no opportunity around. I was in

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:14,879
a recovering post-soviet country that couldn't
recover. And I figured out a solution as a

3
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:20,550
little kid. I said, ”You know what? I can’t
do all the things that I want to do right

4
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,450
now, but when things get better, that’s
when I’ll start doing everything. So I’m

5
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:32,829
just going to wait for that time.” And that’s
literally how I spent the first 17 years of

6
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:39,829
my life. Until I got accepted to United States
Air Force Academy. And I said, “Finally!

7
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:47,129
Going to America, the land of freedom and
opportunity, and as soon as I get there, I’ll

8
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:54,128
start doing all the things that I want to
do.” And, of course, I got here and I realized

9
00:00:55,588 --> 00:01:02,448
I had less time now than I had ever had in
my life. And guess what? Of course I figured

10
00:01:02,448 --> 00:01:07,319
out another great solution. I said, “You
know what, I’m going to wait. I’m going

11
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:12,509
to wait these four years. I’m gonna be a
good little boy and do what I’m told. And

12
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,550
once these four years are done, I’ll be
free again, and I’ll start doing all the

13
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:22,030
things that I want to do.” And then luckily,
I read The Way of the Superior Man by David

14
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:27,359
Deida. Otherwise, I’d be working at a job
right now, hoping that I would find another

15
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:33,750
job where I would have more time to do all
the things I wanted to do, and of course ultimately,

16
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,670
I would end up dying before I did any of those
things.

17
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:44,250
So the first big idea is: stop hoping for
a completion of anything in life. If you’re

18
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:51,250
not doing it right now, realize that you’re
probably never going to do it.

19
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:59,140
Now the second big idea is: don’t get lost
in tasks and duties. And for me, this was

20
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,890
one of the biggest things. When I was at the
Academy, I would wake up and I would say,

21
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:07,569
“Okay, I have to clean my little room for
an hour now, and then I have to go to the

22
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:11,620
mail room and I have to drop this off, and
then I have to take a bunch of papers and

23
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,680
organize them from A to Z, and then when I
get back to my room, I have to do a lot of

24
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,680
homework.” And I realized if I'm dying,
is that what I'm going to be saying? Oh, I

25
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:28,399
was a really good boy and I cleaned my room
for an hour every day. Is that what I'm going

26
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:35,049
to say, or is it going to be something like
I pursued my purpose? So again, make sure

27
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:39,879
you're not getting lost in those tasks and
duties. And those tasks and duties have a

28
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:45,289
weird way of seeming like you couldn't do
without them. And there are certain things

29
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:49,408
that you couldn't do without, but you can
at least minimize those things and maximize

30
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:56,289
the time you're dedicating towards actually
pursuing your purpose. The third big idea

31
00:02:56,289 --> 00:03:01,429
is: be willing to change everything in your
life. And honestly, I don't know if I can

32
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:06,859
think of anything that's more masculine than
this. When I was a little boy, this was probably

33
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:11,659
something that scared me the most. You know,
here I am a little boy and what am I gonna

34
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:18,090
do if my dad loses his job? You know, he somehow
got lucky and landed that job and if he loses

35
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,998
it, guess what? We're done. I'm gonna be starving.
So that was something that scared me all my

36
00:03:22,998 --> 00:03:28,278
life. But that was when I was a little boy.
Now as a man, I don't care. I don't care.

37
00:03:28,278 --> 00:03:32,979
I've cultivated myself to a point where no
matter what happens, no matter what kind of

38
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:39,149
change I go through, it doesn't matter. I'm
going to be able to figure it out. And this

39
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,419
reminds me of a story about Andrew Carnegie.
So you're either going to be someone like

40
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:52,419
Andrew Carnegie, or you're going to be a man
that somehow got lucky finding a job and is

41
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,980
holding onto it and not letting go and being
scared of what's going to happen if he loses

42
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:02,878
it. Or you can be someone like Andrew Carnegie.
Basically, they asked Andrew Carnegie about

43
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:08,229
his business, which was the most successful
business in the world, and he said, "We don't

44
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:13,628
care. Go ahead. You can take away everything
from us. You can take away the machines. You

45
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:17,608
can take the factories. We don't care. Give
us four years and we'll be back to where we

46
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:22,638
are." And that's exactly how I feel at this
point in my life. I've cultivated the things

47
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,780
that I need to be a man to a point where you
can literally take away everything from me.

48
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:31,739
I don't care. You can drop me in the middle
of a street somewhere in the world, and I'll

49
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:38,740
be able to come back where I am. Now the fourth
big idea is: live as if your father were dead.

50
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:48,410
And I remember reading this for the first
time, and I got so upset. I said, "But I respect

51
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:54,728
my daddy. But I respect him." Okay, it doesn't
have to do anything with respect. It just

52
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:59,128
means that when you're a little boy, people
tell you, "Oh, this is good for you. This

53
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:04,500
is what you need to do. This is what you need
to do." When you become a man, and you cultivate

54
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,228
the qualities of a man, there's no one in
the world that knows what you need to do better

55
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:17,228
than you do. Again, a superior man respects
everyone, takes people's opinions and betters

56
00:05:17,658 --> 00:05:23,990
himself, but ultimately, I'm not going to
go to my mom or my dad and say, "Hey guys,

57
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,740
should I work on my business or is it time
for me to go get my MBA? Which one guys?"

58
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,930
Okay, I mean I know guys that are literally,
go up to their mom, and they're like, "Oh

59
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:37,228
but, you know, with my girlfriend, should
I have sex in this position or in that position?"

60
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:43,728
Like what are you doing? As a man, you are
the masculine energy, you know what's best

61
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:50,728
for you. And finally, if you don't know your
purpose, discover it now. It kind of like,

62
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,658
when you were a kid, you watched a warrior
trying to conquer something, or trying to

63
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:01,639
save someone, or trying to liberate. That's
the purpose. That's what you're attracted

64
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:07,960
to. You didn't watch some guy waking up, going
to work, coming back watching TV, going to

65
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:14,908
sleep, and then doing the same thing over
and over again. If you had all the money and

66
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:21,908
all the time in the world, what would you
do?

67
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:32,860
I remember asking myself this question a few years ago. Here I was at the Academy
getting my 4.0, setting myself up for my MBA,

68
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:40,288
and all that. And I asked myself this question
and I thought, "I'm not doing anything right

69
00:06:40,288 --> 00:06:45,188
now that I would be doing if I had all the
money and all the time in the world." So as

70
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:50,220
a man, you want to have a purpose in your
life, And if you don't know what it is, discover

71
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,990
it now. If you're having trouble discovering
it, ask yourself this question, "If you had

72
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,829
all the money and all the time in the world,
what would you do?!"
