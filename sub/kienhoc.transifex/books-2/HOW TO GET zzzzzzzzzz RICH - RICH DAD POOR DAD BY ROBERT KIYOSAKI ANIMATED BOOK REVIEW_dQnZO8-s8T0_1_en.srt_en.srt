1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:06,200
Here’s little Robert Kiyosaki. He has two
fathers. One of them has a Ph.D., the other

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:13,199
never finished 8th grade. Both earn substantial
incomes, yet one always struggles financially,

3
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:18,910
while the other is going to become one of
the richest men in Hawaii. One is going to

4
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:24,500
die leaving tens of millions of dollars to
his family. The other is going to leave bills

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,149
to be paid.

6
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:31,640
The problem with financial education is that
it isn’t taught in schools, so the family

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,560
decides to teach it. Now, the problem with
this is that unless your parents are in the

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:42,770
top 1%, they are going to teach you how to
be poor, not because they don’t love you,

9
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,780
they just don’t know what they’re teaching,
and they don’t read books like Rich Dad

10
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,109
Poor Dad.

11
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:55,299
My story is very similar. I was taught how
to be poor. Then I went to the Air Force Academy

12
00:00:55,299 --> 00:01:01,328
and studied economics and took accounting
and investing classes. I did complicated regressions

13
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:07,858
on economic data and balanced complex balance
sheets. Yet, I have received more pragmatic

14
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:14,419
advice by reading a single book from Kiyosaki
than I did by taking four years of complicated

15
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,709
classes.

16
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:22,299
I never had a rich dad, but I have many rich
dads now. Clason, Kiyosaki, Hill, DeMarco,

17
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:29,299
the list goes on. So if you weren’t born
into the top 1%, let’s learn from Kiyosaki

18
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:32,539
who learned from his rich dad.

19
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:39,049
You have to know these two words: assets and
liabilities. Now forget what you might have

20
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:44,368
learned in your accounting classes, we are
going to define them in very simple terms.

21
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:51,118
An asset is anything that puts money in your
pocket. A liability is anything that takes

22
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:57,069
money away from your pocket. Anything can
be an asset or a liability. If you own a house

23
00:01:57,069 --> 00:02:03,039
and it eats a $1000 a month then it’s a
liability. If you own a house and it brings

24
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:10,038
in a $1000 a month then it’s an asset. Assets
are things like businesses, real estate, paper

25
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:16,759
assets, things like stocks and bonds. Here
is why knowing this distinction is so important.

26
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:23,759
Really try to focus on this. The poor only
have expenses, the rich buy assets, and the

27
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:29,729
middle class buy liabilities that they think
are assets.

28
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:35,049
After graduating if I had followed everybody’s
advice, I would have gotten a job which increases

29
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:40,860
my income, but there are so many problems
with that. As I got my job, my girlfriend

30
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,880
and I would have moved into a bigger house,
we would have gotten a BMW in addition to

31
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:51,769
our Mustang. I would have bought the iPhone
6. The problem with all of this is that I

32
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:57,460
would think I was acquiring assets while I
was actually acquiring liabilities. I would

33
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:03,620
have to pay every month for the house, for
the car, for my expensive phone. In essence,

34
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:09,270
unless you make a paradigm shift about what
you do with your money, which is to buy actual

35
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:15,130
assets, no matter how much income you earn
from your job, you will just match it with

36
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:21,340
your liabilities and expenses. Your friends
might admire your iPhone 6, and you might

37
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,680
look rich but you will never actually be rich.

38
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,960
Now there is nothing wrong with having your
job. I just don’t have one, because I’m

39
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,040
operating from the assets quadrant. But, if
you are following the standard narrative of

40
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:41,370
going to school and getting a job, chances
are you’re acquiring liabilities which you

41
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:47,210
think are assets. That is the problem. So
keep your job, but make sure what you earn

42
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:54,210
goes mostly towards real assets, rather than
liabilities that seem like assets. And yes,

43
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:59,449
eventually when you acquire enough assets,
you won’t need your job either.

44
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:04,919
It absolutely blows my mind how people say,
well what if I lose money with the business,

45
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,679
or the real estate, or the paper assets. They
don’t say the same thing about buying their

46
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,009
second enormous TV which will be worthless
in a year, and which creates a liability every

47
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:21,479
month. I would rather lose all of my money
starting a business than lose it by buying

48
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:28,240
yet another TV I don’t need. Even if I lost
all my money, the lessons learned from starting

49
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,598
a business would be infinitely more valuable
than watching Dr. Phil.

50
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:39,120
Here is another problem. It’s not how much
money you make, it’s how much money you

51
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,908
keep. If I told you I was going to pay you
a million dollars a month, but then I took

52
00:04:44,908 --> 00:04:54,468
away $999,999, you’d have to be an idiot
if you said you were making a million. 

53
00:04:54,899 --> 00:05:01,339
My dad told me become a doctor and you will be
rich. Yet a doctor pays a half or even more

54
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:07,239
of what he earns just to the government. You
get taxed when you earn. You get taxed when

55
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:13,370
you spend. You get taxed when you save. And
guess what, you get taxed when you die. On

56
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:20,949
the other hand, you can operate from the assets
quadrant and pay sometimes 0% in taxes.

57
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:26,649
I have doctor friends who are more financially
anxious than my absolutely broke friends.

58
00:05:26,649 --> 00:05:33,239
Here is a short history of taxation. Years
ago, there was no tax in Great Britain or

59
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,218
the United States. It amazes me how so many
people don’t realize this. The government

60
00:05:39,218 --> 00:05:45,978
would sometimes collect tax during civil wars
and extreme cases, but there was no actual

61
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:50,688
tax. Well, the government realized that the
poor and the middle class were idiots. The

62
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:57,028
masses looked up to the idiotic story of Robin
Hood and actually admired it. So, the government

63
00:05:57,028 --> 00:06:02,759
decided it was going to leverage that. It
said, hey guys let’s put a tax on the rich,

64
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:08,479
so you idiots can get money from them. Well
of course all the idiots agreed and voted

65
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:14,558
for it. The problem is that the government’s
greed grew bigger and bigger until the taxation

66
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:19,830
trickled down to everyone including the poor.
But the rich didn’t care. They were too

67
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:26,579
smart for little Robin Hood. They easily found
ways to avoid being robbed of their hard earned

68
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:32,818
money. So it actually hurt the idiots in the
end, the poor and the middle class. That is

69
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:37,468
why Warren Buffett pays lower tax rate than
his secretary.

70
00:06:37,468 --> 00:06:44,338
I was born in 1992, in the Republic of Georgia
right after the breakup of the Soviet Union.

71
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:50,189
If you think I worked my ass off in poverty
for two decades, so one day I could come to

72
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:55,968
another communist state, you must be out of
your mind. You must be out of your mind if

73
00:06:55,968 --> 00:07:01,278
you think I’m going to share over half of
what I earn with blood and sweat with people

74
00:07:01,278 --> 00:07:07,168
who want to sit on their ass and watch TV
all day and collect the benefits the government

75
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:09,748
hands out to them, so they can get reelected.

76
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:16,749
The rich are too smart for this. Yes, I am
going to buy my BMW, I’m just going to buy

77
00:07:17,278 --> 00:07:22,588
it for my corporation. A poor person thinks
of a bunch of buildings when he thinks of

78
00:07:22,588 --> 00:07:29,019
a corporation when in reality, it’s really
a folder full of papers, a folder full of

79
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:35,848
papers that allows the rich to make all the
expenses and then pay the taxes at the end.

80
00:07:35,848 --> 00:07:41,360
So the rich will never actually be affected
by any of this. It will always come down to

81
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,129
the middle and the upper middle class, the
people who work the hardest, to pay for the

82
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:53,259
benefits of the person with a bag of chips
in one hand, and a remote in the other.
