1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,429
Today we'll be dissecting, so to speak, the
structure of the human psyche, A.k.a. the

2
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:06,429
mind.

3
00:00:06,429 --> 00:00:11,189
But first, it should be clear to everyone
that the term brain and mind are very dissimilar.

4
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:14,599
Mind and brain are used interchangeably in
our daily interactions.

5
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:19,370
However, in terms of studies & research, it
is of the utmost importance to differentiate

6
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,359
the former from the latter.

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,660
The brain is constructed of physical matter.

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,359
I.E. blood vessels, nerves and layers intertwined,
shielded by a skull.

9
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:32,118
When we say brain, we speak of what is physiological,
organic.

10
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:36,890
On the other hand, the mind corresponds to
what is psychic(I.E Psychology).

11
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,710
Picture the mind as an intangible veil of
eletrical impulses generated by the brain.

12
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,670
It is a seperate entity, even from the soul.

13
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,070
As we go through the book, I'll be using the
term psyche as referance to the mind, seeying

14
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,759
that psyche and mind relatively mean the same
thing.

15
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:57,289
With this basic overview at hand, we could
now proceed to the main premise of this book.

16
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:00,370
(the structure of the psyche).

17
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:05,750
Oftentimes, people wish they could die instead
of getting constantly tormented by that annoying

18
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,150
chatter box lurking inside their heads.

19
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,190
But, if we look closely, objectively, you'll
realize that your psyche, doesn't want to

20
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:15,929
shut up, because that stream of nonsense serves
a great purpose.

21
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,830
A constant assessing, judging & classifying
of people & things into certain categories.

22
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:26,829
I think, It does so to help you better grasp
this chaotic world by converting what is unknown

23
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:30,019
& uncertain into something further intelligible.

24
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:33,799
Look around your room and distinguish one
object that you do not yet know its name or

25
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:34,849
nature.

26
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:36,609
Undoubtedly none.

27
00:01:36,609 --> 00:01:41,920
Whether you like it or not, the psyche's fate
is to function daily, consciously or subconsciously

28
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,500
to break down what's going on around you.

29
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,640
The psyche's spontaneous reactivity to the
external is not meant to make you miserable.

30
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:57,280
It is merely a natural tendency to search
& explore the unknown.

31
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:06,680
The psyche does not interpret reality as it
is but always in relation to us.

32
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,280
Everything you perceive from the outside world
passes through your sensory devices.

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,669
Processed by the brain, the mind then weaves
it with your memories, thoughts and feelings,

34
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:19,619
hence project a quote on quote subjective
reality.

35
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,840
Imagine You and I contemplating the ocean
at the moment.

36
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,150
The scenery might elicit joyfulness in you,
whereas it might trigger sadness for me.

37
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:33,530
You see, the reality, the image was the same
but our concept of it differed, seeying that

38
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,129
the view evoked dissimilar memories for both
of us.

39
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:42,519
We experience not the external as a whole
as much as a mere distorted subjective conception

40
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,200
of it.

41
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:49,389
In other words, the psyche's not a reflection
of reality in actuality, but of man's position

42
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:51,789
projected onto the world.

43
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:54,929
Consciousness is more or less the same in
every individual.

44
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,090
Every person, however, streams the world from
his personal angle.

45
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:05,509
Hearing this concept, you might have grasped
it one way, whereas another person on the

46
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:09,780
other side of the world, who's watching the
same video, might've grasped it a totally

47
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:16,090
different way.

48
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,270
Consciousness operates in an inward motion.

49
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:24,010
It seems to pour the world into us through
our sensory-devices.

50
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:26,280
Sense-perception signals that something pertains
infront of us.

51
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,860
But its job is limited only to generating
a field of awareness.

52
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,849
it cannot describe the nature or name of the
things perceived.

53
00:03:33,848 --> 00:03:39,780
The mechanism that tells us what things are
elaborately is called apperception.

54
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,379
Sense-perception is classified more as physiological,
connected to the brain.

55
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:47,789
Apperception on the other hand is sorted as
a psychic process.

56
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:51,750
And unlike sense-perception whose function
is quite obvious, Apperception has a more

57
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,509
intricate structure, in that its workings
involve a harmonuous cooperation between other

58
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:58,030
sub-processeses.

59
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:04,030
To name a few, recognition, evaluation, the
intuitive processes, the instinctual processes,

60
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,030
etc.

61
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:11,349
Now we're going to comment on each one of
these apperceptive sub-processes individually.

62
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:16,370
Imagine, you're hiking a great mountain.

63
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:20,280
On your way upward, there were numerous plants
of various peculiarities.

64
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,119
Suddently, you hear strange noises.

65
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,560
You look up and spot a bird hovering in the
skies.

66
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,660
Your sense-perception has captured it.

67
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,900
But, how is it that you've recognized & named
this object as a bird and not as a flying

68
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,739
car, a tree or a shampoo?

69
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,300
This is where the process of recognition comes
into play, and it functions as follows:

70
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,340
Everytime you direct attention towards an
object, your mind quickly dives into your

71
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:51,339
memory searching for old memory-images that
may help you recognize the novel stimulus.

72
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:56,969
You didn't think of the bird as a tree because
you already have past stored information justifying

73
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,700
what a bird should look like.

74
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:03,789
In contrast, a three-year old baby, who sees
a bird for the first time, will surely be

75
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:08,780
able to see, to become aware of the flying
bird(as an object) but he won't be able to

76
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:12,899
recognize it as a bird or animal because it's
a new experience for him.

77
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:17,698
He will probably assume that it's just another
kind of humans flying up in the air, owing

78
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:23,189
to the fact that his life up until this point
revolved only around living indoors with people,

79
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:26,160
unexposed to outdoor objects.

80
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,660
Hence recognition (of new objects) is a psychic
process.

81
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,180
It happens only when you do have at least
a faint memory-image identical to the new

82
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:39,840
image perceived, or any other memory fragment
containing some information that could help

83
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,839
you identify the object.

84
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,969
Here's an easier example:

85
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,850
Let's say you're a guitar player & a friend
of yours is a pianist.

86
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:53,129
Let's assume also, that you have never seen
a piano in your entire life.

87
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:59,219
You have zero memory-image of it, nor do you
have the word piano in your vocabulary yet.

88
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,990
One day, your friend invites you in to see
it.

89
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:07,100
He knows what a piano is but you, the first
thing that came to mind is a load of questions

90
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,030
concerning this new object.

91
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:13,589
As he played a few notes on it, you might've
been able to guess correct that it's just

92
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:17,750
another musical instrument like your guitar
since it produces similar melodies, however,

93
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:24,478
the name of the object will remain a mystery
until your friend names it for you.

94
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,269
Now, after aqcuiring this experience, the
next time you see a piano, you'll be able

95
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:31,370
to name it as such, and recognize its purpose.

96
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,019
If, we suppose that you haven't gone through
that first experience, the object(aka piano)

97
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:39,459
will remain unintelligeable until someone
explains it to you.

98
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:44,299
The fact of the matter is, you cannot recognize
the nature or name of new oncoming objects

99
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,629
unless you do have already a pre-established
memory-image of them or until someone else

100
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:55,610
explains to you what that thing is, aka, through
second hand experience.

101
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,900
Recognition can also be referenced as thinking.

102
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:02,599
A mental process that helps distinguish the
nature of novel stimulus based on what the

103
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,020
person has seen before.

104
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:09,560
As a side note, next time you're onto reading
a book, notice how your mind understands new

105
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
ideas.

106
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,259
It processes a new insight, then scans memory-images
for relevant clues, facts, past experiences

107
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:20,639
that may help you grasp this new piece of
information.

108
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,629
In case where you couldn't comprehend it,
you're left intruiged, troubled or frustrated

109
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:29,339
as the insight remains an unfathomable mystery.

110
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:33,269
This is why the more experiences & knowledge
you gain, the further you can link things

111
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:39,329
together & the better able you are at decoding
the world.

112
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,719
Having touched a rough surface (of wood for
example), here the word "rough" conveys the

113
00:07:53,728 --> 00:07:57,709
feeling-tone the stimulus carries that was
then sensed by me.

114
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:02,698
And thus prompted me to mentally judge & classify
the material into a certain category (i.e.

115
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,079
among things that are rough)

116
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:07,068
Evaluation is the process of feeling.

117
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:11,990
After recognizing the object, the psyche evaluates
its feeling-tone, and then shocks the body

118
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,019
to conceive emotions based on that assessment.

119
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:19,899
I'd guess that this process could be triggered
after recognition, or function simultaneously

120
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,689
parallel to it.

121
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:27,490
Recognition scans the nature & name of the
item, evaluation helps you feel the item.

122
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,639
Some people might question, "why do I need
evaluation if I have recognized the thing

123
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,778
already?"

124
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:37,879
I personally think, evaluation is a mechanism
by wich the mind is able to further identify

125
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:39,360
novel stimulus.

126
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:49,269
We understand people and things better especially
when we feel emotionally connected to them.

127
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:52,149
Intuition is usually conceived as something
somewhat esoteric.

128
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:56,879
But, in our day to day interactions, all of
us inadvertantly verbalize at times what we

129
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,509
feel intuitively.

130
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:03,669
Allow me to clarify with a basic example:
- At the sight of an unidentified flying object,

131
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,939
three people conveyed the following statements

132
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,510
The first one said "guys, I guess I saw a
spaceship!"

133
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:13,990
The second said "I have a feeling that there's
a rocket coming towards us"

134
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,820
And the last one "calm down, I Think it's
just a bird"

135
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,120
These three statements convey an intuitive
guessing of what the object might be.

136
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,210
The first person said he saw something.

137
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,862
He refered to his intuition as sense-perception,
aka, the act of seeying.

138
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:33,490
The second however, engulfed by strong emotion,
illustrated his intuitive guess as

139
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,080
a process of feeling.

140
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,370
And the third as rational thinking.

141
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,600
The problem here is not in whether or not
they have made a guess, it's in the words

142
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,970
they used to verbalize their intuitive guess.

143
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,970
The intuitive process is not intertwined with
sense-perception, and furthermore has nothing

144
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,480
to do with thinking nor with feeling.

145
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,610
Thinking is quite often slow, it takes time
to ponder.

146
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,919
Conversely, Intuitive guesses, as I shall
call them, are evoked instantaneously & spontaneously

147
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:03,569
at the sight of a novel occurence.

148
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,850
Intuition is some sort of clairvoyant mental
ability that helps us guess or count the possible

149
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,550
outcomes of an event.

150
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:14,599
The reason why we confuse intuition with thinking
& feeling is owing to the insufficient development

151
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:22,839
of our languages as Carl jung cited.

152
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:30,740
In addition, I would personally guess(intuitively
guess), we confuse intuition with other mental

153
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:36,070
functions merely out of lazyness, or perhaps
because the processes of intuitive guessing,

154
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,890
thinking, and feeling occur quite often simultaneously,
leaving no time for us to differentiate between

155
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:45,669
each of them.

156
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:50,360
Volitional processes correspond to voluntary
actions, emerging from free-will.

157
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,690
Volition is contrasted with instinctual reflexes
that happen involuntarily, wich we're going

158
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,220
to see in a second.

159
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,800
This mechanism encompasses not only the ability
to think up intentions within the psychic

160
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:05,909
realm, but also a second function that thrusts
you to voluntarily act upon your willing to

161
00:11:05,909 --> 00:11:14,588
crystallize it into the physical world.

162
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:18,471
When you deliberately intend to do something,
and then willfully act upon that decision,

163
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:22,269
that is a display of volition or free will.

164
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:26,610
The opposite are actions originating from
your instincts, like the fight or flight response

165
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,839
for instance.

166
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,020
Instead of you voluntarily choosing a course
of action, the instinctual physiological response(a.k.a.

167
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:39,829
fight or flight) decides on your behalf and
forces your body to react in a defined direction.

168
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,700
Imagine you're visiting in a graveyard.

169
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,899
And suddenly, you spot a creepy ghost walking
by.

170
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:51,100
In such high pressure situations, Your survival
instinct kicks in without delay and constrains

171
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,019
you to act thoughtlessly, either by screaming
for help, sprinting, or getting paralyzed

172
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:58,338
altogether and fainting.

173
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:02,820
Instincts are primitive behavioral reactions
innate in each and everyone of us.

174
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,440
Some of them of are inborn compulsive drives,
like sexual drives for example.

175
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,900
Arguably, Although our instincts could be
harnessed to some extent, for the most part,

176
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,879
when activated, they send signals to the brain
that we cannot easily ignore.

177
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:22,120
And these electrical impulses are so strong
that they oftentimes overwhelm the thinking

178
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,259
mind.

179
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:27,240
The author denoted that it's difficult to
count a definite number of the instincts.

180
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,879
Neither do we have a distinct definition of
them at the moment.

181
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:33,610
But, the only thing that's ascertained is
that the instincts fall among physiological

182
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:38,080
functions.I.E. generated from the body & not
the psyche.

183
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,980
But, nonethless they are connected to it in
some ways as we will see in further videos.

184
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:51,028
So keep mind, volitional processes are psychological,
instincts are more so physiological.

185
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:54,269
There exists two types of apperceptive processes.

186
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:55,850
Directed and undirected.

187
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,450
Both are contents of consciousness.

188
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:02,990
Directed conscious processes are named as
such for they are rational, and can be consciously

189
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,539
diverted by attention.

190
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:06,230
like thinking & volition.

191
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:10,320
You could, most of the time, direct and freely
chose your thoughts.

192
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,290
On the other hand, undirected conscious processes
are irrational, and are unconfined by attention,

193
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:19,338
like dreams and fantasies for instance.

194
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:22,740
Conscious choices are the product of rational
reasoning.

195
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,919
Dreams are the polar opposite, in that they're
often arbitrary, uncontrolable, disorganized

196
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,429
visions.

197
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:35,759
Some people may exclaim: "aren't dreams considered
unconscious?!"

198
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:39,039
To a fair extent, the answer is yes and no.

199
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:42,929
For the sake of conciseness, I can't further
elaborate on this point as it will prompt

200
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:44,500
us a very long digression.

201
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,620
But, I will in the next video.

202
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,019
For now, a superficial definition should be
sufficient.

203
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:53,139
The author considers dreams among conscious
processes.

204
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:54,139
Here's why

205
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:59,209
He depicted dreams indeed as manifestation
of unconscious psychic activity yet emerging

206
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,349
to the surface of consciousness.

207
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:06,300
And whatever passes into the realm of consciousness
is hence considered one of its contents.

208
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:11,539
So, their origin is unconscious but their
display is conscious.

209
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:17,399
As promised in the next one, we'll dive deeper
into the nature & purpose of dreams & especially

210
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,870
the unconscious psyche.

211
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,339
Thanks for watching and see you real soon.
