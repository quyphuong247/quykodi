1
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:14,628
I SPENT MOST OF MY LIFE CONSTANTLY WORRYING
ABOUT STUFF.

2
00:00:14,628 --> 00:00:18,929
NOW FAST FORWARD TO TODAY,
AND IT'S EXTREMELY RARE THAT I WORRY ABOUT

3
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:20,750
ANYTHING,
AND WHEN I DO,

4
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:26,629
IT USUALLY LASTS ABOUT 20-30 SECONDS UNTIL
I CATCH MYSELF AND STOP.

5
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:31,179
AND CULTIVATING THAT HAS MADE MY LIFE LITERALLY
A HUNDRED TIMES BETTER.

6
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:34,929
SO I THINK IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO STOP
WORRYING AND STRESSING,

7
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:38,250
YOU UNDERSTAND THE BENEFITS AND I DON'T REALLY
HAVE TO SELL YOU ON IT...

8
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,250
BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU A VERY SHORT SUMMARY:
YOU CAN ACTUALLY START HAVING TIME TO ENJOY

9
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,929
LIFE.
YOU WON'T BE CONSTANTLY MISERABLE,

10
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:51,560
AND YOU WON'T BE DESTROYING YOUR HEALTH
AND MAKING YOURSELF CONSTANTLY SICK.

11
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,039
AND I THINK THAT SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD.

12
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:57,250
SO THE TWO BOOKS THAT HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON
ME

13
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,439
WERE ECKHART TOLLE'S THE POWER OF NOW,
AND VIKTOR FRANKL'S MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING,

14
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,750
WHICH I RECOMMEND EVERYONE READ.
BUT TODAY,

15
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,750
I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT FOUR OF MY FAVORITE
IDEAS FROM ANOTHER GREAT BOOK,

16
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:12,578
DALE CARNEGIE'S HOW TO STOP WORRYING AND START
LIVING.

17
00:01:12,578 --> 00:01:16,199
SO THE FIRST BIG IDEA IS:
ASK YOURSELF,

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,960
WHAT'S THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN?

19
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,559
I REMEMBER THE FIRST YEAR IN COLLEGE
CONSTANTLY WORRYING ABOUT MY GRADES.

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,469
WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO IF I GOT A B+
INSTEAD OF AN A?

21
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:34,469
WELL, SURELY MY LIFE WOULD BE OVER
AND I WOULD NEVER AMOUNT TO ANYTHING IN LIFE.

22
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:39,900
LIKE, THAT WAS SERIOUSLY THE THOUGHT PROCESS
GOING THROUGH MY 17 YEAR OLD HEAD.

23
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,490
NOW FAST FORWARD FIVE YEARS,
I WAS CLEANING A FEW DAYS AGO

24
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:47,000
AND FOUND MY DIPLOMA IN SOME WEIRD PLACE IN
MY HOUSE.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,478
HAVEN'T EVEN OPENED THE BOX SINCE I GOT IT,
AND WILL NEVER EVEN END UP USING IT FOR THE

26
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:51,969
REST OF MY LIFE.

27
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:54,719
THAT IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHAT YOUR BRAIN
DOES TO YOU.

28
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,039
IT STARTS TO FREAK OUT WITH UNCERTAINTY.
IF YOU DON'T CLEARLY DEFINE THE WORST THING,

29
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,780
YOUR BRAIN WILL FIND A WAY TO EQUATE YOU GETTING
A B+

30
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,859
TO YOU COMPLETELY RUINING YOUR LIFE.

31
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:11,250
BUT IN REALITY, THE WORST THING IS NEVER REALLY
THAT BAD.

32
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,250
I GET MESSAGES ALL THE TIME FROM PEOPLE SAYING,
"HEY, I'M REALLY INSPIRED BY YOUR CHANNEL."

33
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,528
"I WANT TO START MY OWN, BUT I'M EXPERIENCING
A LOT OF RESISTANCE."

34
00:02:19,528 --> 00:02:25,049
AND HERE'S THE THING... SO DID I.
YOUR BRAIN'S DEFAULT IS LITERALLY TO THINK,

35
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:29,718
"I WILL MAKE A VIDEO. PEOPLE WILL HATE IT."
"EVERYONE WILL MAKE FUN OF ME."

36
00:02:29,718 --> 00:02:33,658
"PEOPLE WILL GET ANGRY."
"THEY WILL COME AND BURN DOWN MY HOUSE."

37
00:02:33,658 --> 00:02:38,628
LIKE SERIOUSLY, THOSE ARE YOUR EITHER CONSCIOUS
OR SUBCONSCIOUS THOUGHTS.

38
00:02:38,628 --> 00:02:42,328
WHAT IS THE REALITY THOUGH?
THE WORST THING THAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOU

39
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:46,730
IN REALITY IS A NEGATIVE COMMENT.
THAT IS IT.

40
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:50,479
AND IT'S THE SAME THING WITH EVERYTHING ELSE
LIKE STARTING A BUSINESS,

41
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,938
OR GIVING A PUBLIC SPEECH.
I HAVE BASICALLY NO EXPERIENCE SPEAKING IN

42
00:02:53,938 --> 00:02:58,138
FRONT OF LARGE CROWDS,
SO IF I GAVE A SPEECH RIGHT NOW IT WOULD PROBABLY

43
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:01,450
SUCK.
I MIGHT HAVE STAGE-FRIGHT, I MIGHT BE AWKWARD,

44
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:04,638
BUT I WOULD NEVER, NEVER REFUSE TO DO IT.
WHY?

45
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,049
BECAUSE WHAT'S THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN?
IT'S NOT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD IS GOING TO

46
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:12,260
MAKE FUN OF ME,
IT'S NOT THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TRY TO KILL

47
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:15,248
ME
EVERYWHERE I GO AFTER MY SPEECH. NO!

48
00:03:15,248 --> 00:03:19,168
IT'S SOME GUY IN THE CROWD WHO NEVER EVEN
GOT INVITED UP ON THE STAGE

49
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:24,120
THINKING THAT MY SPEECH ISN'T THAT GREAT!!
LIKE WHO CARES?!

50
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,308
SO LET ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE...
OUR WASHING MACHINE BROKE DOWN.

51
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,900
NOW,
IF I WASN'T CONSCIOUS OF MY WORRYING,

52
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,639
I WOULD'VE GOTTEN SUPER PISSED OFF, RIGHT?
THAT'S THE NORMAL REACTION TO IT.

53
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:39,120
LIKE I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE SAYING,
"OH THE WASHING MACHINE BROKE DOWN?"

54
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,528
"THAT'S GREAT. NO BIG DEAL."
NO, THAT'S SUPPOSED TO PISS YOU OFF.

55
00:03:43,528 --> 00:03:46,568
NOW YOU'LL NEVER HAVE CLEAN CLOTHES AGAIN.

56
00:03:46,568 --> 00:03:50,908
LOOK,
I SPENT THE FIRST 17 YEARS OF MY LIFE

57
00:03:50,908 --> 00:03:55,620
WASHING MY CLOTHES WITH MY HANDS
WITH SOME SHITTY RUSSIAN DETERGENT.

58
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,079
SO WHAT'S THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN?
THAT I HAVE TO WASH A COUPLE OF SHIRTS

59
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,540
WITH THIS AMAZING COCONUT SOAP I HAVE
FOR A FEW DAYS UNTIL THE WASHING MACHINE

60
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:08,418
GETS FIXED?
OR, THAT I CAN'T WEAR MY FAVORITE SHIRT,

61
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:12,139
SO NOW I HAVE TO PICK FROM THE TWENTY
OTHER AWESOME SHIRTS IN MY CLOSET?

62
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:16,290
I MEAN, IT'S SO RIDICULOUS!
ALWAYS ASK YOURSELF,

63
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,220
WHAT'S THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN?
CLEARLY DEFINE THE WORST OUTCOME,

64
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,040
AND YOU'LL SOON START TO REALIZE
HOW RIDICULOUS MOST OF YOUR WORRIES ARE,

65
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,450
WHICH ACTUALLY LEADS US TO MY NEXT FAVORITE
IDEA...

66
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:31,120
THE ABSURDITY OF IT ALL.

67
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,889
SO I HAVE A FRIEND WHO'S CONSTANTLY WORRIED
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

68
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:36,919
AND HE CALLED ME,
AND HE STARTED TO TELL ME ABOUT

69
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,850
ALL THE STUFF HE'S STRESSED OUT
AND WORRIED ABOUT.

70
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,689
AND I SAID,
"OKAY. LOOK. JUST STOP."

71
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:46,839
CARNEGIE TELLS A STORY OF THIS GUY IN WWII,
WHO'S STUCK IN A SUBMARINE

72
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:49,479
AND BASICALLY KNOWS THAT HE'LL BE DYING IN
THE NEXT FEW HOURS.

73
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,790
AND HE SITS THERE THINKING ABOUT
ALL THE STUFF HE USED TO WORRY ABOUT AT HOME,

74
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,530
AND HOW ABSURD IT WAS,
AND MAKES A PROMISE TO NEVER WASTE HIS LIFE

75
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:00,549
AGAIN LIKE THAT
IF HE SURVIVES.

76
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:06,079
NOW, THAT MIGHT BE HARD TO RESONATE WITH,
SO LET ME GIVE YOU A MORE CONTEMPORARY EXAMPLE.

77
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:11,000
PEOPLE ARE HAVING THEIR HEADS CHOPPED OFF
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,199
EVERY SINGLE DAY!

79
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:16,759
THE ONLY REASON IT'S NOT YOU
IS BECAUSE YOU WERE BORN IN A CERTAIN PLACE

80
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:19,509
AND THEY WEREN'T.
THAT'S IT!

81
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:21,269
NOW GOING BACK TO MY FRIEND,
I TOLD HIM,

82
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:25,560
"LOOK, HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO."
"EVERY DAY, YOU WILL START YOUR MORNING

83
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,100
BY WATCHING SOMEBODY'S HEAD BEING CHOPPED
OFF."

84
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,480
"AND THEN YOU'LL GO ABOUT THE REST OF THE
DAY."

85
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,259
AND HE STARTED FREAKING OUT ABOUT
HOW HE CAN'T DO THAT AND

86
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:36,939
HOW HE DOESN'T LIKE BLOOD AND
WHATEVER...

87
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:41,149
NOW, HERE'S THE THING.
I KNOW THAT'S REALLY CRASS AND MORBID,

88
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:43,779
BUT I DON'T CARE!
IF YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT STUFF,

89
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:48,179
GREAT! YOU DON'T HAVE TO WATCH ANYTHING.
BUT IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT STUPID SHIT

90
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,459
ALL THE TIME,
YOU HAVE A DISEASE!

91
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:55,199
SO YOU EITHER TREAT YOURSELF,
OR NEVER ASK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN STOP WORRYING

92
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,250
AGAIN.
EVER.

93
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,019
HERE'S WHAT I WILL GUARANTEE YOU.
IF YOU START YOUR DAY BY

94
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:03,629
WATCHING SOMEONE ELSE
HAVE THEIR HEAD CHOPPED OFF,

95
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:10,159
NOTHING AND I MEAN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN TO YOU FOR THE REST

96
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,750
OF THE DAY
THAT YOU COULD GET PISSED OFF ABOUT

97
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,050
AND NOT FEEL LIKE A COMPLETE RETARD.

98
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,340
YES, WHEN YOU'VE SEEN SOMEONE'S HEAD CHOPPED
OFF,

99
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:22,489
YOU WILL HAVE A WEIRD FEELING INSIDE YOU
AS SOON AS YOU START TO COMPLAIN ABOUT

100
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,889
HOW YOU DESERVE TO BE PAID MORE AT YOUR JOB,
OR WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO NOW SINCE YOU GOT

101
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:33,110
A B+ INSTEAD OF AN A,
OR HOW YOUR WASHING MACHINE IS BROKEN.

102
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,129
YOU'LL REALIZE THAT IF THAT GUY HAD BEEN
GIVEN THE CHANCE TO LIVE

103
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:40,790
AND WEAR THAT SAME DIRTY SHIRT
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE

104
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:46,390
WITHOUT EVER BEING ABLE TO WASH IT,
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE HAPPIEST MAN ALIVE.

105
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:50,139
REALIZE THE ABSURDITY OF IT ALL.

106
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:53,560
THE THIRD BIG IDEA:
STAYING BUSY.

107
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,189
NOW I DON'T MEAN THE AVERAGE BUSY PERSON.
ACTUALLY, THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WORRY THE

108
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:00,910
MOST.
THE GUY WHO WORKS 12-HOUR DAYS,

109
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:05,860
AND THEN COMES HOME AND WATCHES FOX ALL NIGHT
WORRYING ABOUT WHETHER SOME GUY CAN MARRY

110
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,879
ANOTHER GUY
OR ABOUT ALL THE FOREIGNERS WHO WILL COME

111
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,889
AND TAKE HIS JOB,
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HE IS THE ONLY ONE ENTITLED

112
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:13,889
TO THAT JOB.

113
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:18,460
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT KIND OF BUSY...
HERE'S HOW I LIKE STAY BUSY...

114
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:22,250
READ A BOOK THAT I LIKE.
GO TO THE GYM WITH MY GIRLFRIEND.

115
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,680
PLAY AROUND ON THE PIANO AND COMPOSE.
COOK AMAZING FOOD.

116
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,829
WORK ON A PROJECT I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT.

117
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:34,589
NOW, HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DO THAT...
YOUR BRAIN CAN'T THINK OF TWO THINGS AT ONE

118
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:36,919
TIME.
IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE THAT CAPABILITY.

119
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,080
YOU CAN TRY RIGHT NOW IF YOU WANT.
YOU CAN'T THINK OF YOUR BROKEN WASHING MACHINE

120
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:44,139
AND AT THE SAME TIME,
THINK OF HOW MUCH YOU LOVE PLAYING SOCCER.

121
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:45,280
IT'S NOT HOW YOUR BRAIN WORKS.

122
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,369
SO THE BEST WAY TO GET RID OF THE NEGATIVE
THOUGHTS IN YOUR HEAD

123
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,079
IS TO ACTUALLY START PUTTING POSITIVE THOUGHTS
IN THERE.

124
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,269
GET BUSY WITH WHAT YOU LOVE
AND YOUR BRAIN SIMPLY WON'T EVEN HAVE THE

125
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:57,959
ABILITY TO WORRY.

126
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:01,579
AND FINALLY A QUESTION THAT
REALLY REALLY RESONATED WITH ME.

127
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:05,379
HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IN YOUR LIFE...
YOU'RE GOING TO WORK AND WORRY YOUR ENTIRE

128
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:08,819
LIFE
SO YOU CAN GATHER A BUNCH OF STUFF,

129
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,279
LIKE YOUR HOUSE AND ALL THE STUPID SHIT IN
IT.

130
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:16,519
NOW... IF YOU'RE LUCKY,
AFTER 50 YEARS OF ALL THAT WORRY AND STRESS,

131
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:20,409
ALL YOUR STUFF MIGHT BE WORTH A MILLION DOLLARS.

132
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:25,320
HERE'S THE QUESTION,
WOULD YOU SELL YOUR LEGS FOR A MILLION DOLLARS?

133
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:30,040
LET ME ASK YOU THIS,
WOULD YOU SELL YOUR LEGS FOR A BILLION DOLLARS?

134
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,389
I WOULDN'T.
AND YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T EITHER.

135
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:35,579
WOULD YOU SELL YOUR ARMS FOR ANOTHER BILLION
DOLLARS?

136
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:36,689
NO?

137
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,700
THERE YOU GO,
YOU ALREADY HAVE SOMETHING THAT YOU VALUE

138
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,949
AT TWO BILLION DOLLARS!
ACTUALLY, HOPEFULLY MORE...

139
00:08:43,948 --> 00:08:47,899
BUT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ALL ZEN,
YOU COULD BE A GREEDY CAPITALIST LIKE ME

140
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:49,929
AND UNDERSTAND THIS.

141
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,308
NOW HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO...
YOU'RE GOING TO IGNORE AND NOT UTILIZE

142
00:08:53,308 --> 00:08:58,558
SOMETHING WORTH TWO BILLION DOLLARS,
BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO BUSY WORRYING AND STRESSING

143
00:08:58,558 --> 00:09:02,028
ABOUT THE THINGS THAT MIGHT AMOUNT TO 1 MILLION
DOLLARS

144
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:05,458
AT THE END OF YOUR LIFE.
OH, AND YOU'LL BE CONSIDERED REALLY LUCKY

145
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,138
IF THAT HAPPENS BY THE WAY!

146
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:10,778
ALRIGHT,
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE SEEING HOW CRAZY THAT

147
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:14,169
IS,
BUT THAT'S KIND OF LIKE HAVING A HUGE MANSION,

148
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:18,188
A PERSONAL JET,
EVERY SINGLE CAR YOU EVER WISHED FOR,

149
00:09:18,188 --> 00:09:23,278
AND NOT USING AND ENJOYING THOSE THINGS,
BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO WORRIED ABOUT ONE DAY

150
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:29,159
BEING ABLE TO BUY A COROLLA.
THAT IS CRAZY! ...AND SAD.

151
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:34,980
YOU ALREADY HAVE EVERYTHING THAT YOU VALUE
AT BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
