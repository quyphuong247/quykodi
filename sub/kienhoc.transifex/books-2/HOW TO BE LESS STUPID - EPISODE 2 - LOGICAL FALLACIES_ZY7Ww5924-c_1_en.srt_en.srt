1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,599
1.

2
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:05,759
Argumentum ad populum
You tell your friend that the claims he’s

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,539
making are pretty absurd and that he has no
evidence for them whatsoever.

4
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:16,149
Instead of addressing the issue, he tells
you that if they were so absurd, 1.6 billion

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,278
other people wouldn’t believe in them.

6
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:23,920
Congratulations, you’ve unfortunately just
been served argumentum ad populum.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,280
Apparently just because 1.6 billion people
believe in something, it must be true.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,070
According to the same logic, the world must
have been flat a few thousand years ago since

9
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,530
a lot of people believed in that too.

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,980
2.

11
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:43,779
Anecdotal evidence
Your friend tells you that her grandma only

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,879
ate carrots her whole life and she lived to
be a 109 years old.

13
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:49,568
You tell her, “Okay, cool.

14
00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:50,569
Good for her.”

15
00:00:50,569 --> 00:00:51,800
But she’s not content with that.

16
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:54,698
She wants you to only eat carrots as well.

17
00:00:54,698 --> 00:01:00,000
If her grandma had such great results, you’ll
surely have great results as well.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,030
You tell her that you look at evidence through
scientific studies involving large sample

19
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,060
sizes for what is ideal to eat but she doesn’t
understand.

20
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,740
In her world, smoking is beneficial since
there’s a 109-year-old smoker somewhere

21
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:14,929
in the world right now without lung cancer.

22
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:15,950
3.

23
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:21,329
Correlation proves causation
A friend of yours tells you that he started

24
00:01:21,328 --> 00:01:25,209
using this new soap and his acne have been
getting much better.

25
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:29,000
You realize that that might very well be true,
but you’re also skeptical.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,280
You share this with him and he gets mad.

27
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,450
What do you mean?

28
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:35,700
He knows for a fact that ever since he started
using this soap his acne have been getting

29
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,000
better.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,129
You tell him that yes, while that could be
true, it could also be because we’re getting

31
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:42,209
more sun now cause it’s the summer.

32
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:45,998
He changed his diet a little while ago, and
that also might be affecting it.

33
00:01:45,998 --> 00:01:47,868
He also got a new job and might be less stressed.

34
00:01:47,868 --> 00:01:51,640
You bring up all these points and tell him
that even though the soap could be legit,

35
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,320
you can’t really say for sure.

36
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,589
He’s still mad.

37
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,899
He doesn’t understand that correlation does
not prove causation, especially with his impressive

38
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:02,989
sample size of 1.

39
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,390
4.

40
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:09,199
Wishful thinking
Your friend tells you that he loves the thought

41
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,439
of being massaged by the spaghetti monster
and his tentacles for eternity.

42
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,180
You ask him if he has a reason to believe
in something like that.

43
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,670
He tells you that it’s so consoling to him.

44
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:20,979
What is your alternative?

45
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:23,169
You die and then there might be nothing?

46
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:26,059
All you can tell him is, “I don’t know?”

47
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,439
That kind of uncertainty sounds terrible and
isn’t very consoling, therefore the whole

48
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:36,359
spaghetti monster gently caressing you for
eternity thing must be true.

49
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,520
5.

50
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:43,780
Shifting the burden of proof
A friends of yours tells you that Zeus exists

51
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,140
and that he is the one true God.

52
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:50,839
You ask him if he has any reason to make that
claim or if there’s any way he can prove

53
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,069
that statement.

54
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:56,629
He laughs at you and tells you, “Well, how
about you prove that he doesn’t exist.”

55
00:02:56,629 --> 00:03:00,210
You tell him you can’t do that, just like
you can’t disprove that there isn’t a

56
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,320
teapot orbiting somewhere around the sun right
now even though we would never just assume

57
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,229
that a teapot like that existed.

58
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,679
He laughs again and says, “See...

59
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,510
You can’t disprove it therefore Zeus exists.”

60
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:16,389
You want to bring up the point again that
the burden of proof lies on the person making

61
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:19,839
the claim but at this point you hopefully
realize that you’re not really going anywhere

62
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,810
with this and perhaps have an even more important
realization that you really need some less

63
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,930
shitty friends.
