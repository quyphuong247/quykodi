1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,539
I remember a couple of years ago I used to
get very little sleep. And I really struggled

2
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:19,739
with making the right decisions. I’d be
running on four hours of sleep, and when I

3
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:24,179
was presented with something healthy to eat
and an unhealthy choice, it was really hard

4
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,390
for me to pick the healthy one.
And now a couple of years later, I get plenty

5
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,980
of sleep and it’s so much easier to make
the better decisions. So whether you need

6
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:37,939
to refrain from eating something unhealthy,
or you need to actually do something productive

7
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:43,079
like working on your project, getting plenty
of sleep will make it so much easier, and

8
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,039
I can attest to this from my own experience.
So the first big idea for strong willpower

9
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,719
is to get adequate amounts of sleep. When
you don’t get enough sleep you’re prone

10
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:59,489
to all kinds of stress, and cravings, and
temptation. Research has shown that being

11
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:05,250
sleep deprived is very similar to being mildly
intoxicated which is probably not the best

12
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,599
time to be making decisions. And too little
sleep has been shown to cause problems that

13
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:16,839
mimic those associated with ADHD. So getting
enough sleep is absolutely one of the most

14
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,310
important things you can do for your willpower.

15
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,810
Now just like you go to the gym to build muscle
and get stronger, you can do the same thing

16
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:31,840
for your brain. And the activity that trains
your brain is meditation. It makes your brain

17
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,100
grow denser, packing in more grey matter just
like a muscle bulking up from exercise. And

18
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:43,868
research has shown that those who meditate
really do have more grey matter in their prefrontal

19
00:01:43,868 --> 00:01:50,030
cortex. And the prefrontal cortex is the area
associated with decision making and willpower.

20
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,129
It’s the part of the brain that gets you
to say no to something unhealthy, and it’s

21
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:58,879
the part of the brain that gets you to get
up and start working on your project.

22
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:04,280
And the impact of meditation is fascinating.
Even after only a few weeks of being consistent

23
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,009
with it, we can already observe the brain
structure physically changing. You don’t

24
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:14,089
need to meditate for hours either. Even a
very short period of meditation is effective.

25
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,430
You can start with five minutes of meditation
focusing on your breath and move up to ten,

26
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,480
fifteen, or however long you like, but it’s
much better to be consistent and do only five

27
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:29,500
minutes than be inconsistent. So I would personally
highly recommend starting with five minutes

28
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,979
if you’re just starting out.

29
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:37,539
I also get a ton of emails and messages, and
what I used to do before was wake up and check

30
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:42,009
all that stuff first thing in the morning.
And I would spend hours doing that, and then

31
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:47,859
when it was time for me to actually do creative
work, I was just completely exhausted.

32
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,120
And this is because willpower’s like a muscle.
It gets tired. It’s kind of like going to

33
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,239
the gym to deadlift, and instead deadlifting
first, you decide it’s a good idea to run

34
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,539
on the treadmill for two hours first and then
deadlift. So by the time you’re done running,

35
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:05,409
you probably won’t have the energy to deadlift,
and if you somehow do, it’s not going to

36
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:09,900
be the most effective workout.
And that’s exactly how the brain works too.

37
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,769
You start out with your willpower for the
day and then it just keeps getting depleted

38
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:17,908
and depleted. So one of the most important
things I’ve done is to wake up and start

39
00:03:17,908 --> 00:03:22,269
with my creative work. I never check any of
the messages first thing in the morning anymore

40
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,560
because I know my willpower’s going to get
depleted.

41
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,098
And I know so many people who wake up and
go straight to Facebook or do something else

42
00:03:30,098 --> 00:03:34,628
that isn’t important. Don’t do that. You’ll
deplete your willpower, and then you won’t

43
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:39,469
be able to do what’s actually important.
Instead, wake up and do that important thing

44
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:45,158
first before your willpower gets depleted.

45
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:49,310
So those are the three of my favorite ideas
from the book that I’ve found to be really

46
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:55,670
effective in my life. And to recap them briefly…
1. Make sure you’re not sleep deprived.

47
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:59,568
Not getting enough sleep is one of the biggest
enemies to your willpower.

48
00:03:59,568 --> 00:04:05,068
2. Just like you workout to build up muscle,
you can meditate to build up your prefrontal

49
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:09,408
cortex.
3. Willpower’s like a muscle. It gets tired.

50
00:04:09,408 --> 00:04:13,878
Don’t wake up and get on Facebook first
thing in the morning or do anything else that

51
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:28,899
isn’t important, instead do the most important
thing first before your willpower gets depleted.
