1
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:16,239
Doctor David Burns have found in his late research on cognitive therapy

2
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:21,279
that depression can be cured naturally. without taking any antidepressant drug

3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,039
We're going to go through the process about doing so but first i want you to keep in mind

4
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,199
That you're not the only person , who's suffering from depression

5
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,619
taking in consideration that Others have gone through the same painful experiences

6
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,859
Can bring about , a relief and a sense of unity

7
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:40,519
Also if you're someone who's positive and you think that depression is not for you anymore

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,800
and that you have worked it out long ago

9
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,359
i think you should reconcider that thought again.

10
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,879
in many cases , positive people get so Egotestic about their positivity

11
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,219
to a point that they start resisting unpleasent emotions like sadness

12
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:57,460
it's like saying "oh i got to be positive"

13
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,079
"man are not supposed to cry , i can't fall into this sadness thing"

14
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,519
"because if i do i won't be able to maintain my positivity"

15
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,259
and ironicly by resisting their mood swing

16
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,900
they get depressed

17
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,380
sadness is not depression

18
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:13,339
it's okey to feel down every now and then.

19
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,159
The Big idea from this introduction is to stop resisting the state that you find your self in.

20
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,500
even clinging to positive emotions can make you depressed

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,659
Emotions are just 'chemicals' running through your body

22
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,579
and those emotional chemicals are not permanent.

23
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:29,299
they are meant to come and go.

24
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,539
just like any other experience.

25
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,120
everything is in a constant state of change.

26
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,120
and now with that said , let's move on to the cure for depression.

27
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,900
First we need to understand how you got depressed in the first place

28
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,900
and then we get to solve your illness.

29
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,620
think of it as a math equation , if we happen to internalize the rule

30
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,579
we can solve the equation.

31
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:52,039
let's say that we are sitting in a restaurant

32
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,340
and unintentionally , you a glass infront of me

33
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,520
since am positive , my reaction would be to laugh hysterically like if it was no big of a deal

34
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,859
it's funny for me.

35
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:03,060
as for you

36
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,000
you got pissed off by the noises it produced when it hit the ground

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,039
notice that , it's the same Event for both of us

38
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:13,419
the only difference is the way we perceived that event.

39
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:15,179
so the rule here is simple :

40
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,840
your thoughts create your emotions.

41
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,439
you feel the way you do because of the thoughts you're thinking right now

42
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:26,680
that's why in some guided meditations , they tell you to focus on what you're thinking at the moment

43
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,560
to identify what you're feeling.

44
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,219
if you're confused about an event that happened to you lately in the day

45
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:36,599
Then , your emotional , state at the moment could be confusion

46
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,519
Doctor burns describes how depression occurs

47
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,460
First : we have the event that takes place in the outside world

48
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:48,260
Second : we interpret the event with a series of thoughts this is called your internal dialogue.

49
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:53,199
and finally : your feelings are created by your thoughts and not the actual event

50
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,599
in other words

51
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:59,879
the way you think in any situation will determine how you will feel about it.

52
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,120
Now that you've got the rule , let's look at the equation.

53
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,000
When you interpret an event as negative , doctor burns describes that as "cognitive distortion"

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,419
if you perceive an event as negative you create distorted thoughts

55
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:14,599
and therefore unpleasant emotions.

56
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,219
sometimes you could be right

57
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:17,719
the event is unpleasant

58
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:22,080
it needs to be interpreted that way and we have to be realistic about it.

59
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,600
but , for people who suffer from "mild" levels of depression

60
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,939
those cognitive distortions become so habituated to a certain degree

61
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:33,599
That they start perceiving everything in black and white.

62
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,919
doctor burns cited ten different cognitive distortions that you tend to have when you're depressed.

63
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:42,159
let's look at some examples for the most common ones

64
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,639
let's say that you want to learn improv-comedy.

65
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,959
you took some classes and after a month you decided to give it a shot and go live.

66
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,659
so you go on stage and start cracking the lamest jokes ever since you're nervous and it's your first time.

67
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,500
the audience got bored and left

68
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,900
as a result , you think to yourself that you have no chance of becoming a comedian

69
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,080
or that you will never going to be good at doing anything

70
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,340
this kind of cognitive distortion is called all or nothing thinking

71
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,360
either i'm good at this or i will never be , even if i put it into practice.

72
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,819
either i'm a charismatic confident guy , or i will never be that way.

73
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:20,219
and you can clearly tell that it's all pure nonsense.

74
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,080
this type of cognitive distortion is conveying an exageration of a negative event

75
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:30,019
the event itself is negative but instead of perceiving it as a passing experience

76
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,759
you hold on to the cons.

77
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,500
this leads us to the second cognitive distortion

78
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,720
this one is called "mental filtering"

79
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,680
you take one negative thing in any situation and keep dwelling on it

80
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,360
this video as an example.

81
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,759
no matter how much i put the time to make valuable content for my viewers

82
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:52,680
there will always be that one guy who will filter all the value and leave a negative comment.

83
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,459
instead of saying "okey let's evaluate this objectively"

84
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:58,259
what did i learn from this video ?

85
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:01,399
i learned about something called "cognitive therapy"

86
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,719
i can cure my depression

87
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,400
without taking any anti-depressant drug

88
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,579
see ? at least you learned something.

89
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:10,599
to be honest i'm not resentful toward those people

90
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,220
because they are so addicted to negativity

91
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,360
that it became normal to them

92
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,980
just as normal as holding a fork.

93
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,819
people who perceive reality from a mental filter

94
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:25,360
no matter how hard you try to convince them that the event is actually positive

95
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,000
they will always find something negative about it.

96
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,700
let's say that you got hit by a car

97
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,240
you're on your way to the hospital

98
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,120
and no matter how much the doctors keep telling you that you didn't get a scratch

99
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,959
you just got dizzy and you're ready to go home in three hours

100
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,959
you keep thinking to yourself : oh my god what if i got brain damage ?

101
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,939
and if my brain is damaged will my girlfriend still want to go out with me ?

102
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:51,579
this one is called "jumping to conclusions"

103
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:54,439
this is like exagerating with your expectations.

104
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,459
and projecting to unrealistic conclusions.

105
00:05:57,459 --> 00:06:04,000
since the process of emotion formation happens in a fraction of a second we have little to no control over it.

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,300
the good news is however , even if those thoughts get distorted and you fall into depression

107
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,100
you still have a chance to re-construct them after their occurence.

108
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,120
you have the opportunity to re-frame those distorted thoughts

109
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,019
and therefore change your mood.

110
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:20,919
it's scary how one thought can have the power

111
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,439
to change someone's life for the better or the worst

112
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:30,120
david burns presented us with some practical strategies for dealing with these cognitive distortions.

113
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:36,540
the first step : is to start being mindful enough to catch those automatic negative thoughts and write them down

114
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,840
don't let them buzz around in your head.

115
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:44,339
the second step : is to learn precisely how you are twisting things and blowing them out of proportion.

116
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:48,939
and the third : is to substitute a more objective thought that puts the lie

117
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:51,839
to the one wich made you look down on yourself.

118
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,419
if you hear a thought telling you that you are not good at doing anything

119
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,920
catch that negative thought and write it down.

120
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,480
now write a logical more realistic counter thought to it

121
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,300
try to find out all the logical reasons that convey clearly that you are good at something

122
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,420
no matter what the thought says.

123
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,360
you can read that paper every morning before you go about your day

124
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,220
and with time

125
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,740
the subconscious will re-wire itself.

126
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,480
and instead of weighing you down

127
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,120
your thoughts will start boosting your mood naturally.

128
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,019
this is the basic gist of cognitive behavioral therapy.

129
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:27,240
so far we saw three big ideas.

130
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,259
the first big idea is that your emotions are created by your thoughts and not the actual event.

131
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:36,159
the second big idea is cognitive distortions.

132
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,520
we saw the most common distortions that you tend to fall into when you're depressed.

133
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:43,500
and finally we looked at the practical side of the book.

134
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:50,079
wich is to fix those distortions by writing them and replacing them with more realistic logical thoughts.

135
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,279
and with time

136
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,719
your brain will re-wire itself for the better.
