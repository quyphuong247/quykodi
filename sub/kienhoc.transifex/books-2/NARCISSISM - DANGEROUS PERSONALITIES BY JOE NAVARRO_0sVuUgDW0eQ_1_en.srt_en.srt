1
00:00:17,528 --> 00:00:21,740
It's quite self-evident that you need to confront
unconscious people more often to practice

2
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:24,038
mindfulness and non-reactiveness.

3
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:27,960
Despite this fact, certain people are not
only negative but dangerous.

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,800
You know, there are varying degrees in negativity.

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,719
It could extend to involve criminals and serial
killers or simply the nagging spouse who never

6
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:37,170
stops complaining.

7
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,329
That being the case, you need to learn how
to identify the ones you should avoid altogether

8
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:44,439
and the people that are witless but non-threatening.

9
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:48,099
The biggest shock I had while reading the
book is when the author said that most dangerous

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,539
personalities are people who behave often
like very normal individuals.

11
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:56,518
What got me further concerned is how some
of them could turn out to be highly intelligent,

12
00:00:56,518 --> 00:01:01,768
seductive, ambitious, or even famous wich
makes it tricky to identify them.

13
00:01:01,768 --> 00:01:06,810
The author's job, as an fbi profiler, is to
converse with a stranger for a few minutes

14
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,890
& based on his behavioral quirks and verbals
he should discern if he's dangerous or not.

15
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,390
IN THIS BOOK, he shares decades of experience
on the traits of The most dangerous personalities

16
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,390
out there.

17
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,310
Today, we'll be covering the traits of the
first dangerous personality but before we

18
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,421
begin, I'd like you to keep in mind, in each
and every one of these personalities, there

19
00:01:25,421 --> 00:01:27,270
are varying degrees.

20
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:28,519
Some are worse than others.

21
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:33,250
I'll be sharing stories & behavioral cues
to illustrate cases from all over the spectum

22
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,368
so you could get a sense of who's hostile
and who's tolerable.

23
00:01:37,368 --> 00:01:41,670
While I talk, try to picture someone you know
who could match the character traits that

24
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,269
I'm going to describe.

25
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,269
Let's dig in.

26
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:49,429
ONE-THE NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY:

27
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,680
There could be numerous definitions for the
word narcissist.

28
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,120
In this context, it precicely refers to someone
who seeks his own happiness by all means necessary.

29
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,150
The opposite is the normal person who does
strive for his own happiness but without violating

30
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,439
any laws or boundaries.

31
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:11,120
CHARACTER TRAIT NUMBER ONE-EGOCENTRIC
-> The core personality trait that constitutes

32
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,310
a narcissist is egocentrism.

33
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,000
There comes a time in your childhood where
you start perceiving yourself as the inmost

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,699
center of the universe.

35
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:23,729
Should you not get the toys you want, the
food & affection you want, you get all whiny

36
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:24,949
& fidgity.

37
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:29,509
Everyone around ought to serve you your needs
or else they'll get tormented by an everlasting

38
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:31,879
stream of tears & screaming.

39
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:37,079
Much like the oedipus complex where the boy
declares war on his dad, this egoistic phase

40
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,100
is also as normal and is outgrown by most
children.

41
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:46,090
Unfortunately, kids who fail to get past this
stage develop the narcissistic personality.

42
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:51,620
Even in their late life, adultlife, they still
carry along that same old perception of themselves

43
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,908
as being the center of the world.

44
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:56,039
The following are basic examples:

45
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:58,039
Let's say your friend calls you for coffee.

46
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:01,979
You respond that you're busy, he gets really
mad & accuse you of hating him.

47
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:05,949
He or she will often try to provoke you by
saying that you don't want to hang out with

48
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:06,949
them anymore.

49
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:11,238
Should you not text a narcissist back in time,
they would spend weeks ignoring you.

50
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,400
If they ask you to lend them some money, you
apologize and say that you can't, They would

51
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,569
get mad and start calling you names.

52
00:03:17,568 --> 00:03:20,699
This is the narcissistic egocentrism at work.

53
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:25,289
Either they get what they want from you without
delay or else they turn defensive.

54
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,539
It's all about them, their needs.

55
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:30,370
Do you think they'll take into account your
personal issues?

56
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,370
your feelings?

57
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,370
your time?

58
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,370
hell no!

59
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,789
A narcissistic friend would call you up in
the middle of the night because they had insomnia

60
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:41,158
or some other bullshit, they'd want you to
narrate a story for them to help them fall

61
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:42,158
asleep.

62
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:47,379
They couldn't care less if you had work tomorrow,
a family or kids to care for.

63
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:48,379
2.0

64
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:52,259
While going through the various real-life
stories the author had shared, I remembered

65
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:55,539
my own personal experiences with narcissistic
friends.

66
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:59,840
Hanging out with narcissists, If you don't
comply to any of their suggestions, they would

67
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,469
hold a grudge against you for weeks.

68
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:05,939
Most people are afraid to disagree with them,
even their families.

69
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:10,009
SHOULd you ever say no when they ask for a
favor, they would mock you and or block your

70
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:13,239
facebook or any other childrish variant of
that.

71
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,340
Their best friends are often people who slave
for them.

72
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:21,399
You can almost feel a negative aura radiating
from narcissistic personalities.

73
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,879
Simply nod your head to each & every stupid
request of theirs and you won't experience

74
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,750
any dark force emissions.

75
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,589
Conclusion:
So the first character trait of the narcissistic

76
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:32,560
personality is egocentrism.

77
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,410
The person has this distorted conception that
the whole world revolves around him.

78
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,770
Consequently, he will behave like a baby,
in cases where people refuse to serve him

79
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:44,029
his wants & desires.

80
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:48,198
->>>>Egocentrism also refers to conceit & pretentiousness.

81
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:52,270
Because they see themselves as the center
of the universe, they will toil to get everyone's

82
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:53,269
attention.

83
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:57,740
In any social gathering, narcissistic personalities
ensure that everyone perceives them as high

84
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,930
value people.

85
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,879
They want all eyes on them, either by wearing
expensive watches, clothes, doing dramatic

86
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:07,300
entrances or by perfectly dolling themselves
up.

87
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,129
More often than not, they shamlessly boast
about their connections with so-and-so rich

88
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:13,050
& famous individuals.

89
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,871
Although they accomplish very little, they
never cease to brag & not only that, they

90
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,969
perceive themselves as professionals in their
field.

91
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:25,289
Narcissists, you show them their flaws, they
start crying or worse fault you for failing

92
00:05:25,288 --> 00:05:27,560
to discern their skillfulness.

93
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,038
Confronted with a crisis, they blame everyone
except themselves.

94
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,149
They operate on a built-in victim mindset.

95
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:38,839
Because he's conceited, because he has an
exaggerated self-love, the narcissistic perceives

96
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,519
himself as perfect.

97
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:44,459
And so pointing the finger at himself is out
of the question, eventhough he's convinced

98
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:45,959
that he's in the wrong.

99
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:54,969
Admitting his mistakes would contradict what
he conceives himself to be, flawless.

100
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:00,039
2-OVERVALUES SELF, DEVALUES OTHERS
-> A solid depiction of extreme narcissism

101
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:01,038
is hitler.

102
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:04,969
His craving for attention lead him to attempt
the domination of the whole world.

103
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,520
He thought of the nazis as the ultimate human
race.

104
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,599
And saw everyone else as marginal.

105
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,600
Narcissistic personalities have an eerie ability
to spot insecurity in others.

106
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,500
Thet often use this to put others down to
make themselves look better.

107
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,660
Much like a bully.

108
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,270
More on bullying later by the way.

109
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:25,839
Eventhough they don't always verbalize aloud
their insults, they never cease to judge & mock

110
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:28,258
people mentally, within themselves.

111
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,050
If you've ever hung out with a narcissist,
you've probably noticed how often they talk

112
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,220
in people's backs.

113
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:38,150
They will scan every environment they enter
& judge anyone around based on their looks,

114
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:43,609
clothes, the way they walk, just to reassure
themselves that they still look better than,

115
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,610
perfect & unique.

116
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,449
You will never ever see them cheering someone
up.

117
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:52,091
In fact, if you're anxious before your first
date, they'll make you even more nervous by

118
00:06:52,091 --> 00:06:54,949
narrating how awkward their first date was.

119
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:56,709
A toxic presence.

120
00:06:56,709 --> 00:07:01,279
They always make sure everyone around them
feels like shit, as this, in turn, will boost

121
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,198
their mood for the better.

122
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,960
Common examples is how, at times, they'd importune
you with lame questions non-stop till you

123
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,299
lose your temper.

124
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,980
They will not cease to question until you
answer them.

125
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,600
Or another one, they would list out your weaknessess
infront of everyone just to provoke a reaction

126
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,970
from you.

127
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,449
Anything that's annoying, tempting or irritating,
they will use it against you.

128
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:25,829
The reason why they bully you is because they
lack empathy.

129
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:27,899
And this is the third character trait.

130
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:31,729
3-INSTEAD OF EMPATHY, YOU'll find arrogance
and entitlement.

131
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,860
-> Narcissistic personalities have a hard
time taking into account other people's feelings.

132
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,220
Before acting, they think only about getting
their way, disregarding what could ensue.

133
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,220
(2.0)

134
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,949
I once stumbled across a medical forum.

135
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:47,780
People in the comments were sharing tips & tricks
on how to manage a certain chronic illness.

136
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:51,209
To my surprise, some troll was making fun
of them.

137
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:55,568
I couldn't process the fact that eventhough
these people were in pain, that guy didn't

138
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:58,160
hesistate to post his screwed-up remarks.

139
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,689
Can't he see that they are in constant physical
pain?

140
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,279
can't he feel what they feel?

141
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,179
This is the narcissistic personality.

142
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:11,329
What's more screwed-up is that some narcissists
perceive illness in others as weakness.

143
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:15,008
They feel better in the presence of other
people's suffering.

144
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:17,810
(2.0)
Much like transactions,

145
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,280
friendship for them can be traded for any
kind of material value.

146
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:27,888
If I need a ride to college everyday and you
have a car, deal, let's be friends, for now.

147
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:32,658
If you don't have a car, I can't use you & hence
it's needless befriending you.

148
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:35,100
Imagine you're sick for example and can't
go out.

149
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,969
They wouldn't understand, and accuse you of
not wanting to hang out with them.

150
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:43,659
They may phone about your sickness, but only
to inquire about when you're going get well

151
00:08:43,658 --> 00:08:45,759
and available again for them.

152
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,610
There's a certain agenda behind their empathy.

153
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:53,759
Showing care, love and affection, even towards
their kids, is a matter of give and take.

154
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,078
more on narcissistic parents later.

155
00:08:56,078 --> 00:09:00,779
Sometimes, although you DO serve them what
they want, they break their promises.

156
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,689
Nothing for something, that's the mentality.

157
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,770
The examples I've been shaaring so far are
considered mild.

158
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:12,000
The following is a relevent story that illustrates
the most extreme cases concerning lack of

159
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
empathy.

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,720
You've probably heard of the parents who are
videogame addicts.

161
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,779
One day, the screaming of their baby had been
too loud and irritating.

162
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:20,789
what did they do?

163
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:24,719
They resolved the issue by killing the boy
and burrying him in the backyard so they could

164
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,210
play at ease.

165
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:30,100
Now don't panic, not all narcissistic people
are quite as crazy.

166
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,500
There are varying degrees to this symdrome.

167
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,399
Some are worse than others but this example
should illustrate the most extreme.

168
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,539
A yearning to please oneself by any means,
at others' expense and with reptilian indifference.

169
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:48,110
TRAIT 4--TAKES SHORTCUTS, BENDS RULES, VIOLATES
BOUNDARIES

170
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,000
1-VIOLATES BOUNDARIES
-> They will hurt you emotionally and or financially,

171
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,610
and you'll never hear a single apology from
them.

172
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,350
The narcissistic person feels entitled to
do anything.

173
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:03,509
And because he sees perfection in himself
& his very acts, BEAUTY is in the eyes of

174
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:04,809
the narcissistic personality.

175
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:06,828
A solid depiction could be:

176
00:10:06,828 --> 00:10:11,169
The employee who takes financial risks unbeknown
to his company's CEO.

177
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:16,469
The boss who threatens to fire his employee
when he refuses to lend him money, or service.

178
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:22,050
The abusive parent, the pedophile priest,
the thief banker, all these pals are vivid

179
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:25,879
depictions of someone who violates personal
and professional boundaries.

180
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:31,318
The narcissistic personality will thoughtlessly
risk your time, money and at worst your life

181
00:10:31,318 --> 00:10:32,928
to get their way.

182
00:10:32,928 --> 00:10:36,529
Stepping back, saying sorry is not in their
DNA.

183
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:40,019
They think that there is nothing wrong in
their foolishness.

184
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:41,019
(2.0)

185
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:44,279
2- BENDS RULES, TAKES SHORTCUTS
This personality is also known for its yearning

186
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,289
to take the easy way out.

187
00:10:46,289 --> 00:10:50,928
Have you ever heard of an athlete who got
caught using steroids during a competition?

188
00:10:50,928 --> 00:10:53,850
Bingo! that's probably a narcissistic person.

189
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,019
Another good example of bending the rules
is bullies.

190
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:59,600
Bullying and narcissism go hand in hand.

191
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,850
Bullies will violate your personal space,
comfort and or laws and policies of their

192
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,139
college, workplace, etc.

193
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:11,659
Though they're fully conscious of the wrongness
of their acts, they keep on regardless.

194
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:15,250
Some people tolerate bullying just because
they think that the bully is going to change

195
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,100
for the better one day or another.

196
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,420
Keep in mind, those bloodsuckers never change,
not until they seek medical care.

197
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:25,338
More on bullying in the points to come.

198
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:30,220
Before we move on to the next trait, a crucial
thing to remember is that, these people may

199
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,160
act very normal & friendly most of the time.

200
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,189
Especially around strangers.

201
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:40,179
But wait until you get to know them, and you'll
soon realize that their dark side overweighs

202
00:11:40,178 --> 00:11:41,889
their humaneness.

203
00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:45,838
Their ability to act accordingly more often
makes it harder for you to figure out whether

204
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,570
or not they're dangerous.

205
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,320
But with this information at your disposal,
you will hopefully get a glimpse on how to

206
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,920
identify narcississtic personalities.

207
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:01,370
5-NEED TO CONTROL:
Acting normal surely makes it harder for you

208
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:05,480
to see past their mask, but what makes it
even more difficult is how some of them are

209
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,019
highly cunning, seductive, ambitious or famous.

210
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:14,548
I know, Saying that narcissistic people could
be ambitious contradicts what I said earlier

211
00:12:14,548 --> 00:12:17,220
concerning their yearning for shortcuts.

212
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,800
But recall that I also said that there are
varying degrees & types of narcissists.

213
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:28,769
On one level you could find someone, who embodies
80% egotism, 80% lack of empathy, and 0% longing

214
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:30,000
for shortcuts.

215
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,379
Thus he'll turn out to be intelligent, diligent
and ambitious.

216
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:39,689
But on another level, you could also meet
another one who embodies 0% lack of empathy,

217
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:49,189
only 40% egotism and whose yearning for shortcuts
is at a 100% wich makes him unambitious, unintelligent

218
00:12:49,188 --> 00:12:50,188
and lazy.

219
00:12:50,188 --> 00:12:53,399
There is no black and white when it comes
to studying people's behaviors.

220
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:56,389
Sorry for the digression, I had to.

221
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:57,470
Now let's keep on.

222
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:02,120
A large number of quote on quote "ambitious
narcissistic personalities" hustle hard to

223
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,828
reach high positions(like policeman, surgeon),
not for the large salary, but for they can

224
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,189
control others.

225
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,960
A highly narcissistic doctor may take pleasure
in the suffering of his patients by experimenting

226
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,019
with various medications on him.

227
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:20,490
Owing to the fact that if he follows what
the doctor says, he'll get better in no time.

228
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:25,649
After a decade of trying out various methods,
the patient is confused as to why nothing

229
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:27,338
has worked so far.

230
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:33,059
Perhaps the problem is not the type of medication,
but the type of doctor himself.

231
00:13:33,058 --> 00:13:36,850
Other "narcissistic" doctors couldn't care
less to explain all the details about your

232
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,269
illness, just to keep you in the dark so you're
obliged to frequent them more often.

233
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:43,659
They want you to visit them more frequently.

234
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:46,850
They feel significance when someone is reaching
out to them.

235
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:52,730
They, take pleasure in that godlike feeling
of someone begging for their help.

236
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,550
Now don't get all paranoid.

237
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:58,269
These are just informative examples, and are
not to be taken as face value.

238
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:00,779
Not every doctor is narcissistic.

239
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,809
I know that this is needless to say.

240
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:07,688
But when it comes to studying behaviorism,
it involves grasping countless nuanced points

241
00:14:07,688 --> 00:14:10,959
that usually get misinterpreted by most people.

242
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,580
I want to be as straightforward as possible
to clear out as much potential confusions.

243
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,580
(1.5)

244
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,829
The most accurate depiction I could find for
this character trait is the narcissistic police

245
00:14:20,828 --> 00:14:21,879
officer.

246
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:25,980
Most people chose to work in the police department
just for the sake of working, or because they

247
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,379
simply like the job.

248
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:32,798
A narcissist on the other hand, will seek
out this job just so he could exercise power

249
00:14:32,798 --> 00:14:35,240
and authority over people.

250
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,480
Almost any position where the person could
be seen as above others, the narcissistic

251
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,159
personality will be interested in it.

252
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:44,519
They love to boss people around.

253
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,519
(1.5)

254
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,409
Picture this character type as a vampire.

255
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:52,059
each of his very steps is intended to soak-up
everyone's attention, happiness & welfare

256
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:56,869
by any means, and then transmute that energy
to boost his ego.

257
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,950
Now we've finished detailing the five character
traits of the narcissistic personality.

258
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:05,410
For the time being, I'm going to further elaborate
on some additional yet crucial points.

259
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:09,740
This following segment could also serve as
a summary coupled with further detailed examples

260
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,750
for each character trait we've seen.

261
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:21,570
6- ENCOUNTERS WITH THE NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY
+ HOW THEY IMPACT YOU:

262
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:26,180
-> The narcissistic personality will either
leave you uneasy, troubled, unfulfilled, or

263
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:27,208
tormented.

264
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:31,389
The degree of chaos brought upon you will
be determined depending on how dangerous is

265
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,069
the person you're dealing with.

266
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,190
Here's an example for a mild, not so dangerous
case.

267
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:39,150
In high school, I remember this sports coach
of mine.

268
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:44,240
There wasn't a day in class where she didn't
yell, belittle, mock and sometimes slap students

269
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,990
who didn't get the moves right.

270
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:50,389
If you happen to smile at her, she would kick
you in the balls, I kid you not.

271
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:54,610
When chance struck and everyone happened to
get the moves right, this teacher would get

272
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:58,120
bored because there was no incentive for her
to berate us.

273
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,360
So, what she did In these instances was try
to provoke a reaction from a student just

274
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,959
so she could bite back.

275
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:09,500
If you ask me how it felt like to be her student,
I wouldn't think of any nearer to the truth

276
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,190
description other than training for the marines
or some shit.

277
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,920
She was a miniature image of hitler.

278
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:21,568
This person's presence, always, gives me slight
headaches, faint fever, ear pain, irritation,

279
00:16:21,568 --> 00:16:26,938
temptation to react, resentment, a wanting
to exist the room, tenseness in facial expressions

280
00:16:26,938 --> 00:16:30,338
and or a feeling like I don't want to stick
around for long.

281
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:35,400
The reason why I shared this story coupled
with how I felt like beside this person is

282
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,799
to make it easier for you to remember someone
who makes you feel the same.

283
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:43,529
In spite of that story, my sports teacher
is not considered dangerous.

284
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:49,338
I would guess that her degree of narcissistic
insanity ranged from 45 to 55%.

285
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:51,280
But she lacked empathy for sure.

286
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,578
She is tolerable, but not for the long haul.

287
00:16:54,578 --> 00:17:00,168
Living with such type will engender either
trauma, depression or low self-esteem because

288
00:17:00,168 --> 00:17:03,659
of her constant degrading of the people around
her.

289
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:09,170
The following is a compilation of behaviors
I think best describe the most dangerous cases:

290
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,630
1-They bribe bullies to beat you up, merely
because you didn't serve them what they wanted.

291
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,770
2-Anytime you refuse one of their requests,
they will avenge themselves on you by doing

292
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:17,000
crazy things.

293
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,779
Like steal your car, kidnap your kid or in
quite extreme & psychotic instances, they

294
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:24,509
will not hesitate to put a gun in your face.

295
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:29,220
3-With psychotic narcissists, expect that
they will cause either drastic physical, emotional

296
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,279
or financial harm to you and your beloved
ones, with total indifferance.

297
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:39,299
The following is another neat summary of traits
& behaviors that may be used to identify violant

298
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:42,230
and non-violant narcissitic personalities:

299
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:47,730
1-Devalues others, perceives himself as the
center of attention, inconsiderate of others'

300
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,880
needs, wants, feelings or illnesses.

301
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,160
Befriends people, not for their values & qualities
but based on how much they could gain out

302
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
of them.

303
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,300
If you fail to help them, you'd anticipate
an outburst of rage & resentment.

304
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:07,529
Oftentimes They will act nice, flirty only
to get their way.

305
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:09,019
NEGATIVE OR NARCISSISTIC?

306
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:12,619
I have to point out that negative doesn't
mean narcissitic.

307
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:17,719
Negativity is a general term that could encompass
various traits ranging from simple to extreme.

308
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,160
From complaining per se, to killing.

309
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,560
I'm alluding that the word negative is quite
vague to use as a compass to identify narcissistic

310
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,559
personalities.

311
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,589
Instead, rely on very precise behavioral cues
and also the emotions you feel beside that

312
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:33,220
person's presence.

313
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,380
Not every negative individual is narcissistic.

314
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,620
Sometimes even positive people turn a bit
negative because they're going through a hard

315
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,699
time.

316
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,150
Others are negative but aren't narcissistic.

317
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:47,580
The distinction between the negative person
who's non-threatening and the narcissistic

318
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:52,159
is that the latter will never fail, not even
once to make you feel like shit.

319
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,370
Even though they seem normal most of the time,
everytime you get together, there has to be

320
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:01,199
a moment in the interaction where they're
going to sting you sharply.

321
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,480
7-MOTIVES COMPASS
You can also use PEOPLE's motives as a compass.

322
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,690
For example, let's say you have two friends.

323
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:10,160
The first one, always says that he goes to
the gym because of the many health benefits

324
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,380
of working out.

325
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,910
The second usually says, with a serious tone,
that he likes working out because he wants

326
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,850
to look better, stronger than everyone else.

327
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:21,179
Your second friend is probably narcissistic.

328
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,220
Of course, this isn't a definite conclusion.

329
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,470
I could be working out for health benefits
but say aloud, only this time, in a humorous

330
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:33,600
tone, that I'm doing it to look stronger than
other people, i.e. as a joke.

331
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:36,039
The point being, don't take what I say as
face value.

332
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:40,849
I hope you've got the point and I do trust
that my subscribers are capable of critical

333
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:41,849
thinking.

334
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:45,849
If you're inexperienced in terms of social
dynamics, screening, I would suggest you take

335
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:48,689
your time if you're trying to study someone's
behavior.

336
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,980
The last thing you'd want to do is judge someone
as dangerous because they started acting stange

337
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,180
out of the blue.

338
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,110
It might be that he or she is going through
a hard time.

339
00:19:57,109 --> 00:19:58,409
You don't really know.

340
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,710
8- THE NARCISSISSTIC PERSONALITY IN RELATIONSHIPS:

341
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,620
ONE--AS A LOVER

342
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,879
The narcissitic lover is more dangerous than
a mere friend.

343
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,260
The relationship often revolves around one
person serving the other his unending needs

344
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:12,259
& desires.

345
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:17,819
They, OFTENtimes bond with people who are
naive, inexperienced or those of low self-esteem.

346
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:22,399
The narcissistic choses such partner just
so he could more easily manipulate & keep

347
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,960
them on the hook.

348
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,710
Remember that narcissists could be highly
intelligent & skillful in terms of seduction

349
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,170
despite their syndrome.

350
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,170
1.

351
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,220
Love for them is a matter of give and take.

352
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,430
They rarely offer help or display affection
for free.

353
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,009
Their disinterest in contributing is palpable.

354
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:43,599
Whatever their partner says or does to satisfy
them, they never seem appreciative thereof.

355
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:49,049
The narcissistic personality will quite often
cheapen his partner's efforts, critisize everything

356
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:51,629
they do, and make them feel like they did
something wrong.

357
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:55,010
A solid example for this is a story by the
author.

358
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:59,460
Paraphrasing, the story describes a husband
who spent hours upon hours looking for the

359
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,799
perfect birthday gift for his wife, only for
her to toss the present on the wall in the

360
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,019
end.

361
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:10,180
Narcissistic partners, should you deny one
of their requests, should you ever err in

362
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:16,430
the slightest, they'll threaten to leave you
or hold a grudge against you for weeks.

363
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:19,840
There never goes a day where things go smoothly
and everyone's at peace.

364
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:24,539
Daily, there has to be some kind of drama
or debate going back and forth or else they're

365
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,680
get bored & devoid of meaning.

366
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,370
They will often point out something wrong
in their partner's makeup, dress or demeanour

367
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:34,789
instead of, at least, giving a half-hearted
compliment.

368
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:39,220
Engaging in a relationship with narcissistic
personalities will cause you drastic, lifetime

369
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:45,579
mental & emotional damage, ranging from depressions
to sporadic suicidal thoughts.

370
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:50,740
TWO--AS A PARENT
Because narcissistic parents aspire to be

371
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:55,470
seen as flawless, they will strongly push
their kids to become the best as well.

372
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:59,670
Though the child actually toils to get his
parent's approval, the parent often seems

373
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,220
unsatisfied with his accomplishments.

374
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,750
Not until he gets that "A+" the kid won't
get any praise or affection.

375
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,849
Narcissistic parents push their kids past
to the limits, not because they want to see

376
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:14,699
them flourish, but only for they could brag
about their "A's" infront of their friends.

377
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,150
They may help their child attain fame & prosperity.

378
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:21,720
But, their motives are always to make their
kids seem rich or talented, so they themselves

379
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,610
can be perceived as the parent of so & so,
so they can reap the benefits as well, so

380
00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:32,389
when their child becomes a professional athlete
for example, they could take selfies in the

381
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:35,509
olympics & boast about it on facebook.

382
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:36,879
2.0

383
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,840
In some cases, a narcissistic parent will
feign being supportive, encouraging his child

384
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:45,349
to work hard, only to ask him one day to return
the favor.

385
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:48,079
Some sort of subtle parental exploitation.

386
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:52,470
One day, the child may figure out that he's
being used & this could result in scorching

387
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,700
trauma.

388
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,990
To picture a narcissistic person, always remember
the vampire analogy.

389
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:02,220
Every step they take is meant to drain the
happiness of others to boost their own mood

390
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,740
& reinforce their ego.

391
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,680
Oftentimes narcissistic parents are unsupportive
and reckless towards their kids.

392
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,920
They do not care listen to how their child
got bullied today or why did he get home full

393
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,120
of cuts and bruises.

394
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:18,929
They usually don't pay too much attention
to his emotional or material needs.

395
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:24,560
Consequently, The kid feels neglected, lacking
in love & affection, develops personality

396
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,500
disorders.

397
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,440
2.0

398
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,309
As you probably know, a youngster contructs
the building blocks of his personality by

399
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:34,700
imitating his parent's behaviors.

400
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,610
And because of this, narcissistic parents
can inadvertantly transfer on terrible character

401
00:23:39,609 --> 00:23:40,609
traits.

402
00:23:40,609 --> 00:23:42,259
The most common one is indifference.

403
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:48,309
Because they withdrew love & affection for
their kids, they grow up lacking empathy themselves,

404
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:53,490
quite ruthless, pretentious, disrespectful,
inconsiderate & unapologetic.

405
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,930
If you haven't noticed it yet, these traits
perfectly describe bullies.

406
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:02,549
Yes, Bullies stem from a careless, unsympathetic,
narcissistic parent.

407
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:07,509
The child, having been deeply wounded, will
roam around like a bloodsucker inflicting

408
00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:12,640
on others that same emotional void he himself
had gone through.

409
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,920
Unfortunately, narcissistic parents conceive
narcissistic children .

410
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,920
Conclusion:

411
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,029
To wrap this up, I wanted to emphasize again
that there are varying degrees in severity

412
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:23,529
when it comes to personality disorders.

413
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:27,500
That being the case, not every narcissistic
person is dangerous.

414
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,808
Some are more tolerable than others.

415
00:24:29,808 --> 00:24:33,720
If you sense that someone close to you is
dangerous, please refer to the book as a guide

416
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,029
and not this video.

417
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:39,690
The author has compiled a checklist of the
most common behaviors in narcissistic personalities.

418
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:44,130
The checklist is based on decades of experiences
and will help you validate any suspicions

419
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:48,990
and assure you whether the person you're dealing
is either dangerous or tolerable.

420
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:54,769
The video could help you identify those people
but its primary purpose is to shed light on

421
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:59,660
the major character traits of the most dangerous
personalities and is not to be taken as the

422
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:03,730
ultimate guide to validate your assumptions
about a seemingly dangerous person.

423
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:04,730
If you suspect that one of these traits apply
to someone you know, please don't make any

424
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:05,730
prejudice & conclude that that person is dangerous
based on what is said in this video.

425
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:06,730
If you're interested, you could Read the checklist
in the book firsthand and then decide from

426
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,730
there.

427
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:10,269
SELF-LOVE OR SELFISHNESS:
In spite of what I said in the previous segments,

428
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:14,619
each and everyone of us is at least 1 to 2%
narcissistic.

429
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:17,239
Otherwise you'd be selling your house for
five dollars.

430
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,420
Here, I'm not refering to the word narcissistic
in its literal sense, but in a sense that

431
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,480
every person loves himself to a certain degree.

432
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,620
You should be able to differentiate between
self-love and narcissism.

433
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:33,559
Without self-love you wouldn't have any drive
to build a better life for yourself.

434
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:39,539
But, should self-love exceed a certain threshold,
it turns into narcissisism.

435
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:44,930
A narcissistic person embodies an exagerated
self-love combined with selfishness.

436
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:48,710
I'll further elaborate on this point in a
another video.

437
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:51,289
In closing,
The author speculated that some people may

438
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:54,670
suggest helping those dangerous individuals
heal.

439
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:58,480
This book doesn't include it, it's mainly
about learning how to identify dangerous people

440
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,829
and cut them out of your life.

441
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:05,649
If you wish to help them gain humanity once
more, the author encourages you to read other

442
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,269
books about that matter.

443
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:11,599
Educating yourself about the causes that made
those people the way they are & how to help

444
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:16,539
them heal is a good thing, but the only thing
that matters now is your safety & the safety

445
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:17,960
of your beloved ones.

446
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:24,039
I'll be sharing tactics on how to fend off
psychotic narcissists in my upcoming videos.

447
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:28,558
As for next week's video, I'll be covering
the character traits of The second most dangerous

448
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:30,920
personality.

449
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:39,940
Thanks for watching, talk to you soon.
