1
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,620
It all started with my grandma.

2
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:17,059
I was just a kid when the doctors sent my
grandma home in a wheelchair to die.

3
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:21,570
Diagnosed with end-stage heart disease, she
had already had so many bypass operations

4
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,170
that the surgeons essentially ran out of plumbing.

5
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,179
Confined to a wheelchair.

6
00:00:26,178 --> 00:00:29,759
crushing chest pain, her doctors told her
there was nothing else they could do.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,750
Her life was over at age sixty-five.

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:38,219
But then she heard about Nathan Pritikin,
one of our early lifestyle medicine pioneers,

9
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,140
and what happened next was documented in Pritikin's
biography.

10
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,969
It talks about Frances Greger, my grandma.

11
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,239
It was a live-in program where everyone was
placed on a plant-based diet and then started

12
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:51,089
on a graded exercise regimen.

13
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,500
They wheeled her in, and she walked out.

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,630
Within a few weeks she was walking 10 miles
a day and went on to live another 31 years

15
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:05,219
until age 96 to continue to enjoy her six
grandchildren, including me.

16
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:09,969
Her miraculous recovery not only inspired
one of those grandkids to pursue a career

17
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:13,700
in medicine, but granted her enough healthy
years to see him graduate from medical school,

18
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,859
so it’s really all thanks to her.

19
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:22,780
During medical training I was shocked to find
out that this whole body of evidence on reversing

20
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,750
chronic disease with lifestyle changes—opening
up arteries without drugs, without surgery—was

21
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,290
being largely ignored by mainstream medicine.

22
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:35,390
Wait a second, if effectively the cure to
our #1 killer could get lost down the rabbit

23
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:40,540
hole, what else might be buried in the medical
literature that could help my patients?

24
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,290
I made it my life’s mission to find out.

25
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:49,430
That’s what led me to start NutritionFacts.org
and that’s what led me to write the book,

26
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,950
How Not to Die.

27
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,969
Surveys show people wildly overestimate the
power of pills and procedures to keep them

28
00:01:56,968 --> 00:01:57,968
healthy.

29
00:01:57,968 --> 00:02:01,618
For example, patients believe cholesterol-lowering
statin drugs are about twenty times more effective

30
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:04,390
than they actually are in preventing heart
attacks.

31
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,469
No wonder most people continue to rely on
drugs to save them!

32
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:11,590
But our leading killers aren't caused by drug
deficiencies.

33
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,919
The dirty little secret is that most people
surveyed said they wouldn’t be willing to

34
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:22,510
take many of these drugs if they knew how
little benefit these products actually offered.

35
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:27,129
Whereas cleaning up our diets is not only
safer and cheaper but can be more effective

36
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:31,479
in preventing, arresting, and reversing some
of our leading causes of death, because you’re

37
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:35,759
treating the actual cause of the disease.

38
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:40,549
Each year, the CDC compiles the 15 leading
causes of death and so I have a chapter on

39
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,540
each: How Not to Die from Heart Disease, How
Not to Die from lung Disease, How Not to Die

40
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:50,198
from Brain Diseases, digestive cancers, infections,
diabetes, high blood pressure, liver diseases,

41
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:55,750
blood cancers, kidney disease, breast cancer,
suicidal depression, prostate cancer Parkinson’s

42
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,870
disease and how not to die from so-called
iatrogenic causes, which is essentially death

43
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,299
by doctor.

44
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:07,040
That’s the first half of the book and the
good news is that we have tremendous power

45
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:11,280
over our health destiny and longevity—the
vast majority of premature death and disability

46
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,060
is preventable with a plant-based diet and
other healthy lifestyle behaviors.

47
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,489
I didn’t want to just write a reference
book, though.

48
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:23,730
Yes, there’s thousands of citations to peer-reviewed
scientific papers, but I also wanted it to

49
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:29,199
be a practical guide on translating this mountain
of evidence into day-to-day decisions, and

50
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,319
so that’s what became the second half of
the book.

51
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,750
First I start out with a Traffic Light system
to classify everything into red light, yellow

52
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,849
light, and green light foods.

53
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:43,900
Though there are exceptions that I talk about,
the best available balance of evidence suggests

54
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,689
the healthiest diet is one that minimizes
the intake of meat, eggs, dairy, and processed

55
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:55,189
junk, and maximizes the intake of fruits,
vegetables, beans (split peas, chickpeas and

56
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:59,259
lentils), whole grains, nuts and seeds, mushrooms,
herbs and spices.

57
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:00,948
Basically, real food that grows out of the
ground.

58
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,219
Those are our healthiest choices.

59
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:09,699
Some foods, though, have particular medicinal
qualities and so I then center my recommendations

60
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:13,978
around a Daily Dozen checklist of all the
things I try to fit into my daily routine.

61
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:20,259
So for example, I recommend a quarter teaspoon
of the spice turmeric a day, a tablespoon

62
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:24,399
of ground flax seeds, berries every day, greens
every day, I talk about the healthiest beverages,

63
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,399
the healthiest sweeteners, how much exercise
to get.

64
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:32,939
The whole daily dozen list with recommended
serving sizes is available as free apps for

65
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:37,029
both Android and iPhone, just search for Dr.
Greger’s Daily Dozen.

66
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:42,609
There is only one diet that’s ever been
proven to reverse heart disease in the majority

67
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,319
of patients, this plant-based diet.

68
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:51,161
If that’s all a plant-based diet could do—reverse
the #1 killer of men and women, then shouldn’t

69
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:54,589
that be the default diet until proven otherwise?

70
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:58,810
And the fact that it can also be effective
in treating, arresting, and reversing other

71
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,430
leading killers like high blood pressure and
type 2 diabetes, would seem to make the case

72
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:07,209
for plant-based eating simply overwhelming.

73
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:12,560
Most deaths in the United States are preventable
and related to nutrition.

74
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,430
According to the most rigorous analysis of
risk factors ever published—the Global Burden

75
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:21,000
of Disease study funded by the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation—the number one cause of

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,500
death in the United States is our diet.

77
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,579
The number one cause of disability is our
diet which has now bumped tobacco smoking

78
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,539
to #2.

79
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:37,240
Smoking now only kills about a half million
Americans every year, but diet now kills hundreds

80
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,480
of thousands more.

81
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:45,189
So obviously, nutrition is the #1 thing taught
in medical school, right?

82
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:49,350
The #1 thing your doctor talks to you about
at every visit, right?

83
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:56,040
How could there be such a disconnect between
the science, and the practice of medicine.

84
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,970
Doctors, have a severe nutrition deficiency--in
education.

85
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,200
Most doctors are just never taught the impact
healthy nutrition can have on the course of

86
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,060
illness and so they graduate without this
powerful tool in their medical toolbox.

87
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:15,220
There are also institutional barriers, such
as time constraints and lack of reimbursement.

88
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,110
In general, doctors aren't paid for counseling
people on how to take care of themselves.

89
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:24,699
Of course the drug companies also play a role
in influencing medical education and practice.

90
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:28,459
Ask your doctor when's the last time they
were taken out to dinner by Big Broccoli.

91
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:30,739
It’s probably been awhile.

92
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,750
It’s like smoking in the 50s.

93
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:40,079
We already had decades of science linking
smoking with lung cancer, but it was ignored

94
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,039
because smoking was normal.

95
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,060
Most doctors smoked.

96
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,970
The average per capita cigarette consumption
was 4,000 cigarettes a year, meaning the average

97
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,370
American smoked a half a pack a day.

98
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:59,699
The American Medical Association was reassuring
everyone that smoking--in moderation--was

99
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,079
just fine.

100
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:07,609
There was this same disconnect between the
science, and public policy.

101
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:13,250
It took more than 25 years and 7,000 studies
before the first Surgeon General report against

102
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,009
smoking came out in the 60’s.

103
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:19,349
You’d think maybe after the first 6,000
studies they could have given people a heads

104
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,350
up or something?

105
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,070
It was a powerful industry.

106
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:26,540
And today’s meat, sugar, dairy, salt, egg,
and processed food industries are using the

107
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:32,810
same tobacco industry tactics to try to twist
the science and confuse the public.

108
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,990
Until the system changes, we have to take
personal responsibility for our own health,

109
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,569
for our family’s health.

110
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:45,180
We can’t wait until society catches up to
the science again, because it’s a matter

111
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,090
of life and death.
