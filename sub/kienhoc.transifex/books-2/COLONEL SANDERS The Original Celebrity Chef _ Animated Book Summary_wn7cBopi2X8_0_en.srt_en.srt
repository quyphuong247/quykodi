00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,179
I’m sure many of you know who Colonel Sanders
is and that he founded Kentucky Fried Chicken,

2
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:09,589
but in this video you’ll learn that his
road to success was an interesting and unusual

3
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:14,410
one, involving a shootout with a competitor
and even becoming an amateur midwife in his

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:22,730
early days.
His autobiography along with some of his cooking

5
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:29,519
recipes was written in 1966 but the manuscript
was only discovered in 2011 and KFC published

6
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,390
it for free shortly after.
Harland Sanders was born in Indiana in 1890.

7
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,000
He had a variety of jobs before he became
hugely successful building his million dollar

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,280
business with his food. Sanders’ relationship
with food started at a very young age. His

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,609
father died when he was five and as a result,
his mother went out to work. That left Sanders

10
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:56,109
to cook for his younger brother and sister,
his speciality was light bread, kneading and

11
00:00:56,109 --> 00:01:01,100
baking the loaf himself.
Sanders was a big, strong country boy and

12
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,629
got his first job aged 10, clearing ground
in a woods for a local farmer with an axe

13
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:11,119
and a saw. He didn’t do as much work as
he should have and was fired after a month.

14
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,240
His mother lambasted him with a lecture saying
the only way he could keep a job was by giving

15
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:20,759
his best. Sanders was remorseful and vowed
from that point on to never avoid another

16
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,770
day of work in his life.
He worked for another farmer the rest of that

17
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:30,390
year, ploughing fields, milking cows and feeding
horses. The farmer said that Sanders was the

18
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,590
best hand he’d ever had. It was here that
Sanders learned to love work, taking great

19
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,560
pleasure in it once he got used to the long
hours. He continued to work on a farm whilst

20
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,579
going to school, working before and after
school each day. He dropped out of school

21
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:50,650
at 13 years of age, something he doesn’t
advise others to do now times have changed;

22
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:55,280
claiming hard work does not guarantee success
with no education at all.

23
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,879
He worked various jobs including painting
horse carriages, more farming and tram conducting.

24
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:05,349
Then he volunteered for the army. Despite
being only 15 at the time he looked older

25
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:10,579
than he was and was accepted. He was sent
to Cuba for the duration of his army employment,

26
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:15,590
which was just under six months.
On his return from Cuba, he took a job as

27
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:20,299
a blacksmith’s helper on the railroad in
Alabama for a couple of months. He then moved

28
00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:24,519
onto clearing the ash pans of the locomotive
engines on their run and eventually became

29
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,459
a fireman, shovelling the coal into the firebox,
fuelling the train engine.

30
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:34,889
Around this time, he got married and had his
first child. His wife did not cook so he spent

31
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:39,180
time teaching her, using instructions his
mother had taught him as well as trying out

32
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,510
recipes he’d memorised, tweaked and perfected.
Whilst working on the railroad, Sanders was

33
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:50,009
studying law at night and eventually got to
practise law, becoming a lawyer and representing

34
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:55,449
train crash victims. After three years of
studying and practising law he decided being

35
00:02:55,449 --> 00:03:00,308
a lawyer wasn’t for him. He briefly returned
to working on the railroad, before taking

36
00:03:00,308 --> 00:03:05,340
a job selling life insurance. His hard work
ethic led to him becoming one of the greatest

37
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,419
insurance sellers in the office and he was
promoted to be in charge of other staff.

38
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:15,299
He then started a transportation company running
a steamboat as a ferry from Jeffersonville

39
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:22,019
to Louisville which he ran successfully, eventually
making himself approximately $22,000 in the

40
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:28,498
process. He used this money to start manufacturing
farm lighting. A combination of stiff competition

41
00:03:28,498 --> 00:03:32,908
and far too rapid expansion led to Sanders
losing everything he put into this business

42
00:03:32,908 --> 00:03:37,078
and going broke.
Soon, Sanders was offered the opportunity

43
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:42,540
to run a petrol station, filling up the cars
tanks with fuel. However, he ran the station

44
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:49,188
offering extremely good service, from windscreen
wiping to pumping up tires, all free of charge.

45
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:53,348
After only a month in charge, he was selling
three times more fuel than anyone else had

46
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:59,388
previously at that station. It proved to him
that hard work works, in this case with a

47
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:03,909
helpful and personal service.
It was while in charge of a petrol station

48
00:04:03,908 --> 00:04:09,649
that Sanders was made aware of a local rival
painting over his advertising signs. It was

49
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,569
a particularly rough neighbourhood and he
travelled over to catch the man in the act,

50
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:17,560
driving down with two Shell employees (who
he was meeting with at the time) with their

51
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:23,560
guns loaded. Unfortunately, the rival saw
them coming and killed one of the Shell employees,

52
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:29,610
shooting him with his pistol. Sanders returned
fire and shot the man in the shoulder. The

53
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,379
rival was later arrested and convicted of
murder.

54
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:38,139
During his time working in petrol stations,
the Great Depression hit America. Sanders

55
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:43,439
had been offered a job with Shell Oil Company
running another station in Kentucky and during

56
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,339
this time, he got involved with delivering
babies. Many families were so broke due to

57
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:52,869
the depression that husbands could not even
afford a doctor to deliver their baby when

58
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:58,379
their wives were pregnant. Sanders delivered
any babies he could and where there were complications

59
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:03,040
tried to get hold of a doctor to help out.
One couple were so grateful, they named their

60
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,879
child Harland.
It was at the Shell Company’s station that

61
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:12,139
Sanders first got into the restaurant business
and utilised his cooking knowledge. He opened

62
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:16,620
a cafe as part of his station. He called it
a cafe rather than a restaurant as it had

63
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,879
less letters and he could paint them bigger
on the sides of nearby barns to advertise.

64
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,810
He was soon tinkering with chicken and his
special seasoning. His restaurant got a reputation

65
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:32,970
far and wide for serving good quality, delicious
food. His menu was small but good, allowing

66
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,810
him to focus on the quality of each item he
sold.

67
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:42,769
In 1935, Sanders was commissioned as a Colonel
by the governor of Kentucky. It is the highest

68
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:47,919
honour the state can bestow on somebody, and
is given as recognition for noteworthy accomplishment

69
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,939
or outstanding service to the community. This
is the origin of how he later became known

70
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:57,529
as “The Colonel”.
He also got into the motel business by building

71
00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:03,449
one in Kentucky with the help of a loan shark.
He agreed to borrow over $5,000 but would

72
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:08,430
pay the money back to him with a third of
the profit from the hotel rooms he sold. The

73
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,019
loan shark made so much money from that deal
that he offered to build Sanders a second

74
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:17,129
motel in North Carolina.
The Second World War brought with it rationing

75
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:22,050
and tourism decreased dramatically. He sold
his second motel and was left with his original

76
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:27,470
service station, cafe and motel. Later, when
surveyors moved the highway away from his

77
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:33,930
original setup, he ended up selling his original
business too. It was 1956 and he was practically

78
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:39,680
back to square one at 65 years old.
He decided after this he needed to head in

79
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,240
a new direction so focused on franchising
his own special fried chicken. He spoke to

80
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,560
many small restaurant operators, travelling
around the country, often sleeping in the

81
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,350
back of his car, and taught them how to fry
his chicken. The only secret was the seasoning,

82
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:00,800
made up of 11 herbs and spices, which he packaged
and shipped to protect his franchises. He

83
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,090
made 5 cents for each chicken dish they sold.
People kept applying for franchises and the

84
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:11,729
operation grew and grew, to a point where
it was difficult to keep up. At his age he

85
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:16,430
was still travelling over 200,000 miles a
year to potential franchises and grand openings

86
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:22,180
and many business decisions had to be held
up until he returned.

87
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,620
In 1964, Sanders sold his business for $2
million. Kentucky Fried Chicken was the largest

88
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:33,189
seller of chicken in the world, selling $56
million worth. He wanted somebody to carry

89
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:38,089
on his business and really do something with
it. He’d handed over the operational side

90
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:43,529
but still worked for the company in promotion,
publicity and as an advisor. Over the next

91
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:47,989
two years he appeared on eleven of the best
national TV shows in the country, gaining

92
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:53,060
valuable exposure for the business.
Sanders was moderately successful in his earlier

93
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:58,879
life but made millions after he turned 65.
He used his experience and knowledge he’d

94
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,600
gained throughout his life but his secret
was that he was not scared of “hard, back-cracking”

95
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,060
work.
