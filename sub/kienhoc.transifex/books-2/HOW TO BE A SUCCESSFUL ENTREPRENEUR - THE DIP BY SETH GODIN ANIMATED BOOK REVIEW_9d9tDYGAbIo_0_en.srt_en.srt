1
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:19,879
So there's a dangerous belief hovering around
the people who follow self-improvement.

2
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:22,899
it's the belief that If you work hard enough,
you're going to succeed.

3
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:27,799
Now before you misconceive anything, bring
up that shot-gun and shoot me in the head.

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,140
let me explain.

5
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,000
Self development gurus frequently emphasize
the idea that you should never give up. And

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,119
I couldn't agree more.

7
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,780
But, I also believe that it's equally important
to learn when to quit.

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,530
Many great people have wasted their lives
in fruitless endeavors. With the ingrained

9
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,859
idea that If you hustle strong enough. Things
will turn out well.

10
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:51,130
Big, big misconception.

11
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,070
If you're into any kind of project or creative
work.

12
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:59,700
It's essential for you to learn when precisely
you should keep up and when to give up, stop

13
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,710
wasting your time and move on to something
else.

14
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,989
Seth Godin laid down a clear blueprint for
this.

15
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:09,809
He said that when people venture onto a business
or project.

16
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,019
there has to be three different types of plateaus
that a person is more likely to encounter.

17
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:17,280
The first one is called "The Dip"

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,390
when you start off.
in the beginning you're noticing gradual growth.

19
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,950
but then the dip happens.

20
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,880
The dip is the long slog between starting
and mastery.

21
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,099
The dip isn't that discouraging actually,
it helps you move faster to your goal as long

22
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:33,449
as you are willing to hustle to break through
it.

23
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,900
The first time I picked the guitar it was
fun.

24
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,159
but a few months later.

25
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:42,340
I found out that in order to become a master,
you have to learn a thousand scales, chords

26
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,728
and another thousand combination of techniques.

27
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:47,810
I realized at the time, that I hit a dip.

28
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:53,700
The dip is that period where you work, and
work, and work without perceiving any tangible

29
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,790
results.

30
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,368
It's the hardest part about learning anything
and only those who persevere will get to the

31
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:00,759
other side of the dip.

32
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:06,438
The second type of plateau is called the "cul-de-sac"
(wich is the french word for "dead end")

33
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:10,068
let's say you've encountered a dip and decided
to persevere.

34
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:13,848
Afterwards, there are two possible outcomes
that are liable to occur.

35
00:02:13,848 --> 00:02:18,530
The first one is that after persevering through
the dip, your growth curve peaks up. You're

36
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,408
success rate gets higher.

37
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:23,209
But there's a second possibility wich is the
cul-de-sac.

38
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:28,729
A cul-de-sac is when You're working and hustling
for months, even years but nothing seems to

39
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:29,268
pan out.

40
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:35,019
A cul-de-sac is a dead end, if you see one
while working on any kind of project you better

41
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:37,150
quit as soon as possible.

42
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,269
I know this is harsh advice but
It's worthless to invest your whole life in

43
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:45,139
something that's not going to pay off sooner
or later.

44
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:50,459
So the dip is good, it's a path toward mastery.
If you're on a dip, keep pushing.

45
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:55,789
You recognize a dip when you start to see
tangible results after a few months.

46
00:02:55,789 --> 00:03:01,548
But the cul-de-sac is a dead end. a dead end
is when you're working for years without achieving

47
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,739
any considerable results.

48
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:08,099
It's better to stop and start something else
that will grant you the potential to reach

49
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:13,138
a dip, rather than to keep punching at a wall
that's never going to break.

50
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:17,999
One of my friends asked me once, if I could
teach him how to play the guitar since I've

51
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:20,098
been doing it for seven years now.

52
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:24,119
I said okey I'll teach you but first you have
to answer this one question.

53
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,239
Are you planning to be the best in the world
?

54
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,739
He bursted(burst) with laughter and said that
he didn't know, that he just wanted to practice.

55
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:33,099
I said, okey we'll start tomorrow.

56
00:03:33,098 --> 00:03:37,348
So he came over and I noticed that he bought
a very expensive guitar to practice with.

57
00:03:37,348 --> 00:03:41,468
I questioned why he wasted a lot of money
on a guitar as a beginner.

58
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:46,878
He responded that he's so excited about learning
so he'd better get himself some good gear.

59
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,259
so I began coaching him but a weird thing
happened just a few weeks later.

60
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:55,448
He said that he wanted to quit.
That this guitar thing is getting too difficult

61
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:56,379
for him.

62
00:03:56,378 --> 00:04:00,058
This is the third type of plateau. it's called
the cliff.

63
00:04:00,058 --> 00:04:03,838
In the beginning. it's fun you're like "yeah
let's do this bring it on"

64
00:04:03,838 --> 00:04:07,248
But after a while, that passion. that desire
fades away.

65
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:10,948
and I talk about this more in my outlier review.

66
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:15,049
The cliff is no different than a dead end,
they both lead to failure.

67
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:20,459
the difference is that The cliff is characterized
by what we call, "beginner's excitement"

68
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,490
Be wary of the fact that whenever you see
a pretty talented person. You're prone to

69
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,560
be persuaded and want to start doing the same
thing.

70
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,110
You have to be clear about why you're starting
out in the first place:

71
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:37,098
are you going to stick to it and become a
master yourself ? or is it just "beginner's

72
00:04:37,098 --> 00:04:38,079
excitement"

73
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,589
Think of the cliff as a person walking backwards
on a train rail.

74
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:45,060
He's having fun at the moment
but he's unaware that the train is coming

75
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,899
to smash him right in the back.

76
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:51,929
Think of the train as lack of excitement.
So you better wake up now or that train will

77
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,300
do it for you.

78
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,930
So far we saw three types of plateaus that
you're liable to encounter while cultivating

79
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,418
a skill or building businesses.

80
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:05,089
The first one is the dip. If you see a dip
then it's a good sign, keep plowing through

81
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:08,668
& eventually, your growth rate will start
to spike up again.

82
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:10,978
.
How do you recognize a dip ? easy.

83
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:15,769
A dip is when you're onto a project for a
couple months, you get stuck, you persevere

84
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:18,359
and eventually the results pop up.

85
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,788
The second type of plateau is the cul-de-sac,
The dead end.

86
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:26,519
And the third one is the cliff. The cliff
is characterized by excitement in the beginning

87
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:29,579
and a crash at the end, just like drinking
coffee.

88
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:34,029
If something is new, you'd love to try it
out but are you going stick to it?

89
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:36,679
if the answer is no then you're on a cliff.

90
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,069
Beware That beginner's excitement will fade
away sooner or later

91
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:46,039
If you find your self on a cul-de-sac or a
cliff, you have to quit fast to save resources

92
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:48,259
to save a new project.

93
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:52,639
Sometimes a cliff or let's just say "lack
of passion" can be turned into a dip with

94
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,439
proper discipline but a dead end cannot be
turned around.

95
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,889
If you're lacking passion, decide right now.

96
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:04,620
Either you quit or aim for a dip.
The dip is not about passion, it's about discipline

97
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,718
and perseverance.

98
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:09,478
The dip is the only path toward fruitfulness.

99
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:11,279
Now let's look at some further examples:

100
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,188
Let's say you own a business, a youtube channel.

101
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:18,039
Looking at the statistics of your channel,
you've noticed that you're going to reach

102
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:21,759
100 thousand subscribers in two years. perhaps
even less.

103
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,210
This is an example of a dip.

104
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:28,609
A dip is a situation where you're aware at
the moment that no results are perceivable

105
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,090
whatsoever.

106
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:34,508
But you're also conscious that if you keep
hustling, it's going pay off well.

107
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:39,499
The dead end is where the person is conscious
of the fact that he's stuck but he's not willing

108
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,240
to concede his failure.

109
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,490
I know people on youtube who've been posting
videos for 5 years and for the past 5 years

110
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,079
they've merely gained about 100 subscribers.

111
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,370
the guy doesn't seem like giving up already.

112
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:57,819
And i'm thinking: "seriously, you've traded
5 years of your life for 100 subscribers"

113
00:06:57,819 --> 00:06:57,829
?

114
00:06:57,829 --> 00:07:00,680
this is like selling your house for 5 dollars.

115
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:06,129
I realize that some people are not serious
about it, they're just doing youtube for fun.

116
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:08,300
if that's your thing that's your thing.

117
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,978
But if you're serious about it and you've
invested two years in a business but it hasn't

118
00:07:12,978 --> 00:07:15,068
generated a single penny yet.

119
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:17,199
Then you better be ready to quit.

120
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,468
Am not saying quit after 3 month or 5 months.
Give it a year or two.

121
00:07:22,468 --> 00:07:25,329
If it's not working, stop wasting your time.

122
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:29,589
It's painful I know, you don't want to quit
because you need to start all over again and

123
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:31,519
I have been there so many times.

124
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:36,598
But it's better to abandon the projects that
are not working rather than waste your whole

125
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:40,228
life on a dead end.
It's like running on a hamster wheel.

126
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:45,218
Quitting in contrast, can sometimes turn out
as very good strategy.

127
00:07:45,218 --> 00:07:46,498
Now a quick recap.

128
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:51,789
One. If something is worth doing, then there
is probably a dip. Period.

129
00:07:51,788 --> 00:07:55,889
Only the ones who persevere and cherish the
dip that their efforts will be rewarded.

130
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:00,370
The person who will reach the other side of
the dip is the one who's willing to become

131
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,348
the best in the world.
If you're not going be number one or number

132
00:08:04,348 --> 00:08:06,938
two, then why bother start ?

133
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:10,610
If you're just doing it as a hobby then consider
that from start.

134
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:16,718
Acknowledge that you're doing it just for
fun but don't expect more than "fun" in return.

135
00:08:16,718 --> 00:08:20,550
The second thing we saw is two types of plateaus
aside from the dip.

136
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,168
The cul-de-sac wich is the french word for
dead end and the cliff.

137
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:29,728
The dead end is pretty obvious, you're just
working and working for months, even years

138
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:31,308
and nothing seems to pan out.

139
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:35,278
And lastly the cliff.
Every body's drawn to new experiences.

140
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:38,750
The cliff is also known as "beginner's excitement"

141
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,940
In the beginning, It feels amazing.

142
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,750
but then you're like "this is getting a little
bit tedious for me"

143
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,629
so it's very very important to distinguish
beginner's excitement from long term vision,

144
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,500
long term discipline.

145
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,159
If you're on a dead end, I have nothing to
offer but to wish the best for you on your

146
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,240
next project. Please Don't waste your life.

147
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,250
If you're on a cliff however, you have to
decide right now.

148
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,230
Either you throw yourself and turn that cliff
into a dip,

149
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,730
And aim to achieve mastery.

150
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,730
Or turn your back on it and discontinue that
project immediately.

151
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,259
If you're not going to be the best in the
world than why bother.
