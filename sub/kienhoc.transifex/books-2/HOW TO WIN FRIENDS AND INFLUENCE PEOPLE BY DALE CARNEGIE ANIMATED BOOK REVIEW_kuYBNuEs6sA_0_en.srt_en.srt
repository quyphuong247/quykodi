1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,509
When I meet a person and he tells me he plays
the violin, I become fascinated. The first

2
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:12,769
thing I want to do is hear him play. When
I meet a person and he tells me he’s a painter,

3
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:18,600
I instantly want to see his paintings. I want
to ask him about what he paints, what his

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:25,600
lifestyle is like. I want to ask him why my
paintings look like I’m five years old.

5
00:00:25,928 --> 00:00:32,199
If I meet a doctor, I instantly want him to
tell me his craziest patient stories. I want

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,800
to know what his schedule is like. I want
to know how that affects his family.

7
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:44,799
But was I always like this? NO! I used to
be interested in only one sport, one instrument,

8
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:52,020
one profession, one everything. And it was
obviously the one thing that I did. If I didn’t

9
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:58,390
do something, it couldn’t possibly have
value or be interesting. I would sit there

10
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,969
and pretend I was listening when all I really
did was think about the things I was going

11
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:09,968
to say when the other person was done. And
once the person was done, I would unload all

12
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,770
my really interesting and important stuff
onto them.

13
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:20,099
If your social interactions suffer, one of
the biggest reasons might be this. You need

14
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:26,839
to become genuinely interested in other people.
By doing this, you will create a beautiful

15
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,930
variety in your life, and also have great
social experiences because you won’t be

16
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:38,140
sitting there creepily excited about what
you’re going to say when the person is done

17
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,170
talking.

18
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:48,170
Do you ever meet a person, and almost everything
he says is wrong? As an economist, this happens

19
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:56,240
to me all the time. I used to confront it,
and I never really changed anyone, but I did

20
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:03,239
create a lot of unnecessary arguments and
hostility. Telling a minimum wage worker about

21
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:10,508
the inefficiencies caused by the minimum wage
won’t get you too far. Trust me on that.

22
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:15,719
There are settings where you could do this,
but in general... you simply show respect

23
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:22,020
for the other man’s opinion. You never tell
a man he’s wrong.

24
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:28,790
The next little milestone that I have set
for myself is to reach 1,000 subscribers to

25
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:35,079
my channel. However, would I ever make the
mistake of approaching my viewers from that

26
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,030
perspective? NO!

27
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:42,250
If I came to you and said, “Hey, everyone!
I’m trying to get to 1,000 subscribers.

28
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:48,259
Please subscribe to me!” That doesn’t
mean anything to you. My social IQ would be

29
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:54,819
non-existent in that case. Yet, look around.
Most people do exactly this.

30
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:59,449
So instead, how do I approach you? Well, if
you’re watching this video, it’s pretty

31
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:05,619
safe to assume that you are interested in
self-improvement ideas. Then, in the best

32
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:12,620
possible way I can, I present to you an idea
that can really impact you. After I have done

33
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,510
all this, I tell you, “If you want to see
more big ideas when they come out, you can

34
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:24,539
subscribe.” Now, if these are the ideas
that you’re interested in, and assuming

35
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:31,539
that I did a decent job at presenting them,
the chances of your subscribing increase dramatically.

36
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,640
This is called talking in terms of the other
man’s interest.

37
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:43,208
Carnegie uses a great metaphor for this. He
says, “If you were going fishing, you wouldn’t

38
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:49,810
take cherries as bait.” Yet, we do this
all the time. It’s absolutely ridiculous.

39
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:55,150
And then we complain about how anyone could
pick worms over cherries.

40
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:00,569
You have to talk in terms of the other man’s
interest, if you’re to going to influence

41
00:04:00,568 --> 00:04:01,659
anyone.

42
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:07,568
Anyway, these are just three big ideas that
I use all the time from How to Win Friends

43
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:12,629
& Influence People by Dale Carnegie. I’m
sure most of you who are into self-improvement

44
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:18,069
have already read this book and not just once
either, but if you haven’t definitely read

45
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:21,269
it because there are so many other cool ideas
in the book.
