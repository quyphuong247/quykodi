Random Reminiscences of Men and Events. The
Autobiography of John D. Rockefeller

2
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:12,808
Seen by many as the richest person in modern
history, John D. Rockefeller made his fortune

3
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:19,109
in the oil business and used his wealth to
fund numerous philanthropic causes. His autobiography

4
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,600
is a collection of various events and experiences
from his life.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,640
Rockefeller learnt the methods and principles
of business from his father and he started

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,140
his first business venture aged 7 or 8 with
the help of his mother, looking after turkeys

7
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,730
before selling them for profit.
He worked from the age of 16, starting as

8
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:42,189
a bookkeeper in Cleveland before adding auditing
accounts to his list of duties. Working for

9
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:47,189
somebody else and the training received as
a result, was of great value to him. In his

10
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:51,539
early days in business, he was a large borrower
of money which allowed for his business to

11
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,649
grow fast. He exalts the value of friendship,
as many of his friends either directly lent

12
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:00,999
him money to expand or as some of them were
directors of banks, insisted on their bank

13
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:06,439
advancing him the money without hesitation.
At the age of 20, Rockefeller established

14
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:11,280
a business with an English gentleman called
Maurice B. Clark. Rockefeller was given a

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,570
loan from his father (with an interest rate
of 10%) which allowed him to contribute $2,000

16
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:22,569
and become an equal partner in the new business
dealing with produce, called Clark & Rockefeller.

17
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:26,319
The amount of trade they were performing soon
increased and more money from the bank was

18
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,459
required.
After initially looking after the business

19
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:34,339
finances, Rockefeller went out to try and
solicit new business. He travelled across

20
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,890
two states speaking personally to every person
he knew was involved in the same industry

21
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:44,180
of produce consignments. His tactic of not
asking for immediate work but just introducing

22
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:48,250
his company worked wonders and resulted in
a pile of new business which helped them achieve

23
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,870
sales of half a million dollars in their first
year.

24
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:59,000
In the 1860s, Rockefeller began to deal in
and refine oil. In 1867 Rockefeller’s newly

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,920
established firm joined with several other
firms, allowing them to unite their skills

26
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:09,490
and finances to maintain their business but
at a greater scale, whilst improving efficiency.

27
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:15,030
After yet more partners joined, Rockefeller
formed the Standard Oil Company. He acknowledges

28
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,699
the success of the company down to constantly
expanding the company’s operations and consistently

29
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:24,839
investing in cheaper and more efficient methods
of storing and delivering oil.

30
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,340
Utilising economies of scale provided a real
advantage over other firms. For example, one

31
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,670
of the main risks in the oil business was
fire. By having oil plants and refineries

32
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:39,339
distributed across the country, the risk and
potential loss from fire was minimised, as

33
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:45,560
no one fire could wipe out and ruin the company.
The Standard Oil Company also negotiated a

34
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,710
rebate from the railroads that it used to
transport its oil. Each company that used

35
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:56,280
the railroads was charged and then negotiated
a rebate in secret. The Standard Oil Company’s

36
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,699
bargaining power was strong as it promised
large quantities of freight to be transported

37
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:05,319
consistently, providing the railroads with
a consistent source of income. This allowed

38
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:10,560
them to significantly reduce their oil transportation
costs. The cost of transporting oil was reduced

39
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,319
further still with the construction of pipelines.
Rockefeller retired from the hands-on management

40
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:21,598
of the company’s business in the mid-1890s.
After disengaging from directly running the

41
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:26,609
company (but still always remaining the majority
shareholder), Rockefeller changed his focus

42
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,630
to philanthropy. He believed that people should
be educated to help themselves and that man

43
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:36,280
should contribute whatever he can, whether
it be money or service, to human progress

44
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,210
and the advancement of civilisation.
Rockefeller defined civilisation as being

45
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:45,730
made up of the following elements:
1. Progress in subsistence

46
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:52,269
2. Progress in government and law
3. Progress in literature and language

47
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:59,730
4. Progress in science and philosophy
5. Progress in art and refinement

48
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:05,659
6. Progress in morality and religion.
All but the first and the last elements can

49
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:11,799
be achieved through higher education and Rockefeller
founded universities both in America and abroad.

50
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,989
He also used his large fortune to create foundations
which affected the fields of education, science

51
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:21,459
and medicine, including eradicating certain
diseases.

52
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:25,740
John D. Rockefeller used ruthlessness and
intelligence in business which helped generate

53
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:32,370
a personal wealth at its peak of an estimated
$300-400 billion, after being adjusted for

54
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:38,120
inflation. His philanthropy resulted in him
giving away in total over $540 million prior

55
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:44,300
to his death in 1937. These figures have seen
him considered as the richest person in modern

56
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,530
history and the greatest philanthropist in
America of all-time.
