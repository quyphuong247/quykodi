00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:16,259
The Truth about Relativity
Why Everything Is Relative - Even When It

2
00:00:16,259 --> 00:00:17,929
Shouldn't Be

3
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:21,089
So imagine you're walking around the store
looking at things,

4
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:25,719
and you see a bread maker.
There's only one bread maker, and it costs

5
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:29,899
$99.
And You look at it and then move on to other

6
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:30,449
things.

7
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,710
This was a huge problem for a bread maker
company.

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,500
People weren't buying,
so they decided to do something clever.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,439
They came out with another more expensive
bread maker

10
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:44,459
so that they could start selling the less
expensive one.

11
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,560
So how did that work?

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,640
Well, now you walked around the store,
came across bread makers,

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,149
and you saw one for $99 and another one for
$199.

14
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:56,189
And all of a sudden,
there was something to compare it to,

15
00:00:56,189 --> 00:01:01,689
the $99 bread maker became much more attractive,
and people started to buy.

16
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:07,140
This is the power of relativity.
We have no idea about how much things should

17
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,930
cost.
Should a bread maker cost $49, $99, $199?

18
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,180
I mean who knows?!
Wine companies, along with restaurants,

19
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,368
and many other establishments
know this really well.

20
00:01:18,368 --> 00:01:22,269
Most people have no idea about wine.
If you're like most people,

21
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:27,500
you wouldn't be able to tell any difference
between a $10 wine and a $35 wine in a blind

22
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,670
test.

23
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,040
So because of this,
relativity is one of the most powerful tools.

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,200
If you're the buyer,
do you want to buy the wine that costs $10

25
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,740
or $35?
You know you won't be able to tell the difference

26
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:41,849
if you're like most people,
but hey, look,

27
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:46,879
there's also one for $70,
so I'm gonna go ahead and grab the $35 wine.

28
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:49,849
That is literally how most people make the
decision

29
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:51,280
on what to buy.

30
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,180
And this has huge implications if you're selling
as well.

31
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,759
Let's say I wanted to sell you
an educational product I made for $49.

32
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:01,400
Now who knows what a product like that should
cost?

33
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,439
I mean seriously...
But what if I put it in perspective for you?

34
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:07,758
What if I tell you...
If you live in North America,

35
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,568
that translates to going out
and eating twice at a mediocre restaurant.

36
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:15,348
Do you think it's worth it to give up eating
out those two times,

37
00:02:15,348 --> 00:02:17,938
so you can buy a product that really has the
potential

38
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:21,408
to make your life a lot better?
And I could actually do this really well,

39
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,808
and I don't even have to lie to you about
anything either,

40
00:02:23,808 --> 00:02:27,239
I can be super honest about it.
But the difference is that I've put it in

41
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,859
perspective for you now,
and you're much more likely to buy.

42
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:37,558
The Cost of Zero Cost
Why We Often Pay Too Much When We Pay Nothing

43
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:42,669
Alright, let's be honest...
How much pleasure do you derive from Amazon's

44
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:45,529
Free! shipping?
Me personally, I absolutely love it.

45
00:02:45,528 --> 00:02:48,789
I love when something is shipped to me for
free.

46
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:53,269
If you're final came out to $62 and you had
to pay $6 for shipping,

47
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:57,370
and if your final came out to $68 and shipping
was Free!,

48
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,718
most people are going to be much happier,
or what economists call deriving more utility,

49
00:03:01,718 --> 00:03:02,878
with the second purchase.

50
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,009
Now that's crazy but
there's something about Free!,

51
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:11,370
that we're just wired to absolutely love .
Perhaps, it's loss aversion that I talked

52
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,480
about in my last video.
When you pay $5 for something,

53
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,459
there's a chance that you made a bad decision,
so there is a downside to it.

54
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:21,278
You might get home and be sad that you didn't
make the right choice.

55
00:03:21,278 --> 00:03:25,698
But what happens in the case of free stuff
is that it seems like there's no downside,

56
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:30,159
especially by the standards of System 1,
which again I discussed in my last video.

57
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:33,209
If you get home, and the product sucks,
your brain will say,

58
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:35,930
"Well, whatever... I got it for free anyway."

59
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,199
But what if what you got is Ben and Jerry's
ice cream,

60
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,479
that you waited 2 hours for just like a lot
of people do?

61
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,699
Your System 1 will still say,
"Well, whatever... I don't like this flavor

62
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:49,900
but it's not like I paid for it."
But you did,

63
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,808
and you paid a lot!
2 hours of your time for a $3 item?

64
00:03:54,808 --> 00:03:59,049
Come on!
You're valuing your time at $1.50/per hour.

65
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,269
At least go for the minimum wage.

66
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:04,479
So there are huge implications to understanding
our love for

67
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,229
quote unquote FREE! stuff whether you're the
buyer or the seller.

68
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:12,269
You can dramatically diminish your irrational
behavior as a buyer,

69
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:15,739
and you can sell a lot more as a seller.

70
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:20,509
The Cost of Social Norms
Why We Are Happy to Do Things,

71
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:24,240
but Not When We Are Paid to Do Them

72
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,460
Imagine I'm your neighbor and I need help
with my car,

73
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:31,418
and you're walking by and you offer to help.
Now imagine I tell you thank you

74
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:34,490
and I offer you $5 when you're done helping
me.

75
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,590
That will make you angry and pissed off.
"What the hell?"

76
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:40,829
Now here's the thing...
From a traditional economic perspective,

77
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:45,579
$5 is much better than $0,
but we're confusing market norms with social

78
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:46,579
norms.

79
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:50,870
I could offer you a $1000 to help me,
and you will gladly help.

80
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,949
I could ask you as a human being in need,
and you will also help.

81
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:57,439
But as soon as I pay you $5,
I've messed everything up.

82
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:02,270
Now this has huge implications.
Dan Ariely has a great example of lawyers.

83
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:06,008
They were asked to offer services at a discounted
price of $30

84
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:09,470
to a group of people in need,
and they all rejected.

85
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,500
Then they were asked to offer services for
completely free

86
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,699
as a decent and a charitable thing to do
and most of them agreed.

87
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:21,000
This is the problem that we face today.
You don't want to offer the $30 to the people

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,399
that you're leading.
You either want to offer the real wage

89
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,049
and meet the market norms,
or you want offer something congruent with

90
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,919
social norms.
And I think utilizing these social norms

91
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:34,788
can have really efficient, amazing effects,
but at the same time,

92
00:05:34,788 --> 00:05:37,639
even large corporations don't quite clearly
understand

93
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:40,259
this distinction.
Instead of appreciating

94
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:43,139
the person's dedication to helping fix the
car,

95
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,780
they offer the $5 incentive.

96
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:52,038
The Problem of Procrastination and Self-Control
Why We Can't Make Ourselves Do

97
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:54,339
What We Want to Do

98
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:56,839
So Dan Ariely had a class where three papers
were due

99
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:00,068
by the end of the semester,
and also a class where the three papers were

100
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:03,658
spread out
with three deadlines at 4 weeks, 8 weeks,

101
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:05,319
and 12 weeks.

102
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:07,680
Now there was more to this study,
but to keep it simple,

103
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,400
let's look at the results.
The class with no deadlines did much worse

104
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:13,519
than
the class with the deadlines spread out throughout

105
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,709
the semester.

106
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:17,158
Now, two huge takeaways here...
One...

107
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:19,598
I know a lot of people who are working on
a project

108
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:22,310
or a new business or whatever you want to
accomplish,

109
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:27,199
and they don't have any set deadlines.
And if you do this, you're pretty much guaranteed

110
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,280
to fail.

111
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:30,859
You don't want to be one of those people.
A lot of times in life,

112
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,949
you won't have a teacher who will set the
deadlines for you,

113
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:36,439
but you have to set artificial deadlines for
yourself.

114
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:39,120
This is absolutely crucial!

115
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,999
One of the things that I've done with these
videos

116
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:45,669
is taking it from having no deadlines whatsoever,
to having a video that has to be ready for

117
00:06:45,668 --> 00:06:49,120
rendering every
Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday before I go

118
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,009
to bed.
I've stayed up till 6 in the morning sometimes

119
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:55,889
because I can't go to sleep unless the videos
are ready.

120
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:58,939
And for over a month now,
I've always had a video ready

121
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:01,849
for final rendering before I go to sleep.

122
00:07:01,848 --> 00:07:05,579
So this has obviously worked really well,
but if I was still struggling with it,

123
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:08,810
I would put some really unpleasant punishments
in place,

124
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,329
just like having points taken off if the paper
is late,

125
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:17,120
and just like how doctors offer paying
an extra $200 up front to patients

126
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,478
that will be deposited back into their bank
account

127
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:24,560
if they show up for their colonoscopy or whatever,
and a lot patients actually agree to it

128
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,069
because they know they will be forced to show
up

129
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:29,419
and do the right thing for their health.

130
00:07:29,418 --> 00:07:32,878
So if I were struggling with meeting my artificial
deadlines,

131
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,999
imagine how effective it would be setting
up a $500 punishment,

132
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:39,669
where if I don't have a video rendering in
my computer

133
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:43,120
before I go to sleep, I have to pay $500 to
a charity

134
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,889
that I absolutely hate.
Well I can guarantee you,

135
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:51,249
I would do anything and always have it ready
just so that wouldn't happen.

136
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:55,789
And there are so many aspects to procrastination,
which I will probably address at some point

137
00:07:55,788 --> 00:07:58,709
in maybe a quote unquote ultimate guide to
it or whatever,

138
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:02,278
but this particular part is a huge part.

139
00:08:02,278 --> 00:08:05,930
So again,
One... Set up artificial deadlines.

140
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,550
Two... If you're not meeting them,
set up some really unpleasant punishments,

141
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,199
and I will guarantee you that you will meet
them.

142
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,158
I had a friend a few years ago who had major
trouble

143
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:20,110
approaching girls that he liked.
So I took him out one time and got him to

144
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,439
agree
to give me a $100 that I would keep for myself

145
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,789
unless he approached every girl that I told
him to approach.

146
00:08:27,788 --> 00:08:31,278
The result...
He approached every single girl,

147
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:34,418
even if the interactions were possibly the
most awkward thing

148
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:38,699
I have ever seen.
But, fast forward a few years later now,

149
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,539
and he's better at it than almost any other
guy I know.
