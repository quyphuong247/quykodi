00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:14,280
Managing Oneself by Peter Drucker
Today is a time of immense and unprecedented

2
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:18,769
opportunity. Gone are the days where you are
stuck having to do the same job that your

3
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:24,109
father did. You can rise to the top of your
profession with drive, talent and ambition

4
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:29,219
and it doesn’t matter where you’ve come
from. However, to achieve this you must look

5
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:34,179
after your own career and not rely on a company
to do so for you. You must also personally

6
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:39,759
make sure you’re engaged and productive.
In this book, Peter Drucker explains how to

7
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:45,009
carve out your place in the world and when
to change course. He does so by asking a series

8
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:47,920
of questions.
What are my strengths?

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,990
You need to know what you’re good at as
a person can only perform from strengths.

10
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,710
Performance cannot be built on weaknesses.
The way to identify your strengths is through

11
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,870
feedback analysis. Write down your expected
outcomes for your key decisions and actions

12
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:08,578
then 9-12 months later, compare them with
the results.

13
00:01:08,578 --> 00:01:12,739
Based on this feedback you can put together
a plan of action:

14
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,009
Place yourself where your strengths can produce
results.

15
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:20,500
Work to improve your strengths.
Avoid intellectual arrogance and acquire skills

16
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:25,629
as required.
Remedy any bad habits. A weakness may in fact

17
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:30,920
just be a bad habit. For example, a weakness
of not being productive could be due to browsing

18
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,310
the internet too much. Eliminating that bad
habit could remove the weakness.

19
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:41,439
Know what not to do by identifying areas of
incompetence and then avoiding them.

20
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,879
How do I perform?
Drucker defines most people as being either

21
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:50,920
a “reader” or a “listener”. President
John F. Kennedy was a reader who surrounded

22
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,019
himself with a brilliant group of writers
who assisted him by writing to him before

23
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:00,780
discussing memos with him in person.
Another American president, Franklin D. Roosevelt

24
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,519
was a listener, preferring free-for-all press
conferences with no advanced warning of the

25
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,989
questions so he could discuss the matter out
loud rather than reading and writing.

26
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:16,310
You may learn through reading, writing, doing,
listening or talking. The important thing

27
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,530
is to always employ the methods that work.
Rather than trying to radically change yourself,

28
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,360
work harder to improve the way you perform
instead.

29
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,620
What are my values?
When it comes to ethics, Drucker advocates

30
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,509
what he calls the “mirror test”. Ask yourself
“what kind of person do I want to see in

31
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:38,129
the mirror in the morning?”.
Your personal value system should also be

32
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:43,159
compatible with that of the company that you
work for. Avoid conflicts where your values

33
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:48,280
differ. For example, is the company’s emphasis
on short term results or long term goals and

34
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,509
do they match yours? This is the ultimate
test to see if you’re compatible with your

35
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:56,280
employer.
Where do I belong?

36
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,280
Only a small minority know at a young age
where they belong. Mathematicians, musicians

37
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,939
and cooks are usually mathematicians, musicians
and cooks by the time they’re four or five

38
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:11,810
years old. Most people do not know where they
belong until they’re well past their mid-20s.

39
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:16,090
By then though, if they want to be highly
successful, they should know where they belong

40
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:21,860
or rather where they do not belong as successful
careers are not planned.

41
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,680
Successful careers develop when people are
prepared for opportunities because they know

42
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,390
their strengths, their way of working and
their values.

43
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:33,759
Knowing where one belongs can transform an
ordinary person that’s competent and hardworking

44
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,509
but otherwise mediocre, into an outstanding
performer.

45
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:42,318
What should I contribute?
The quest on contribution for a knowledge

46
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:48,518
worker involves several elements:
a) What does the situation require?

47
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:53,539
b) Given my strengths, methods and values,
what is the greatest contribution that I could

48
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:58,729
make to what needs to be done?
c) What results have to be achieved to make

49
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:02,369
a difference?
It is rarely possible to look too far ahead

50
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:08,349
in this situation. An 18 month plan should:
a) Achieve meaningful results and make a difference

51
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:12,000
b) Set stretched and difficult, but reachable
goals

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,319
c) Gain a visible and measurable outcome.
Therefore you should define a course of action

53
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:23,229
by planning what to do, where and how to start
and deciding what goals, objectives and deadlines

54
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:28,750
to set.
Responsibility for relationships

55
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,350
To manage oneself requires taking relationship
responsibility as most people work with other

56
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:38,490
people and are effective through other people.
Working relationships are as much based on

57
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:44,439
people as on work. It is important to take
responsibility of communicating how you perform

58
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:50,850
to reduce personality conflicts. Trust between
people is what companies are built on. This

59
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:56,720
doesn’t mean that colleagues necessarily
like each other, but they understand one another.

60
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,180
Drucker concludes that in the modern working
world, managing oneself requires unprecedented

61
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,769
things from the individual. This in effect
means that each knowledge worker should think

62
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:08,288
and behave like a CEO.
