1
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:13,789
So I remember watching the movie
The Pursuit of Happyness

2
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:18,129
a long long time ago,
and I just thought it was so beautiful.

3
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:22,570
I couldn't stop crying.
I was so amazed.

4
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,618
And then a few months ago,
my girlfriend and I wanted to watch a movie

5
00:00:26,618 --> 00:00:29,820
and we decided that's what we were going to
watch.

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,618
And this time,
I thought it was the dumbest thing I had ever

7
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:36,570
seen
and yet another stupid lesson from Hollywood.

8
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,750
And this is a really famous movie,
but just in case you haven't seen it,

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,799
let me recap it for you...

10
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:46,328
So this guy's really poor
and going through all this adversity,

11
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:50,030
but he has a chance of one day becoming a
stockbroker.

12
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,850
And the entire movie basically shows him
constantly worried,

13
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,189
constantly stressed,
constantly pissed off and negative,

14
00:00:57,189 --> 00:01:00,229
constantly yelling and getting into fights
with his wife,

15
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:05,759
BUT one day he might become a stockbroker
and finally attain happiness.

16
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:11,920
I guess Hollywood's version of happiness
is one day being a stockbroker.

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,000
And at the end of the movie,
of course he gets the job,

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,530
and he has now successfully pursued
and attained happiness.

19
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,959
Now, there are so many things wrong with that,
but let's start with this one...

20
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,310
It's weird that someone would even try to
pursue happiness,

21
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,329
because happiness cannot be pursued.
It's not like a degree that you pursue for

22
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:36,829
4 years
and then you finally get it

23
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:41,679
and can keep it for the rest of your life.
It's more like a birth certificate that just

24
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:44,799
comes with you.
It's in your house, you just have to find

25
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,530
it.
It doesn't depend on how big or small your

26
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,899
house,
it's in there.

27
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:54,519
So my first favorite idea from the book is,
Happiness cannot be pursued.

28
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:58,649
And to keep this from getting esoteric,
let me tell you a story.

29
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,849
So I remember when I was about 7 or 8
my parents left me with my grandma

30
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:06,500
and we never really had food at home.
And I don't mean that in the western sense

31
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,389
of
there's nothing that I like in the fridge.

32
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,669
No it was like,
there's nothing in the fridge that can be

33
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:16,030
consumed as calories.
And my grandma's only source of income was

34
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,049
her pension.
And I remember it was 13 Lari

35
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:22,760
which is about $6 or $7,
and sometimes they wouldn't even bring her

36
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,590
that.

37
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,539
Now, there was also a little bakery
at the end of the street.

38
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:30,359
And they had this little pastry that I really
really liked.

39
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,079
And it cost 20 Tetri which is about 10 cents.
But most of the time,

40
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:39,370
I didn't have money to go buy it.
So I was out on the street a lot with other

41
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,829
kids,
and I soon figured out that there was this

42
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:45,750
lemonade store.
And they'd give you 5 tetri if you brought

43
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,310
them
an empty lemonade bottle.

44
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,620
And I remember I'd wake up every day
and I would go looking for bottles on the

45
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,959
streets.
Now it was pretty hard to find those bottles,

46
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,468
but if I found four bottles that would mean
I could

47
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:01,098
bring them to the lemonade store and get 20
Tetri for them.

48
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:05,268
And I remember how I was just the happiest
kid alive.

49
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:09,688
Every time I found a bottle,
it was like the happiest moment of my life.

50
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:13,158
Every time I went to the lemonade store
and collected my 20 Tetri,

51
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:17,039
it was an unbelievable feeling.
And finally I would go to the little pastry

52
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,889
store,
and I would buy my little 20 Tetri pastry.

53
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:24,158
And I would sit out on the side walk
and just enjoy it.

54
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,968
And it was supposed to have raisins in it,
but since it was so cheap,

55
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:32,289
they only put a few of them in there.
And I remember the occasional raisin bite

56
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:35,688
and how I felt like the happiest kid alive.

57
00:03:35,688 --> 00:03:40,138
Now contrast that to today...
There have been times where I'm eating a $100

58
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:42,540
steak
and I'm pissed off and unhappy

59
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:47,489
because I ordered a medium well
but this looks more like a medium.

60
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:52,438
My night is now officially ruined guys.
I'm going to be negative for the rest of the

61
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:53,430
night.

62
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,590
Now, I'm not here to tell you that
the stale, bland, 10 cent pastry is better

63
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,269
than
a $100 steak.

64
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:04,039
I have a preference for the steak.
There's nothing wrong with improving your

65
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,519
life
and being able to experience more.

66
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,489
But that's all it is.
Just the ability to experience more.

67
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:15,468
What I will guarantee you is that
you either cultivate the ability to be happy

68
00:04:15,468 --> 00:04:19,310
and are able to be completely happy where
you are right now.

69
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,550
Or, I promise you there's absolutely nothing
around you

70
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:29,720
that you can chase to attain happiness.
Going from a 10 cent pastry to a $100 steak

71
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,440
is like going from having to take the bus
to owning a Ferrari.

72
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,990
Now I'm going to say this again.
Yes, it's okay if your preference is driving

73
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,019
a Ferrari
over taking the bus.

74
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:45,159
But remember,
all that does is just let you experience more.

75
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,000
That's it.
So you're either happy on the bus right now

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,399
just like you'll be happy when you have the
Ferrari.

77
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:56,258
Or you aren't happy on the bus right now
and you won't be happy in the Ferrari.

78
00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:00,150
And you know, I look at my life right now,
which is really really good.

79
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:03,469
But I also think of what it's going to be
like in 5 years.

80
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,780
And in 5 years, the quality of my life is
going to be

81
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:09,529
a hundred times better than what it is right
now.

82
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:11,918
It'll literally be like going from the 10
cent pastry

83
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:17,029
to a $100 steak all over again.
But I have to keep reminding myself that

84
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:20,978
I'm either going to be completely happy with
that pastry right now

85
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:25,068
just as I'll be completely happy with the
$100 steak in five years.

86
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:31,160
Or, I'm not going to be happy right now,
and I'm not going to be happy in five years.

87
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,870
My second favorite idea
is that there's a stimulus,

88
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,120
which is what happens to you,
which you can't control.

89
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,199
And then there's a response,
which is what you do about it,

90
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:44,270
which you have full control over.
But we treat the response like we have no

91
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:49,139
control over it.
It's just completely automatic for most people.

92
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:52,990
Something bad happens to you,
you automatically get pissed off.

93
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,788
But the reality is,
you don't have to.

94
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:59,318
You have complete control over it.
Doesn't matter what kind of stimulus you're

95
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:01,970
presented with,
no one can ever take away the ability

96
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,020
for you to choose whatever response you like.

97
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:08,728
So let's say you're in the kitchen,
and you break a bunch of new plates that you

98
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:12,628
just bought.
Now what's the automatic, natural reaction?

99
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:15,229
Getting pissed off, right?
You have to clean it up now.

100
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:18,399
Plus you broke a bunch of plates that you
just bought.

101
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:24,198
Or, what could be your other response?
Cool, it's just a bunch of plates.

102
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:27,430
It's not a big deal.
It's actually great because it's giving me

103
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,829
an opportunity
to not get pissed off by the stupidest little

104
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:34,149
things.
Like, you can have gratitude for breaking

105
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:37,089
the plates
and having the opportunity to practice your

106
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:40,378
virtue.
Remember you can pick whatever response you

107
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,689
like.
It's all up to you.

108
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:44,199
Someone puts you down?
Great!

109
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,439
You're one step closer to not caring
about what people think of you.

110
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:52,579
Or, you can go home and cry about it.
It's all up to you.

111
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:58,050
All the kids I grew up with, including myself,
went through a lot of adversity.

112
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:03,030
You know what happened to most of them?
They turned into alcoholics and drug addicts.

113
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:07,508
You know what their excuse is?
"I had to see my dad beat my mom.

114
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:09,770
My parents never had time to take care of
me.

115
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:15,628
I was so poor, I had no opportunity."
You know what my reason is for the very humble

116
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:20,939
accomplishments I have at 22-years-old?
The exact same thing.

117
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:25,129
There's no way most people
are going to have the same work ethic as me.

118
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:27,750
Most people don't know what it's like to be
7

119
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:33,740
and out on the street collecting dirty bottles,
so you can feed yourself.

120
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,930
They just won't be able to compete with me,
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,519
And I'm so thankful for every bullshit experience
I've had,

122
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,168
and I wouldn't change a single thing if I
could.

123
00:07:44,168 --> 00:07:47,318
Remember that...
There's a stimulus which you can't control,

124
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,960
but the response is all up to you.
Step in between that gap and realize

125
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:56,788
that everything can be taken away from you
but one remaining thing,

126
00:07:56,788 --> 00:07:59,300
and that is the freedom to choose.
