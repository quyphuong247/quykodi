1
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,570
Winston Churchill was born in Blenheim Palace
on 30th November 1874. His father was an English

2
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,800
politician, however despite eventually having
the same job, Churchill got most of his prominent

3
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,118
characteristics from his mother, as his father
was at first too busy and then struck with

4
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:36,229
illness, passing away when Churchill was 20.
Churchill and his American mother were both

5
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:40,349
full of energy, ambition and courage, with
a passion for adventure.

6
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,960
He did not do naturally well at school and
was written off as an academic failure by

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,730
his dad. It was mutually decided by both of
them that a career in the army was what lay

8
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:52,750
ahead for a young Churchill.
When in school he developed a fluency in the

9
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,179
English language. This mastery allowed his
words, both written and spoken, to be his

10
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:02,890
main source of income from the age of 21.
He wrote a lot; many articles and books, some

11
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,989
of them long. His account of the Second World
War is over two million words.

12
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:14,250
As a soldier he served in Cuba, India, Egypt,
Sudan and South Africa. He returned to London

13
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,329
with several medals.
It was on his return that he first ventured

14
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:23,170
into politics, winning a seat in 1900 and
making his first speech in the House of Commons

15
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:29,189
in 1901 at the age of 26. Eventually he would
go on to make 500 speeches in that room over

16
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:33,938
the course of the next 60 years.
He joined parliament as a Tory but switched

17
00:01:33,938 --> 00:01:39,258
to a Liberal in 1904. He was not a political
party man and his loyalty belonged to the

18
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:45,000
national interest and his own. When he eventually
lost his seat in 1922, he returned to the

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,409
Conservatives.
He joined the cabinet at the age of 34, becoming

20
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:54,540
president of the board of trade. Shortly after
this in 1908 he got married and went on to

21
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,990
have a son and four daughters.
His political career continued to rise, becoming

22
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:05,949
Home Secretary. This office he held he later
admitted he disliked the most, in particular

23
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,360
when exercising the power to confirm death
sentences.

24
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,340
He later took the government into the oil
industry, creating an oil company now known

25
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,890
as BP.
Churchill’s responsibility also included

26
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:22,869
the Royal Navy and he formed policies to increase
the ship construction rate after seeing Germany

27
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,840
increase theirs. It meant that when the First
World War began, the British fleet was ready.

28
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,200
When the Belgians were about to surrender
Ostend and Antwerp in the war, Churchill was

29
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:38,750
ordered to go to Antwerp and take charge.
He was delighted to and held the city for

30
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:43,568
a week, allowing three chief French channel
ports to be secured in the meantime.

31
00:02:43,568 --> 00:02:47,318
Prime Minister Asquith was thinking about
a coalition with the Tories which would require

32
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:51,958
Churchill to be removed of his position in
charge of the Royal Navy and this occurred

33
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,150
when Asquith began to fight for his own political
survival.

34
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:00,010
Churchill was determined to return to the
front line and fought in Flanders in 1915.

35
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:04,340
This service in the trenches helped him in
both World Wars as it enabled him to understand

36
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,330
the views of the ordinary soldiers.
Asquith was eventually ousted in 1916 and

37
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,239
Churchill returned as an unofficial advisor
on the war to new Prime Minister Lloyd George.

38
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:21,099
By 1917 he received an official title: Minister
of Munitions. Within a year, the British Army

39
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:25,518
was better supplied with weapons than the
French or Germans. He also made sure the Americans

40
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,689
arriving at this time were never short of
munitions either.

41
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:33,400
After Lloyd George won another election in
1918, he put Churchill in charge of the Army

42
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,700
and Air Force. In 1921 he also became head
of the Colonial Office.

43
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:44,199
A year later in 1922 Lloyd George was forced
to resign and his coalition government split,

44
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:48,780
leaving Churchill, nearing 50 years of age,
with no office or seat in parliament.

45
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,110
Throughout his life he nearly always drank
champagne at meal times. He had a special

46
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,379
room in his house for his cigars, but never
had more than 12 a day.

47
00:03:57,378 --> 00:04:02,848
A couple of years later in 1924, Churchill
returned to the House of Commons, winning

48
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:06,768
a seat with a large majority and promptly
joined the Conservatives, where he’d stay

49
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:11,319
for the rest of his career. Prime Minister
Baldwin had just won the general election

50
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:16,459
and made Churchill the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
As Chancellor he introduced five budgets,

51
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,709
each with a two hour speech superbly delivered
with majestic language. They were very popular

52
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:25,939
in parliament and the country as a whole,
described as “the great events of the parliamentary

53
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:31,550
year” by The Times newspaper. One aspect
where his persona changed completely was defence.

54
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,240
From building a fleet of over 1000 warships
when in charge of the Navy, as Chancellor

55
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,829
he became stingy, being particularly hard
on plans to replace the ships.

56
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:45,310
Despite performing well as Chancellor, his
Prime Minister lost the 1929 election and

57
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:50,139
he lost his job as a result. He also resigned
from his seat on the Conservative front bench

58
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:55,079
over the issue of allowing India to self-rule,
which he was against. He went to America to

59
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:59,909
lecture and write. His fortune whilst over
there was not great. Despite earning lots

60
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:04,880
of money from his writings in the past, he
lost it all in the Wall Street Crash. Then

61
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:09,060
he was seriously injured by a car after looking
the wrong way when crossing the road.

62
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,750
In 1933, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany.
Churchill initially had no success in alerting

63
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,319
public opinion to the danger of Germany, despite
expressing the view that aerial warfare would

64
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,009
be devastating and told the house that 40,000
Londoners alone would be killed or injured

65
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:30,470
in the first week of war. Eventually by 1935
his speeches started to make some progress.

66
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:35,720
After the Nazi invasion of Poland, Britain
and France declared war. Soon after, Churchill

67
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,240
was invited to accept his old post as head
of the Navy, which he did along with a seat

68
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,490
in the war cabinet.
During this time he received a letter from

69
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,960
Franklin D Roosevelt offering friendship which
Churchill accepted allowing Britain and the

70
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:52,888
USA to be brought closer, something which
would prove invaluable in the coming years.

71
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:56,449
Prime Minister Chamberlain was heavily criticised
for Britain’s failure to stop Norway being

72
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:02,449
taken over by Nazi forces and with his support
dwindling, he decided to resign. On Friday

73
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:07,639
10th May 1940 Winston Churchill got the job
of Prime Minister, twelve hours after the

74
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:12,500
Germans had begun their campaign against France.
His first victory over Hitler was won over

75
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,889
the air waves. Whilst Hitler was the most
popular leader in German history from 1933-39,

76
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:23,500
the German people did not want to be lead
into a World War. When he invaded Czechoslovakia

77
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:29,769
in March 1939, it was his first major unpopular
act. Hitler ceased to make public speeches

78
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:34,668
after sensing his loss in popularity. Churchill
on the other hand increased his presence in

79
00:06:34,668 --> 00:06:39,478
newspapers and newsreels with a series of
memorable and electrifying speeches.

80
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:43,969
Churchill sensed the importance of air power
and the opportunities it offered. He instructed

81
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,440
his aircraft production minister to go flat
out and British production overtook German

82
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:54,269
both in quantity and quality. The battle over
British skies was won by Britain and the Germans

83
00:06:54,269 --> 00:07:00,189
resorted to night bombing. He paid tribute
to the RAF fighter pilots in a speech: “Never

84
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:05,978
in the field of human conflict was so much
owed by so many to so few”. This victory

85
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:09,769
in the Battle of Britain allowed Churchill
to then go on the offensive.

86
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:16,668
In late 1941, Hitler declared war on America.
This would prove to be his biggest mistake.

87
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:21,399
Japan was already attacking Britain and America
but Churchill persuaded Roosevelt to defeat

88
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:26,189
Germany first. This would be the most important
act of persuasion in Churchill’s entire

89
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:29,319
career.
He got the Americans to agree to a joint landing

90
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:34,520
in Africa which succeeded and all Axis forces
there surrendered. Then followed Churchill’s

91
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:39,198
invasion of Sicily and Italy, causing the
Italians to switch sides and join the Allies.

92
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,348
There was also Churchill’s campaign of heavy
bomber assaults on Germany. Despite things

93
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:49,959
going badly wrong elsewhere, these raids kept
his popularity high. Churchill was not held

94
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:55,788
back by humanitarian motives and the raids
killed 600,000 German civilians and destroyed

95
00:07:55,788 --> 00:07:59,399
the remainder’s morale.
The Allied invasion of North West Europe was

96
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:04,579
timed correctly by Churchill and was necessary
to defeat Germany. It was achieved with minimal

97
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:07,939
loss of life for so hazardous and immense
an operation.

98
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:13,439
By the end of the war, Churchill was 70 years
old. He wanted to continue the coalition government

99
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:19,728
but was forced to begin an election campaign
with the Tory party. Labour won and in 1945

100
00:08:19,728 --> 00:08:23,508
Churchill was out.
In opposition his main task was to arouse

101
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:28,479
the world to the dangers presented by the
power of the Soviet Union under Stalin. In

102
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:35,620
1951, Churchill returned to power. In 1953,
the Queen made him a knight and in 1955 he

103
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,870
handed over the reins and stepped down as
Prime Minister, staying as a Member of Parliament

104
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:46,159
until 1964. He died the following year, aged
90 having lived a full life and is now seen

105
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:52,100
by many as the greatest Briton that ever lived.
So what can we learn from his life?

106
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,560
Always aim high. He may not have always met
his elevated target, but by aiming high, he

107
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:03,139
always achieved something worthwhile.
There’s no substitute for hard work. He

108
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:05,559
worked hard at everything to the best of his
ability.

109
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:11,609
Never allow mistakes or criticism to get you
down. His career was an exercise in how courage

110
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:16,440
can be displayed providing reassurance and
inspiration to others.

111
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,620
Waste no energy on the meanness of life. There
was no recrimination, shifting the blame,

112
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:27,320
malice or vendettas in his tenure.
Absence of hatred, leaves room for plenty

113
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:33,959
of joy in life. Churchill was happy with people.
No great leader was ever laughed at, or with,

114
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,278
more than Sir Winston Churchill.
