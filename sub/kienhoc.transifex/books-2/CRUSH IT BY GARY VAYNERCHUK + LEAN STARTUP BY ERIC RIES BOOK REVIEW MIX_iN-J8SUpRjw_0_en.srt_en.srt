1
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:26,978
i see alot on youtube channels these days.
they were able to get success only in one year

2
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:29,388
and everybody wants to know how to do that right ?

3
00:00:29,388 --> 00:00:34,908
in this book there is an effective marketing
strategy for social media that explains how do it

4
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:37,028
it's called "word of mouth"

5
00:00:37,029 --> 00:00:41,579
and the idea behind word of mouth, is to create
extremely great content.

6
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,878
soo good that people would feel bad not to
share it with their friends and family.

7
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,140
so you could be spending alot of time optimizing
your tags and titles to get your video ranking

8
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:54,009
on the first page of youtube.

9
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:57,250
but if you do not have the right strategy,
you're going to lose.

10
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,640
so let's get into it

11
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,009
to be able to achieve word of mouth there
are a few factors that needs to be in place.

12
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:05,849
the first one is expertise and passion

13
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:07,349
you have to know your stuff.

14
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:10,240
if i'm starting a youtube channel on self
development

15
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,519
i must have at least have a decent level of
expertese in that niche.

16
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:16,700
i need to know the
stuff that works and the things that doesn't.

17
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,140
so you can't be putting
wrong information out there.

18
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,879
you need to know what you're talking about.

19
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,699
also, your channel idea should be based on something that you really enjoy doing.

20
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,900
working or relaxing becomes the same because
your doing what you love either way.

21
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,060
the second factor and the most important one
is great content

22
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,079
if you're working on youtube or twitter

23
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,920
and you haven't had a single subscriber for the past three months !

24
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,460
it just means that your content sucks
you have to make better quality videos.

25
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:49,839
and am not talking about what microphone you
should use or what webcam you need to buy

26
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:51,689
all that stuff is secondary.

27
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:54,468
on social media, what really matters is:

28
00:01:54,468 --> 00:01:56,788
Value: is your content valuable?

29
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:58,859
engagement: is it engaging enough ?

30
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:02,748
and uniqueness: are you different or better
than your competitors ?

31
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:05,168
let's look at the first one wich is value.

32
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:09,649
the whole thing about offering value is to
genuinely care about your customers.

33
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:14,788
Gary talks alot about caring in this book
as THE most powerful marketing tool.

34
00:02:14,788 --> 00:02:20,448
let's say you made a video offering tips for
people who suffer from anxiety.

35
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:27,129
now before you can put it out on the internet
i want you to imagine your self in that person's skin

36
00:02:27,128 --> 00:02:32,149
you are the one who has the anxiety now and
you stumbled upon your own video.

37
00:02:32,149 --> 00:02:37,568
after watching it, did it help ? was it of
great help ? or was it just a waste of time.

38
00:02:37,568 --> 00:02:41,348
make a video like if you were the one who's
going to watch it.

39
00:02:41,348 --> 00:02:43,788
put your self in the viewer's skin.

40
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:47,248
that is how you know if you're caring enough or not.

41
00:02:47,248 --> 00:02:52,549
that is how you know if you're offering as
much value as possible or not.

42
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:56,680
when it comes to social media, offering value
isn't enough.

43
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,120
that value has to be conveyed in a way that
will hold the viewer's attention

44
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,000
and not click off your video.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,719
the thing about engagement is to try different
styles then find out what works for you.

46
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,780
depending on what kind of content you make.

47
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:11,530
but for educational videos for example.

48
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,719
you really have to make sure that your script
or commentaries

49
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:17,149
aren't irrelevant to the title of your video.

50
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,760
try to write a meaningful script that is straight
to the point.

51
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,799
make it short. don't do long introductions
talking about your dog or how much you love cookies

52
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,100
when your video title says "how to build self esteem"

53
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,400
keep it simple, practical, and straight to the point.

54
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,760
also don't do longer videos because you
think that it will get you more views or watch time

55
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:38,109
people can sense that.

56
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:43,449
i see videos that are 30 minutes long, and
if i were to measure how much value they offered

57
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:46,569
the video would be worth 3 minutes of watch time.

58
00:03:46,568 --> 00:03:50,968
be realistic, it's better to make a 2 minute
video that teachs people something

59
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:55,908
than to make a longer one that has no value
wasting your time with it and other people's time

60
00:03:55,908 --> 00:04:01,108
keep this in mind: if someone were to watch
your channel he must feel like you really care about him

61
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:05,489
think of your content
as a sign of respect toward your audience.

62
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,719
now uniqueness:

63
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:10,919
most of us aren't creative enough to come
up with something unique.

64
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:15,500
so, if you cannot be different then you have
to be the best in your niche.

65
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,459
most people will hear that and say:

66
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,439
"okey, wait, being different is hard, but
becoming the best is more difficult"

67
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:24,860
"and i don't think i'm capable of doing that"

68
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,220
"i'm not funny enough, i'm not interesting,
and i have no value to offer"

69
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,930
well luckily for you.

70
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,740
here is where the lean startup by Eric Ries
comes into play.

71
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:40,089
Eric ries, author of the lean startup explains
that to be able to build the best product

72
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:42,069
you don't have to be perfect from the start.

73
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:47,310
in fact what you really need is failure when
first starting out and with failure comes the lessons.

74
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,780
you have to go through
a cycle of failures to create the best product.

75
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:54,439
and he basically calls it the build-measure-learn cycle

76
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,480
now suppose you have an online business

77
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,900
a youtube channel, a twitter or an instagram.

78
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,679
your product is your content.

79
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,620
in the beginning what you really want to
do is to put yourself out there

80
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,480
create something, anything.

81
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,560
just like i did with my first video.

82
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,720
on that one i sounded like if i were on drugs
or something, and that's pretty much how i started

83
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,320
that is what the build phase is all about.

84
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,199
you create something
throw it out to the public and wait for a reaction.

85
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,899
when i published my first youtube video
i got some comments saying :

86
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:27,560
"hey dude your voice-overs suck, your animating sucks

87
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,459
and everything about you seems to suck"

88
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:32,819
and i'm like okey cool
now we have something to work with at least.

89
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:35,120
people are telling me to improve this and that

90
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,360
good, we arrived at the measure phase.

91
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,340
Relative to the feedback you received, in the measure phase you analyze what went wrong in the build phase.

92
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,270
and the last phase is learn, wich is to learn
from your mistakes

93
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:49,789
and try to make a better product next time.

94
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:54,270
forget about being perfect from the start
to learn you have to be imperfect.

95
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:56,629
and linking this back to social media

96
00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:00,209
if you want to make sure that
your videos are the best out there

97
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:05,658
you have to go through the same
build-measure-learn cycle as many times as you can

98
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,540
and to never stop improving.

99
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,500
that's how you come up with the best product
the best quality videos.

100
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,620
keep putting content out there
and always make everything better than previous.

101
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,399
so let's summarize really quick

102
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,899
if you want to be successful on social media

103
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:26,560
these are the questions that you should be
asking yourself when creating your content:

104
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,939
One: is this actually helpful? depending on
what content you make

105
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:34,619
but, if you're doing an educational video for example

106
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,879
keep in mind if a person were to watch it
what are the lessons that he would learn from it?

107
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:45,259
also make sure you're offering value in way
that it is engaging OR entertaining enough

108
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:47,098
to hold the viewer's attention.

109
00:06:47,098 --> 00:06:51,199
Two: is my video remarkable or different in
any way?

110
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,718
Because you can't be doing what everyone else is doing

111
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,720
if you aren't creative enough to be different
then you have to be better

112
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,940
and preferably the best in your niche

113
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:05,399
and to achieve that, you have to keep going
through the same build-measure-learn cycle.

114
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:12,819
and in the process of doing so, you will discover
how to create the best product and dominate your niche

115
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:15,839
and the third question
and the most important of all three:

116
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:22,079
is my content good enough to be shared?
because that's what word of mouth is all about.

117
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,800
as i said in the beginning, word of mouth
is caring enough for your customers

118
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,740
and offering as much as you can

119
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,680
so they would support you back
by spreading the word about your business.

120
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,879
people can sense if you truly care or not
so try to create content

121
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:39,620
as if you were making it for yourself

122
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:45,658
and always remember, word of mouth
is about creating extremely great content.

123
00:07:45,658 --> 00:07:50,178
soo good, that people would feel bad not to share.

124
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,459
and to be able to achieve that

125
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:57,189
always make everything better than previous.
