Steve Jobs: The Exclusive Biography by Walter
Isaacson

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,400
Steve Jobs is a man who revolutionised six
different industries (PCs, Animated films,

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,899
Music, Phones, Tablets and digital publishing).
This is the story of his life and how he achieved

4
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:25,250
that remarkable feat.
Steven Paul Jobs was born on the 24th February

5
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,618
1955 in San Francisco. He was adopted and
this was something he was aware of from a

6
00:00:29,618 --> 00:00:35,210
young age. Jobs claimed this made him feel
independent but not abandoned. He treated

7
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,870
his adoptive parents as his “real” parents.
Jobs realised at a young age that he was brighter

8
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:44,830
than his parents but also became aware that
they knew this and adapted their lives for

9
00:00:44,831 --> 00:00:50,051
him to accommodate him and give him opportunities.
As well as a feeling of abandonment, he also

10
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:54,579
felt “special”.
Jobs learnt to read before he went to school

11
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:59,530
and often found himself bored. He would play
pranks until he was moved to an advanced class

12
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:04,329
which kept his attention and kept him enthused.
He skipped a year and went to a different

13
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:08,809
school but he was bullied so his parents moved
house so that he could attend yet another

14
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:13,530
school. It was in the garage of this house
that his father tinkered with cars and Jobs

15
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,519
experimented with electronics.
The Hewlett-Packard Explorers Club was a group

16
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:22,539
of students that gathered and listened to
an engineer from an HP lab that would talk

17
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,870
to them each week on what he or she was working
on. Jobs was fascinated and wanted to get

18
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,978
some parts to work on things himself, so he
got the number of Bill Hewlett the CEO and

19
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:39,509
spoke to him for about 20 minutes. Hewlett
got him the parts but also offered him a job.

20
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,000
While still a student, Jobs became friends
with a former student five years his elder,

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,079
Stephen Wozniak or “Woz” as he was known.
Woz was interested in electronics from a young

22
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,599
age, inspired by his father who worked as
a rocket scientist. Both Jobs and Woz shared

23
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:59,438
an appreciation of electronics, as well as
music and practical jokes. They also made

24
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:04,809
a good partnership when it came to work. Woz
had the engineering skills and Jobs had the

25
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,759
vision.
Jobs went to Reed college, which was a liberal

26
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,878
arts school in Portland, Oregon. He lived
a hippie lifestyle while he was there, reading

27
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,858
about Zen Buddhism, experimenting with his
diet and taking psychedelic drugs. Jobs got

28
00:02:17,859 --> 00:02:22,040
bored at college, specifically he didn’t
enjoy going to the classes he was required

29
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:27,769
to go to. He dropped out of college but did
still attend classes that interested him.

30
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:31,849
One such class was a calligraphy course that
Jobs said influenced him to create the Mac

31
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:36,810
computer with multiple typefaces and proportionally
spaced fonts.

32
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,251
After 18 months, Jobs returned to his parents’
house and got a job working for Atari, the

33
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:46,658
video game company who developed the famous
arcade game, Pong. The simplicity of Atari’s

34
00:02:46,658 --> 00:02:51,578
games and lack of need for any sort of manual
influenced Jobs in his later endeavours.

35
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:58,269
Jobs’ interest in spirituality continued
and he travelled to India for most of 1974.

36
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:02,209
When he returned to work at Atari, he was
set a challenge to design a one-player version

37
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:08,058
of pong, receiving a financial bonus for each
computer chip fewer than 50 he would use.

38
00:03:08,058 --> 00:03:11,818
Jobs brought in Wozniak to help him engineer
the game and after four days they got the

39
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:17,468
work done using only 45 chips.
In his spare time, Woz was building a personal

40
00:03:17,468 --> 00:03:22,840
computer. In 1975 he became the first person
to type a character on a keyboard and have

41
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,838
it display on the monitor in front of them.
Jobs was impressed and convinced Woz to start

42
00:03:27,838 --> 00:03:32,878
a company with him to sell the computer’s
circuit boards. Jobs came up with the name

43
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,209
“Apple” as he was on a fruit based diet
and had just visited an apple farm. It would

44
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:42,819
also appear before Atari in the phonebook.
After a demo, a computer shop owner offered

45
00:03:42,818 --> 00:03:49,188
to pay for 50 fully assembled circuit boards
at $500 each. More orders followed and eventually

46
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:53,650
they created the Apple I personal computer,
including a case with a sleek design that

47
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,650
set Apple apart from the other machines around.
The Apple I would go on to be sold for the

48
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:05,349
next 16 years and register six million sales.
Apple as a company had grown to a dozen employees

49
00:04:05,348 --> 00:04:09,498
and moved out of the Jobses’ family garage
into a rented office.

50
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:15,180
For the previous five years, Jobs had been
in an on-off relationship with Chrisann Brennan.

51
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:21,108
She got pregnant and gave birth to their daughter
Lisa in 1978. Jobs did not deal with the pregnancy

52
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:26,399
well, either ignoring it or denying he was
the father. A year after Lisa was born, Jobs

53
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,370
took a paternity test and was forced to start
paying child support. He didn’t exercise

54
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:36,240
his visitation rights for a long time. His
behaviour regarding his daughter is one of

55
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,189
the few things he is remorseful about. After
the court case, Jobs changed. He stopped taking

56
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:46,939
drugs, dressed smarter and cut back on his
Zen interests. One of the next projects Apple

57
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:52,620
took on was a computer Jobs called “Lisa”.
Once the court case was finished, Jobs took

58
00:04:52,620 --> 00:05:01,668
Apple public. Its valuation went from $5,309
in January 1977 to $1.79 billion in December

59
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:09,029
1980. Over 300 people involved in the company
became instant millionaires. Now in his mid-twenties,

60
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:14,739
Jobs had fame and fortune, appearing on the
cover of TIME magazine among many others.

61
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,900
In the early ‘80s, Jobs was put in charge
of the Macintosh project, named after the

62
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:24,468
previous manager’s favourite type of apple
(but spelt differently). Jobs not only created,

63
00:05:24,468 --> 00:05:29,339
but successfully marketed a machine that transformed
personal computing.

64
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:33,388
One of the greatest traits that Jobs possessed
was his ability to convince people of nearly

65
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:38,960
anything. His powers of persuasion were described
as a “reality distortion field”. A combination

66
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,818
of his charisma, willpower and eagerness led
people to get caught in this distortion field

67
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:48,360
and allowed Jobs to be able to actually change
reality. It made people do the impossible,

68
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,689
because they didn’t realise it was impossible.
Jobs applied his distortion field to his Mac

69
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:58,870
team which resulted in unrealistic timeframes
and expectations. Whilst his behaviour was

70
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:03,949
not necessary or justified and could be demoralising
at times, it could also be motivating and

71
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:09,210
inspiring, which resulted in the Mac team
achieving some really great results.

72
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:13,839
Ever since Jobs started Apple he was a firm
believer in great design. He knew a simple

73
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:19,079
logo and sleek casing would set apart his
company and products from the rest. Apple’s

74
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,089
first office was in a building shared with
Sony and Jobs used to study their marketing

75
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:28,899
material and dark, industrial style. Then
he attended a design conference and was exposed

76
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:33,658
to the Bauhaus movement, which merged art
with manufacturing, creating a bright, simple

77
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:39,250
and clean look. This is the look he implemented
on his Apple products.

78
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,769
With the launch of the Macintosh significantly
delayed due to Jobs’ insistence on not compromising,

79
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:50,508
IBM had increased its share of the PC market
by 26% in the previous two years. There was

80
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:55,009
pressure on the Mac launch in January 1984,
with the machine being initially priced at

81
00:06:55,009 --> 00:07:02,918
$2,495. A lot more than the $1000 originally
proposed and $500 more than Jobs wanted due

82
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:08,210
to additional marketing costs.
When planning the launch, Jobs asked for a

83
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:11,658
revolutionary commercial that matched the
product it was selling in terms of astonishing

84
00:07:11,658 --> 00:07:16,728
the audience. Ridley Scott was hired as the
ad director and it was filmed in London with

85
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:23,998
a budget of $750,000. The ad was based on
the George Orwell novel 1984 but with a different

86
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:29,020
ending with a sledgehammer smashing the screen,
vaporising big brother and announcing the

87
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:33,339
new Macintosh. It first played during the
Super Bowl and won various awards for the

88
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:38,098
greatest commercial of all time.
Jobs became a master of product launches from

89
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:45,089
the Mac in 1984 to the iPad in 2010. He combined
captivating adverts with comprehensive media

90
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:49,978
coverage, appearing on the covers of publications
such as Time and Newsweek. The final piece

91
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:55,528
of the puzzle was a launch event with a public
unveiling of the product by Jobs himself.

92
00:07:55,528 --> 00:07:59,860
After the successful launch, sales for the
Mac slowed down in the second half of 1984.

93
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,028
Woz left his role in the company as an Apple
I engineer, citing Jobs not being appreciative

94
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:10,658
of the Apple I as his reason, despite its
accounting for 70% of sales at Christmas 1984.

95
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:16,521
The relationship between Jobs and the Apple
CEO also deteriorated to a point where a him

96
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:21,968
or me ultimatum was issued at a board meeting.
The board sided with the CEO and Jobs was

97
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:26,110
removed as head of the Mac team.
Jobs resigned from his position as chairman

98
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:31,490
of the company soon after and he left Apple
completely. He sold all his Apple shares bar

99
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,250
one, so he could still attend shareholder
meetings. At 30 years of age, he started a

100
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:41,599
new venture called NeXT. NeXT would develop
and manufacture computers for the higher education

101
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,589
market.
Unfortunately, despite an appealing design

102
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:50,420
and the usual hype created around its launch,
the first NeXT computer was ultimately a disappointment

103
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:56,439
for many people. The $6,500 price tag was
higher than expected and despite having a

104
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,060
factory that could produce 10,000 of these
machines a month, they only sold 400 a month

105
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:06,588
and the company lost a lot of money.
At the same time, Jobs had struck a deal with

106
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:12,620
George Lucas to buy his Lucasfilm computer
division. Jobs paid Lucas $5 million with

107
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,259
the promise of a further $5 million investment
into what would become a standalone company.

108
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:23,019
In return, Jobs owned 70% of the newly formed
company, called Pixar, named after one of

109
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:28,940
its computers. Pixar made hardware and software
for rendering digital images but it also had

110
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,781
a group of animators, who made short films.
While the hardware and software wings of the

111
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:39,319
company didn’t do well, the animation side
did. Walt Disney’s nephew Roy wanted to

112
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,730
revive Disney’s animation department and
Pixar won the contract to computerise the

113
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:50,310
development. In 1988, the first film they
worked on was The Little Mermaid. In the same

114
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:55,389
year, Pixar won an academy award for one of
their shorts called Tin Toy.

115
00:09:55,389 --> 00:10:00,559
In October 1989, Jobs gave a lecture at Stanford
Business School and before he was introduced

116
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:05,458
to the stage, was sat next to a graduate student
called Laurene Powell. The two hit it off

117
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:11,000
straight away and Jobs proposed on New Year’s
Day in 1990. They got married the following

118
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,590
year and Jobs’ daughter Lisa (now aged 14)
moved in with them in their new home in Palo

119
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:21,389
Alto, California. A few months after they
were married, Laurene Powell gave birth to

120
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:27,720
Jobs’ second child – Reed Paul Jobs. They
had a second child together in 1995, a daughter

121
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,460
called Erin and another daughter in 1998 called
Eve.

122
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:37,660
Back at Pixar a deal was struck between them
and Disney to produce the film Toy Story together.

123
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:43,419
The film was a tremendous box office success
and week after it opened in the cinemas, Pixar

124
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:49,479
went public. It meant the shares Jobs owned
were worth $1.2 billion, about five times

125
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,750
the amount he’d made when Apple went public.
The Disney and Pixar deal was renegotiated

126
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,370
to consist of producing five films over the
next ten years, with equal branding on the

127
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,959
films.
Since his departure from Apple, the company

128
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:07,419
had nose-dived. There was little innovation
and the Mac had hardly improved and its market

129
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:14,009
share had fallen to just 4%. The share price
of the company had gone from $70 in 1991 to

130
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:20,190
just $14 in 1996. Apple needed a new operating
system as the latest one they had produced

131
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:25,190
was not good enough. They agreed to purchase
NeXT to be able to use its operating system

132
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:30,980
software. As part of the deal Jobs returned
to Apple in a part-time role as advisor to

133
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,970
the chairman.
When the Apple board decided to sack the current

134
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,660
CEO, Jobs took a more active role getting
involved in all aspects of the business and

135
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:44,689
joined the board. When it became public knowledge
that Jobs was heavily involved, the stock

136
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:50,370
rose to $20. Jobs announced a new partnership
with Microsoft which meant Microsoft would

137
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:56,778
invest $150 million into Apple and continue
to develop Microsoft Office for the Mac. Apple’s

138
00:11:56,778 --> 00:12:03,088
stock rose to $26 after the day of the announcement.
Eventually, Jobs took on the role of interim

139
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:09,130
CEO, or iCEO as it became known. He was back
in charge despite not receiving a salary or

140
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:14,458
signing any formal contract. It was the most
gruelling time of his life, being CEO of two

141
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:19,208
companies and having a young family took its
toll on his health.

142
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:24,369
Jobs ability to focus helped Apple succeed
again. The previous CEO had approved dozens

143
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:29,310
of different products and Jobs got rid of
70% of them, resulting in over 3,000 staff

144
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:34,208
losing their jobs. It meant the remaining
staff were now more focused on a smaller range

145
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:39,958
of four products: a professional desktop,
a professional portable, a consumer desktop

146
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:45,888
and a consumer portable. This strategy resulted
in Apple going from making a loss of $1.04

147
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:53,068
billion in 1997 to a profit of $309 million
in 1998.

148
00:12:53,068 --> 00:12:58,019
In May 1998, Apple released a desktop computer
called the iMac. The ‘i’ on this and many

149
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:03,389
future products refers to the internet, which
the product seamlessly integrates with. The

150
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:08,129
teardrop shaped design was unlike anything
seen before. The casing was a translucent

151
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:13,208
blue colour that allowed you to see inside
the computer. The colour was named “Bondi

152
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:18,509
blue” after the colour of the water of an
Australian beach. It included a handle – not

153
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:22,129
because many people wanted to move around
a desktop, but because it let people feel

154
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:27,198
comfortable touching the machine. At this
time many people were still scared of technology

155
00:13:27,198 --> 00:13:29,959
and didn’t touch anything they were scared
of.

156
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:35,410
The iconic product epitomised Apple’s “Think
different” slogan. The iMac became the fastest

157
00:13:35,409 --> 00:13:41,838
selling computer in Apple’s history with
32% of sales from first time buyers of a computer.

158
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,360
Jobs announced his role as CEO was permanent
in January 2000. The Apple board were thrilled

159
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,278
and he was given a private jet from them in
celebration.

160
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:55,159
Jobs liked to control the entire process at
Apple but one aspect he didn’t have control

161
00:13:55,159 --> 00:14:00,039
of was the customer experience of buying an
Apple product at a store. He began developing

162
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:05,199
Apple stores in 1999. He decided the stores
should have only one entrance to control the

163
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,329
experience more easily, they shouldn’t be
long and narrow so customers can intuitively

164
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:13,539
work out the layout when entering and they
should be in main streets and shopping centres

165
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:18,149
to attract a lot of foot traffic.
Inside the stores they would be minimalistic

166
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:22,789
and provide people with the ability to try
out the products. Many people not familiar

167
00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:26,610
with Apple thought of it as a cult but this
would help change their view of the company

168
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:31,250
as “something cool”.
The first store opened in May 2001 and in

169
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:37,159
the first year the stores had taken $1.2 billion
in revenue. A decade later there were over

170
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:43,559
326 stores worldwide averaging revenue of
$34 million per store every year but their

171
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:48,989
presence also helps create a buzz for product
launches and they increase brand awareness.

172
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:53,409
The next aim for Jobs was to create a strategy
to transform the personal computer into a

173
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:57,948
“digital hub” and in turn evolve Apple
into a technology company rather than just

174
00:14:57,948 --> 00:15:03,689
a computer company. Apple started producing
software focusing on people working with art

175
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:08,790
and technology. This meant that Apple could
control the full user experience as they now

176
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:14,319
produced software, hardware and digital devices
allowing them to be tightly integrated, something

177
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,300
no other company could do at the time.
After creating iTunes, the next stage of the

178
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:24,229
strategy was to make a portable music player.
The aim was to make the device as simple to

179
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,339
use as possible, while the complex tasks can
be carried out on the computer (in iTunes).

180
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:34,250
In fact the iPod was so simple, it didn’t
even have an on/off button – the device

181
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:39,289
would just become dormant when not in use.
The device could hold 1,000 songs and fit

182
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:44,458
in your pocket. The television adverts showed
dancing silhouettes with pure white headphones,

183
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:49,588
which were themselves iconic due to almost
all other headphones being black at the time.

184
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:53,470
Now Apple provided the means to manage all
elements of your own music collection, the

185
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:58,699
next step was to provide a way for consumers
to purchase new music through the company.

186
00:15:58,698 --> 00:16:03,198
Jobs created the iTunes store and sold songs
individually as well as full albums, saying

187
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:07,208
it was the only way to compete with piracy
that was rife at the time, facilitated by

188
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:12,008
software such as Napster and Kazaa. The main
challenge though was to get all the music

189
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:17,120
labels on board to provide a big library.
Luckily for Jobs, the major music companies

190
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,318
were upset about piracy and impressed with
Apple’s solution making it easy for the

191
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:27,328
consumer and safe for the record labels. It
was announced in April 2003, starting with

192
00:16:27,328 --> 00:16:32,838
200,000 tracks and increased each day. In
the first six days after launch, it sold 1

193
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:37,600
million songs.
As rival devices were released by competitors,

194
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,000
Apple launched new iterations of the iPod
to increase their market lead. The iPod mini

195
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,198
came out in January 2004. Its small size proved
ideal to use during exercise and increased

196
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:54,229
Apple’s market share from 31% to 74% in
the 18 months after it launched. The iPod

197
00:16:54,230 --> 00:17:00,860
shuffle played songs randomly and was simplified
further by not even having a screen. By February

198
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:08,250
2006 the iTunes store had sold a billion songs.
Also in 2006, Disney agreed to purchase Pixar

199
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:14,089
in a deal worth $7.4 billion. Jobs became
the largest individual shareholder owning

200
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:20,259
7% of the stock. As part of the deal, Pixar
still retained its individual identity with

201
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:24,089
Disney’s animation department being placed
under Pixar.

202
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:28,850
Back in October 2003 a routine scan of his
kidneys revealed that Jobs had a tumour on

203
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:34,050
his pancreas. He kept his cancer diagnosis
secret until the day after he had surgery

204
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:39,909
in June 2004. Unfortunately the operation
to remove part of his pancreas revealed the

205
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:44,890
cancer had spread to his liver. Despite the
illness, he returned to work and continued

206
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:49,390
to run Apple.
In 2005, the digital camera market was being

207
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:54,470
decimated by the fact that mobile phones could
now take photos. Jobs realised the same could

208
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:59,921
happen to the iPod, which accounted for 45%
of the revenue for Apple that year. If a phone

209
00:17:59,921 --> 00:18:05,150
could play music, the iPod would be unnecessary.
Apple developed a screen that could process

210
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,580
multiple inputs at the same time, allowing
people to type by touching the screen with

211
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:14,009
their fingers. They hired a company to produce
incredibly tough glass that was resistant

212
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:19,190
to scratches. Combining these two elements
with a design that was thin and tightly sealed,

213
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:25,250
they produced the iPhone which was unveiled
in January 2007. Jobs dubbed the device as

214
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:31,390
three products in one: a widescreen iPod with
touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone

215
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:37,400
and a breakthrough Internet communications
device. By the end of 2010, 90 million iPhones

216
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,060
had been sold.
In 2008, Jobs’ cancer had spread further

217
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:46,029
and his health issues became more obvious
due to his severe weight loss and withered

218
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:51,549
look. He was receiving drug therapy for the
cancer but was very sick and in excruciating

219
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:58,849
pain. In January 2009 he went on medical leave
from Apple. In March, Jobs had a liver transplant

220
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:03,349
and was back at work again by the end of June.
The following year would become one of his

221
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:08,399
most productive at Apple, ever.
Apple used the same multi-touch screen technology

222
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,400
to build a tablet. The iPad was announced
in January 2010, but the initial reaction

223
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,870
was mixed. People had many complaints ranging
from the name to the lack of a camera or USB

224
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:25,589
port. This soon subsided when the iPad went
on sale in April. In under a month, they sold

225
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:30,559
one million, less than half the time it took
the iPhone to reach that target.

226
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,789
Jobs initially didn’t want outside developers
creating apps for the iPhone and iPad but

227
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:39,170
he later allowed outsiders to create apps
as long as they adhered to Apple’s standard

228
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:44,990
and were sold in an Apple App Store. The App
Store produced a new industry instantly. Three

229
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:49,549
years after the App Store was launched there
were 500,000 apps that had been downloaded

230
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:54,119
15 billion times.
Jobs had to fight battles with competitors

231
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:58,869
in this period of his reign at Apple. Google
had produced the Android operating system

232
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:04,339
for phones and Jobs felt that they had ripped
off many of Apple’s user designs. It didn’t

233
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:08,209
help that Eric Schmidt the Google CEO was
on the board at Apple when they developed

234
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:13,170
the iPhone and iPad. Apple sued Google for
infringement of its patents.

235
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:18,600
He also battled Adobe refusing to run Flash,
Adobe’s multimedia software for websites,

236
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:24,969
on the iPhone or iPad. He cited high battery
use, security holes and bugs as his justification.

237
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:30,980
In 2001 Jobs had a vision of the personal
computer being a digital hub, but he now knew

238
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:36,529
that the hub was going to move from the computer
into the cloud. A decade later, Apple created

239
00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:42,309
a new service called iCloud, which would be
free and allowed apps, photos, music, films,

240
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:48,559
documents and more to sync across all apple
devices, making them available anywhere.

241
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,759
Jobs began suffering another downturn in health
around November 2010, losing his appetite

242
00:20:53,759 --> 00:21:00,129
completely and experiencing an increase in
pain. At the start of 2011 doctors discovered

243
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:05,880
signs of new tumours and Jobs took another
medical leave of absence from Apple. Despite

244
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,040
constant monitoring and drug treatment, by
July the cancer had spread further and into

245
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:15,639
his bones. With his health deteriorating,
Jobs knew he wouldn’t return as CEO of Apple

246
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,100
and resigned.
Steve Jobs’ personality was reflected in

247
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:26,039
the products he produced at Apple. His intensity
and ability to focus helped create great,

248
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:31,039
innovative products that provided a simple
yet seamless experience for the user. He built

249
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,379
a start up from his parents’ garage into
the most valuable company in the world and

250
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,380
will be remembered as a visionary and a genius.
