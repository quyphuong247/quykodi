Most people start their presentation like
this, “Hi, my name is Malkhaz. I’m here

2
00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:15,859
with FightMediocrity. And today I’m going
to talk to you about the habit loop.”

3
00:00:16,089 --> 00:00:22,939
The problem is no one cares about me, or my
brand, or a concept or a product if I were

4
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,129
in business.

5
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:30,629
Here’s how I actually started my presentation
for the habit loop in my last video…

6
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:37,629
In the early 1900s, only 7 percent of Americans
had toothpaste in their homes. After Pepsodent

7
00:00:37,768 --> 00:00:43,079
put a few ingredients in its toothpaste which
had absolutely no effect on the cleanliness

8
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:50,079
of teeth, that number jumped up to 65 percent
in about a decade. What did Pepsodent do?

9
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:56,808
I started with a story. In fact, not only
do I start with a story, but I try to make

10
00:00:56,808 --> 00:01:02,669
my entire presentation a story with only a
few seconds of talking about the concept and

11
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,219
quickly coming back to the story again, because
here’s the key: a human doesn’t care about

12
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:14,709
a concept or a product unless that concept
or product does something for that human, and

13
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:18,849
the best way to convey what it does is through
a story.

14
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:23,038
I remember I started my first paper in college
with a story. When the teacher read it, she

15
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:28,929
gave me a bad grade. I talked to her about
it and she said I had it all wrong. You weren’t

16
00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:33,399
supposed to start with a story. You were supposed
to tell your audience how you were going to

17
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:37,960
bore them, then you were supposed to bore
them, and once you were done, you needed to

18
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:43,328
tell them how you bored them. So I did that
for the rest of my papers and I got mostly As.

19
00:01:43,328 --> 00:01:48,809
The difference is now I’m dealing with
real people, and real people tend to grade

20
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,528
you differently.
