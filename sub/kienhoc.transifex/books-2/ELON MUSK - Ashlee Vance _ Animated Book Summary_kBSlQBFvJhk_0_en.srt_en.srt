1
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,320
Elon Musk has long since entered the consciousness
of the general public. Back in early 2012

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,320
people started to take notice. One of his
companies had just built and delivered an

3
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,719
all-electric car. Another of his companies
had just flown a capsule to the International

4
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,439
Space Station and back. He was being lauded
as an entrepreneur on a par with the likes

5
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:41,009
of Steve Jobs. However, whilst Jobs had succeeded
in achieving similar feats in two different

6
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:46,210
industries at the same time, Musk has since
achieved it in three of them.

7
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:52,808
Musk jumped into the dot com mania after college
founding Zip2 in 1995. The company was like

8
00:00:52,808 --> 00:01:01,640
a basic version of Google Maps meets Yelp.
Compaq bought Zip2 in 1999 for $307million.

9
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,159
Musk made $22million from the deal and put
most of it into his next start-up, which would

10
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:13,868
eventually become PayPal. In 2002, eBay acquired
it for $1.5billion.

11
00:01:13,868 --> 00:01:20,079
Musk moved from Silicon Valley to Los Angeles.
He put in $100million into SpaceX, $70million

12
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:27,900
into Tesla Motors and $10million into SolarCity.
It was adopting ultra-risk-taking to the extreme.

13
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,960
When possible his companies all make things
from scratch, rethinking accepted convention.

14
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:38,179
SpaceX was battling the likes of Lockheed
Martin and Boeing in the USA as well as other

15
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:44,479
entire nations like China and Russia. It is
the low-cost supplier in the industry. They

16
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:49,429
are currently testing reusable rockets that
can take up cargo and then land back on Earth.

17
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:55,930
Once this is perfected it will become a world
leader in taking cargo, and humans, into space.

18
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:00,630
Tesla Motors is an automobile firm that strives
to make all-electric cars that push the limits

19
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:05,839
of technology. They are not sold through dealers,
but sold on the web and in galleries in shopping

20
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,620
centres. Cars are free to refuel from solar
powered supercharging stations alongside roads.

21
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,230
SolarCity is the largest installer and financier
of solar panels for business and consumers

22
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:23,078
in the United States of America.
His total net worth is over $12billion but

23
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:29,450
how has he done it? By thinking big and having
long term goals. This is epitomised by his

24
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:35,578
talk of putting mankind on Mars.
Born in South Africa on 28th June 1971, Elon

25
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:42,159
grew up in Pretoria with his younger brother
and sister. In 1984, aged 12 a PC magazine

26
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:46,168
published the source code of a video game
he had created which netted him $500.

27
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:52,060
As a young boy he had a compulsion to read.
At one point he ran out of books to read at

28
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:58,799
the library so he read the Encyclopaedia Britannica.
At 17 he travelled to Canada to avoid South

29
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:03,629
African military service as he didn’t want
to be part of the apartheid regime. He secured

30
00:03:03,628 --> 00:03:07,679
a Canadian passport through his mother and
left home for good.

31
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,909
After 2 years at University in Ontario he
transferred to the University of Pennsylvania.

32
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:17,789
Soon after university he founded Zip2 with
his brother. Originally called ‘Global Link

33
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:24,468
Information Network’, they rented a 20x30
foot office in Palo Alto which left them broke.

34
00:03:24,468 --> 00:03:30,329
They lived at the office, showering at the
YMCA. Early on Musk would sleep on a beanbag

35
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:34,689
next to his desk, asking the first employees
to kick him when they came in to wake him

36
00:03:34,688 --> 00:03:40,049
up so he could return to his work.
In early 1996, the company received $3million

37
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:45,139
in venture capital. They hired talented software
engineers who improved on the code originally

38
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:51,569
written by Musk who was self-taught. The venture
capitalists pushed Musk into the role of CTO

39
00:03:51,568 --> 00:03:55,698
and despite the company becoming successful
thanks in part to a new business model courting

40
00:03:55,699 --> 00:04:01,299
newspapers to use its service, Musk had lost
control. He vowed from that point on to stay

41
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:07,188
as CEO in any new ventures and as soon as
the offer from Compaq for $307million was

42
00:04:07,188 --> 00:04:11,998
accepted, he left Zip2.
Musk had become a dot-com millionaire at 27

43
00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:16,709
and his confidence meant he needed a new,
ambitious project. He purchased a McLaren

44
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:22,810
sports car (at the time only one of 62) and
organised races with billionaire Oracle co-founder,

45
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,399
Larry Ellison.
Musk invested $12million into X.com leaving

46
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:32,888
him $4million after taxes for personal use.
X.com was to become one of the world’s first

47
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:39,418
online banks and went live in November 1999.
X.com eventually merged with Confinity, created

48
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:44,788
by Max Levchin and Peter Thiel which had a
payment service called PayPal. Musk took charge

49
00:04:44,788 --> 00:04:49,009
but after an employee coup and a letter of
no confidence was sent to the board, Musk

50
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:53,830
was replaced by Thiel as CEO. Musk continued
to be the largest shareholder even when Thiel

51
00:04:53,829 --> 00:05:00,228
rebranded X.com to PayPal. PayPal had a revenue
of $240million per year and after the board

52
00:05:00,228 --> 00:05:06,459
accepted a $1.5billion offer for the company
from eBay, Musk walked away with $180million

53
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:11,049
after tax.
After PayPal, Elon and his now ex-wife Justine

54
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,680
moved to Los Angeles. Musk picked that location
to give him access to the space industry.

55
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,598
He wanted to do something meaningful and lasting
with his life.

56
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:24,829
His first plan was to send mice to Mars and
back. His second was to send a robotic greenhouse

57
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:29,810
to Mars and use it to grow a plant and produce
the first oxygen on the planet.

58
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:35,038
After failing to buy a rocket from the Russians,
Musk decided they could build a rocket themselves.

59
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:41,370
In June 2002 Space Exploration Technologies
or SpaceX was born. They purchased a test

60
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:48,598
site in Texas. In December 2003 SpaceX unveiled
a prototype of its first rocket, Falcon 1.

61
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:53,509
After several tests and failed attempts, Falcon
1 successfully launched from Kwaj in the Marshall

62
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:57,629
Islands.
On 1st July 2003 Tesla Motors was founded

63
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:02,280
by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. The
initial electric car they were building would

64
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:07,908
be powered by nearly 7,000 lithium ion batteries
and use the chassis of a Lotus Elise.

65
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:13,329
When searching for some venture capital funding,
Elon Musk invested $6.5million to become the

66
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:19,438
largest shareholder and chairman of Tesla
Motors. On 27th January 2005 a new car had

67
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,759
been built by only 18 people. Musk then invested
a further $9million.

68
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,860
Spiralling costs led to their first production
model, the Roadster to cost approximately

69
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:35,300
$200,000, even though they planned to sell
it for $85,000. This (among other reasons)

70
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:41,509
resulted in Eberhard being replaced as CEO
in August 2007. By the end of the year, Eberhard

71
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:46,580
had left the company completely. Eventually
Musk would become the CEO.

72
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:50,649
Despite serious financial concerns with his
companies, in particular with Tesla Motors,

73
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:57,418
which was hours away from bankruptcy, on 23rd
December 2008 NASA picked SpaceX to be a supplier

74
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:02,709
for the International Space Station. The deal
consisted of 12 flights to the ISS and the

75
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:09,089
company received £1.6billion as payment.
SpaceX now sends rockets up about once a month,

76
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:14,658
carrying satellites for companies and nations
and supplies for the ISS. Their latest advancement

77
00:07:14,658 --> 00:07:18,918
is to use rockets that return to Earth with
great accuracy, using reverse thrusters to

78
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:24,718
lower them slowly so they can be reused. This
it is hoped will cut SpaceX’s cost for a

79
00:07:24,718 --> 00:07:31,300
launch to 1/10th of its rivals. SpaceX’s
estimated worth is now $12billion. It is still

80
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:36,728
a fundamental goal of SpaceX to create the
technology to establish life on Mars.

81
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:40,300
In summer 2012, Tesla Motors began shipping
the Model S.

82
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:45,960
A couple of years earlier on 29th June 2010,
Tesla Motors became the first US car maker

83
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:51,508
to go public since Ford in 1956. There were
again financial issues though as not enough

84
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:56,960
cars were being sold. Musk was in talks with
Larry Page at Google and a handshake agreement

85
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,938
was made to sell Tesla to Google. However
the car sales improved, the value of Tesla

86
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:08,028
increased and the Google deal fell through.
Elon Musk’s cousins, the Rive brothers formed

87
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:13,610
the company SolarCity in 2006. It did not
manufacture solar panels, instead buying them

88
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,419
from other companies. Everything else was
done in-house from installing the panels to

89
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:23,060
building software to analyse whether solar
made sense for a particular property. Musk

90
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:28,769
became the chairman and its largest shareholder,
owning a third of the company. SolarCity has

91
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:34,319
become the largest installer of solar panels
in the USA. It went public in 2012 and is

92
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:41,229
now worth over $7billion. In June 2014 the
company purchased a solar cell maker called

93
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:45,990
Silevo for $200million and began producing
their own solar panels.

94
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:52,570
In August 2013 Musk announced the Hyperloop.
It will be a new method of transportation,

95
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:58,010
moving people and cars in pods through a raised
pneumatic tube. Each pod is thrust forward

96
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:02,669
by an electromagnetic pulse with motors in
the tube boosting the pods as needed to maintain

97
00:09:02,669 --> 00:09:09,199
a speed of 800mph. The whole thing will be
solar powered. Hyperloop Technologies Inc.

98
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,840
has been formed and Musk had a one-to-one
meeting with President Obama about the idea

99
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,750
in August 2014.
Elon Musk’s ambition shows no signs of slowing

100
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,149
down as he continues to run three billion
dollar companies whilst still continuing to

101
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:24,600
invent and invest.
