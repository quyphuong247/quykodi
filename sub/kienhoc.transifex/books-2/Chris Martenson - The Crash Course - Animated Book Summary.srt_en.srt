1
00:00:05,80 --> 00:00:10,629
It's time to face the facts a dangerous
convergence of unsustainable trends in

2
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:14,950
the economy energy and the environment
will make the 20 teens one of the most

3
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,830
challenging decades ever

4
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:22,419
that's how Chris Martenson starts his
book the crash course the main premise

5
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,000
of the crash course is pretty
straightforward

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,349
he put simply at the beginning of this
book massive change is upon us

7
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,930
what does he mean by massive change
basically that our material prosperity

8
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:40,000
is at its peak that from here on out we
have to be prepared for a future of less

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,320
and not more

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,780
he comes to this conclusion by focusing
on what he calls the 3 e's or the

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,449
economy energy and the environment

12
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:54,190
although we have major issues in all of
these areas for Martinson what makes

13
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,370
these problems in predicaments so
much worse is the fact that they

14
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,780
reinforce each other and that most
people won't even see these issues until

15
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,470
it's too late

16
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:08,360
let's dive in the Martin's argument by
finding out how we got to this point and

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,470
it all starts with energy whether you
know it or not

18
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,10
energy is the master resource as julian
simon says it

19
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,340
the reason is before you can have
anything else you need energy first and

20
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,960
in order to understand how we went from
small villages to having super computers

21
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,149
in the palms of our sweaty hands

22
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,110
you have to understand the role of
energy and why you need surplus energy

23
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,490
for a civilization to grow

24
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,179
this was a difficult topic for me to
grasp so let me tell you a story that

25
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,590
really clicked with me

26
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,189
imagine your farming family a very long
time ago

27
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:50,229
your farm produces enough food or
technically chemical energy to feed all

28
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,970
five of you and no more

29
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:56,500
but in order to produce that food it
also takes all five of you to do all the

30
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,360
work

31
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,430
Martinson would describe this as a zero
net energy surplus because although

32
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,160
you're producing enough food to feed all
five of you

33
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,520
it also takes all five of you to get
that energy

34
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,210
now let's skip forward a bit and imagine
that you get a horse

35
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,840
this horse enables you to do all the
work that previously took your whole

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,20
family to do the harnessing of animal
power has allowed you one person to

37
00:02:22,20 --> 00:02:25,20
produce enough chemical food energy for
five people

38
00:02:25,20 --> 00:02:30,390
which leaves you with a surplus of for
chemical energy the surplus means your

39
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,869
family members no longer have to work in
the fields but can pursue other

40
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:39,90
professions interests or education in
other words this surplus energy has

41
00:02:39,90 --> 00:02:42,120
enabled economic growth or prosperity

42
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,489
now let's skip forward to walk imagine
one day you get a tractor that runs on

43
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:50,489
oil this tractor has 100 horsepower

44
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,980
which allows you to do the work that
previously required 100 horses

45
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,970
this new power source allows you to
expand your farm so that you're

46
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,790
generating enough surplus food so that
499 people don't have to work the farm

47
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,579
and can choose other occupations instead

48
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,260
all because we harnessed oil

49
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,700
now obviously this is a very simplified
example but it gets the point across

50
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,879
because this is basically what has
happened for a very long time

51
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:25,359
essentially we have kept harnessing more
and superior supplies of energy from

52
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,379
pre-industrial human windwood and animal
power to industrial coal and oil fossil

53
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:36,700
fuels in particular makes so much
surplus energy that our world economy

54
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,849
has grown to previously unimaginable
Heights

55
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:45,69
now let's see how our modern economic
system fits into this energy picture

56
00:03:45,69 --> 00:03:49,569
when we think about the future and
especially our economic future

57
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,620
most of us assume that it will be bigger
and better than yesterday

58
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,50
and in fact the way our current monetary
system is designed it requires the

59
00:03:59,50 --> 00:04:03,700
future economy to be exponentially
bigger tomorrow and not required as in

60
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,380
will have to modify some laws if the
economy doesn't grow but rather required

61
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,980
as in the economic system might collapse
if it doesn't grow exponentially

62
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,900
just like you would collapse if you
suddenly couldn't breathe why this is

63
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:20,589
the case is a little too detailed to get
into now and Martin explains it in this

64
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:24,969
book but you can see this exponential
growth over the last century and things

65
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:30,460
like the US gdp the total stock of money
or m3 and total credit market debt

66
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:36,150
so how does an economic system that
requires exponential growth match up

67
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:42,270
with the energy picture we talked about
pretty damn perfectly actually in 1913

68
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,49
our current monetary system was
established which happened to be the

69
00:04:46,50 --> 00:04:49,229
same time we're discovering
exponentially more energy sources

70
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:53,159
natural resources and inventing better
technology to catch for them

71
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,510
so as our economy grew exponentially
larger we found the raw materials to

72
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,800
supply that growth and since everything
has worked out for the last hundred

73
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,300
years no one really sees a problem with
the system but we're starting to see the

74
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,900
warning signs appear signaling that
houston we have a problem

75
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,590
which brings us to our finally the
environment

76
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,979
Martinson breaks down the environment
into two categories

77
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,120
the first is the idea that Earth is a
source of natural capital

78
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:28,270
in other words its oil coal copper iron
etc are all here for us to use and are

79
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:33,700
the first raw materials in our economy
but after many years of extraction we're

80
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,390
running out of everything from our
energy sources like oil too many of the

81
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,180
raw materials we use as well

82
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,50
secondly think of Earth as a final
resting place for all the waste and

83
00:05:44,50 --> 00:05:49,210
pollution are ecological systems are
urgently flashing warning signs with our

84
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,508
ocean acidification at the fastest rate
in 300 million years

85
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:57,370
the six mass extinctions in Earth's
history happening right now and are

86
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,120
stable weather patterns that we rely
upon to grow our food becoming

87
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,190
increasingly chaotic

88
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,370
so now we come to our current
predicament

89
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:11,680
our economy needs to keep growing
exponentially or it will collapse a

90
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,600
bigger economy will need more energy and
more raw materials to make more energy

91
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,610
will need more coal and oil and for more
raw materials will need to mind more

92
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,610
natural resources like copper iron etc

93
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,90
but planet Earth only has a certain
amount of resources and it appears we've

94
00:06:30,90 --> 00:06:32,969
reached the peak production for many of
these

95
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,380
additionally our environmental
ecological systems are clearly showing

96
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,719
signs of stress

97
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,100
let's go back to my farming example and
imagine the situation in a new light

98
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,350
remember with that tractor you're able
to produce enough food to feed 499

99
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,340
people

100
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,750
well what happens if you're only able to
obtain fifty percent of the fuel you

101
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,680
need

102
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,890
well now our equation changes because
you can only feed 249 people then let's

103
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:07,440
imagine fuel availability drops by fifty
percent again now your farm killing feed

104
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,100
a hundred and twenty four people

105
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:15,20
again this is a very simplified analogy
but if you continue this process out we

106
00:07:15,20 --> 00:07:18,710
can see there was a peak to our
prosperity that relied upon cheap

107
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,950
plentiful energy

108
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:25,60
this lack of cheap plentiful energy
predicament is made worse by the fact

109
00:07:25,60 --> 00:07:29,200
that we have tons of other issues to
deal with like our demographics funding

110
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,30
social entitlement programs few
alternative energy substitutes available

111
00:07:34,30 --> 00:07:39,849
and likely global economic collapse from
our current monetary system in short

112
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,420
why massive changes

113
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,780
hey guys it's nick i really hope you

environment and this book tied
everything together in a way that helps

118
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,000
you see the bigger picture in a way that
not a lot of books I've read that it

119
