00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:14,539
1. Cognitive ease.
A couple of days ago I put out a video about

2
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:19,838
The Prince by Machiavelli, and every time
I make a video like that, I expect a particular

3
00:00:19,838 --> 00:00:25,368
type of comment and I’m usually never disappointed.
The comment goes more or less something like

4
00:00:25,368 --> 00:00:32,820
this, “This is stupid, I don’t like Machiavelli…”
Now… The topic of discussion might be something

5
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,250
very complex like, “Is it beneficial for
a prince to learn how not to be good,” which

6
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,390
is a really good and a relevant question,
but what do you have to do to answer that

7
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:48,219
question? You have to think a lot, you have
to analyze the behavior of the people in power

8
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:52,619
throughout history, and along with endless
other considerations you have to dedicate

9
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:58,789
a lot of time and mental energy to it. Now…
Why would our brains want to waste energy

10
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:03,939
like that? So what do we do instead? We ask
a simpler question… And the question is,

11
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:08,688
“Do I like Machiavelli or not?” And if
the answer to that is, “No, I don’t like

12
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:13,529
Machiavelli,” then we’ll take that answer
and turn it into, “Well, it turns out that

13
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,840
it’s not beneficial for a prince to learn
how not to be good.” But notice how the

14
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,859
two questions literally have nothing to do
with each other. Whether you like Machiavelli

15
00:01:23,858 --> 00:01:30,248
or not has absolutely nothing to do with the
original topic of discussion. And we tend

16
00:01:30,248 --> 00:01:35,048
to do this with all kinds of complex questions
we have to answer in life.

17
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:40,679
So the first big idea is to realize our tendency
to replace complex questions with easier,

18
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:47,879
irrelevant questions and thereby reduce our
ridiculous biases caused by cognitive ease.

19
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:55,298
2. Confirmation Bias.
A few days ago, I was talking to my friend

20
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:59,399
who’s really into coconut oil. And he started
to tell me how great it is, and how it’s

21
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,629
the best thing in the world, and I don’t
know much about coconut oil so I said, “That’s

22
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:08,348
pretty cool. Why is it so good?” And he
just had absolutely no idea. So I said, “Okay,

23
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:13,030
cool… Why don’t we just research it?”
So I get on my computer and type in something

24
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,169
like, “Is coconut oil good for you?” And
I’m not even done typing when he yells,

25
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:22,780
“Look! I found a study that says it’s
good for you.” So I thought, “Hmm… That

26
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,370
was pretty fast…” And I go over there
and I take a look at the article and it was

27
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,840
citing this study that literally had nothing
to do with whether coconut oil is good for

28
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,849
you or not. But I also clicked on his search
tab and guess what he had searched for? He

29
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:40,340
had searched for, “Why coconut oil is good
for you.”

30
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,580
And that is what we tend to do with everything
in our life. If you care about searching for

31
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,210
truth and don’t want to live in some fantasy
world, instead of typing in, “Why coconut

32
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:54,090
oil is good for you,” type in “Is coconut
oil good for you?”

33
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,030
If you’re Mormon and you care about searching
for truth, stop typing in, “Why Joseph Smith

34
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:04,039
is the best thing that happened to humanity.”
Instead, type in “I would like to learn

35
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:08,699
more about Joseph Smith.” And I guarantee
you those two will give you very different

36
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:14,339
results. So remember, if searching for truth
is what you care about, realize how susceptible

37
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,090
we are to confirmation bias and don’t answer
the question before you’ve even started

38
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,710
your research.

39
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:28,980
3. The endowment effect.
Now a lot of people watching this are probably

40
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:33,669
thinking, “Heh, stupid Mormons… Yeah,
let’s all make fun of how easily they’ll

41
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:38,579
fall for bullshit and how stupid they are,”
but chances are that you yourself might be

42
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,510
catholic, or whatever else but let’s just
pick the Catholics. For those of us who aren’t

43
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:48,829
catholic, your beliefs are just as childish
and ridiculous. For those of us who aren’t

44
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:54,270
catholic, the idea of giving our time and
money to some guy wearing a dress and a ridiculous

45
00:03:54,270 --> 00:04:00,150
hat because that somehow makes him important
is just as crazy.

46
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,090
So how can we look at something and think
that it’s so ridiculous, but not be able

47
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:10,069
to see it if it’s our own? It’s called
the endowment effect. We value things highly

48
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:14,349
just because they’re ours. If you have a
car that you’re trying to sell, you’ll

49
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:17,930
think that it should cost a lot more than
if you weren’t the owner and you were actually

50
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:23,030
trying to buy it yourself.
So the third big idea is to become aware of

51
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:29,259
our endowment bias. So ask yourself with everything
in life including religion, do you really

52
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:34,189
think your religion is the best because you
actually searched for truth without confirmation

53
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:40,069
bias or all the other biases and came to that
conclusion, or is it because it’s just your

54
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:45,569
religion? Do you really think that Nicaragua
is the best country in the world because it

55
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:50,939
really is, or could it possibly be due to
the fact that you just happened to be born

56
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:54,589
there?

57
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:59,669
So the 3 big ideas are…
1. Cognitive ease. We have to stop replacing

58
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:05,370
complex questions with easier ones that are
irrelevant if we want to be less biased.

59
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:11,899
2. Confirmation bias. We have to stop starting
out with an answer before we’ve even asked

60
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:16,060
the question.
3. And the endowment effect. We have to stop

61
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:22,040
thinking that something is great just because
it’s ours. Maybe Nicaragua really is the

62
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:27,040
best country in the world and you just happened
to be born there, or maybe it’s a little

63
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:40,050
more likely that you’re just biased because
of the endowment effect.
