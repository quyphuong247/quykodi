00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:14,029
Magician of the Movies: The Life of Walt Disney
by Bob Thomas

2
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:19,269
Walt Disney was born on the 5th December 1901
in Chicago but his first memories are of the

3
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:24,689
farm that his family lived on in Missouri,
as his family moved there when he was young.

4
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,550
Walter was the youngest of four sons and he
had a younger sister too.

5
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:35,210
From the age of six, Walt helped around the
farm, herding the pigs into their pen. He

6
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,590
also already had a passion for painting and
drawing. His Auntie not only thought he was

7
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,190
good at painting, she thought it was a good
way for him to express himself too, so she

8
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:51,670
bought him a pad and some pencils. Walt was
thrilled and began sketching as much as possible.

9
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:57,420
A local doctor saw his sketches and asked
Walt to sketch his stallion. The doctor was

10
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,630
so impressed with the sketch he paid Walt
five cents for it and hung it in his office.

11
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,530
A little while later, the same doctor was
called to the family farm where Walt’s father

12
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,920
had fallen ill. The doctor advised his father
that if he continued to work the large farm

13
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,209
on his own he could be headed for an early
grave. As a result, the decision was made

14
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:21,999
to auction off the farm and the family moved
to Kansas City.

15
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:27,629
With the money raised from the farm, Walt’s
father bought a newspaper dealership and Walt

16
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:32,708
and his brother Roy would wake up at 3.30
in the morning and deliver the papers before

17
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:37,719
school. After school, he had more papers to
deliver except on Sundays, when Walt could

18
00:01:37,718 --> 00:01:43,208
go to the matinee performance of the variety
entertainment show at the local theatre. In

19
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:47,200
between the performances in the show they
would play movies, including those of Charlie

20
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,999
Chaplin. Walt was fascinated by Chaplin and
would dress up and imitate his comic routine.

21
00:01:52,998 --> 00:01:57,638
His friends found it hilarious and at the
age of 14 he even entered a Charlie Chaplin

22
00:01:57,638 --> 00:02:04,108
contest at a nearby theatre, winning unanimously.
One evening, Walt’s father announced to

23
00:02:04,108 --> 00:02:07,839
the family that they would be moving back
to Chicago as he’d gone as far as he could

24
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,879
with his newspaper business. Walt’s eldest
three brothers had already left the household

25
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,240
and Walt stayed in Kansas City to finish his
schooling while his family moved.

26
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,890
Walt applied for a job that was known as a
“news butcher”, a boy that walks up and

27
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:27,389
down trains selling food, drinks, newspapers
and magazines. He did this for two months

28
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:32,069
and got to see most of the mid-west of the
United States. After that, he wanted to see

29
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:36,449
more.
When he was approaching 16 years of age, Walt

30
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:41,500
joined his family in Chicago and went to high
school. He also kept himself very busy by

31
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,050
pursuing his art studies and working full
time for the post office. He’d only got

32
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,860
the job by lying about his age and saying
he was 18, two years older than he was, but

33
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,940
soon he was given the responsibilities of
driving a truck for special deliveries and

34
00:02:54,939 --> 00:03:00,030
riding a horse for delivery pickups.
As America became involved in the First World

35
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:06,909
War, Walt joined the Red Cross (again altering
his age) and travelled to France as a driver.

36
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:12,189
By the time he arrived in Paris, the war was
over but much work remained for him, transporting

37
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:18,979
supplies, carrying wounded and escorting important
visitors. As the work eventually died down,

38
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:23,899
Walt passed the time sketching and painting.
He painted medals on people’s jackets and

39
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,650
insignia on truck canvas covers, earning himself
some money simultaneously. After over a year

40
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:35,010
in France he returned home and decided he
would be an artist.

41
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:39,329
Walt got a job in Kansas City creating drawings
for an advertising company that focused on

42
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:45,390
farms. He drew animals and other farm related
items. After Christmas, the rush died down

43
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:50,629
and he was let go along with a friend of his,
Ub Iwerks. They went into business together

44
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:54,990
doing art work for companies that didn’t
have their own art staff. Walt also took a

45
00:03:54,990 --> 00:04:00,830
job as a cartoonist for a film ad company
making commercials for movie theatres.

46
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:05,150
In this job he realised the current method
of animation used by cutting out and moving

47
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,740
drawings slightly for each frame was rather
basic, so he went to the library and read

48
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:15,340
as many books as he could on human movement
and film cartooning. He learnt a more sophisticated

49
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:20,379
method of film animation by drawing each frame
with a slight movement and went further still

50
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:25,348
by studying how cameras worked and built his
own.

51
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:30,399
Walt drew political cartoons and sold them
to movie theatres. He created a company and

52
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,989
worked on more and more ambitious projects.
Then disaster stuck when a distributor vanished

53
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,569
with money earnt from Walt’s work, leaving
him in a ton of debt. He put the company in

54
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:45,830
bankruptcy but he got in even deeper debt
to the point where he couldn’t afford to

55
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:51,038
eat. He finally raised some money charging
parents for movies of their new-born babies

56
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:57,180
and went to California, specifically Hollywood.
Walt went to several studios to try and get

57
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,788
a job as a director working with real actors
but was rejected each time due to a lack of

58
00:05:01,788 --> 00:05:08,558
experience so he returned to making cartoons.
A distributor wanted to buy his funny cartoon

59
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:14,129
combining a live action heroine with cartoon
figures called “Alice’s Wonderland”.

60
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:19,559
This time he went into business with his brother
Roy. In the Disney and Disney studio, Walt

61
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:24,659
drew the cartoons and Roy learnt to use the
camera and dealt with the finances. The Alice

62
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:29,558
comedies were a hit and soon they hired more
staff to help them, including his former partner

63
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:34,949
Ub Iwerks. Walt also hired a girl to help
colour in his drawings called Lillian Bounds,

64
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:40,809
she would soon be Mrs Walt Disney.
After a while Walt created a cartoon about

65
00:05:40,809 --> 00:05:46,099
a rabbit with long ears called Oswald. This
creation helped Walt become the leading maker

66
00:05:46,098 --> 00:05:50,968
of cartoons in the film industry but the contract
they signed meant that the distributor owned

67
00:05:50,968 --> 00:05:56,728
Oswald and to cut costs they got rid of Walt
and Roy and carried on making the cartoons.

68
00:05:56,728 --> 00:06:01,318
They were back to square one again.
The next character Walt created was a mouse

69
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:06,430
with human elements such as hands and shoes.
He called it Mortimer but his wife didn’t

70
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:11,740
like the name so it became Mickey Mouse. The
film industry was changing with the first

71
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,319
films released containing the sound of the
characters talking. Walt created the first

72
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,389
ever cartoon containing talking and signing
animals, even doing Mickey’s voice himself.

73
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:26,639
Mickey Mouse was first shown in individual
theatres and then Walt sold the cartoons to

74
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,400
a different distributor in each state. This
made Mickey a star, capturing everyone’s

75
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,138
hearts. Film companies were happy to work
and distribute on Walt’s terms and he finally

76
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:44,259
had become an independent producer. Mickey’s
popularity grew worldwide from France to Mexico

77
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:49,129
to Japan and Russia, with Mickey’s face
being plastered on products such as clothes,

78
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:54,229
watches and stationary.
Despite the success of Mickey Mouse, Walt

79
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:58,899
wasn’t happy with just making those cartoons
all his life. He came up with a new set of

80
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:03,679
cartoons called “Silly Symphonies”, which
utilised the new technology of sound within

81
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,490
film and rather than having one star character,
featured a different subject each time. It

82
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,778
allowed Walt to experiment and introduced
the audience to a whole array of new characters

83
00:07:13,778 --> 00:07:18,499
such as Donald Duck, Goofy and the Three Little
Pigs.

84
00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:23,770
The experimentation didn’t stop there. As
soon as colour was introduced into film, the

85
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:28,639
Disney studio signed an exclusive two year
deal with Technicolor to make cartoons in

86
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,079
colour. Their first colour Silly Symphony
called “Flowers and Trees” was a huge

87
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:39,118
success and won them an academy award. Walt
then received a second Oscar for the creation

88
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:48,430
of Mickey Mouse. By 1931, his studio employed
100 people and produced a cartoon every fortnight.

89
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:54,389
In 1933, Walt and Lillian had their first
child, a daughter called Diane, their second

90
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:59,369
daughter, Sharon, joined the family three
years later. He was in the prime of his life

91
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:04,279
and decided to take on his biggest challenge
to date – a feature length cartoon, Snow

92
00:08:04,278 --> 00:08:10,408
White and the Seven Dwarfs. The basic story
already existed but they needed to make the

93
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:15,399
characters interesting to get an audience
to sit through a cartoon for 80 minutes. They

94
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:20,408
gave each dwarf a name to match their characteristics
and also gave each one a distinctive style

95
00:08:20,408 --> 00:08:26,990
of movement, for example Happy skipped about
whilst Sleepy plodded around.

96
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:34,210
The film cost $1.7 million and premiered at
the end of 1937. The large cost and long development

97
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:40,450
time was justified as the film was a nationwide
success and earnt the studio millions. Walt

98
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,990
immediately commissioned three more feature
length cartoons.

99
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,240
The Second World War meant that Disney lost
their entire European market and the high

100
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:55,529
costs of feature films forced them to stop
making them. Nazi propaganda had created anti-American

101
00:08:55,529 --> 00:09:00,289
feeling in South America so Walt was asked
by the US government to travel there to try

102
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:06,319
and improve relations, as his films were popular
there. He established a studio in Brazil and

103
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,770
created a film called “Saludos Amigos”
which highlighted friendship and proved a

104
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:16,100
huge success in both North and South America.
Walt also produced propaganda cartoons for

105
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,170
the US government, including Donald Duck paying
his income tax in an attempt to get Americans

106
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:27,719
to do the same and fund the War, which they
did. Finally, Walt even produced a film called

107
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,879
“Victory Through Airpower” that Sir Winston
Churchill personally asked to watch.

108
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:38,929
After the war, Disney returned to feature
length cartoons. Cinderella was an instant

109
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:45,799
hit. Alice in Wonderland was a flop. Peter
Pan, another hit. Then instead of relying

110
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:52,389
on existing children’s stories, Disney produced
Lady and the Tramp. The public loved it.

111
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:57,659
Walt then turned to real-life adventures.
He hired nature photographers and film teams

112
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:02,100
to film animals in their wild habitat and
then created 30 minute nature films with their

113
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,019
footage of the animal’s lives moulded into
a story, accompanied by music and some comedy

114
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:11,659
elements.
Walt noticed he was beginning to get strained

115
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:16,889
and decided to have a rest from the studio.
He was moving to a new house with his family

116
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:21,509
and decided to build a railroad around the
house. He spent hours learning how to operate

117
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:26,100
steam engines and build railroad cars and
once it was built took guests on his miniature

118
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,389
train (only 1/8th the normal size) for the
half a mile journey.

119
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:37,240
From a young age, amusement parks always fascinated
Walt Disney. When he was older, he took his

120
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,149
daughters to the parks around Los Angeles
but was disappointed with them. He vowed to

121
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:48,709
one day build his own amusement park and when
he built his new studio, bought 50 acres rather

122
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:53,120
than the 20 he needed, with a view to building
his park next to it. The popularity of the

123
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:59,450
studio meant it expanded to use all the land,
but Walt never forgot his dream. When he travelled

124
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:04,300
the world, he made a point of travelling to
places of amusement such as fairs and zoos

125
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:08,519
and noted what people enjoyed and what they
didn’t.

126
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:13,500
Eventually, Walt began financing his new amusement
park with his own money. He planned to call

127
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:20,610
it Disneyland and it would have four kingdoms.
Adventureland containing wild animals, Frontierland

128
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:26,850
based on the Wild West, Fantasyland containing
a castle and Tomorrowland containing adventures

129
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:32,090
themed in the future. He agreed to make a
television series in exchange for the TV network

130
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:37,180
helping fund the park. The program would be
called Disneyland and promote the amusement

131
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:41,629
park at the same time.
The park was built in Anaheim on the outskirts

132
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:46,059
of Los Angeles and contained many features
Walt had worked on and perfected throughout

133
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:54,879
his life: cartoon characters, live animals,
music and a railroad. It opened in 1955. The

134
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:59,669
opening day was a disappointment for Walt.
It was supposed to only be open for people

135
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:04,479
specially invited but people had entered with
counterfeit tickets and the queues were far

136
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,840
more than they could handle. People got irate
queuing for rides and rubbish was strewn everywhere.

137
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,820
For the next two weeks, Walt stayed in the
park, researching what needed to be done and

138
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,320
improving it.
Firstly, he hired extra workers to clear all

139
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,190
the rubbish and keep the park clean. His reasoning
was that if the part is ultra clean, people

140
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:31,550
will respect it more and the cleaning will
be reduced in the long term. Secondly, he

141
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:36,609
hired his own ushers rather than outside workers.
They would feel more pride in their job and

142
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:41,950
the park and would treat the public as guests
in a friendly manner, rather than just customers.

143
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:46,930
The problems were fixed in a fortnight and
within seven weeks, over a million people

144
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:53,629
had visited the park, spending 30% more than
expected. Walt was not finished there. As

145
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:59,570
his imagination whirred, he came up with new
ideas and improvements. To finance these he

146
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,170
looked to television again and he created
The Mickey Mouse Club, a TV show shown five

147
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:09,819
times a week.
In 1965, Disneyland welcomed its fifty-millionth

148
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:15,230
visitor. People had visited from over 100
countries around the world and Walt’s imagination

149
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:21,779
and hard work had increased the number of
major attractions from 22 to 57.

150
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:28,399
After Disneyland, the Disney organisation
expanded immensely. Income grew to over $110

151
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,809
million. Disney films such as Mary Poppins
were shown across the world. Disney products

152
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:39,509
including books, toys and music flew off the
shelves. Walt didn’t change much; he still

153
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:44,399
preferred to relax in his family home rather
than enjoying the Hollywood social life. He

154
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,620
now had seven grandchildren to enjoy and spend
time with.

155
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:53,450
At the end of 1966, Walt went to hospital
for a check-up and it was discovered he had

156
00:13:53,450 --> 00:14:00,270
a lung condition. He needed an operation but
it was too late and he died on the 15th December,

157
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:05,689
aged 65. His brother Roy made sure all the
plans Walt had would be implemented in the

158
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:11,990
years to come, continuing the Disney success
for many future generations.

159
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:17,060
Walt Disney said that he thought young people
need a sense of direction. Having a goal to

160
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:22,879
aim for will give them a reason to be curious
and seek knowledge. He believed a person should

161
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,539
devote all his talent and energy into achieving
their goal so that no matter whether the goal

162
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:30,689
is achieved or not, they’ll know that they
have been alive.
