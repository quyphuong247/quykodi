1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:08,029
Here are the two basic concepts in acquiring
wealth. The first one is: for every 10 coins

2
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:15,279
that you earn, pay yourself one coin first
and then spend the rest of the nine coins.

3
00:00:16,489 --> 00:00:21,469
Don't spend the coins at the supermarket,
don't spend the coins at a restaurant, until

4
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:27,379
you have payed yourself that one coin first
and then you can spend the rest of the nine coins.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Now... I see two kinds of butt-hurt
behavior emerging from this. The first one

6
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:49,649
is going to be something like this: "Well,
did you really have to tell us that we need

7
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:59,399
to save in order to, um, acquire wealth?"
Yes. I have done technical analysis, fundamental

8
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:03,959
analysis, let's look at the PE ratio, let's
look at this, let's look at that for years

9
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,960
now. And as I was reading The Richest Man
in Babylon last night, this idea was one of

10
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:18,200
the biggest paradigm shifting ideas that I've
had in a long time in regards to acquiring

11
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:25,290
wealth. So for you to come to me with a clear
conscience and complain like that, this is

12
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:33,239
what you must have done. You must have for
years now religiously put away that one coin

13
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,680
out of ten every month, every month. You never
said, "Oh, I don't have enough funds this

14
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,950
month, so I can't do it this month." No, you
did it every month religiously and then after

15
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,079
years of doing that, you can come to me and
tell me, "Well, this is just basic stuff."

16
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,828
But here's the thing, if you indeed are that
person, you will be the least likely person

17
00:01:57,828 --> 00:02:04,699
to come to me with that complaint because
you have cultivated a huge appreciation for

18
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:13,000
that particular concept. Now... Here's the
second part of the butt-hurt situation. It's

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,599
going to be something like this, "Well, I,
I can't, I can't, I can't do it. I have to

20
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:26,199
pay for this, I have to pay for that. I can't
put away that one coin." Here's the thing...

21
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,200
If you make a salary of $3000 a month, and
your employer calls you in and he says, "You

22
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:39,179
know what, our business isn't doing so well
and so what we're going to do is pay you $2700

23
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,680
from now on." Don't tell me that you won't
be able to make ends meet. You won't be homeless,

24
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,420
trust me. In fact, it probably won't affect
you in any way. You won't even notice it.

25
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:59,419
So, again the first concept... For every ten
coins that you earn, pay yourself one coin

26
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:07,739
first, and then you can spend the nine coins.
The second concept... As you start doing the

27
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:14,870
first concept, you'll be accumulating money.
Now what you have to realize is this: money

28
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:23,248
is a commodity that generates profit just
like any other thing. If you had a house,

29
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:30,209
you wouldn't let it sit for thirty years and
let it rot and not rent it out. And rotting

30
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:36,729
is what's going to happen to your money when
it's in a bank account with inflation. But

31
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:42,098
with the house it comes to you easily, "Of
course, we need to rent it out." Well, the

32
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:50,179
same thing is true of the money. So let's
do a little bit of calculation... If you don't

33
00:03:50,348 --> 00:03:57,030
follow the first concept, what's going to
happen is after thirty years, you're going

34
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:02,348
to have zero dollars in your account. You
didn't put away that one coin, now you have

35
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:11,199
nothing. If you do follow the first concept,
here's what's going to happen... If you have

36
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:18,259
a salary of $3000 dollars, the one coin is
$300, so in thirty years, you're going to

37
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:26,879
have over $100,000 in your bank account. Now
here's what happens when you realize that

38
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:35,959
your money can generate you profit... And
the biggest problem in realizing this is the

39
00:04:36,158 --> 00:04:42,598
interest rate. You look at the 7% and you
think of $300... What's 7% of $300? Oh, not

40
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:47,889
even $30. And it's like, it's not even worth
it, but here's where the compounding effect

41
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:59,528
comes into play. So with 7% interest, you
would have over $300,000 instead of $100,000.

42
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:06,749
That's three times the amount. With 10% interest,
notice only three percentage point change,

43
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:16,798
you will have over $600,000. That's six times
as much. So again, two basic concepts... The

44
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:24,468
first one: for every ten coins that you earn,
pay yourself one coin first, then spend the

45
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:31,869
nine. That allows you to start accumulating
wealth. And once you're doing that, realize

46
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:37,838
that you don't just let it sit. It's like
the house, you rent it out. You do the same

47
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:44,110
thing with your money. And you also realize
that the percentages of interest rates that

48
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:51,449
seem minimal are actually huge in the long
term because of the compounding effect.
