1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,30
Capitalism is unstable.

2
00:00:12,30 --> 00:00:15,99
Government must help get people back to
work.

3
00:00:15,99 --> 00:00:20,60
The economy needs to be stimulated. Slogans are misleading.

4
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:25,10
"The fact is most periods of severe
unemployment were produced by the

5
00:00:25,10 --> 00:00:28,990
government's mismanagement rather than by any inherent instability of

6
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:33,769
capitalism. For example in the Great
Depression the Federal Reserve System

7
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,440
exercised responsibilities so ineptly as
the turn what otherwise would have been

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,440
a moderate contraction to a major
catastrophe."

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,519
That's how Milton Friedman starts his
chapter on monetary policy in his book

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,710
Capitalism and Freedom. Monetary policy
is about who controls the supply of

11
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,820
money or who actually prints the Dollar
bills, Euros, Yen or some other

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,900
currency. Or if the money supply is a
commodity like gold or silver. Most

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,830
people don't know or care what monetary
policy is, but they should because it has

14
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,830
a drastic effect on the economy and
their livelihoods.

15
00:01:12,90 --> 00:01:17,590
Friedman says the goal should be to have
a stable monetary policy; as stability

16
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:23,119
enables people to grow the economy. But
the question becomes how do you go about

17
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,549
achieving a stable monetary policy.

18
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:31,299
Well typically there is 1 of 2
answers. One is to use gold and silver as

19
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:36,479
money and the second answer is I have
some experts help direct the economy by

20
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,870
turning different knobs and dials.

21
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,940
Milton Friedman says both of these
answers suck and here's why.

22
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:48,579
The first option, a gold and silver
system, in theory works great.

23
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:53,740
The total amount of money is determined
by how much gold is mined and once its

24
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,690
refined into coins people can spend it.

25
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:01,320
The system is simple and straightforward
has the least amount of middleman and so

26
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,320
preserves the max amount of individual
freedom.

27
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:10,179
Historically though, it has never really worked
like this. Even when gold and silver are

28
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:15,730
used as money there's always some kind
of paper currency also. For example let's

29
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,780
say a society starts off with 100% gold
and sivler as money. Pretty soon

30
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,200
afterward someone whether it be a
private business or the government will

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,910
basically create a piece of paper that
says, "I know this is just a piece of

32
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:34,709
paper but it represents actual gold that
I have in a vault." Inevitably the government

33
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:39,40
gets involved to both prevent people
from fraud and others by creating pieces

34
00:02:39,40 --> 00:02:43,530
of paper from cold that doesn't actually
exist in a vault. And eventually so they

35
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,810
can have the irresistible power being
able to print money to themselves. Thus

36
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,489
in practice almost all gold standards
have become mixed with both paper

37
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:55,90
currency and actual metal.

38
00:02:55,90 --> 00:02:59,420
And while some people may look back to
when America was on a gold standard as the

39
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,549
good old days of monetary policy we have
to remember that to the Americans at the

40
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:09,379
time the system clearly didn't work. There were financial crisis he's in 1873,

41
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:17,899
1884, 1890, 1893. William Jennings Bryan
infamous cross of gold speech was given

42
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:24,910
in 1896. The panic of 1907 finally
crystallized this ill-feeling into action and

43
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:30,269
six years later the Federal Reserve would
be established. Milton Friedman's conclusion

44
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:35,560
is that an, "automatic commodity
standard or gold and silver standard is

45
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,959
neither feasible nor a desirable
solution." But if we thought a gold

46
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,739
standard had its issues just wait until
the experts get their hands on things.

47
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:51,760
The second option is an independent
central bank which also works great in

48
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,420
theory. Advocates will often say that due
to how unstable a capitalist economy is

49
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:03,390
we need to be able to adapt to
unforeseen circumstances. Therefore we

50
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,329
need a group of experts given various
powers to turn different knobs and dials

51
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:12,480
to keep the economy moving along
smoothly. While this sounds great in

52
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,230
theory in practice the results have been
pretty terrible. Before the Federal

53
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,260
Reserve the U S had panic's and resessions, but nothing like the severe

54
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,539
depressions after its establishment.

55
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,950
"Even when you give the Federal Reserve
the benefit of the doubt," says Milton

56
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:34,190
Friedman "on the basis of extensive study
of the historical evidence" they

57
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:39,100
undoubtedly screwed things up even more. Just to prove his point Milton Friedman

58
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,140
dives into how badly the Federal Reserve
just completely messed things up during

59
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,479
the Great Depression. Firstly he says
most people think the Great Depression

60
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:53,360
started with the stock market crash of
1929. And while the crash makes for a

61
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,370
great opening scene to a movie with
stockbrokers jumping out of windows

62
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:02,570
hanging or shooting themselves it's not
really when it started. Really it started

63
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:07,240
just a little prior to the crash and
while the crash certainly didn't help

64
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,000
things there is nothing that signaled
that this crash will be the beginning of

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,969
a major depression.

66
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:17,39
The proverbial crap only started to hit
the fan once the bank failures started.

67
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:23,350
Due to the nature of how banks are
interconnected when one bank failed it

68
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,889
made it more likely that other banks
would fail.

69
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:30,770
Which in turn made it more likely that
other banks would fail. This domino effect

70
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:34,299
started the economy going downhill and
people started to panic.

71
00:05:35,39 --> 00:05:40,330
Back then if your bank failed you lost
all the money you had in the bank. This

72
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:45,20
panic caused people to withdraw their
money which caused more banks to fail

73
00:05:45,20 --> 00:05:51,758
which intensified the downturn. This was
the moment the moment the Federal

74
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:58,779
Reserve was meant for built for designed
for and they dropped the ball. In

75
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:02,550
December of 1930 when they
should have done something they did

76
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:08,270
nothing. In the middle of 1931 when more
bank failures began the Federal Reserve

77
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,849
decided to still do nothing.

78
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:15,349
Later in 1931 the Federal Reserve
decided to do something they promptly

79
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:20,310
responded to requests of people wanting
their gold, which only intensified the

80
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:26,110
downturn. Finally in 1932 the Federal
Reserve bought some government bonds which

81
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,870
kinda helped, a bit.

82
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:33,610
The collapse resumed shortly thereafter
finally culminating in FDR's banking

83
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,550
holiday of 1933.

84
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,230
But all this didn't stop the Federal
Reserve Board members from high-fiving

85
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:45,160
each other and writing in their annual
report of 1933 what a great job they did

86
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,930
helping to avert something really bad.

87
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,120
Cue the Great Depression.

88
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,930
Now current proponents of the Federal
Reserve will usually respond with

89
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,850
something to the effect of, "Yes yes we
know the Fed failed during the Great

90
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:03,320
Depression, but we got real experts in
charge now. They got all these equations

91
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,760
and stuff. They know what they're doing." To that Milton Friedman has one more

92
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,60
thing to say, "The Great Depression is a
testament to how much harm can be done

93
00:07:14,60 --> 00:07:18,790
by mistakes on the part of a few men
when they wield such fast powers over

94
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:24,250
monetary system. Any system which gives so much power to a few men whose

95
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:30,220
mistakes, excusable or not, can have such far-reaching effects is a bad system.

96
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:37,179
So if neither a gold standard or central
bank works then what's Milton Friedman's

97
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,260
end game here. What is his solution.

98
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,780
Well good old Milton proposes a simple one. Essentially we need to go back to one of

99
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,859
our founding ideals of being a nation of
laws and not men. Rather than have some

100
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,810
group of experts be in charge of stuff. Simply create a rule that makes the

101
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:59,180
stock of money increase every year by
certain percentage. Creating a rule would

102
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:04,230
drastically reduce the amount of power
any experts have in the economy and would

103
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:09,470
preserve the maximum amount of freedom for the individual. That is the solution

104
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,569
according to Milton Friedman.

105
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:18,119
Thanks for watching this video. If you
haven't read Capitalism & Freedom I really

106
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:22,89
recommend it. In it Milton Friedman
covers this topic

107
00:08:22,89 --> 00:08:25,999
much more detail than I ever could have
hoped to do in this video, but also

108
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:31,889
topics including poverty, discrimination,
social welfare and a lot more and how

109
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:36,779
they relate to Capitalism and Freedom (obviously the title of the book). So if

110
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:40,698
you like this summary you can purchase
the book from Amazon. If you use the

111
00:08:40,698 --> 00:08:44,479
Amazon link on my website I get a little
kick back which helps me make more videos

112
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,670
like this one. Simply go to TheNickWright.com . If you want to be emailed
