1
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:09,638
Most people wake up and have a constant stream
of negative thoughts until they go to bed.

2
00:00:09,638 --> 00:00:15,468
And the majority of those thoughts will never
actually happen. And the things that will,

3
00:00:15,468 --> 00:00:21,469
don't even really matter or are simply going
to be challenges that they're going to overcome.

4
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:26,199
It's funny that most people might not even
realize this. It has become the norm. Unless

5
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:32,320
you've tried to become aware of your thinking
or tried meditating, you might not even realize

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,280
what your mind is doing to you. Now the mind
is probably one of the most powerful tools

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,689
that we have, but the more powerful something
is, the more dangerous it is if a person doesn't

8
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:48,339
know how to be in control of it. It's literally
like taking a chainsaw and giving to the guy

9
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:54,829
who has no control over his limbs. So why
is that you want to become aware of this or

10
00:00:54,829 --> 00:01:00,789
as Eckhart Tolle says, "watch the thinker?"
Because it's killing you. The more we study

11
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:05,259
this, the more we realize that it's physically
killing us. If you go outside and look at

12
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:11,790
people, you will see cortisol producing machines.
That's literally what everyone has become.

13
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,219
And it'a apparent in how they walk and how
they interact with each other. It is literally

14
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:22,530
killing you. Not only is it ruining your life,
it's literally physically killing you. So

15
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,810
a lot of people have come to understand this,
and most people have started to see the value

16
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,659
in becoming present. But really, there are
two obstacles to becoming present. And it

17
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:37,880
is the past and the future. And people have
an easier time reconciling the past with the

18
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:42,589
present, even though I'll still get questions
like, "Oh, so uh, what are your biggest regrets

19
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:47,469
in life?" And I'm like, "Uh, I don't know."
They're like, "Come on! You gotta have some."

20
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:51,688
But I really don't know, because I don't think
about that. It just doesn't make sense to

21
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:56,849
take something that isn't and let it negatively
affect something that is. And I think most

22
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:01,390
people understand that, maybe not in practice
but at least in theory they understand that.

23
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,799
But the really big problem has come with the
future and the present moment. How do you

24
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,920
reconcile those two? I want to set those powerful
goals, I want to have a powerful vision, but

25
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,179
how do you reconcile that with being present
to the moment? And there are really two kinds

26
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:22,150
of people. The first one is the classic rat
racer. In two years, he's going to get a $2

27
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:27,870
raise, and that's all he's anxious and stressed
out about for the next 2 years. After he gets

28
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,810
that $2 raise, he'll be quasi-happy for 2
minutes, and he'll be back to another 2 years

29
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:39,030
of stress and anxiety for another $2 raise.
And that's most people. And then some of those

30
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:45,060
people will pick up the Bhagavad Gita or Eckhart
Tolle's The Power of Now and completely misunderstand

31
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:51,020
it and say, "Well, no more goals! That's just
ego gratification! From now on I'm staying

32
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:56,310
fully present to the moment!" And honestly,
anything's probably better than being a rat

33
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,699
racer, but ultimately you don't want to get
stuck in either one of those paradigms. So

34
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:05,619
let's look at an analogy from Tal Ben-Shahar
that should allow us to never ever have a

35
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,830
problem understanding how you can have a vision
and goals and stay present to the moment at

36
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:15,379
the same time. Tal Ben-Shahar says, imagine
you're a mountain climber. Okay, we all get

37
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:21,429
it. Happiness isn't in the peak. If a helicopter
picked you up and dropped you off at the tip

38
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,360
of the mountain, you wouldn't say, "Oh, look!
I'm a happy mountain climber! Look at how

39
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:33,360
proud I am of myself!" But he says, neither
is it in aimlessly wandering at the base of

40
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:41,348
the mountain. Happiness is the experience
of climbing towards the peak. And that's literally

41
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,849
how you want to look at it. You set up that
powerful vision, that worthy goal of yourself

42
00:03:45,848 --> 00:03:51,348
which is the peak, and then you follow that
path that leads you there while you stay present

43
00:03:51,348 --> 00:03:55,348
to the moment on the journey. And again there's
going to be some guy that says, "Well, you're

44
00:03:55,348 --> 00:04:00,408
taking out all the spirituality from Eckhart
Tolle," or whatever. But look, you're obviously

45
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:05,739
misunderstanding it. Eckhart Tolle does not
say don't plan. If that was the case, the

46
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:11,939
guy would still be sitting on a park bench
instead of going on Operah and producing multiple

47
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,419
best-selling books.
