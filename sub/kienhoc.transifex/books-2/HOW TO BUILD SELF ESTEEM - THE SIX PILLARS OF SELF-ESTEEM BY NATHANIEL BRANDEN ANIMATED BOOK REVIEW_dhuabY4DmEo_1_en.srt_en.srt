1
00:00:03,049 --> 00:00:08,019
I want you to imagine two people.
The first man wakes up and does his usual

2
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:13,609
routine before work, and it’s all a blur.
He goes to work and when he comes home, he

3
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:18,858
isn’t even really conscious of what he did.
He starts eating the junk food he bought on

4
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:24,659
his way home and watches TV while his wife
tries to talk to him.

5
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:30,460
Now imagine another man. He wakes up and tells
his wife how thankful he is for their life.

6
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:35,820
He drives over to his business and is passionately
working to build it into something great.

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,030
He comes home, and he and his wife have dinner
together while they stay present to the moment

8
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:44,070
with each other.
Out of these two people, which one do you

9
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:50,878
think is going to have higher self-esteem?
The first pillar is the practice of living

10
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:52,729
consciously.

11
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:59,729
Lately, my hair has been thinning. What I
haven’t done is this: “Uh, how come John’s

12
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:06,709
hair isn’t thinning? How come John has better
genetics? Oh and did I mention that John is

13
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:12,819
also 6 foot 4?” Okay, the reason I haven’t
done that is because, that’s a game you

14
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:18,979
can’t win. I promise you. I don’t care
who you are, even John can’t win that game.

15
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:23,270
What I have done is what anyone who’s practiced
building self-esteem in their life would do,

16
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:30,269
and it is this: improve what you can change,
and learn to accept what you can’t. Improve

17
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,680
what you can change, and learn to accept what
you can’t.

18
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,910
Now let me address a common issue. There are
people who think that self-acceptance somehow

19
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:46,819
goes against self-improvement. It doesn’t.
In fact, self-improvement can only follow

20
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:51,529
self-acceptance. If I didn’t accept that
my hair was thinning, I wouldn’t start researching

21
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,650
what the right haircut needs to look like
for me, and I would end up looking like Bobby

22
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:02,420
Charlton.
The second pillar is the practice of self-acceptance.

23
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:07,500
I know a lot of people who are so physically
unfit that it jeopardizes the most important

24
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,560
things in their life like their health and
their relationships. And when they get confronted

25
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,560
about it, a lot of these people have learned
a little trick that has been really trending

26
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,460
lately. Apparently, everyone I know who is
unhealthy is unhealthy because of a medical

27
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,960
condition. Now, let me just be clear that
I’m not saying that these conditions don’t

28
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:33,620
exist. I’m just saying that 19 out of 20
of these people don’t have it. If you do

29
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,750
not exercise, if you do not eat healthy, you
probably shouldn’t be going around telling

30
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:43,939
people how you’re overweight and unhealthy
because of a medical condition. Yeah, they

31
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:48,229
might treat you like you’re the victim,
but guess what? The only reason they sympathize

32
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:53,169
with you is because the last thing they care
about is whether you’re taking care of yourself

33
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:59,269
or not.
The third pillar is the practice of self-responsibility.

34
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:04,350
I don’t know of a single person who doesn’t
take responsibility, loves playing the victim

35
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:08,120
and also has high self-esteem.

36
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,870
If I had a kid and I could only teach him
one thing before he went to college, it would

37
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:18,580
be how to stay authentic to his true self
under pressure. Other than special occasions

38
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:23,020
with my girlfriend where I’ll have some
champagne, I don’t drink. I haven’t found

39
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:27,360
that to be something of value to my life.
When I was in college, I would go out with

40
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,330
my friends and there was always that thing
of, “Come on! Let’s get drunk.” And

41
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:36,340
I was bad at a lot of things, but the one
thing I was really good at was being really

42
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,990
grounded in what I believed in. In fact, in
almost every case it turned into guys having

43
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:48,090
respect for it and girls being attracted to
it. Now again, I didn’t say I sort of believed

44
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:55,090
in it. It was fully standing for what I believed
in, 100% unapologetic, and if that was a problem,

45
00:03:55,348 --> 00:04:01,530
everyone always knew I could just leave and
go have fun somewhere else. I wasn’t half-assing

46
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,780
anything.
The fourth pillar is the practice of self-assertiveness.

47
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,590
Now let me make it clear that asserting yourself
doesn’t mean lacking social awareness or

48
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,069
being pushy. I didn’t go to a party where
I knew people would be drinking and start

49
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:20,528
converting and preaching. Don’t be stupid
with this, it depends on the context. I’m

50
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:24,749
going to act a little differently if I’m
in a classroom environment than if I’m around

51
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:31,749
friends, but I’m not going to go against
my authentic self in either situation.

52
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:36,218
If you meet an entrepreneur who is passionate
about his business, and if you also meet a

53
00:04:36,218 --> 00:04:42,399
person who is indifferent towards his regular
job, the entrepreneur will almost always have

54
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:49,198
higher self-esteem. Why is that? Because the
entrepreneur is the modern day warrior. Just

55
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,379
like the warrior has a strong sense of purpose
and lives to conquer, so does the entrepreneur.

56
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:59,718
He has higher self-esteem because he lives
with a purpose.

57
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:06,168
The fifth pillar is the practice of living
purposefully.

58
00:05:06,168 --> 00:05:13,168
And finally, the sixth pillar – the practice
of personal integrity. Notice how I said personal

59
00:05:13,408 --> 00:05:18,259
integrity, not someone else’s integrity.
I went to a military academy and there were

60
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:22,319
thousands of rules I had to follow, and I
broke most of them and it didn’t bother

61
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,278
me at all or affect my self-esteem in any
way, because those weren’t the things that

62
00:05:27,278 --> 00:05:33,278
went against what I believed in. But, if I
act against what I believe in, my inner voice

63
00:05:33,278 --> 00:05:38,879
will tell me how I’m worthless over and
over again. And only I will know, but when

64
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:44,468
it comes to self-esteem, my inner voice is
the one that matters the most. You can’t

65
00:05:44,468 --> 00:05:48,899
have the voice in your head telling you how
worthless you are and build self-esteem at

66
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:51,098
the same time.

67
00:05:51,098 --> 00:05:57,168
And these are the six pillars of self-esteem
by Nathaniel Branden. Notice how each pillar

68
00:05:57,168 --> 00:06:04,168
starts with “the practice of.” Self-esteem
is not something you build by reading a book

69
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:10,169
or watching a video; it is something you build
by constant practice for the rest of your

70
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:10,418
life.
