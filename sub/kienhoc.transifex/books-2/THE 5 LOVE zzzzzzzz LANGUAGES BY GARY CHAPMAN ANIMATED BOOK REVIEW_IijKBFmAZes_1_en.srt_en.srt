1
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:14,949
So I knew this guy who thought
he did everything he could for his wife,

2
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:19,289
but the wife was just completely unhappy.
And he couldn't understand why.

3
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,679
He would say,
"But look! I'm doing all these things for

4
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:25,129
her..."
But here was the reality...

5
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:29,729
He never told her how much he loved her,
he never told her how beautiful she was.

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,619
In his mind it was like,
"Why is all that fluff necessary?

7
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:37,539
I make sure to support the family,
and take out the trash,

8
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:40,909
and fix things...
I'm showing her real love,

9
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:43,788
why are those extra words necessary?"

10
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:47,059
Alright,
so that is the equivalent of

11
00:00:47,058 --> 00:00:51,539
someone who speaks English going to China
and speaking with people who don't understand

12
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,010
English,
and being confused about why it's not working...

13
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:58,108
"Why don't they understand me?!
I'm speaking English,

14
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,719
it's the best language in the world,
how can they not understand me?"

15
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,390
So the whole idea here is that
people speak different love languages.

16
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,170
In this example,
the man's love language was acts of service.

17
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,329
And his wife's love language was words of
affirmation.

18
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:19,890
And he spoke the language of acts of service
and expected his wife to feel loved,

19
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,109
which is again kind of like speaking to a
Chinese person

20
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:26,959
who doesn't speak English
and being surprised and angry that he doesn't

21
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,929
understand you.

22
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,940
So the five love languages are:
Words of Affirmation

23
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:34,670
Quality Time
Receiving Gifts

24
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,640
Acts of Service
and

25
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,359
Physical Touch.

26
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:41,679
And one of the things that has made
my relationship with my girlfriend so enjoyable

27
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,350
for over two years now
is that we have the same primary love language,

28
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:50,890
and it's quality time
which is closely followed by physical touch.

29
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,909
The most enjoyable thing for us
is when we cook an amazing dinner

30
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,500
and then sit down and just spend time with
each other.

31
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,920
Or when we go on a date and just spend time
together.

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,420
And it's the same thing with physical touch.
We can sit around for literally hours

33
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,560
just holding and touching each other
and it doesn't have to be anything sexual.

34
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,949
So that works out really well but for her,
words of affirmation are really important

35
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:16,060
as well.
For me, I don't really care so much about

36
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,949
it.
I don't have to be told how pretty I am every

37
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:20,128
day,
I'm fine without that.

38
00:02:20,128 --> 00:02:23,090
But at the same time,
I don't make the mistake of thinking,

39
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:28,209
"Well, I don't need it so it's not important."
No, I tell her how beautiful she is,

40
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:31,759
because why wouldn't I?
Even though that's something that I personally

41
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,858
don't need
I find it really enjoyable to do it for her.

42
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:38,319
Now here's a little difference between the
book and this...

43
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:43,048
The whole idea in the book is to figure out
what your partner's need is and then meet

44
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:46,030
that need.
So let's say you've been married for 30 years,

45
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,479
and you hate each other,
that can be a great way to make the relationship

46
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,638
better.
But the ideal situation for me

47
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:56,790
is to start with a person
who has about the same disposition as you.

48
00:02:56,789 --> 00:02:59,979
So going back to my girlfriend,
we have almost an identical disposition

49
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:03,179
except for words of affirmation.
But that's fine...

50
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,498
That's a language that even though isn't natural
to me,

51
00:03:05,498 --> 00:03:08,449
I like it, I want to speak it.
It's kind of like French,

52
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:11,598
it might not be my natural language,
but I like it.

53
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:16,378
But... And there's a huge BUT here...
Let's say her primary love language was acts

54
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:18,509
of service.
What that means is that

55
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:21,699
she's not going to feel loved when we cook
an amazing dinner,

56
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:25,060
and sit down, and look at each other, and
appreciate each other.

57
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,310
She's going to feel loved
when I take out the trash.

58
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,459
Now the advice is,
well, figure out that that's what she needs

59
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:33,400
and then do it,
and you know what,

60
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,419
I could do that in the short run.
But in the long run,

61
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:40,489
that's going to lead to resentment.
I just hate the whole idea of even thinking

62
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:43,560
about it.
So I guess if you've been married for 30 years,

63
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,468
and everything sucks,
then yes,

64
00:03:45,468 --> 00:03:49,120
taking out the trash and meeting her need
can make your relationship way better than

65
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,680
it is.
But my advice for a truly amazing relationship

66
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,748
would be to
to pick a partner with roughly the same disposition.

67
00:03:56,748 --> 00:03:59,009
It's kind of like,
if you hate German.

68
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:02,149
You just hate the way it sounds,
you never want to hear it in your life,

69
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,400
and then you start a relationship with a German
girl.

70
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,859
And you get the advice,
"Well, just meet her need

71
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:09,909
and speak German with her."
And yes,

72
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:14,188
it will be better than talking with her
in a language that she doesn't understand,

73
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:18,168
but it would also be way better
to start with a French girl because you love

74
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:19,399
French.

75
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,819
So those are the five love languages:
Words of Affirmation

76
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:24,649
Quality Time
Receiving Gifts

77
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:26,319
Acts of Service
and

78
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,728
Physical Touch.

79
00:04:27,728 --> 00:04:31,810
And my advice would be,
figure out what your love language is...

80
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,680
Try to find a partner who has a similar disposition.
Realize that there will be slight differences,

81
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,620
like words of affirmation in my situation,
and adjust to that if that's going to be something

82
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,550
that you know you will enjoy.
But otherwise,

83
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,770
if it's something that you know you don't
like,

84
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:50,709
don't just be like, "Well, I'll just accomodate
that."

85
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:53,529
I guess if you're in a relationship
which you're not going to get out of

86
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:57,168
for different reasons like marriage,
then that can be the best thing that you can

87
00:04:57,168 --> 00:04:58,029
do,
but otherwise,

88
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:02,089
make sure you're going to enjoy meeting your
partner's needs.

89
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:06,219
You don't want to be the guy
who only enjoys physical touch during sex

90
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,620
stuck with a girl who wants to snuggle on
the couch

91
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,610
for three hours, and trying to accommodate
that.

92
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,550
And you don't want to be the girl
who enjoys going on amazing dates and spending

93
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,430
quality time
stuck with a guy who doesn't feel loved by

94
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,030
that
and instead feels loved when you wash his

95
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:47,689
dishes.
