1
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,039
THIS IS A BOOK THAT I FIRST READ
IN MY MILITARY STRATEGIC STUDIES CLASS

2
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:19,710
AT THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE ACADEMY.
AND IT'S KIND OF CRAZY THAT A BOOK WRITTEN

3
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,679
OVER 2,500 YEARS AGO
IS REALLY THE FIRST AND THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL

4
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:28,079
BOOK STUDIED
BY THE WORLD'S GREATEST AIR FORCE TO THIS

5
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,909
DAY.
AND YOU MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE FIGHTING

6
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,829
WARS,
BUT BUSINESS IS BASICALLY THE MODERN DAY WARFARE,

7
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:37,600
SO IF YOU OWN ONE OR WORK FOR ONE,
WHICH SHOULD BASICALLY BE EVERYONE,

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,870
THEN THIS BOOK IS JUST AS USEFUL FOR YOU
AS FOR A MILITARY STRATEGIST.

9
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:51,439
KNOW YOUR ENEMY AND KNOW YOURSELF
AND IN 100 BATTLES YOU WILL NEVER BE IN PERIL.

10
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:55,009
A LOT OF PEOPLE GO TO JOB INTERVIEWS,
DON'T GET PICKED,

11
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:59,179
AND DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS EXACTLY
WHY.

12
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:02,530
THEY WALK IN THERE HAVING NO IDEA
ABOUT WHO THEY'RE DEALING WITH.

13
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:07,500
IF YOU'RE WALKING INTO A JOB INTERVIEW,
YOU NEED TO HAVE SPENT THE PAST FEW WEEKS

14
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,219
LEARNING EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW
ABOUT THE COMPANY AND THE INDUSTRY IT'S IN.

15
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:15,519
DO YOU KNOW HOW IMPRESSIVE IT IS IF YOU WALK
IN THERE

16
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,759
AND SAY SOMETHING LIKE,
"WE'RE IN A BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY.

17
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:22,379
I KNOW WE'RE CURRENTLY HOLDING 20% OF THE
MARKET SHARE,

18
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:26,659
AND THE CEO HAS ANNOUNCED TWO WEEKS AGO
THAT WE'LL BE TRYING TO HIT 30% BY THE END

19
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:29,549
OF NEXT YEAR.
AND HERE IS HOW HIRING ME

20
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,659
IS GOING TO HELP THIS COMPANY ACHIEVE THAT."
DO YOU KNOW HOW IMPRESSIVE THAT WOULD BE?

21
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:37,450
MOST PEOPLE'S ANSWER TO THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING
LIKE,

22
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:42,659
"UH... WE TRY TO SELL SHOES HERE.
I DON'T REALLY KNOW..."

23
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,629
NOW THAT'S CRAZY...
BUT NOT ONLY DO PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT

24
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:50,689
WHO THEY'RE DEALING WITH,
THEY HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT THEMSELVES.

25
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:54,390
MOST PEOPLE IF ASKED,
"HEY, WHY SHOULD WE PICK YOU,"

26
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,739
HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO ANSWER IT.
IT'S LIKE,

27
00:01:56,739 --> 00:02:02,439
"UH, I GUESS I'LL WORK REALLY HARD..."
NO, THAT WAS THE ANSWER THAT

28
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:07,890
THE 20 OTHER PEOPLE BEFORE YOU GAVE.
WHY ARE YOU BETTER THAN ALL THE OTHER ONES?

29
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,419
OBJECTIVELY, WHAT ARE YOU CAPABLE OF
THAT MAKES YOU BETTER THAN ALL THE OTHER ONES?

30
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:20,329
KNOW YOUR ENEMY AND KNOW YOURSELF
AND IN 100 BATTLES YOU WILL NEVER BE IN PERIL.

31
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,500
AVOID WHAT IS STRONG. ATTACK WHAT IS WEAK.

32
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,229
SO WHEN JEN GETS A JOB AT A COMPANY,
SHE GOES IN AND SEES HOW EVERYONE'S

33
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:31,649
REALLY GOOD AT ANSWERING THE PHONE.
AND SHE SAYS,

34
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,569
"I'M GOING TO WORK HARD AND BE BETTER THAN
EVERYONE

35
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:36,340
WHEN IT COMES TO ANSWERING THE PHONE."

36
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,229
AND JEN'S NEVER GOING TO BE VALUED IN THAT
COMPANY.

37
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:43,859
THERE ARE ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE
WHO ARE REALLY GOOD AT ANSWERING THE PHONE.

38
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,140
YOU DON'T WANT TO COMPETE THERE.

39
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:48,309
YOU WANT TO BE THE JEN WHO EVERYONE GOES UP
TO

40
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,750
WITH INSURANCE QUESTIONS
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON IN THERE

41
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,090
WHO KNOWS EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT
INSURANCE.

42
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,710
SAME THING IN BUSINESS.
NO WONDER BUSINESSES HAVE SUCH A HUGE RATE

43
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,670
OF FAILURE
WHEN PEOPLE WALK INTO A BUSINESS TRYING TO

44
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:04,759
COMPETE
WITH WALMART ON PRICE.

45
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:09,969
WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING WHAT IS STRONG?
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BEAT WALMART ON PRICE.

46
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:14,250
BUT WHAT ARE THE WEAKNESSES?
WHAT DO PEOPLE DEMONIZE WALMART FOR?

47
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,090
THE CUP WAS MADE WITH THE TEARS OF CHINESE
CHILDREN.

48
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,240
THE CUP HAS NOTHING AUTHENTIC ABOUT IT.

49
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,260
SO ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU SAY,
LOOK AT MY CUP.

50
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:26,699
IT'S MADE BY TREATING PEOPLE REALLY WELL,
IT'S AUTHENTIC BECAUSE OF THIS AND THAT...

51
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:30,579
NOW THAT'S STILL A REALLY HARD MARKET,
SO GOOD LUCK WITH COMPETING IN THERE,

52
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,390
BUT AT LEAST YOU HAVE SOME CHANCE OF SOME
LITTLE MARKET SHARE NOW,

53
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:39,000
BECAUSE YOU LITERALLY HAD ZERO CHANCE BEFORE.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,590
TO WIN 100 BATTLES IS NOT THE HEIGHT OF SKILL-
TO SUBDUE THE ENEMY WITHOUT FIGHTING IS.

55
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,099
IT'S AMAZING HOW EVERYONE'S OBSESSED WITH
SUING TODAY.

56
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,979
THERE'S DEFINITELY A TIME WHEN FIGHTING IS
THE LAST RESORT,

57
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:57,349
BUT A LOT OF THESE CASES COULD BE SOLVED JUST
BY PICKING UP THE PHONE.

58
00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:02,669
PICKING UP THE PHONE COSTS NOTHING,
SUING PEOPLE WILL COST YOU A LOT.

59
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:05,419
AND I LOVE WHEN PEOPLE FINALLY QUOTE UNQUOTE
WIN,

60
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:09,458
AND ARE SO PROUD.
BECAUSE THAT'S ALL YOU CAN BE, JUST PROUD.

61
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:14,039
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOKED AT IT RATIONALLY,
YOU HAVE SPENT ENDLESS AMOUNTS OF MONEY,

62
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:17,469
YEARS OF YOUR TIME AND ENERGY AND ALL THAT
OPPORTUNITY COST,

63
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,849
AND NOW YOU QUOTE UNQOUTE "WIN."

64
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:24,219
MAYBE THE BENEFIT WAS HIGHER THAN THE COST
IN YOUR SITUATION,

65
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,160
AND THAT'S AWESOME, CONGRATULATIONS,
BUT A LOT OF TIMES IT'S NOT.

66
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,430
YOU'RE SMARTER THAN YOUR OPPONENT,
YOU DON'T RELY ON EMOTIONS LIKE ANGER AND

67
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,910
PRIDE
TO DECIDE IF YOU'RE GOING TO FIGHT OR NOT.

68
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,280
YOU ALWAYS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE COST,
AND YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN

69
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,369
TO WIN THE BATTLE WITHOUT ACTUALLY FIGHTING
IT.

70
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:48,069
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT FIGHTING HAS A COST,
AND THAT COST IS HUGE.

71
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:50,599
SO THE THREE BIG IDEAS ARE:

72
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,780
KNOW YOUR ENEMY AND KNOW YOURSELF
AND IN 100 BATTLES YOU WILL NEVER BE IN PERIL.

73
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:59,959
AVOID WHAT IS STRONG. ATTACK WHAT IS WEAK.

74
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:03,569
AND TO WIN 100 BATTLES IS NOT THE HEIGHT OF
SKILL-

75
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:07,029
TO SUBDUE THE ENEMY WITHOUT FIGHTING IS.
