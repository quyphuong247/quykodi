1
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,099
I REMEMBER AT COLLEGE,
I HAD TO TAKE A BUNCH OF CLASSES

2
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:18,339
THAT I WASN'T INTERESTED IN.
AND EACH CLASS ONLY LASTED

3
00:00:18,339 --> 00:00:22,239
ABOUT 53 MINUTES.
AND I WOULD LOOK AT THE CLOCK

4
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,659
EVERY TWO MINUTES,
I COULDN'T FOCUS ON ANYTHING,

5
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,349
AND I COULDN'T WAIT FOR THE CLASS
TO BE OVER.

6
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,299
WELL, MAYBE I SHOULD'VE
GOTTEN A PRESCRIPTION FOR SOME ADDERALL.

7
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,570
OR MAYBE NOT,
BECAUSE I CAN NOW WORK ON PROJECTS

8
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,280
THAT I'M INTERESTED IN
FOR 20 HOURS STRAIGHT.

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,820
AND THIS IS WHY EVERYONE'S
BASICALLY MEDIOCRE AT WHAT THEY DO.

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,000
AS SOON AS YOU'RE A LITTLE KID,
YOUR PARENTS START PRESSURING YOU

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,289
TO BECOME SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T
INTEREST YOU.

12
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:52,698
I MEAN, YOU WANT TO BE A COMPOSER?
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

13
00:00:52,698 --> 00:00:55,399
AND NOT ONLY ARE PEOPLE AROUND YOU
CONSTANTLY PRESSURING YOU,

14
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:01,179
BUT THEN YOU START TO PRESSURE YOURSELF...
"WELL, YOU KNOW, MAYBE I CAN MAKE MORE MONEY

15
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:03,868
BEING A DOCTOR.
I KNOW I CAN'T STOP PLAYING THE PIANO

16
00:01:03,868 --> 00:01:06,299
DAY AND NIGHT,
BUT MAYBE BEING A DOCTOR

17
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,830
IS A SAFER CHOICE."
AND THEN YOU END UP

18
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:13,500
IN A CLASS LEARNING ABOUT THE KREBS CYCLE
AND LOOKING AT THE CLOCK EVERY TWO MINUTES.

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,930
AND THAT'S OUR PROBLEM.
WE HAVE TOO MANY MOZARTS

20
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,290
WHO WERE FORCED TO BECOME A DOCTOR.
AND THEN YOU GO VISIT

21
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,510
THAT MOZART DOCTOR WHEN YOU'RE SICK,
AND YOU CAN JUST TELL THAT HE DOESN'T GIVE

22
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,109
A SHIT.
HE HANDS YOU THE PRESCRIPTION AND THEN YOU

23
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:27,209
LEAVE.

24
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:32,429
NOW, I'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH QUITE A FEW DOCTORS,
AND IT ALWAYS AMAZES ME WHEN I WALK IN THERE

25
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,370
KNOWING MORE ABOUT MY CONDITION THAN HE DOES.
AND I DON'T EVEN BLAME HIM!

26
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,600
HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE A DOCTOR,
HE WANTED TO BE A COMPOSER.

27
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,519
NOW HE GOES HOME,
AND INSTEAD OF BEING EXCITED ABOUT

28
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,129
FINDING A SOLUTION TO MY CONDITION,
HE WATCHES TV.

29
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:49,259
HE'S NOT MISSING OUT ON SLEEP
BECAUSE HE'S RESEARCHING TOO MUCH,

30
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,280
HE CAN'T EVEN WAIT TO LEAVE WORK.

31
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,200
DON'T GIVE INTO THAT PRESSURE!
YEAH, YOU MIGHT END UP WITH A GOOD JOB,

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,810
A NICE CAR, A NICE HOUSE,
I'LL GIVE YOU ALL THAT.

33
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:03,510
BUT I WILL GUARANTEE YOU ONE THING.
YOU WILL NEVER HAVE A CHANCE AT MASTERY.

34
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:07,590
BECAUSE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO
DEDICATE THE REQUIRED THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS

35
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,149
OF HOURS TO IT.
BECAUSE YOU WON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

36
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:13,370
TO WAKE UP AND WORK ON SOMETHING UNTIL YOU
FALL ASLEEP.

37
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,670
THEN DREAM ABOUT IT,
AND WAKE UP AND START DOING IT AGAIN.

38
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:17,929
YOU WON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE!

39
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,680
AND HERE'S THE THING...
I'M NOT EVEN COMING FROM SOME ROMANTIC PLACE

40
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,459
OF YOU SHOULD PROBABLY DO WHAT YOU ENJOY IN
LIFE,

41
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,528
WHICH IS PROBABLY THE BEST ADVICE I COULD
GIVE.

42
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:32,068
BUT FORGER THAT,
I'M COMING FROM A PURELY MASTERY PERSPECTIVE.

43
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:35,298
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT IN THOUSANDS AND
THOUSANDS OF HOURS

44
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:38,870
INTO YOUR CRAFT TO BECOME A MASTER.
THERE'S NO OTHER OPTION!

45
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,370
AND YOU'RE SIMPLY, PHYSICALLY NOT GOING TO
BE ABLE TO DO THAT

46
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:49,370
IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW YOUR INCLINATION
AND DO WHAT YOU'RE DEEPLY INTERESTED IN.

47
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:55,759
THE WHOLE IDEA HERE IS THAT
YOU HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME.

48
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,259
YOU CAN'T BE SPENDING DAYS AND WEEKS
FIGURING THINGS OUT ON YOUR OWN

49
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:02,798
WHEN YOU CAN BE TAUGHT IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.

50
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:04,889
SO HERE ARE THE THREE STEPS
THAT YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW

51
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:06,510
WITH YOUR APPRENTICESHIP.

52
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:10,979
FIRST: DEEP OBSERVATION.
YOU WALK IN THERE.

53
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:13,979
YOU'RE NOT MAKING THE MISTAKE
OF ASSERTING YOURSELF LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

54
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:16,848
YOU DON'T TRY TO SHOW EVERYONE
HOW TALENTED YOU ARE.

55
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:19,009
YOU DON'T TRY TO INVENT THINGS.

56
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:23,138
THIS IS A TIME TO OBSERVE EVERYTHING.
HOW DOES THE SYSTEM WORK?

57
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:26,760
WHAT ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUCCESSFUL IN
MY NICHE DOING?

58
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:31,539
NOW, NOT A 100% OF WHAT YOU OBSERVE AND LEARN
IS GOING TO BE RIGHT OR OPTIMAL

59
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:35,218
IN ANY APPRENTICESHIP OR FROM ANY MENTOR.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

60
00:03:35,218 --> 00:03:38,528
THIS IS NOT YOUR TIME TO TELL PEOPLE
HOW YOU'VE RESEARCHED THINGS ON YOUR OWN

61
00:03:38,528 --> 00:03:42,519
AND HAVE FOUND MORE EFFECTIVE WAYS OF DOING
THINGS.

62
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:46,359
SECOND: SKILLS ACQUISITION
THIS IS WHERE YOU START PUTTING IN YOUR 10,000

63
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,230
HOURS
THAT EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT.

64
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:50,539
IF YOU'RE A WRITER,
YOU'RE WRITING ALL DAY,

65
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:53,679
YOU'RE RACKING UP THOSE HOURS.

66
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,090
AND FINALLY,
ONCE YOU HAVE COMPLETED THAT AND YOU'RE READY,

67
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,759
YOU TAKE EVERYTHING YOU'VE LEARNED,
YOU TAKE THAT FOUNDATION AND SKILL,

68
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,438
AND PUT YOUR OWN UNIQUENESS ON IT
AND CREATE SOMETHING GREAT.

69
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:06,858
THIS WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO START IMPLEMENTING
THAT THING THAT YOU RESEARCHED

70
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:08,989
THAT MIGHT MAKE YOU MORE EFFICIENT.

71
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:12,938
SO THAT'S THE MODEL,
AND I SEE PEOPLE IGNORING IT ALL THE TIME,

72
00:04:12,938 --> 00:04:16,519
DON'T IGNORE IT.
THE FOUNDATION IS VERY SIMILAR FOR EVERYTHING.

73
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,699
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THE PERSON LEARNING
HOW TO DO THE FOUNDATION ALL ON HIS OWN.

74
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,210
PEOPLE ASK ME ALL THE TIME,
"HOW DO I START A BUSINESS?"

75
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:28,198
WELL, LET'S SAY IT'S AN ONLINE BUSINESS,
FOLLOW THE THREE STEPS.

76
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,590
TAKE THE SUCCESSFUL ONES YOU WANT TO BE LIKE.
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

77
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:34,839
"OH LOOK AT THAT,
THEIR WEBSITE LOOKS LIKE THIS."

78
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:39,378
"THEY GIVE A LOT OF VALUE FOR FREE,
I WONDER WHY A BUNCH OF CAPITALIST PIGS WOULD

79
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,319
DO THAT."
"WELL, BUT LOOK AT THAT,

80
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:44,229
THEY ALSO HAVE A PRODUCT.
LET ME TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THEY TRY TO SELL

81
00:04:44,228 --> 00:04:48,019
IT TO YOU."
YOU DO YOUR DEEP OBSERVATION.

82
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:50,810
NOW YOU'VE LEARNED HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS,
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO PUT IN YOUR HOURS

83
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,060
TO CREATE YOUR WEBSITE,
CREATE YOUR PRODUCT,

84
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,180
START DOING YOUR MARKETING.

85
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,400
NOW AGAIN,
LET'S SAY YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING ON A PLATFORM

86
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,829
LIKE WORDPRESS,
YOU CAN EITHER WATCH A GUY EXPLAIN THE FOUNDATION

87
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:04,068
OF WORDPRESS TO YOU
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS,

88
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:08,270
OR YOU CAN LEARN ON YOUR OWN FOR WEEKS.
BY THE WAY,

89
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:11,019
THIS IS THE BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT THE TIME
THAT WE LIVE IN AS WELL,

90
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,198
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO KNOW PEOPLE FOR THEM
TO BE YOUR MENTOR.

91
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:17,250
NOW FINALLY,
YOU'RE NOT JUST CREATING A COPY OF SOMEONE

92
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,899
ELSE'S BUSINESS,
THAT WAS JUST THE FOUNDATION.

93
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:24,198
NOW YOU PUT YOUR OWN UNIQUENESS ON THE WEBSITE,
YOU CREATE A PRODUCT THAT'S BETTER,

94
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,939
YOU TAKE THE GENERAL IDEAS OF MARKETING BUT
DO IT BETTER.

95
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:33,939
AND THAT IS HOW YOU END UP WITH A SUCCESSFUL
BUSINESS.

96
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,629
I LOVE THE FACT THAT THIS IS INCLUDED AS ONE
OF THE KEYS.

97
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:42,310
EVERY MASTERY BOOK TALKS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE
OF THINGS LIKE PRACTICE,

98
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,788
WHICH IS CRUCIAL BUT SO IS SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE.

99
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:48,848
YOU'LL BE MESSING UP ALL THE OTHER KEYS WITHOUT
IT.

100
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:52,060
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THEM...
FOLLOWING YOUR INCLINATION.

101
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,899
YOU HAVE CONTROLLING PARENTS
AND INSTEAD OF APPEASING THEM,

102
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:59,329
AND MAKING THEM FEEL IMPORTANT,
AND TELLING THEM HOW YOU CAN'T WAIT TO BE

103
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:02,538
WHATEVER THEY'RE FORCING YOU TO BE,
YOU START CONFLICT.

104
00:06:02,538 --> 00:06:05,860
THEY KICK YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE,
YOU HAVEN'T DEVELOPED YOUR SKILLS YET,

105
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,788
SO NOW YOU'RE WORKING AT MCDONALDS,
INSTEAD OF BEING FED BY MOMMY AT HOME

106
00:06:09,788 --> 00:06:11,829
WHILE YOU DEVELOP YOUR SKILLS.

107
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,008
SAME THING WITH APPRENTICESHIP.
TRYING TO WALK IN THERE

108
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:17,360
AND SHOW PEOPLE HOW HARD WORKING AND TALENTED
YOU ARE.

109
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,218
YOU THINK IT'S GREAT.
THEY'RE REALLY GOING TO APPRECIATE YOU NOW.

110
00:06:21,218 --> 00:06:24,129
EXCEPT FOR, THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY'RE THINKING
AT ALL.

111
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:26,699
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT YOU SHOULD
NEVER APPEAR TOO PERFECT,

112
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,310
AND EVENTUALLY THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU
AND GET RID OF YOU.

113
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,918
SAME THING WITH MENTORS.
FIRST OF ALL,

114
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:35,508
GOOD LUCK GETTING A GOOD MENTOR WITHOUT SOCIAL
INTELLIGENCE,

115
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:40,370
BUT LET'S ASSUME THAT YOU SOMEHOW DID.
YOU START TO SHARE WITH HIM ALL THE GREAT

116
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,819
IDEAS YOU HAVE.
YOU WANT HIM TO BE REALLY IMPRESSED BY YOU,

117
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:46,300
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER OUTSHINE
YOUR MASTER.

118
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,629
SO YOU GET HIM INSECURE AND HE GETS RID OF
YOU.

119
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:53,090
I SEE THIS ALL THE TIME.
OTHERWISE INTELLIGENT PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO

120
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:55,288
WILLING
TO PUT IN ALL THE HARD WORK

121
00:06:55,288 --> 00:07:00,218
GETTING THROWN OFF THE PATH TO MASTERY,
AND ALL BECAUSE THEY DON'T CULTIVATE ANY SOCIAL

122
00:07:00,218 --> 00:07:01,139
INTELLIGENCE.

123
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:03,699
IF YOU HAD READ
CARNEGIE'S HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE

124
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:06,340
PEOPLE
AND GREENE'S THE 48 LAWS OF POWER,

125
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:07,899
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE MADE ANY OF THESE MISTAKES.

126
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:10,288
BY THE WAY,
THESE ARE TWO BOOKS THAT EVERYONE MUST READ,

127
00:07:10,288 --> 00:07:13,329
EVEN THOUGH I USUALLY DON'T LIKE TO SAY
THAT ANYONE HAS TO READ ANYTHING.

128
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:16,908
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THREE TYPES OF MINDS:
THE ORIGINAL MIND,

129
00:07:16,908 --> 00:07:21,300
THE CONVENTIONAL MIND,
AND THE DIMENSIONAL MIND.

130
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,650
HERE'S THE ORIGINAL MIND.
LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A LITTLE KID WHO WANTS

131
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:24,929
TO BE A TEACHER
WHEN HE GROWS UP.

132
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,139
AND YOU ASK HIM,
"HEY KID, WHAT SCHOOL DO YOU WANT TO TEACH

133
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,569
AT?"
YOU MIGHT GET A CRAZY ANSWER LIKE,

134
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:34,400
"I'M GOING TO TEACH THE ENTIRE WORLD."
AND YOU'RE LIKE,

135
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,049
"OH, THAT'S REALLY SWEET."
THAT'S THE ORIGINAL MIND.

136
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,759
IT'S CRAZY.
IT'S CREATIVE.

137
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:44,680
THEN YOU HAVE THE CONVENTIONAL MIND.
AND THIS WOULD BE ONE OF MY OLD PHD PROFESSORS

138
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,579
AT COLLEGE.
IF YOU ASKED ONE OF THEM,

139
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:49,399
"HEY, WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO TEACH?"
YOU MIGHT GET AN ANSWER LIKE,

140
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:54,579
"WELL, OF COURSE, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE HARVARD!"
THAT'S THE BEST THING HIS MIND CAN COME UP

141
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:57,748
WITH.
A CLASS OF 15 STUDENTS AT HARVARD.

142
00:07:57,749 --> 00:08:01,900
NOW, THIS PROFESSOR MIGHT HAVE PUT IN THOUSANDS
OF HOURS INTO ECONOMICS,

143
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:08,019
MIGHT KNOW ALL THE FACTS ABOUT EVERYTHING,
BUT HIS MIND HAS LOST ALL OF ITS ELASTICITY.

144
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:12,740
HE CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING CRAZY ANYMORE.
HE CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING CREATIVE ANYMORE.

145
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,019
FINALLY, YOU HAVE THE DIMENSIONAL MIND.
AND THE DIMENSIONAL MIND COMBINES

146
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:20,839
THE CRAZINESS AND THE CREATIVITY OF THE ORIGINAL
MIND,

147
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:24,198
WITH THE MASTERY OF THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS
OF HOURS OF EXPERTISE.

148
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:29,460
AND WHEN YOU COMBINE THESE TWO,
THAT'S WHEN YOU END UP WITH TRUE MASTERY.

149
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:33,829
THE CHILD HAS THE ORIGINAL MIND WHICH IS GREAT,
BUT HE HASN'T CULTIVATED THE SKILL TO DO ANYTHING

150
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,460
GREAT WITH IT.
THE OLD PROFESSOR HAS CULTIVATED THE SKILL,

151
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,158
BUT HAS SUPPRESSED HIS ORIGINAL MIND COMPLETELY
IN THE PROCESS.

152
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:44,059
SO HE WON'T BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING GREAT EITHER.

153
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:49,309
NOW LET'S GO BACK TO TEACHING THE ENTIRE WORLD.
SOUNDS PRETTY CRAZY RIGHT?

154
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:52,209
ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT THAT CRAZY. IT'S CALLED
YOUTUBE.

155
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:56,660
IT'S CALLED THE INTERNET.
IF THE OLD PROFESSOR HAD MAINTAINED THE ORIGINAL

156
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:59,799
MIND,
HE WOULDN'T SAY SOMETHING STUPID LIKE,

157
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:05,899
"YOUTUBE? ISN'T THAT THE PLACE FOR CAT VIDEOS?"
"UHH, NO THANKS, KID. I HAVE A PHD.

158
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:10,779
I HAVE TO GET UP AT 6 TOMORROW
TO GO TO MY MEDIOCRE COLLEGE AND ACTUALLY

159
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:14,000
TEACH."
ALRIGHT PROFESSOR,

160
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,120
GOOD LUCK TEACHING IN YOUR LITTLE CLASSROOM
UNTIL YOU DIE.

161
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,230
HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE...
WHAT IF I GO UP TO HIM AND SAY,

162
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,440
"HEY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SO DRY WHEN YOU
TEACH."

163
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,930
"I HAVE FOUND A LOT OF SUCCESS
TELLING STORIES SO PEOPLE CAN RESONATE WITH

164
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:31,120
IT
AND DRAWING STUPID LITTLE CARTOONS

165
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,970
SO PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY FOLLOW ALONG."
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN HIS MIND AT THAT

166
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,060
POINT?
"STORIES? DRAWING? I HAVE A PHD!

167
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:45,559
I CAN'T ENGAGE IN SUCH FRIVOLOUS MATTERS!"
AND I'M LIKE,

168
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:49,449
"UH, WELL, BUT,
BEING LIGHTHEARTED AND LEARNING SOMETHING

169
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,000
NEW
DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE,

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
RIGHT?"
AND HE'S LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN

171
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,840
KID,
IF IT'S NOT DRY, IT'S FRIVOLOUS."

172
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,500
OH AND HE HAS A PHD. YOU GET THE POINT...

173
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,330
YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN YOUR ORIGINAL MIND.
COMBINE THAT WITH THE THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF

174
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:11,410
PRACTICING YOUR SKILL,
AND THEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE AT DOING GREAT,

175
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:12,719
AMAZING THINGS.

176
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,519
THAT COMBINATION IS THE POWER OF THE DIMENSIONAL
MIND.

177
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:24,699
AGAIN, WE HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MINDS.
THE INTUITIVE MIND,

178
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,350
AND THE RATIONAL MIND.

179
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,250
BOTH ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.
BUT WE TEND TO VALUE THE RATIONAL MIND AND

180
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,710
IGNORE THE INTUITIVE MIND.

181
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,930
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
LET'S SAY

182
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:40,679
YOU'VE SPENT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF HOURS
INVESTING IN COMPANIES AND PRODUCTS.

183
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:43,359
NOW SOMEONE PRESENTS TO YOU THEIR COMPANY
OR PRODUCT,

184
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,060
AND YOU CAN JUST SENSE THAT THIS IS GOING
TO BE HUGE.

185
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:49,369
NOW YOU MIGHT HAVE OTHER FRIEND INVESTORS
TELL YOU

186
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,750
"YOU'RE CRAZY!
YOU'RE PAYING TOO MUCH BECAUSE OF THIS METHOD

187
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,889
OF VALUATION,
AND THIS EQUATION AND THAT EQUATION."

188
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:01,460
BUT IF YOU'VE DONE THIS FOR A VERY LONG TIME,
YOU MIGHT BE SEEING SOMETHING THAT OTHER PEOPLE

189
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,120
CAN'T SEE.
IT'S ALMOST HARD TO EXPLAIN,

190
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,669
BUT AFTER ALL THOSE HOURS,
EVERYTHING STARTS TO COME TOGETHER.

191
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:09,439
YOU START TO SEE THE WHOLE PICTURE.

192
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,310
NOW, I'VE BEEN PLAYING THE PIANO FOR OVER
A DECADE.

193
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:17,389
WHEN I FIRST STARTED,
I HAD TO BE VERY RATIONAL ABOUT EVERYTHING.

194
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:20,110
IT WAS LIKE,
I'M GOING TO PLAY C NOW.

195
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,810
NOW I'M GOING TO PLAY D.

196
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:25,769
BUT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,
SOMETIMES I LIKE TO SIT DOWN AND JUST PLAY

197
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,480
AROUND AND COMPOSE,
AND MY FINGERS JUST KIND OF RUN AROUND ON

198
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,759
THEIR OWN.
IT'S WEIRD.

199
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:35,990
THERE'S ALMOST NO RATIONALITY INVOLVED,
BUT SOMEHOW MY FINGERS KNOW WHERE TO GO.

200
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,009
AND KEEP IN MIND,
THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN JUST A HOBBY FOR ME.

201
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:41,980
TO THINK ABOUT WHAT GOES ON IN A PERSON'S
HEAD

202
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,159
WHO'S PLAYED FOR YEARS AND YEARS FOCUSING
ON BECOMING A MASTER

203
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:47,789
IS KIND OF SCARY FOR ME TO EVEN THINK ABOUT.

204
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:52,639
NOW, THERE'S NOTHING SUPERNATURAL HERE.
IN FACT, YOU CAN USE THE RATIONAL MIND TO

205
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,949
EXPLAIN IN RETROSPECT WHY FACEBOOK MIGHT HAVE
BEEN A GREAT INVESTMENT,

206
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:03,060
OR WHY SOME CHORD GOES WELL WITH SOME KEY.
BUT THE INTUITIVE MIND HAS A HUGE ADVANTAGE

207
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:06,669
OVER THE RATIONAL MIND
IN CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THIS.

208
00:12:06,669 --> 00:12:10,719
MASTERS ACCOMPLISH GREAT THINGS
BECAUSE THEY CAN COMBINE THE INTUITIVE WITH

209
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:17,720
THE RATIONAL.

210
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:31,870
ALRIGHT EVERYONE,
THAT WAS MASTERY BY ROBERT GREENE.

211
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,990
ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS.
DEFINITELY ONE OF MY FAVORITE AUTHORS.

212
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,460
AND YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ASK ME ALL THE TIME,
WHAT BOOKS DO YOU RECOMMEND?

213
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,370
WELL IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS ONE,
DEFINITELY READ THIS

214
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,870
ALONG WITH THE 48 LAWS OF POWER.

215
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,289
AND I JUST WANNA SAY A HUGE THANK YOU TO ROBERT
GREENE.

216
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:51,169
