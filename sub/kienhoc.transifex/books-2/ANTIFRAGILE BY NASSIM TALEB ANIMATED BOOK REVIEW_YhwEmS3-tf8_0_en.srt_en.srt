1
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:07,519
Think of a box that says fragile on it.
It's going to have something in it that breaks

2
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:12,280
if you throw it around.
So it could be something like glass for example.

3
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:15,669
Now if you ask most people,
"What is the opposite of fragile?"

4
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:20,990
You'll get answers like resistant or robust.
So something like a more solid piece of glass

5
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:25,500
that doesn't break when it gets thrown around.
But that's like saying that the opposite of

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,698
negative is neutral.
The opposite of fragile is not robust,

7
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,500
it's antifragile,
meaning a structure that gains from disorder,

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,299
that gains from being kicked around.

9
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:40,299
The way I like to think about it is,
every time you kick the antifragile box,

10
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:43,599
the glass inside doesn't break, doesn't simply
resist,

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,399
but turns a little bit more into a diamond.
The more you kick it around,

12
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,978
the stronger the diamond gets.

13
00:00:49,978 --> 00:00:54,069
My first two years at the Air Force Academy,
I wasn't allowed to own a car.

14
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:58,850
And the only way I could ever leave was if
an upperclassman let me use their car.

15
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,920
And I remember it would be the weekend
and I would tell my frinds,

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,908
"Hey, let's borrow a car from someone and
leave."

17
00:01:03,908 --> 00:01:07,530
And they'd say something like,
"Oh, everyone's already left.

18
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,118
"We can't get a car."
"No one who's here lends it out."

19
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:14,618
And I went along with that for a while,
but then I said,

20
00:01:14,618 --> 00:01:18,039
"This is bullshit!"
"I'm going to go around and knock on every

21
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:22,269
single door and ask for a car."
And by the end of the night I had a car,

22
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:26,188
but I also realized why everyone always had
some kind of a rationalization

23
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:32,368
for why there were no cars available.
Every time I knocked on a door, it was awkward.

24
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:37,358
And awkward was the best scenario.
The most common answers were rude or condescending.

25
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:40,078
But,
the more doors I knocked on,

26
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,718
the more awkward situations I put myself in,
the more condescending the comments,

27
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:48,339
the more I got made fun of,
the less I started to give a shit,

28
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,929
and I almost always ended up with a car.
I wasn't a glass that was going to break,

29
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:58,210
I wasn't simply resisting being broken,
I was turning into a diamond with every door

30
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:00,228
that I knocked on.

31
00:02:00,228 --> 00:02:04,810
Being antifragile is being alive.
You should crave being kicked around.

32
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,049
You crave it,
because the more you get kicked around,

33
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,789
the more you know that you're turning into
that diamond.

34
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:12,389
Now you might say,
"Are you some kind of a masochist?

35
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:15,869
Who wants to crave being kicked around?"
Well,

36
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,150
here's my question,
When you go to the gym,

37
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,780
and you're on your 8th rep,
and you have 4 more to go to failure,

38
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,930
do you stop and say,
"Well, I'm not a masochist,

39
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,569
I will cease the lifting process now
because I'm starting to feel discomfort."

40
00:02:29,568 --> 00:02:32,768
Hopefully not...
So why are you only applying that to just

41
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:36,959
one aspect of your life?
It's actually a lot easier to go to failure

42
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,549
on your set in the gym,
than to go door to door trying to sell a product,

43
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:43,400
or make those uncomfortable calls when you're
an entrepreneur,

44
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,989
or go up to a woman in the middle of the street
and say hi.

45
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:49,819
I know this because I had plenty of friends
who went to failure in the gym,

46
00:02:49,818 --> 00:02:52,818
no problem,
who squatted 3 times as much as I did,

47
00:02:52,818 --> 00:02:56,619
but could never go door to door asking for
a car.

48
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,019
Apply being antifragile to every aspect of
your life.

49
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,769
Start craving that disorder around you.

50
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:06,810
Getting a 1000 negative comments since I started
this channel,

51
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,799
has been one of the best things that has ever
happened to me.

52
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:11,909
Literally one of the best things!
I remember when I first started,

53
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:15,429
I told myself,
"Oh, I don't care about external feedback."

54
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,540
"That doesn't affect me."
"I'm completely detached from it."

55
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:22,280
And then I started to receive that negativity,
and sometimes it would get to me.

56
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,128
It really would even though I knew it shouldn't.
Fast forward to now,

57
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:30,149
after reading a 1000 negative comments,
it doesn't even register anywhere anymore.

58
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,180
I just laugh and keep doing what I need to
do.

59
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,409
But to get to that level with anything,
you should be willing to be alive,

60
00:03:36,408 --> 00:03:39,828
to be antifragile,
to be thrown around.

61
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:42,530
And the more you subject yourself to being
thrown around,

62
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,489
the more that fragile glass turns into a beautiful
diamond.
