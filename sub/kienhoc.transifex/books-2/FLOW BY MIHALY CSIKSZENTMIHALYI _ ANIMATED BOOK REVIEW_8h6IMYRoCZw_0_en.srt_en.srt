1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:14,138
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi,
and that's by the way how you say his name,

2
00:00:14,138 --> 00:00:16,768
dedicates a big part of the book to this idea
that,

3
00:00:16,768 --> 00:00:23,640
"A person can make himself happy, or miserable,
regardless of what is actually happening 'outside,'

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,599
just by changing the contents of consciousness."

5
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,050
And he goes on to quote
Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius, and Viktor

6
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,630
Frankl...
So this idea isn't something new,

7
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,290
it's been around for millennia now,
but recently we've been able to gather more

8
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:38,649
data on it.

9
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:41,310
And I've talked about this idea ad nauseam
now,

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,440
so I won't go into detail with it.
I've talked about it in my videos

11
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:47,989
about Meditations and Man's Search for Meaning,
and many other videos,

12
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,050
but to touch on it briefly...

13
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:53,909
People have this idea that
if you just had a bigger house, you'd be happy.

14
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:59,029
If you just had a nicer car, you'd be happy.
If you just had a lot of money, you'd be happy.

15
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,980
But that's just not how happiness works...

16
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:06,328
Here's a graph adjusted for inflation
that shows a period of about half a century

17
00:01:06,328 --> 00:01:10,938
where personal income tripled,
but it didn't really affect how happy people

18
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:13,059
were.
After some basic point,

19
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,439
where your basic needs have been met,
buying an even bigger house isn't the way

20
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:22,269
to happiness.
It's about changing the contents of your consciousness.

21
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:26,888
So how can we change the contents of our consciousness?
One of the best ways to do this

22
00:01:26,888 --> 00:01:31,718
is to put ourselves in a state of optimal
experience called flow.

23
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:36,208
Csikszentmihalyi describes flow as,
"The state in which people are so involved

24
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:40,310
in an activity
that nothing else seems to matter."

25
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,310
He goes on to say that,
"Concentration is so intense that there is

26
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,959
no attention left over
to think about anything irrelevant or to worry

27
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,528
about problems.
Self-consciousness disappears, and the sense

28
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:52,569
of time becomes distorted."

29
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:57,329
And you've probably experienced this before,
and it's absolutely one of the best feelings

30
00:01:57,328 --> 00:01:59,528
in the world.
If you're working on your business,

31
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:04,259
you might be so focused on what you're doing
that 12 hours might pass and you have no idea...

32
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,759
All of a sudden, you look up and you realize
you haven't even had any food,

33
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,939
you haven't thought about anything else,
the only thing that you could focus on was

34
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:13,530
your business.

35
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,890
And the same thing applies to so many other
activities

36
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:19,719
whether you're a rock climber focused on climing
your new record

37
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:24,400
or a master pianist composing your new masterpiece.
It's an amazing feeling.

38
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,319
You're so immersed into what you love doing,
into what you're really good at,

39
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,409
that your brain simply can't focus on other
things.

40
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:35,340
You're not worrying about stupid things.
You're not regretting what you did yesterday

41
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,520
or stressing about what you'll do tomorrow.
It's absolutely one of the best feelings in

42
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,880
the world.

43
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,129
So if we look at the flow diagram,
here's how you put yourself in the state of

44
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:47,769
flow...
You don't want what you're doing to be too

45
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,100
challenging,
otherwise you'll have anxiety.

46
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:53,180
You don't want what you're doing to be too
easy for your skills either,

47
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,879
otherwise you'll be bored.
But it's when you balance these two

48
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:00,069
that you end up in the flow channel.
You're striving towards the upper right corner

49
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:03,340
constantly.
You increase your challenge, you get better.

50
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,729
You get better, you increase your challenge.
And the more you move toward that direction,

51
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:11,289
the more intense the state of flow gets.

52
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:15,349
So this is not really a how-to book,
but our goal should be to find what it is

53
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:17,650
that we love
and then keep getting better at it

54
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,539
and keep making it more challenging.
Or in other words,

55
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:23,009
the main goal is to spend as much of your
life

56
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:28,199
as you possibly can in the state of flow
because that is where you find this unbelievable

57
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,759
ecstasy.

58
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,319
And Csikszentmihalyi gives an example of the
indians

59
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,189
in the Shuswap region of Canada,
who would settle down in a place filled with

60
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:38,800
resources,
and life was good, and they had everything

61
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,460
they needed...
They had all the food and fish where they

62
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,290
were,
but the elders would make sure that the entire

63
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:47,539
village
would just pack up and move to a new location

64
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:51,959
every 25 or 30 years.
This way, they knew they would have new places

65
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,069
to explore
and hunt and fish and new challenges to overcome...

66
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:58,989
And it's a great story to keep in mind when
you think about

67
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,150
how most people just want to settle down in
front of their TV

68
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,120
for the rest of their lives...

69
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,789
And in a lot of my videos,
I criticize being in front of the TV all night,

70
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,120
or spending your entire day on your Facebook
feed,

71
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,659
and I often get people who tell me,
"Well, what if that makes the person happy?"

72
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:17,788
And the answer is,
"Sitting on Facebook all day will not make

73
00:04:17,788 --> 00:04:21,319
anyone genuinely happy."
If you pick a person who spends his entire

74
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:25,699
day in front of the TV,
he's probably not going to be the most exciting,

75
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,560
happy, ecstatic person.

76
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,149
Let's take a look at the graph again...
Looking at your facebook all day or watching

77
00:04:32,149 --> 00:04:34,539
TV
puts you in the lowest left corner of the

78
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,450
graph,
which is known as the area of apathy.

79
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:41,229
There's no challenge involved, there's no
skill involved,

80
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:44,170
you're apathetic.
And when you're not completely apathetic,

81
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,000
You're probably sitting there bored,
or worrying about everything there is to worry

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,879
about.

83
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,310
So move away from that...
Move away from the boredom, apathy, and worry

84
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,860
and move towards ecstasy which is what you'll
experience

85
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,850
when you hit the state of optimal experience
called flow.
