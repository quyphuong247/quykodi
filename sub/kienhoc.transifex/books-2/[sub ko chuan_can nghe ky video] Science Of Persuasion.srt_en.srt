1
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,140
researchers have been studying the
factors that influence us to say yes to

2
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:22,450
the request of others for over 60 years
and there can be no doubt that there's a

3
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:28,480
science to how we are persuaded and a
lot of the science is surprising when

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,769
making a decision

5
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:32,920
it would be nice to think that people
consider all the available information

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,199
in order to guide their thinking

7
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:41,530
but the reality is very often different
in the increasingly overloaded lives we

8
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:46,329
lead more than ever we need shortcuts or
rules of thumb to guide our

9
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:51,460
decision-making my own research has
identified just six of these shortcuts

10
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,360
as universals that guide human behavior

11
00:00:55,899 --> 00:01:04,360
they are reciprocity scarcity authority
consistency liking and consensus

12
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,880
understanding these shortcuts and
employing them in an ethical manner can

13
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,890
significantly increase the chances that
someone will be persuaded by your

14
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:15,820
request

15
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,820
let's take a closer look at each in turn

16
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:23,440
so the first universal principle
influence is reciprocity

17
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,810
simply put people are obliged to give
back to others the form of behavior gift

18
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:33,789
or service that they have received first
if a friend invite you to their party

19
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:37,30
there's an obligation for you to invite
them to a future part ii you are hosting

20
00:01:37,30 --> 00:01:39,640
if a colleague does your favor

21
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,209
then you owe that colleague a favor and
in the context of a social obligation

22
00:01:44,80 --> 00:01:49,899
people are more likely to say yes to
those that they owe one of the best

23
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:53,289
demonstrations of the principle of
reciprocation comes from a series of

24
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:55,239
studies conducted in restaurants

25
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:59,170
so the last time you visit a restaurant
there's a good chance of the waiter or

26
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,330
waitress will have given you a gift

27
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:05,709
probably about the same time that they
bring your bill lockyer perhaps or a

28
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,860
fortune cookie or perhaps a simple meant

29
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,330
so here's the question does the giving
of a mint have any influence over how

30
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,370
much tip you're going to leave them

31
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,620
most people will say no but that meant
can make a surprising difference in the

32
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,10
study giving diners a single meant at
the end of their meal

33
00:02:24,10 --> 00:02:25,569
typically increased tips

34
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:30,790
by around three percent interestingly if
the gift is doubled and two minutes

35
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,230
provided tips

36
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:37,358
don't double they quadruple a fourteen
percent increase in tips

37
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,69
but perhaps most interestingly of all is
the fact that if the way to provides one

38
00:02:42,69 --> 00:02:47,589
mint starts to walk away from the table
but pauses turns back and says for you

39
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,430
nice people

40
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:53,139
he's an extra mint tips go through the
roof at twenty-three percent increase

41
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:58,000
influenced not by what was given but how
it was given

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,959
so the k2 using the principle of
reciprocation is to be the first to give

43
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:07,180
and to ensure that what you give is
possible i used an unexpected the second

44
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,969
universal principle of persuasion is
scarcity

45
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:14,349
simply put people want more of those
things they can have less of when

46
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:19,268
british airways announced in 2003 that
they would no longer be operating the

47
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:24,69
twice-daily London New York conquered
flight because it had become an

48
00:03:24,69 --> 00:03:29,260
economical to run sales the very next
day took off

49
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:33,819
notice that nothing had changed about
the Concord itself

50
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:39,370
it certainly didn't fly any faster the
service didn't suddenly get better and

51
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,709
the airfare didn't drop it had simply
become a scarce resource and as a result

52
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:47,229
people wanted it more

53
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:50,769
so when it comes to effectively
persuading others using the scarcity

54
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:51,849
principle

55
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:56,349
the science is clear it's not enough
simply to tell people about the benefits

56
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:59,349
they'll gain if they choose your
products and services

57
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:04,840
you'll also need to point out what is
unique about your proposition

58
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:11,259
and what they stand to lose if they
failed to consider your proposal our 3rd

59
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:13,988
Prince of influence is the principle of
authority

60
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:17,680
the idea that people follow the lead of
credible knowledgeable experts

61
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:22,900
physiotherapists for example are able to
persuade more of their patients to

62
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,159
comply with recommended exercise
programs if they display their medical

63
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:30,240
diplomas on the walls of their
consulting rooms

64
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,780
people are more likely to give change
for a parking meter to a complete

65
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,830
stranger

66
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:39,000
if that request or wears a uniform
rather than casual clothes

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,680
what the science is telling us is that
it's important to signal to others

68
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,509
what makes you a credible knowledgeable
authority before you make your influence

69
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:53,430
attempt of course this can present
problems you can hardly go around

70
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,819
telling potential customers how
brilliant you are but you can certainly

71
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:59,69
arrange for someone to do it for you

72
00:04:59,69 --> 00:05:03,210
and surprisingly the science tells us
that it doesn't seem to matter if the

73
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:08,370
person who introduces you is not only
connected to you but also likely to

74
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,280
prosper from the introduction themselves

75
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,609
one group of real estate agents were
able to increase both the number of

76
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,349
property appraisals and the number of
subsequent contracts that they wrote by

77
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:24,30
arranging for reception staff who
answered customer inquiries to first

78
00:05:24,30 --> 00:05:29,340
mention their colleagues credentials and
expertise so customers interested in

79
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,960
letting a property were told

80
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,609
lettings let me connect you with Sandra
who has over 15 years experience letting

81
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,539
properties in this area customers who
wanted more information about selling

82
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,810
properties were told speak to Peter our
head of sales

83
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,789
he has over 20 years experience selling
properties I'll put you through now the

84
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:52,139
impact of his expert introduction led to
a twenty percent rise in the number of

85
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,669
appointments and a 15-percent increase
in the number of sign contracts

86
00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:01,349
not bad for a small change in formed
from persuasion science that was both

87
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:06,659
ethical and costless to implement the
next principle is consistency

88
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,729
people like to be consistent with the
things they have previously said or done

89
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:18,448
consistency is activated by looking for
and asking for small initial commitments

90
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:23,310
that can be made in one famous set of
studies researchers found rather

91
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,110
unsurprisingly that very few people
would be willing to erect and unsightly

92
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:34,139
wooden board on their front lawn to
support a drive safely campaign in their

93
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:35,219
neighborhood

94
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:40,810
however in a similar neighborhood close
by four times as many homeowners

95
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,919
indicated that they would be willing to
erect the Sun slightly billboard

96
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:52,750
why because 10 days previously they had
agreed to place a small postcard in the

97
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,610
front window of their home

98
00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:00,850
that signal their support for a drive
safely campaign that small card was the

99
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:06,370
initial commitment that led to a four
hundred percent increase in a much

100
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,580
bigger but still consistent change

101
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,240
so when seeking to influence using the
consistency principle

102
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:19,930
the detective of influence looks for
voluntary active and public commitments

103
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:25,660
and ideally gets those commitments in
writing for example one recent study

104
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:32,169
reduced missed appointments at health
centers by eighteen percent simply by

105
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:37,000
asking the patients rather than the
staff to write down appointment details

106
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,30
on the future appointment card

107
00:07:40,30 --> 00:07:44,950
the fifth principle is the principle of
liking people prefer to say yes to those

108
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:50,50
that they like but what causes one
person to like another persuasion

109
00:07:50,50 --> 00:07:54,970
science tells us that there are three
important factors we like people who are

110
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:59,830
similar to us we like people who pay us
compliments and we like people who

111
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:04,990
cooperate with us towards mutual goals
as more and more of the interactions

112
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,210
that we are having take place online

113
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:11,888
it might be worth asking whether these
factors can be employed effectively in

114
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:17,560
let's say online negotiations in a
series of negotiations studies carried

115
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,310
out between mba students are too
well-known business schools

116
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:26,350
some groups were told time is money get
straight down to business in this group

117
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,580
around fifty five percent were able to
come to an agreement a second group

118
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,500
however were told before you begin
negotiating exchange and personal

119
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,940
information with each other

120
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,779
identify a similarity you share in
common then

121
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,480
begin negotiating in this group

122
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,680
ninety percent of them were able to come
to successful and agreeable outcomes

123
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,160
that would typically worth eighteen
percent more to both parties

124
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,660
so to harness this powerful principle of
liking

125
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,69
be sure to look for areas of similarity
that you share with others and genuine

126
00:09:01,70 --> 00:09:04,399
compliments you could give before you
get down to business

127
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,149
the final principle is consensus

128
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:12,170
especially when they are uncertain
people will look to the actions and

129
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,439
behaviors of others to determine their
own

130
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,329
you may have noticed that hotels often
place a small card and bathrooms that

131
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:26,599
attempt to persuade guests to reuse
their towels and linen most do this by

132
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,980
drawing a guest attention to the
benefits that we use can have on

133
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,750
Environmental Protection

134
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,620
it turns out that this is a pretty
effective strategy leading to around

135
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:42,500
thirty five percent compliance but could
there be an even more effective way

136
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,630
well it turns out that about 75% of
people who check into a hotel for four

137
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:52,430
nights are longer will reuse their
towels at some point during their state

138
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:56,540
so what would happen if we took a lesson
from the principle of consensus and

139
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,610
simply include that information on the
cards and said that seventy-five percent

140
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:06,79
of our guests reuse their towels at some
time during their stay

141
00:10:06,79 --> 00:10:12,439
so please do so as well it turns out
that when we do this towel reuse rises

142
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,990
by twenty six percent now imagine the
next time you stay in a hotel you saw

143
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,579
one of these signs

144
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:22,880
you picked it up and you read the
following message

145
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,850
seventy-five percent of people who have
stayed in this room every used their

146
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:29,660
towel

147
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:35,000
what would you think well here's what
you might think I hope they're not the

148
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,69
same towels and like most people you
probably think that this sign will have

149
00:10:40,69 --> 00:10:45,769
no influence on your behavior whatsoever
but it turns out that changing just a

150
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:47,449
few words on a sign

151
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:52,329
- honestly . out what comparable
previous guests have done was this

152
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:59,229
single most effective message leading to
a thirty-three percent increase in reuse

153
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:05,19
so the science is telling us that rather
than relying on our own ability to

154
00:11:05,19 --> 00:11:10,569
persuade others we can point to what
many others are already doing especially

155
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:13,29
many similar others

156
00:11:13,29 --> 00:11:18,850
so there we have it six scientifically
validated principles of persuasion that

157
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:24,339
provide for small practical often
costless changes that can lead to big

158
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:28,420
differences in your ability to influence
and persuade others in an entirely

159
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:33,279
ethical way they are the secrets from
the science of persuasion
