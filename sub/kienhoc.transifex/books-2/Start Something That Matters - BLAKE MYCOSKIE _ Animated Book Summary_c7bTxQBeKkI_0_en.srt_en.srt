00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:22,429
In 2006 Blake Mycoskie was a 29 year old entrepreneur.
He founded his first company when he was 19

2
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:28,099
and ten years on he was taking a break from
his fourth start-up to go travelling in Argentina.

3
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:33,090
During his travels he engrossed himself in
the culture. He danced the tango, played polo,

4
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,109
drank the wine and even wore the national
shoe – the alpargata.

5
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:42,420
Later on in the trip he visited villages and
poverty stricken areas and became aware that

6
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,420
many children lacked shoes. Being barefoot
meant blisters, sores and infections. He wanted

7
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,280
to do something about it to help.
He first thought of a shoe-based charity but

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,829
it would only last as long as there were donors.
Then he thought why not use his existing entrepreneurial

9
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,469
talents to create a profitable business which
could help provide shoes for the children.

10
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:08,978
His idea became “TOMS” which stands for
“Tomorrow’s Shoes”. It’s a shoe company

11
00:01:08,978 --> 00:01:14,750
that sells the alpargata shoe to US markets
and beyond. For every pair sold, they donate

12
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:20,150
another pair to a child in need, one for one.
He started the company with the help of his

13
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,520
polo teacher Alejo, who primarily helped as
a translator initially, as well as allowing

14
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:29,390
the use of his family barn to work out of.
After getting a local shoemaker on board and

15
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:34,219
making 250 sample pairs, Mycoskie went back
to the USA.

16
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:38,650
His friends loved the shoes, bought pairs
from him and put him in touch with stores

17
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,189
who might want to sell them. The shoe buyer
at one of these stores loved them too and

18
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:48,339
TOMS now had a retail customer. It wasn’t
just the shoe people loved, it was the story

19
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:54,340
behind the shoe and both could be sold.
Soon big breaks came in the form of articles

20
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,750
in the Los Angeles Times and Vogue magazine.
Orders for the shoes dramatically increased

21
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,000
and even celebrities such as Keira Knightley
and Scarlett Johansson were wearing them,

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,979
creating yet more exposure.
After 10,000 sales, they returned to Argentina

23
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:14,150
to give out the shoes. The next ten days they
drove through the country handing over shoes

24
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,819
to children in locations from schools to soup
kitchens.

25
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:23,310
Seeing the impact of this work and the joy
on the children’s faces made Mycoskie realise

26
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,699
that this would become his life and he sold
his other entrepreneurial endeavours. TOMS

27
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:33,889
has become a huge social as well as financial
and business success. He wrote this book as

28
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:39,389
a guide on how to build something that will
make a difference focusing on six keys traits.

29
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:45,850
It shows you how to earn money, achieve fulfilment
and make a positive impact on the world.

30
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:50,469
1. Find your story
Having a story that’s compelling helps to

31
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:55,729
attract attention from the press. It creates
loyal customers who feel connected to a story

32
00:02:55,729 --> 00:03:01,500
that moves them. Stories help the human mind
understand, make sense of, remember and plan

33
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,810
our lives. This most primitive form of communication
is being used today by smart companies who

34
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,389
tell stories on YouTube and Facebook.
A story evokes emotion and emotion creates

35
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:17,019
a connection. People make their decisions
based on what the facts mean to them, rather

36
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:22,289
than the facts themselves.
Mycoskie used to wear odd coloured TOMS shoes

37
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:26,909
– red on the left foot and blue on the right
– so that people would ask him why and he

38
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:31,689
could tell the TOMS story. To spread your
message, you should commit to telling the

39
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:36,669
story at every opportunity.
2. Face your fears

40
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:43,400
Those who are successful face up to their
fears and make plans to overcome them. Everyone

41
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:49,789
who succeeds battles through adversity at
some point, fear and setbacks are inevitable.

42
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:54,259
Instead of focusing on the fear itself, which
can grow and distort our behaviour, focus

43
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:59,948
on your actions, which is something you can
control. No matter what happens, life goes

44
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:05,370
on. Everyone makes mistakes.
In the beginning, there were times when TOMS

45
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:10,819
didn’t have the money to pay the bills.
These were particularly scary moments. Mycoskie

46
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:15,530
dealt with the fear by surrounding himself
with interns. They’re enthusiastic and so

47
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,500
new to everything that they don’t waste
time being fearful. Surrounded by these people

48
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,660
gave him confidence and made him feel young,
rather than old and scared.

49
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,400
He also read biographies. Specifically biographies
about people who focused their business on

50
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:36,750
profit and a larger mission, such as Richard
Branson or Howard Schultz. Learning how someone

51
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,699
else was doing something similar to what he
wanted to do, eliminated fear.

52
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:48,729
3. Be resourceful without resources
Many well known companies started out in improvised

53
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:53,750
spaces.
Facebook began in Mark Zuckerberg’s dorm room.

54
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,759
Kenneth Cole’s first shoe display was in
the boot of his car.

55
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,089
LinkedIn began in Reid Hoffman’s living
room.

56
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:07,189
Apple started in Steve Job’s family garage.
Lack of resources is not a reason to avoid

57
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:14,189
starting a company. It often inspires a competitive
edge and creativity. If you have little money

58
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:18,660
it becomes part of your company’s DNA so
that when you expand you keep that efficiency

59
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,430
and frugality to stay successful.
Develop a presence where it’s free – utilise

60
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,480
social media. It’s a great equaliser of
companies, regardless of how many resources

61
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:34,230
the companies have.
When TOMS first started instead of renting

62
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,790
expensive office space, Mycoskie became friendly
with staff at a coffee shop he used to go

63
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:44,860
into in LA. They let him start receiving his
mail there and just like that, TOMS had an

64
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,490
address on Hollywood Boulevard, which would
help them get taken more seriously.

65
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:56,590
4. Keep it simple
In design, simplicity rules. The iPod when

66
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:01,099
launched was more expensive than competitor’s
products, lacked a radio receiver and made

67
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:06,810
replacing the battery difficult. It succeeded
because of its simple design and ease of use

68
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:12,129
due to it being less complicated.
TOMS shoes are based on the alpargata, which

69
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:16,659
have been around for over 100 years and are
simply a piece of canvas around the foot attached

70
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,880
to the sole. This simplicity gives TOMS a
blank canvas allowing them to create different

71
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:26,949
designs and special editions with celebrity
partners such as Charlize Theron.

72
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:32,539
5. Build trust
There are two fundamental aspects of trust

73
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,389
for a business. Internal trust that you build
within the organisation and external trust

74
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:40,620
that you build with your customers and third
parties.

75
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,180
Trust between employer and employee is the
cornerstone of your business and your future.

76
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,240
A leaders job is to motivate the staff and
anyone else they’re in a position to influence.

77
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,340
The better the employees feel, the better
the business performs. Trust rather than authoritarianism

78
00:06:57,339 --> 00:07:01,279
allows knowledge and valuable contributions
to come from anywhere in the business instead

79
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:07,869
of just from the executives at the top. Powerlessness
is the ultimate de-motivator. Giving away

80
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:13,168
autonomy and giving the employee more responsibility
empowers employees, making the organisation

81
00:07:13,168 --> 00:07:17,109
run more smoothly and leaves more time to
spend on other issues.

82
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:23,930
Leaders who use qualities such as empathy,
awareness and listening to people can be inspiring.

83
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,870
They create loyal employees who are attached
to the company. A leader can create a company

84
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:35,620
but a community creates a movement.
Admit your own mistakes. Everyone makes them

85
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,259
and if you admit them and work through them,
you can treat them as an opportunity to build

86
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:45,039
more trust.
TOMS once accidently created 6,000 shoes with

87
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:51,360
too much fabric. They were fine at first but
after a few weeks of wear, they became slippy.

88
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,370
No customers complained but TOMS recalled
the shoes at great cost. In the long run it

89
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,149
showed they stood behind what they made and
gained a great deal of trust.

90
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:05,679
If you lose the trust of your customers, you
lose everything. You can build this trust

91
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,620
by creating a powerful promise for the customer.
Brands have built reputations by offering

92
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:16,389
lifetime guarantees of their products, often
replacing products with no questions asked.

93
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:21,120
This wins loyalty and trusting these guarantees
will encourage the customer to invest further.

94
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,120
At TOMS a lady emailed saying she needed two
different sized shoes for a medical condition

95
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,899
she had with her foot, but couldn’t afford
two pairs. TOMS staff spoke to warehouse staff,

96
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:37,360
had a custom pair made and shipped and the
lady wrote back thrilled. A potentially irate

97
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,990
customer had been turned into a potential
evangelist for the brand.

98
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:48,120
6. Giving is good business
Giving is good in two ways because it helps

99
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,690
people and it makes money. When giving is
incorporated into the business model, customers

100
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,920
help market a product by telling people about
it and the story behind it.

101
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:04,729
Giving helps the giver as well as the recipient.
It will help you get through a bad day. You’ll

102
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,009
love talking about your job and you’ll love
your job itself a little bit more.

103
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:14,189
If a business is doing good, customers have
greater reason to care about the work. It

104
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,320
not only creates loyal customers, it retains
the most amazing employees who want to be

105
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,830
part of the story.
It also helps to attract great partners. Businesses

106
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:28,460
want to partner with other businesses that
are doing something good. TOMS has worked

107
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:33,150
with Microsoft, Facebook and YouTube among
others.

108
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:38,639
Social and economic priorities are merging
in business. Profit-only focus risks alienating

109
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,889
customers and not attracting the best talent.
However, it is important to give more than

110
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:49,439
money. Being actively involved in giving is
more fulfilling. Giving only money means you

111
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,520
often don’t see its results or know exactly
where it goes.

112
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:58,829
Blake Mycoskie’s company TOMS Shoes gave
its one millionth pair of shoes to a child

113
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:06,240
in 2010. In 2011, they moved into vision,
creating one for one eyewear, providing eye

114
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,070
treatment, eye surgery or glasses for every
pair purchased.

115
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:14,960
His goal has evolved from creating a profitable
company that helps relieve pain and suffering

116
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,649
for children without shoes, into influencing
other people to go out in the world and have

117
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:24,789
a positive impact themselves.
By showing everything he’s learnt at TOMS,

118
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:28,349
he hopes to encourage others to have the confidence
to start something that matters.
