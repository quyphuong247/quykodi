2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,010
OK.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,530
Now, that we've already learned
a few things about

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,950
management, let's have a look at
the history of management.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:20,220
And, actually, management, as
it appears today, has only

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,759
been in place for approximately
100 years.

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,110
So that's pretty much how long
research has been conducted

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,509
scientifically.

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,450
The first method that I want
to introduce you to, so

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:38,560
basically the scientific method
of management research.

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,890
If you look at the history of
management again, you could

12
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,160
trace that even further back
and not actually 100 years.

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,860
So look at the Egyptians
building the pyramids which

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,019
you would probably all agree
required a very high level of

15
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,720
planning, leading, organising,
and actually controlling the

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,530
proper erection of
those pyramids.

17
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,780
And you can see the Egyptians
have been

18
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,960
pretty good with that.

19
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,600
The scientific approach that I
would like to address now is

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,770
concerned about gaining
efficiencies.

21
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,600
It's about creating a higher
output volume for workers, for

22
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,710
example on an assembly line.

23
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,470
So what we're doing here or what
has been done is with the

24
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:34,490
scientific approach, scientists
have researched

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,140
efficiencies and how
to increase the

26
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,110
output volume of workers.

27
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,680
The father of scientific
management was unarguably

28
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,040
Frederick Taylor.

29
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,610
And Frederick Taylor
was an engineer at

30
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,120
Midvale Steel Company.

31
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:58,910
His research was around again
looking how he could get his

32
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:03,250
workers to be more productive
working his company.

33
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,110
He realised fairly quickly
that if he was allowing

34
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:11,490
workers to go on breaks in their
shifts, productivity

35
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,070
would actually increase.

36
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,820
And the quality of the output
that he was getting or the

37
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,769
quality of work that the workers
were producing was

38
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,020
higher than before.

39
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,080
He then also took it a step
further, and he scientifically

40
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,130
selected and trained staff
for tasks that they were

41
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,299
specifically well suited for.

42
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,730
Another study that was conducted
by Frank and Lillian

43
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,670
Gilbreth was the
motion studies.

44
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,399
Lillian and Frank Gilbreth
they ran a

45
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,060
brick laying company.

46
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,020
And they, sort of, tried to
assess the movements and the

47
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,190
motions that the bricklayers
were doing in their company.

48
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,270
And they realised fairly quickly
there was a lot of

49
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,330
wasted movement.

50
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:05,780
So in that respect, efficiency
could be greatly gained by

51
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,320
just adjusting these movements
of their workers, of these

52
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,579
bricklayers, as they were
laying brick by brick

53
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,920
a little bit more.

54
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,089
And consequently, they came up
with a strategy and a training

55
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,600
programme for their workers
and increased productivity

56
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,870
from 120 bricks per hour
to 350 bricks per hour.

57
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,930
Now, just imagine if you could
adapt that in your workplace.

58
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,310
That is an increase by three
times in terms of

59
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,290
productivity, which was
a fantastic outcome.

60
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,829
Henry Ford, he basically used
both Frederick Taylor's but

61
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,450
also Lillian and Frank
Gilbreth's motion studies and

62
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,209
applied them to his
production line.

63
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:58,810
Henry Ford became famous by
developing a fully, not

64
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,000
automated still manual labour
there, production line for

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,950
automotives.

66
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:09,850
And what he did is he split up
tasks specifically for each

67
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,560
worker which resulted
effectively in great

68
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,000
efficiencies again.

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,860
And consequently, the
organisation was able to

70
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,840
manufacture many, many more
vehicles per day than they

71
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,085
initially did without the
assembly line that basically

72
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:28,335
Henry Ford invented.

73
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:31,532
