2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,930
OK, let's continue to have
a look at the history of

3
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,010
management.

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,590
And I would like to have
a look at Max Weber's

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,720
bureaucratic approach
to management.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,229
Max Weber pretty much assessed
management from a more

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,410
bureaucratic and administrative
approach and he

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,479
developed multiple principles
of management.

9
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,100
I just wanted to give you a
brief rundown overview of

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,880
those, rather than going
into intimate detail

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,210
of each one of these.

12
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,770
And what I'm trying to do is
I'm going to apply a more

13
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,480
modern language to the
principles that he's actually

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,500
come up with.

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,210
So one of the principles
inhibited a clear job

16
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,020
description.

17
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,480
So he firmly believed that
workers should clearly know

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,709
what their job was and
traditionally that could've

19
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,519
changed on a daily basis.

20
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,665
He also believed in a clear
hierarchy, so to say structure

21
00:01:09,665 --> 00:01:16,200
of an organisation, where lower
offices basically had to

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,300
adhere to the commands
of higher offices.

23
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,060
So a clear hierarchical
structure in an organisation

24
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,780
which wasn't the given
in the past.

25
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,810
He also firmly believed in key
performance indicators, the

26
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,910
development of KPIs, so
employees and workers knew

27
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,679
exactly what they had to do.

28
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,470
He also believed that workers
should not bring their own

29
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,810
equipment to work, which
traditionally happened.

30
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,870
He believed that organisations
were supposed to provide

31
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,110
workers with their equipment.

32
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,210
You might laugh about
this, that's pretty

33
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,279
much a given today.

34
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,910
But traditionally workers were
actually bringing their own

35
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,509
equipment to work.

36
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:05,510
Also, he emphasised on looking
at qualifications.

37
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,880
And people with the right
knowledge, expertise, and

38
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,590
qualifications should actually
be in certain positions rather

39
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:20,560
than determined by heritage, or
by wealth, or by the family

40
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,970
that they were from.

41
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,260
And he also believed in
clear career pathways.

42
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,410
So here, motivating staff with
offering them clear career

43
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:35,210
pathways during their career
within an organisation.

44
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,920
Enough about Max Weber.

45
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,780
I would like to move
on to Henry Fayol.

46
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,510
Henry Fayol being a Frenchman,
and also a follower of the

47
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,690
scientific management
school, so to say.

48
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,579
He came up with 14 principles
of management.

49
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,740
And don't worry, I won't bore
you with another 14

50
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,170
principles.

51
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,730
But what he also identified
was five functions of

52
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,810
management.

53
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,670
So he identified that
forecasting and planning,

54
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:12,640
organising, command and
direction, coordination and

55
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,859
also control were basically the
five main principles of

56
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,895
management.

57
00:03:17,895 --> 00:03:21,690
Now, some of you might say hold
on, that looks or sounds

58
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,710
a little bit familiar.

59
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,070
And yes, you're right.

60
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,720
We talked about the four
principals self-management

61
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,720
initially, which were planning,
organising, leading,

62
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,100
and controlling.

63
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,510
And obviously, here the term
that Henry Fayol was using,

64
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,720
commanding and directing, was
here replaced with a more

65
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,430
democratic term--

66
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,440
leading, in that respect.

67
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,130
Which is probably the better
term to use these days.

68
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:52,109
Lastly, I would like to have
a look at the humans

69
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,550
relationship approach.

70
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,690
And I guarantee you that's
pretty much the last bit of

71
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,650
history that I want to cover
with you when it comes to

72
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,150
management.

73
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,340
Elton Mayo conducted a lot of
research in terms of looking

74
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,010
at human relationships
in management.

75
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,239
Other researchers would be
Chester Barnard, but also Mary

76
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,620
Parker Follett.

77
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,040
Let's just focus
on Elton Mayo.

78
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,890
And here only on the three main
principles that Elton

79
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,900
Mayo really identified,
and these are

80
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,945
pretty much as follows.

81
00:04:23,945 --> 00:04:27,590
And I'm quickly going
to illustrate those.

82
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:32,060
So Elton Mayo was
mainly concerned

83
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,480
about social aspects.

84
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:41,490
Social aspects as in an
organisation which was

85
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,460
traditionally pretty much
structured in a fairly

86
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,989
hierarchical way.

87
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,700
He would say rather have a look
at the social aspects as

88
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,039
the groups, the people that
actually form that

89
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,010
organisation, and let's
focus on those.

90
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:01,670
He also emphasised
on communication.

91
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,120
And communication, not only
in terms of having good

92
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,380
communication flows within the
company, but he emphasised on

93
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,190
communication actually
in both ways.

94
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,760
Not only upward to downward,
but also from

95
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,840
bottom to the top.

96
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,080
So pretty much having that
consistent flow of

97
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,440
communication in both ways.

98
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:32,280
And the last, for me, fairly
straightforward principle that

99
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,909
he followed was that good
leaders or good human

100
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,370
relationship managers basically

101
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,140
need leadership skills.

102
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:48,060
And leadership skills, that will
be something we'll look

103
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,000
into a little bit later on.

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,060
But basically here just looking
into the ability of a

105
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,900
person, of a manager, to lead
the organisation, to motivate

106
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,289
staff, and come across as a
person that people actually

107
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,540
want to follow.

108
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,340
