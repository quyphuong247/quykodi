00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,770
In this module, I would
like to introduce

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,760
you to the GE matrix.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,160
The GE matrix was developed in
the 1970s, together with

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,470
McKinsey Consulting, which
is a famous consulting

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,619
company in the US.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,830
And together with General
Electrics, a massive

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,080
organisation--

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,810


10
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,759
in fact, General Electric is a
multinational conglomerate.

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,290
And because GE has so many
different strategic business

12
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,019
units-- just to give you a rough
idea on what they are

13
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,610
and I'm only going to mention
a couple of them--

14
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,440
they have their hands in energy,
they have a business

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,760
unit in computing, financial
services, health care,

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,800
insurance, electrics.

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,199
And again, just to mention
a few of them.

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,130
And basically, to have a better
overview on how each of

19
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,180
these business units is actually
performing, in the

20
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,080
1970s they collaborated
with McKinsey and came

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,399
up with the GE matrix.

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,400
Now let me illustrate what the
GE matrix actually looks like,

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,500
and you might find that it's
quite similar to the BCG

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,760
matrix that we've
covered earlier.

25
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,790
So similar to the BCG
matrix, we have two

26
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,380
axes there as well.

27
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,410
In the BCG matrix we had a
look at market growth and

28
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:34,179
market strength, whereas here
with GE matrix we're actually

29
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,980
looking at market attractiveness
and business

30
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,250
units strengths.

31
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,470
So business unit strength--

32
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,720
put that on top--

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,929


34
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:52,540
and market attractiveness
here to the left.

35
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,260


36
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:00,030
Now another the difference is
that you may realise now is,

37
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:06,800
actually, the GE matrix
consists of four--

38
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,930
not four quadrants, but
nine quadrants.

39
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,970
And we're going to distinguish
here in terms of business

40
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:18,600
strength whether it's high,
medium, or low, and the same

41
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,440
applies to market
attractiveness, so we can be

42
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,950
looking at high,
medium, or low.

43
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,089
Now you're probably wondering,
so, what's market

44
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,170
attractiveness and business
unit strength all about?

45
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,609
Market attractiveness is
basically looking into what's

46
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,850
the size of the market, the
overall size of the market.

47
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,910
Is it a big market or
a small market?

48
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,890
What's the market growth rate--
is it growing or is it

49
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,619
a declining market?

50
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,950
What is it in terms
of profitability--

51
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,089
are profit margins high or is
profitability relatively low?

52
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,700
How intense is competition?

53
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,530
Are there are a lot of
competitors out there or are

54
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,280
you operating in an environment
that is sort of

55
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,250
fairly protected and
you're the only one

56
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,820
operating in there?

57
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,920
Also, what's variability
in terms of demand?

58
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:18,079
Are there high fluctuations or
is demand fairly constant?

59
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,920
Then you can also look at PESTLE
factors-- so again,

60
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,670
looking at the political, the
economic, the social culture,

61
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,540
the technological, the
environment itself, and the

62
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,829
legal environment, and also
assess what kind of entry

63
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,440
barriers are there.

64
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,880
So you realise it's quite
comprehensive what we're

65
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,840
looking at in terms of market
attractiveness.

66
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,840
The same applies to competitive
strength of that

67
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,600
strategic business unit.

68
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,040
So here, looking into
financial strength--

69
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,380
does the organisation have a lot
of assets, access to cash?

70
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,170
Do they have a high brand
equity, which is always good

71
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:05,109
because with high brand equity
customers know your brand,

72
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,320
which is always an asset.

73
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,280
In terms of market share, is
there growth potential?

74
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,430
How are the profit margins
of that business unit?

75
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:22,150
Does that business unit have a
strong record of innovation in

76
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,030
technology, for example?

77
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,700
And are they managed by a very
strong management team?

78
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:35,130
So you start to realise the GE
matrix is a little bit more

79
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,740
comprehensive than the BCG
matrix that we dealt with

80
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,640
really earlier.

81
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,710
And what I'll do in
the next topic--

82
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,650
I'm going to illustrate how
to actually put strategic

83
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,489
business units into
the diagram.

84
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,642
