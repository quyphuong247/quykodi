2
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,660
In this topic, I would like to
introduce you to Porter's

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,350
Framework of Generic Business
Strategies.

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:19,300
Porter developed his framework
of generic business strategies

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,250
in the 1980s.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,610
It has influenced management
significantly.

7
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:29,380
And even some people refer to
it as the most influential

8
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,220
contribution to strategic
management,

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,320
pretty much in history.

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,760
It's not really an entirely
new concept.

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,129
But I guess Porter, he's been
the very first one to really

12
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:48,710
identify three alternatives that
businesses have in their

13
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,790
strategic decision making.

14
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:56,780
So let me just illustrate
Porter's Generic Business

15
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,030
Strategies, the three that
he came up with.

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,550
And Porter is claiming
businesses either need to

17
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:10,789
differentiate or obtain
cost leadership--

18
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,300
I'll abbreviate that with CL.

19
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,119
Or they need to have a focused
strategy, which pretty much

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,000
combines differentiation
and cost leadership.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,530
Now, there are organisations
who do that fairly well--

22
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,590
for example, Ikea, Toyota,
probably IBM, Caterpillar or

23
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,610
McDonald's.

24
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,420
But for the purpose of this
course and this topic, I would

25
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,360
like to focus only on
differentiation and cost

26
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,550
leadership.

27
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:49,100
So let's have a look at a cost
leadership strategy, and what

28
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,800
exactly does that mean
to a business.

29
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,860
Well, businesses that are
driving a cost leadership

30
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,630
strategy, they're trying
to be efficient in

31
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,619
what they're doing.

32
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,210
They're trying to be efficient
in the scale of their

33
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,479
facilities.

34
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,190
They're very focused
on cost reduction.

35
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,758
They are usually very
experienced in what they're

36
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:13,149
doing, and they can
leverage that.

37
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,750
They're very tight
on cost control.

38
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,740
They're trying to minimise costs
at all ends and reduce

39
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,560
or minimise costs in research
and development, customer

40
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,510
service, operations,
et cetera.

41
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:32,690
I think a really good example
for that would be the German

42
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,290
discount grocery
retailer Aldi.

43
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:41,380
Aldi is a German discount
grocery retailer that has

44
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,320
operations and is operating
in Europe and the

45
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,070
US, but also in Australia.

46
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:52,630
So the location where Aldi has
their stores is usually not in

47
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,710
areas where property's very
expensive, so it's more in the

48
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,850
outer suburbs of cities.

49
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:04,000
Also, the layout of the stores
is very generic and every

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,890
store pretty much
looks the same.

51
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,239
Aldi also only has 1,000
different products in their

52
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,160
portfolio that they're
selling to customers.

53
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,730
And that's very different to the
big supermarkets here in

54
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,299
Australia--

55
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,190
Cole's and Woolworth's, or in
the US it would be Walmart or

56
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,970
in the UK it would be Tesco.

57
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:29,850
These giant supermarkets have
actually 20,000 to 35,000

58
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,079
different products, probably
even more than that, and Aldi

59
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,490
only offers thousands.

60
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:39,010
And they're here focusing on
the high turnover products.

61
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:44,670
Aldi also only has about four
staff, average, per store.

62
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,109
All their staff is
cross-trained.

63
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,660
And if you compare that to
other supermarkets, they

64
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,549
actually have around 10
to 20 staff in store.

65
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,200
If you look even look at small
things at Aldi so, for

66
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,260
example, the air conditioning.

67
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,170
When you walk into an Aldi store
it's actually not on 16

68
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:08,839
degrees when it's 35 degrees
outside, it's moderate 20, 22,

69
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,200
24 degrees which saves energy.

70
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,890
They even switch the lights
off when there's enough

71
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,029
lighting from outside.

72
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:20,000
If you look at the freezer
section where the frozen goods

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,030
are, you realise that the
freezers actually have closed

74
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,700
doors, and that's again
to save energy.

75
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,870
Even the plants in their car
parks are plants that require

76
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,080
minimal maintenance and don't
need to be watered.

77
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,109
So I think you're starting to
see where Aldi is coming from,

78
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,900
and how they really drive this
cost leadership strategy

79
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,729
trying to be very efficient,
and trying to reduce costs.

80
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,700
Just a last thing to
cost leadership.

81
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:55,060
The underlying theme of cost
leadership is, in my point of

82
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,300
view, trying to leverage
economies of scale.

83
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,600
And that's a topic that we'll
address a little bit later on.

84
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,630
But let's now have a look at
differentiation and its

85
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,469
successful differentiation
strategy.

86
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:13,730
Porter identified that
businesses should either

87
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,610
differentiate through their
products, the features that

88
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,920
they're offering, the complexity
of the product, or

89
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,250
the location where the product
or service is being offered.

90
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,500
Or maybe it could be also the
timing of the introduction

91
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,180
into the market of
this new product.

92
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,900
Another strategy that we like
to differentiation would be

93
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:42,049
building sustainable or
long-lasting relationships, or

94
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,140
having a marketing strategy that
is targeting customers

95
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,960
and businesses individually.

96
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,219
So here having tailored product
marketed to certain

97
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,830
customers include differentiate
here with the

98
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,365
marketing strategy.

99
00:05:57,365 --> 00:06:00,890
I'll give you a few examples
around features.

100
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,990
Think in terms of a luxury
car, how that actually

101
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,780
compares to a mass-produced
car.

102
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:13,510
In terms of complexity, think of
an off-shelf software that

103
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:17,460
you're just installing on your
PC or on your server, compared

104
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,479
to tailored solutions that IT
companies are offering to

105
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,660
organisations.

106
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,160
Or think in terms of design.

107
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,590
Think about luxury or premium
fashion brands, and how that

108
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,679
actually compares to
ordinary clothing.

109
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,930
Or think in terms of location.

110
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:44,480
A hotel that has their premises
in the CBD, or close

111
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,240
to the airport, or right next to
the beach compared to other

112
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,300
hotels who are further
away from

113
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,290
these convenient locations.

114
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:59,110
I think to summarise, you
realise that a cost leadership

115
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,990
strategy is very much around
being efficient and trying to

116
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,890
save costs and trying to
leverage economies of scale.

117
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,190
A differentiation strategy
is maybe around

118
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,910
doing something different.

119
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,820
And in our next topic, when I
will introduce Porter's ROI

120
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:23,080
Gap to you, it will become very,
very clear to you why it

121
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,450
is so crucial for organisations
to either go

122
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,310
differentiation to differentiate
with their parts

123
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,050
and services, or to obtain
cost leadership.

124
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,017
