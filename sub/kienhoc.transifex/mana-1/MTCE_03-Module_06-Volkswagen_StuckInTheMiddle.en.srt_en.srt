2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,799
In our last topic, we discussed
Porter's ROI Gap.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,780
And eventually companies
who don't have a clear

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,600
differentiation or a cost
leadership strategy will get

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,270
stuck in the middle.

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:27,210
Now a good example to put that
into perspective would be

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,900
looking at a tennis player,
and some of you might even

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,930
play tennis.

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,960
So some players prefer to play
from the back of the field,

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,180
because it gives them the
advantage to see what their

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,210
competitor is doing and they
can react to that.

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,120
But then other players are
constantly on the front of the

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,089
net, and that gives them the
advantage that they can

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,540
basically surprise their
opponent and play the ball

15
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,170
very quickly and
win the match.

16
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,760
Whereas players who are playing
in the middle of the

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,110
tennis field, they don't have
the advantage of really seeing

18
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,429
what their opponent is doing as
if they were to play in the

19
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,580
back of the field.

20
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,679
Nor do they have the advantage
of being surprising to their

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,100
opponent in their actions
and where they're

22
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,660
going to hit the ball.

23
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,899
And in most occasions you'll
find that players that are

24
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,220
playing predominantly in the
middle of the field are

25
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,730
actually losing their match.

26
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:38,020
Now, I've promised you a company
that I see as somehow

27
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,320
somewhat being stuck
in the middle.

28
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,740
And I've identified Volkswagen
as an organisation that is

29
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,910
potentially somehow somewhat
stuck in the middle.

30
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:53,009
When we look at Volkswagen,
Volkswagen is a German

31
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,335
manufactured car.

32
00:01:54,335 --> 00:01:55,990
It's a good car.

33
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:00,789
But if we look at it closely,
we realise well, it's not

34
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,390
really a BMW.

35
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,990
It's not really an Audi or a
Mercedes, nor is it a Porsche.

36
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,880
But it's not a Toyota, either.

37
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,880
It's not a Mazda, it's
not a Hyundai.

38
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:23,120
It's a little bit cheaper
than Mercedes or BMW.

39
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,730
Nor is it as cheap as a
Toyota or the Hyundai.

40
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,310
And quality is very good and
it's solid manufacturing.

41
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,490
But somehow somewhat they're
stuck in the middle.

42
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:40,350
Now let me illustrate that
according to Porter's ROI Gap.

43
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:49,079
So on the one hand, we have BMW
and let's say Mercedes,

44
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,900
and clearly these are
the brands that are

45
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,830
differentiating.

46
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,820
They're premium cars,
luxury cars.

47
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,019
They are beautiful in their
design, they have high

48
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,690
performance engines.

49
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,990
On the other end, we have the
mass-produced cars which are,

50
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:15,260
for example, Toyota, maybe
Mazda, and we could also add

51
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,700
Hyundai to that.

52
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,450
So Volkswagen, again,
is somewhere

53
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:26,149
somewhat here in the middle.

54
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:34,620
And according to Porter,
they are somewhat

55
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,730
somehow in the ROI Gap.

56
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,829
Or in other terms, they're
stuck in the middle.

57
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:51,720


58
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,180
Now, let's have a closer look
at Volkswagen and what

59
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,200
Volkswagen has done.

60
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,489
Volkswagen, I'm pretty sure they
identified that almost 10

61
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:05,360
years ago or probably even a
little bit longer than that.

62
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,850
And they were starting to think,
so what can we do to

63
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:16,000
promote our brand a little bit
more and actually push it more

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,510
into the premium segment?

65
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,740
And Volkswagen introduced
the Phaeton.

66
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:28,030
The Phaeton is a very big car, a
luxury sedan actually, which

67
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,229
compares to a Mercedes S
Class or an Audi A8.

68
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,260
And it's a big luxurious
car, very

69
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,880
comfortable car, high quality.

70
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,290
And when they put it on the
market, it wasn't really

71
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,310
embraced by customers.

72
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,290
In fact, in 2005 Volkswagen
only sold 820

73
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,910
models in the US.

74
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:57,970
Over the period of 10 years,
they only sold 61,000 cars,

75
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,230
which is very, very little
if you consider that the

76
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,780
development costs for the whole
car were more than $900

77
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,280
million US.

78
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,330
So it was a seemingly
costly mistake that

79
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,580
Volkswagen made here.

80
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,780
When you look at the Phaeton,
it is and it

81
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,530
was a fantastic car.

82
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:25,419
And although they considered
getting out of the market and

83
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,320
basically getting rid
of that model, they

84
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,599
continued to build it.

85
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,120
And they continued to sell that
car, even if that meant a

86
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,650
financial loss to the
organisation.

87
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,679
The Phaeton is, again,
a great car.

88
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,340
It has great features, a
four-zone climate control,

89
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:51,359
automatic door closing,
driver adaptable

90
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,920
suspension, et cetera.

91
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,130
So things that you probably
won't even find in premium

92
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,110
luxury cars these days.

93
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:04,430
And the starting price was
$64,000 which is significantly

94
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,610
cheaper than their other
competitors such as BMW, Audi

95
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,530
and Mercedes.

96
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:15,090
So it would be very easy to say,
given the fact that they

97
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:19,299
invested $900 million into this
project, they only sold

98
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,270
61,000 cars, that this
was a big failure.

99
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,900
I don't believe so.

100
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,159
I believe it did a massive
favour to the brand of

101
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,290
Volkswagen.

102
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:33,300
Volkswagen, being the brand that
is neither a Mercedes or

103
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,840
a BMW, nor is it a Toyota
or a Mazda or a Hyundai.

104
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,000
All they were trying to do is
to actually lift their image

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,150
and their brand awareness, and
actually push it more into the

106
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,380
premium space.

107
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,210
So I could illustrate that in
terms of here pushing their

108
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:58,940
brand name more into the
direction where actually BMW

109
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,980
and Mercedes are standing
at the moment.

110
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,970
And I think in that respect
it might have cost the

111
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,080
organisation lots of money, and
financially it might have

112
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,030
been a loss.

113
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,289
However, they realised we were
stuck in the middle, we need

114
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,080
to lift our brand image.

115
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,640
And consequently we have to
introduce a luxury car just to

116
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:26,150
get that competitive edge and a
higher level of brand equity

117
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,919
so we are perceived as actually
a premium car

118
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,980
manufacturer.

119
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,660
And the Phaeton has exactly
delivered that.

120
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,573
