2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,560
So let's now focus on ethics
and also social

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,070
responsibility.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,160
Now before we start talking
about ethics, let's have a

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,810
quick think what are
actually ethics?

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,040
I think you're all come across
this term, but it's somewhat

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,810
somehow abstract.

8
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:32,530
I define ethics as basically a
set of mortals and values that

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,690
ultimately determine
right from wrong.

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,349
And the same applies
to business ethics.

11
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:46,350
So decisions that are being made
in an organisation being

12
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,440
the right decisions or
the wrong decisions.

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,410
Let me give you a few examples
around that.

14
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,849
Let's have, for example, a
look at discrimination.

15
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,240
You're discriminating in
terms of pay between

16
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,160
female and male workers.

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,268
Is that ethical?

18
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:09,230
Or illegal acts, for example,
lying about an expense claim

19
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,090
or forging signatures,
something like that.

20
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,450
So basically anything in an

21
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,000
organisation that is not right.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,700


23
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,020
Let's have a look at the
different factors that

24
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,550
influence ethical
decision making.

25
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:32,560
First of all, the intensity,
so basically how intense is

26
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,390
that decision that I've made.

27
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:40,650
And what are the long term
consequences that are coming

28
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,150
with this decision.

29
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,940
Just think about yourself.

30
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,750
Everyone's made a
wrong decision.

31
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,460
I'm not necessarily saying that
this was an unethical

32
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,130
decision, but think about
consequences.

33
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,369
Sometimes we've just made the
wrong decision because we

34
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,690
didn't think about
the consequences.

35
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,390
And the same applies
to businesses.

36
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,420
Consequences, whether they're
negative on the company, or on

37
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,220
the organisation, or whether
these consequences actually

38
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,240
have a positive impact
on the company.

39
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,930
And then also the social
consensus.

40
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:25,710
So here in terms of what does
the public, the social public,

41
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:30,500
people in general, what do they
actually think about this

42
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,600
kind of decision.

43
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,489
The principles behind ethical
decision making could be

44
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:42,780
determined by long-term self
interest, So ethical decision

45
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:49,020
making usually looks into
long-term decision making that

46
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,480
is sustainable and basically
the right thing to do.

47
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,239
Also it depends on
personal virtues.

48
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,970
So here basically not doing
anything that is not honest or

49
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,690
not trustful.

50
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,560
But also in terms of government
regulation.

51
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,710
So here the government coming in
as a regulator determining

52
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:14,980
ultimately with guidelines,
with rules, and frameworks

53
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,459
what's ultimately right and
what's wrong, what's ethical,

54
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,450
what's unethical.

55
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,720
Now let's have a look at
social responsibility.

56
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,320
Social responsibility, how I
would describe it is basically

57
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,940
organisations in terms of how
they give back to the society.

58
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,800
Or in other words, how a
organisation is actually a

59
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,060
good corporate citizen.

60
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,430
A good corporate citizen,
obviously, wouldn't do the

61
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:48,200
wrong things, wouldn't try to
provide services or products

62
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,049
that are harming the
public and their

63
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,370
customers in the long run.

64
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,210
Let me give you an example for
that together with government

65
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,110
regulations.

66
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,740
So for example, the fishery
industry, as much as I'm aware

67
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,760
of, most fishing industries
across the globe will have

68
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,829
regulations from their
governments in their

69
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,840
respective countries in
terms of the meshing.

70
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,000
So basically, the nets and
the meshing that is

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,089
within those nets.

72
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:23,240
And what the size actually
should be to

73
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,420
protect certain species.

74
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:30,720
And some organisations in the
fishing industry, some

75
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,930
fisheries, will actually have
a meshing that is bigger and

76
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,310
wider than what is actually
required by the government.

77
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:47,590
And here contributing in terms
of sustainable fishing for

78
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,940
guaranteeing that fishes
basically will be in the ocean

79
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,000
in the long run.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,710
And they're not only complying
with the guidelines stipulated

81
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,960
by the government.

82
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,162
