00:00:08,092 --> 00:00:11,930
In this topic I would like to
introduce you to the term

3
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,820
sustainable competitive
advantage, and what a

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,800
sustainable competitive
advantage is.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,960
Now, before we do that, let's
have a look at what is

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,750
actually a Competitive
Advantage, or CA as I've

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,670
abbreviated.

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,450
A competitive advantage--

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,130
I think a good example for that
would be, let's have a

10
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,150
look at the car manufacturing
industry.

11
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:44,140
In the '80s and the '90s, German
car manufacturers had

12
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,140
pretty much a competitive
advantage, or I would say they

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,660
were leaders in technology.

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,250
German premium manufactured cars
had lots of features that

15
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,690
didn't come in normal cars.

16
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,160
If you look at the car industry
these days, we'll

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,768
find that pretty much all the
features that you find in a

18
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,350
premium car are also available
in pretty much

19
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,919
mass-produced cars.

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,580
So in that respect, I think that
the German premium car

21
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,400
manufacturers have in somewhat
some respect lost their

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,330
competitive advantage when
it comes to technology.

23
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,570
Another good example of
competitive advantage through

24
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,029
innovation would be 3M.

25
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,400
3M developed the Post-it note.

26
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,280
And the Post-it note was
developed actually by accident

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,640
by one of their employees.

28
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,450
One of their employees actually
tried to design a

29
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,920
super glue.

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,190
And what he designed was
a glue that didn't

31
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,730
really stick properly--

32
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:52,100
it was easy to peel off when
you put in on notes.

33
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:59,130
And he decided just to use it as
a tool, as a mechanism, as

34
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,160
a product to basically post
notes on his work desk.

35
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,990
And management picked
up on that, and the

36
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,329
Post-it note was born.

37
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,170
The Post-it note is still
very popular.

38
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,480
It has been replicated by
competitors, but it's still

39
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,090
the most popular Post-it note
as we know it today.

40
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,090
Competitive advantages
are usually built

41
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,520
on Key Success Factors.

42
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,310
So let me put that down
as KSF, abbreviated.

43
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:39,140
And key success factors can be
related to staff, so here the

44
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,779
human resources department of an
organisation can be related

45
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,980
to research and development
of an organisation.

46
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,320
So in that respect, being very
innovative could relate to

47
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,630
design, or it could also
relate to operations.

48
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,340
And I think we had a really good
example here when I was

49
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,760
talking about Aldi, and how
efficient this German discount

50
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,030
grocery retailer is in
their operations.

51
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,030
Another term that I would like
to introduce to you is the

52
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,640
USP, a Unique Selling
Proposition.

53
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,279
A unique selling proposition
is something that sets your

54
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,250
business apart from
the competition.

55
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,800
It's something you do
different and you're

56
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,730
substantially better than
the competition.

57
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,829
Now, how does that all come
together when I just promised

58
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,890
you earlier that I'm going
to explain a Sustainable

59
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:44,123
Competitive Advantage to you--
or in other terms, an SCA?

60
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:50,519
Look, an SCA is pretty much
based on key success factors

61
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,620
and potentially on USP's
unique selling

62
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,010
propositions as well.

63
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,660
A sustainable competitive
advantage is an advantage that

64
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,570
an organisation has that is
very, very difficult for the

65
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,260
competition to replicate
or to imitate.

66
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,690
It will take the competition
a long time to do so, so

67
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,769
generally speaking we're saying
that a sustainable

68
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,769
competitive advantage will last
for about three, maybe

69
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:21,890
five years.

70
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,099
But we'll have more good
examples around sustainable

71
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,850
competitive advantages
in our next topic.

72
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,720
