2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,170
Now I want to move
on to Tuckman's

3
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,780
Group Development Model.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,770
It's a very useful model that
goes through different stages

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,020
and exemplifies what is the
process that groups are

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,380
actually going through.

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,530
Now Bruce Tuckman, he was a
researcher, and he researched

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:32,049
basically the theories of group
dynamics in 1965 and

9
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:37,150
that's where he came up with
this model Tuckman's stages in

10
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,660
the group development.

11
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,929
And it's basically the process
that groups or

12
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,810
teams are going through.

13
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:49,140
Now, different stages include
how teams grow.

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,810
How they face challenges.

15
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,970
How they take on problems,
actually find solutions to

16
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:00,100
these problems, and in the
end also achieve results.

17
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,769
So the different stages that
Bruce Tuckman came up with are

18
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:05,550
as follows.

19
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,320
The first stage is the
forming stage.

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,990


21
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,979
During the forming stage, group
members need to get to

22
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,140
know each other first.

23
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,880
Nobody knows each
other, right?

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,170
So the group members are
just new to each other.

25
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,070
Obviously they need to be
introduced to each other.

26
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:31,270
And quite naturally, people
try to avoid conflict.

27
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,920
Stress levels are usually a
little bit high, and team

28
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,810
members usually work
more independently

29
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,210
rather than in a group.

30
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:45,050
And there's also a requirement
for the team leader to control

31
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,060
the group here.

32
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,240
Now, the second stage is
the storming stage.

33
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,250


34
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:02,780
During this storming stage, as
its name already indicates,

35
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:08,300
the team is going through
a stormy, rough phase.

36
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:14,300
Usually issues are addressed
here, conflict emerges, a

37
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:21,120
clear leadership model is
started to be developed.

38
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,300
It's important that group
members don't

39
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,070
stay in that stage.

40
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:30,170
Some groups stay in that
storming stage, and they never

41
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,670
go beyond that.

42
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:37,880
And also impatience is a
contributing factor to that--

43
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,720
that's where groups
basically fail.

44
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,290
Now, if groups can overcome
that, they eventually move

45
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,965
into the third stage which
is the norming stage.

46
00:02:47,965 --> 00:02:50,710


47
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:55,810
During the norming stage, group
members have agreed on a

48
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,870
common goal that they
want to achieve.

49
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,910
They give up their own ideas.

50
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,820
They realise, hey, we're
together now in a team, we're

51
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,140
doing this together.

52
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:11,690
They collaborate, criticism is
constructive amongst team

53
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,720
members, and a clear hierarchy
has been established.

54
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,200
And everyone pretty much knows
what they're doing now.

55
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,690
So once groups reach that
stage, they now have the

56
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,079
potential to move into the
fourth stage according to

57
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,820
Tuckman, and that's a
performing stage.

58
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:41,299
In the performing stage, group
members or productivity of the

59
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:46,152
group is much, much higher than
in all the other stages.

60
00:03:46,152 --> 00:03:49,959
The team is now very effective,
very efficient.

61
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,690
They're working together to
get that goal that they've

62
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,480
defined earlier accomplished.

63
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,890
According to Tuckman, there is
no conflict in the group now.

64
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,950
And even if team members are
changing the transition

65
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:12,339
process, the exchange of team
members is quite smooth and

66
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,180
work is usually delegated
amongst group members.

67
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,950
So here we are looking into a
high performance team that

68
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:24,630
really gets work done.

69
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,969
The last stage that Bruce
Tuckman came up with, and that

70
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:33,100
was a little bit later after
1965 when he identified the

71
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,300
four stages here, forming,
storming, norming and

72
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,090
performing, he added one stage
which is the fifth one, and

73
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,469
it's called adjourning.

74
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:50,530
So during the adjourning stage,
pretty much the project

75
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,250
has been completed.

76
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,430
The team has reached their goal
and the team is now ready

77
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:02,900
to break up to identify new
goals and start over new.

78
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,549
And especially when the team
dissolves, that is a difficult

79
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,470
process for some team
members which should

80
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,120
be managed as well.

81
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:20,720
So criticism around Tuckman's
Group Development Model would

82
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,300
be that actually in the
performing stage, in the

83
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,520
fourth stage, there
is still conflict.

84
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,440
But usually there is negative
connotations with conflict.

85
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,920
I have a different
approach to that.

86
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,090
I believe conflict is actually
a good thing.

87
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,640
But it's only a good thing if
you work on it, you don't

88
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,610
leave it alone, that you're
trying to overcome it.

89
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,110
And according to Tuckman,
apparently

90
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,010
conflict is not happening.

91
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,280
I see that very much in
performing teams though, and I

92
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,630
think overall it is
a good thing.

93
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:00,480
So I guess to summarise,
Tuckman's model is giving you

94
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:07,530
a really good idea on what
stage you're at in the

95
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,229
development of groups.

96
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,770
And consequently, you do
understand what needs to be

97
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:17,510
done to make a team that is not
performing at this stage

98
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,550
to become a high performing
team.

99
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,803
