HALDOR AAMOT: In our a previous
topic, we talked

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,850
about planning and
goal setting.

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,969
Now we talked a lot
about goals.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,360
What I would like to introduce
to you is a framework that

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,090
ensures that you're actually
setting smart goals.

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,509
And when I say &quot;smart&quot;, I mean
specific, measurable,

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:31,450
achievable, relevant, and also
timely, or time oriented.

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:36,910
So let me quickly put that
down as &quot;smart.&quot; So goals

10
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,419
always need to be smart.

11
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:47,480
When I say specific, I basically
mean you need to

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,430
have a goal for something.

13
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:49,920
OK.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,290
So if you are, for example,
saying, I want to be promoted

15
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:59,769
at work, that is OK, but it's
not really specific.

16
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,800
So you should say, I want to be
promoted into the position

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,509
as project manager.

18
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,890
So now you've identified a
specific job role that

19
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,640
you're going for.

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,413
The next one would
be measurable.

21
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:15,899


22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,340
Make sure that the goals that
you're setting are somewhat,

23
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,050
somehow quantified.

24
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:27,670
So a lot of people, especially
after a new year, they have

25
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,500
the goal to lose weight.

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,320
And that's an ambitious and that
is a great goal, but it's

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,699
not specific.

28
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,980
So if you want to be on track
with your goals, and you want

29
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:43,100
to succeed, it's important that
you make them measurable.

30
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,190
And here, just by saying, losing
weight, that's not

31
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,970
measurable.

32
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,820
So what I would suggest is you
set yourself a goal of losing

33
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,419
five kilogrammes.

34
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,100
Now you've specified it.

35
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,339
And now you can basically tell
when you actually reach that

36
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,530
goal, when you have lost
five kilogrammes.

37
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,020
OK.

38
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,860
Goals should be, also,
achievable.

39
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,060


40
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,900
And when I say achievable, just
think about your work.

41
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,120
Think about the manager
that you have.

42
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,530
How would you feel if your
manage approaches you and

43
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,970
gives you tasks, on a daily
basis, or gives you big

44
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,910
projects that you can't
really achieve.

45
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,620
You're just overwhelmed.

46
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,680
So what you need to make sure
is that your goals are

47
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,440
achievable.

48
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,310
So for example, losing five
kilogrammes of weight, I would

49
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,210
say that's probably achievable
for most people.

50
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:43,980
However, losing 25 or 30 kilos
is probably setting the bar a

51
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,420
little bit too high.

52
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,718
Goals should be,
also, relevant.

53
00:02:48,718 --> 00:02:51,646


54
00:02:51,646 --> 00:02:55,429
Relevant in terms of, well,
is it actually really

55
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,950
worthwhile doing it.

56
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,760
Does that really apply to what
I want to do, what I'm trying

57
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,579
to achieve.

58
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,250
So again, try to make sure that
your goals are relevant.

59
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:14,060
And the last one, that your
goals should be timely, or

60
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,340
time framed.

61
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,320
And here, make sure you
put a date on it.

62
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,040
A lot of goals are sort of
identified with, I want to

63
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,260
achieve x, y, z in the next
six months, or 12 months,

64
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,030
which is good and, I
guess, fair enough.

65
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,260
But I want to push
it a bit further.

66
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,320
I would say set a clear date.

67
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,709
So set a date, for example, on
the 31st of July, I want to

68
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,420
have achieved x, y, z.

69
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,790
So here, you've got
a clear date.

70
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,190
And when you look back you don't
need to identify, well,

71
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,920
did I set this goal three,
or six months ago.

72
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,700
Or was it actually
seven months ago?

73
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,390
So it just insures that
you are really on

74
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,839
track with your goals.

75
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,680
So to summarise, we've
identified that

76
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,810
goals have to be smart.

77
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,200
So make sure that your goals
are specific, they're

78
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,810
measurable, they are achievable [or attainable],
they're relevant [or realistic],

79
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,610
and they're time framed,
or timely.

80
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:17,485
