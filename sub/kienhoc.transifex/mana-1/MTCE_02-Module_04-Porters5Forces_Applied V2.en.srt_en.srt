3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,520
In our previous topic, I've
given you an overview of

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,570
Porter's five forces.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,810
What I would like to do now is,
actually, apply Porter's

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,470
five forces, just how
we did it, when we

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,380
did the PESTLE analysis.

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,945
And so you get a really good
idea of how these two tools

9
00:00:25,945 --> 00:00:29,080
are actually coming together,
I'm also going to do that on

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,740
the airline industry.

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,120
So let's have a look at
the industry rivalry.

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,870
And if you look at the airline
industry, there are lots of

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,610
airlines across the globe.

14
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,450
So it's a highly competitive
environment.

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,170
I think, today, we can
distinguish between

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:50,630
traditional airlines but also
low-frill airlines that are a

17
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,680
growing market and are
continuing to grow.

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,730
Have a look at Southwest
Airlines, Ryanair in Europe,

19
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,092
or Virgin Australia,
here in Australia.

20
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:06,940
The airline market is a highly
transparent market--

21
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,259
I mentioned that before--
so customers can

22
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,310
easily compare prices.

23
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,370
And it is, consequently,
very competitive.

24
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,580
If we look at it in Asia, we'll
find it's a bit less

25
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,149
competitive than in the US,
Australia, and Europe, but

26
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,790
competition is growing
fast there.

27
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,590
Now that we've covered the
industry rivalry, let's have a

28
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,380
look at the threat
of new entrance.

29
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,890
Threat of new entrance in the
airline industry is, I would

30
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,440
say, moderate.

31
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,240
It's a highly regulated
environment.

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,729
There is a huge financial
outlay, especially if you're

33
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,820
starting a new airline.

34
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,759
And it involves high risk.

35
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,870
And the failure rate is very
high in that industry.

36
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,540
So consequently, it's actually
not that much of

37
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,290
an attractive industry.

38
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,250
However, the competition is
still increasing and more and

39
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,250
more airlines are expanding and
splitting their operations

40
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,910
from traditional airlines
to low-frill airlines

41
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,329
A quick example here, Quantas
has also Jetstar under their

42
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,550
umbrella, which is a low-frill
airline, which is under the

43
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,770
Quantas group.

44
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,570
If we have a look
at substitutes--

45
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,670
let's have a look
at them now--

46
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,600
what's a substitute for
an airplane flight?

47
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,530
Well, we discussed maybe
a Skype call.

48
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:39,280
But also think in terms of you
can just catch a train.

49
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,420
You can take the car.

50
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,970
Or you can go on a cruise.

51
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,010
However, consumers, these days,
are very convenient and

52
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,769
they appreciate the convenience
that comes with a

53
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,610
flight really getting,
quickly, from a to b.

54
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,270
So, for example, me travelling
from Sydney to Melbourne, that

55
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,930
would be prohibitive
time-wise.

56
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,520
It would take me 10, 11, maybe
12 hours on the car.

57
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,450
It's 1,000 kilometres.

58
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,130
On a plane, that's
just one hour.

59
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,310


60
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:15,430
Now that we had a look at the
threat of substitutes, I would

61
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,580
like to have a look at the
bargaining power of suppliers.

62
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,970
So let's have a look at those.

63
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,890
When it comes to fuel, and all
airlines need fuel, I think

64
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,109
there's very little bargaining
power that airlines have over

65
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,090
the fuel, petrol industry.

66
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:40,170
However, a good example would
be Ryanair, who negotiated

67
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:45,480
incredibly low prices over
Boeing, just after 9/11, when

68
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,890
the airline industry was
pretty much down.

69
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,100
Ryanair also negotiated very
good prices and played off

70
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,000
regional airports in Europe
to get the best deal.

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,840
However, if you want to get a
slot at Heathrow Airport,

72
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,970
obviously, that is more
expensive and highly

73
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,840
competitive.

74
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,550
Now let's have a look at the
bargaining power of customers.

75
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,300
And well, we mentioned
that before.

76
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,700
It's fairly high.

77
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,349
The internet is providing
customers with great

78
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:23,390
transparency around prices and
also customer service.

79
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:27,280
Etihad and Emirates, when they
started offering flights from

80
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,289
Australia to Europe, prices
have actually come down in

81
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,580
Australia for flights
to these areas.

82
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,030
If you look at peak season, the
Christmas time, usually

83
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,760
prices are fairly high.

84
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,039
And the same applies to
Fridays, in the late

85
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,250
afternoon, and Sunday evening,
when pretty much everyone

86
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,200
wants to fly back home.

87
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,000
Now that we've applied Porter's
five forces to the

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,430
airline industry, I think
you've gained a good

89
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,780
understanding on how the
micro-environment is really

90
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,679
impacting on business.
