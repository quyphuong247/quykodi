00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,130
In this topic, I would like to
introduce you to John Stacey

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:17,940
Adams Equity Theory that
he developed in 1963.

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,910
Adams pretty much identified
that workers in an

5
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:27,090
organisation are actually
adapting their inputs to the

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,330
outputs, or basically what
they're getting.

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,400
And workers are basically
motivated by fair treatment.

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,280
So let me give you
an example here.

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,740
If you are paying a worker below
what they think they

10
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:49,270
bring into the organisation,
they will consequently adapt

11
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,260
their outputs, or their
productivity.

12
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,265
An example for that would be a
worker in an organisation who

13
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:01,620
is supposed to produce
800 units per day.

14
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,470
This worker can probably easily
manage to produce 1,000

15
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,720
units per day.

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,140
But because this worker is only
being paid to produce 800

17
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,790
units per day, this worker will
feel like, well, if I

18
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,750
produce more than 800, and
I don't get paid for

19
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,646
it, why should I?

20
00:01:20,646 --> 00:01:24,770
So, consequently, Adams
identified that a bonus

21
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,170
structure, or an incentive
structure, will help to lift

22
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,460
motivation of staff
and also increase

23
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,149
productivity with that.

24
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,760
So when he put an incentive
structure in place for these

25
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,070
workers, workers were now
incentivised to produce more

26
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,250
than 800 units per day.

27
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,770
And every additional unit that
they were producing, they got

28
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,000
additional pay for that.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,820
Now, this kind of theory, Equity
Theory, doesn't only

30
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,360
apply to normal workers.

31
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,650
We could also look here
at very highly

32
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,740
paid executive managers.

33
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:12,230
So, for example, a CEO of
Japan Airlines, Haruka

34
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:18,000
Nishimatsu, he had to cut
wages of his employees.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,170
And he also had to force workers
into early retirement.

36
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:28,350
Haruka Nishimatsu felt like
he had to give back to the

37
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,930
organisation and, consequently,
cut

38
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,660
his own pay as well.

39
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,660
And despite the fact that he's
a, well, very prominent CEO of

40
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:43,000
a famous Japanese airline, his
pay is actually lower than the

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,120
pay off his pilots.

42
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,640
So output doesn't necessarily
refer to money.

43
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,119
We talked quite a bit about
financial incentives, but it

44
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,980
also refers to recognition,
praising staff, giving them a

45
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,970
sense of achievement, or passing
on responsibilities.

46
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,618
