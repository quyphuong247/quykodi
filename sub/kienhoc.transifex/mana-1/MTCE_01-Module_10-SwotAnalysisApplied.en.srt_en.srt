2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,770
In our last topic, we discussed
a SWOT analysis.

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,209
And we had a look at strength,
weaknesses,

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,120
opportunities, and threats.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,320
What we're going to do in this
module is actually apply a

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,980
SWOT analysis to a small
online retailer.

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,460
And this will greatly help you
to complete your final

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,550
assignment.

9
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,870
So let's have a look
at some strength

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,750
of an online retailer.

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,090
So the first strength
that comes into my

12
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,245
mind would be overheads.

13
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:40,019


14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,940
Overheads of a online retailer
are fairly low because they're

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,440
operating a website.

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,809
Consequently, they don't
have a store.

17
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,640
They don't have front
line stuff.

18
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,530
Pretty much everything
operations is

19
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,200
happening in the back room.

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,060
So overheads would
be fairly low.

21
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,740
Other strength that I would
identify is because it is a

22
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,489
small business they are
very adaptable.

23
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,960
They can change very quickly.

24
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,820
And there are no lengthy
management

25
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,570
processes in this business.

26
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,759
So they're very, let me
put down as quick.

27
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,830
They're also very strongly
customer focused.

28
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,830
They know what's going on.

29
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,620
They have a great web developer
in their team who

30
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,060
knows, obviously, what
he or she is doing.

31
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,080
And they've got strong search
engine optimisation.

32
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,090
Now what about weaknesses?

33
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,200
Well, because it is such
a small business they

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,080
have very few staff.

35
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,870
And consequently, if one of the
staff members becomes sick

36
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,900
or somebody is leaving the
business that would be a

37
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,390
problem quite clearly.

38
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:55,050
So I'll just put that
down as staff.

39
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:59,860
Also in terms of financial
resources--

40
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,050
I'll just put that down
as a dollar figure--

41
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,640
financial resources might
be restricted.

42
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,790
It is a start up businesses.

43
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,610
They probably don't
have deep pockets.

44
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,580
And consequently, that business
might look into cash

45
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,780
flow constraints.

46
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,760
And on top of that, they also
have very little market

47
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,060
presence at the moment.

48
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,610
So they need to build that
to become basically

49
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,640
stronger with that.

50
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,529
Let's have a look at some
of the opportunities.

51
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,170
I think a clear opportunity for
that online retailer would

52
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:36,119
be online sales are growing
every year.

53
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,340
In fact, from the research that
I've done, it's growing

54
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,830
by about 20% every year.

55
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,820
And that's an environment you
want to operate in, an

56
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,780
industry that is actually
growing.

57
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,010
So strong growth.

58
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,880


59
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,260
What else?

60
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,269
I would also say the economy.

61
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:05,400
And the economy has been fairly
slow in recent years.

62
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,510
And the economy is operating
in cycles.

63
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,899
And consequently, I believe we
are not far away from breaking

64
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,230
the cycle again.

65
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,470
And there will be great
opportunities coming up, not

66
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,500
only in online retailing,
but across industries.

67
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,560
So I think we just hit rock
bottom and the economy is

68
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,050
starting to recover.

69
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,720
So there will be an opportunity
in the future to

70
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,780
grow that business with
economic growth.

71
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,190
Another opportunity that I've
identified is their

72
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,470
competition is probably fairly
slow to adopt to changes.

73
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:46,980
So that is an opportunity to
come in with a quick approach.

74
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,220
And also new technologies
emerging on a constant basis,

75
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,359
which is an opportunity for
the business as well.

76
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,010
Let's have a look at some
of the threats.

77
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,200
If I think about it
strategically, I'm thinking,

78
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,500
well, it's a small online
retailer, what about a larger

79
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,170
competitor who is not offering
the products that this online

80
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:16,899
retailer is offering
in the future.

81
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:21,040
So that would mean that they
have to compete with a large

82
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,060
competitor.

83
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,385
So what I'll do is I'll just
put it down as competition.

84
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:29,590


85
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,310
Also, government regulations
are changing.

86
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,240
And online sales are subject
to a few regulations.

87
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,460
I'm not going to go into that.

88
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,450
But changes here could make it
more difficult for a small

89
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,110
online retailer as well.

90
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,950
Technology might change to an
extent that it becomes very

91
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,680
difficult for the small online
retailer to adapt to these new

92
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,840
technologies.

93
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,869
And consequently, that
poses a threat.

94
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,260
OK, I think you got an idea what
we're doing here with a

95
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,980
SWOT analysis.

96
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,820
I'm proud of you.

97
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,480
You've got very far.

98
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,280
You've finished, pretty much,
module one once you've

99
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,700
finalised your final
assessment.

100
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,190
And I'll see you in
the next week.

101
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,817
