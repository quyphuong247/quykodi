3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,655
Welcome everyone.

4
00:00:09,655 --> 00:00:13,440
What I would like to do in this
topic is introduce you to

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,640
the BCG Matrix, developed by
Bruce Henderson in 1970, when

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,320
he was working for the Boston
Consulting Group.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,960
It's a very useful tool if you
want to allocate financial

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,350
resources, operational costs,
or marketing resources to a

9
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,520
business unit, within
the organisation.

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,120
The underlying theme or
understanding should be that

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,339
products or services are going
through a product life cycle.

12
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,520
In brief, they go through
rapid growth.

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,920
They're very profitable.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,430
And then, eventually,
they decline.

15
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,310
Now how the BCG Matrix is
actually illustrated is

16
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58,960
through a scatter diagram, which
has an x and a y-axis,

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,780
which I will illustrate here.

18
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:09,020
And these axes have a variable
allocated to it, in terms of

19
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:19,289
market share and also market
growth, which I will just

20
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,165
illustrate here as growth.

21
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:25,080


22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:31,120
Now there are four quadrants
that we're going to look at.

23
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,220
And obviously, we need to
indicate whether their market

24
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,860
or market growth
is low or high.

25
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,565
So we'll do that, low or high.

26
00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:46,870


27
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,800
Let's kick off with the quadrant
that we find in the

28
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,080
upper right.

29
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,800
And here that would be
identified with a high market

30
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,970
share and a high growth rate.

31
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,220
And we'll call it a star.

32
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,530
Let me illustrate that
with a star.

33
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:12,550
Now stars are basically products
or services that have

34
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,730
a high growth and a
high market share.

35
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,929
And a good example
for that would be

36
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,980
the iPad or the iPhone.

37
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,209
So they need to be
heavily invested.

38
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,940
So I say invest into those.

39
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:30,130
And if we invest into those, we
can potentially turn them

40
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,079
into a cash cow, which I'm going
to illustrate here with

41
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,950
a dollar sign, lots of
money to be made.

42
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,600
And, obviously, these kinds of
products or services, with a

43
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,590
high market share but relatively
low growth, are the

44
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:50,640
ones that we want to
milk, so milk them.

45
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,920
If we look at the top, left-hand
corner, basically

46
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,700
here are products and services
that have a relatively high

47
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,130
growth rate and a low
market share.

48
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,890
We would probably have
a look here at

49
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,140
companies like Instagram.

50
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,450


51
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,700
And we sort of symbolise that
with a question mark.

52
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,700
We're not too sure what
to do with them.

53
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,570
They're not really generating
profit at this stage.

54
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,790
So we need to decide whether we
going to invest into them.

55
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,670
We push them into the right-hand
side, so they

56
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:33,019
become a star and, hopefully,
consequently, a cash cow.

57
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,370
But we really need to be very
selective about them.

58
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,850
So I would say we have to
be selective, so select.

59
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,359
Now one area, one quadrant
is still missing, and

60
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,710
that's out poor dog.

61
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,200
I'll just illustrate
that here as a dog.

62
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,790
And, basically, the dogs are the
products or services that

63
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,570
you want to liquidate, because,
obviously, market

64
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,790
share is low, growth is very
limited, it's low as well, so

65
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,900
you either liquidate them
or you sell them off.

66
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,140
So you've seen the
BCG Matrix.

67
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,989
It's a very useful tool to give
a business an overview on

68
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,100
where their products and
services are sitting at this

69
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,570
stage, and, consequently, it
enables them to develop

70
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,969
strategies to either invest to
them, select them, milk them,

71
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,220
or liquidate them.

72
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,048
