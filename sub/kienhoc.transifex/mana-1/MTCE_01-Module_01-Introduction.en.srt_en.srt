00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:09,280
Welcome.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,340
My name is Hal, and I'm very
excited to introduce you to my

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,870
subject, management tools
for a competitive edge.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,610
A little bit about myself.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,320
I've worked in project
management, marketing, human

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,540
resources, but also in learning
and development, and

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,549
I have founded a few startup
businesses in the past.

9
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,420
Currently, besides my lecturing
activities, I'm

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,190
running my own consulting
business, and I'm offering

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,690
here learning and development
services, but also management

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,000
consulting to a variety
of industries.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,490
I've just recently completed my
MBA with Macquarie Graduate

14
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,010
School of Management, and I'm
very excited to introduce you,

15
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,460
first of all, to management.

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,470
In the second week, we talk
about management tools, then

17
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,900
about strategy, and we'll finish
off in week four with

18
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,160
leading and leadership.

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,580
I look very much forward to
working with you, and I hope

20
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,429
you're just as excited as I am.

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,937
