00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,250
Michael Porter, a professor at
Harvard University, also

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:18,210
identified the ROI gap that
comes with his model of

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,280
generic business strategies.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,650
So Porter identified here that,
if organisations don't

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,290
clearly distinguish between
having a differentiation

7
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:35,180
strategy or a cost leadership
strategy, they will eventually

8
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,770
get stuck in the middle.

9
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:43,040
Now let me exemplify that
here on my iPad.

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,660
So here we've got two axes.

11
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,260
One axis is around return
on investment.

12
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,660
The other axis is concerned
about product

13
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,550
volume or market share.

14
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,500
I just abbreviate
that with MS.

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:08,490
And here he identified ROI
is high if you either

16
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,530
differentiate--

17
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,470
so again, I abbreviate
that with diff.--

18
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:19,070
or you're trying to obtain
cost leadership here,

19
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,320
abbreviated with CL.

20
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,869


21
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:29,380
Now according to Porter, if
you're doing a little bit of

22
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,970
both, you're getting stuck in
the ROI gap, which I have

23
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,929
illustrated here.

24
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,160
And this is somewhere
in the middle.

25
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:47,539
And it distorts the success
of an organisation.

26
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,210
So organisations who have
a clear strategy, either

27
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,339
differentiation or cost
leadership, will have a above

28
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,800
average returns.

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,619
Now, let me put that a little
bit more into perspective.

30
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:07,786
Think in terms of a luxury car
versus a mass produced car.

31
00:02:07,786 --> 00:02:10,840
You start to realise
manufacturing a luxury car,

32
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,510
with the nice design, all the
features, the great customer

33
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,870
service, and also the
dealership, which is most

34
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,310
likely in a premium location,
and it looks very nice, lots

35
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,160
of glass there, lots of nice
cars exhibited, in a very nice

36
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,010
way, with professional
staff, that

37
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,859
obviously comes at a price.

38
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,610
So usually you'll find that
differentiation has a higher

39
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,120
price, in terms of the products
that they are

40
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,980
offering, than cost
leadership.

41
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,859
Also think in terms of what is
actually being delivered or

42
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,480
what you're getting.

43
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,709
And think about going to
McDonald's compared to go to

44
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,070
luxury restaurant that
has a Michelin star.

45
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,450
I guess the experience here
is very different and,

46
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,140
consequently, it costs a
different amount of money to

47
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,089
go either of them.

48
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,110
So let me just exemplify
that again.

49
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,820
So Porter here clearly
identified businesses should

50
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,530
either pursue a differentiation
strategy or a

51
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,490
cost leadership strategy.

52
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:25,380
And anything else will
eventually get them stuck in

53
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,250
the middle.

54
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,310
They will have below average
returns and, consequently, not

55
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,500
succeed in what they're doing.

56
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,470
Now in our next topic, I will
give you a good example of an

57
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,120
organisation where I believe
that they're

58
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,340
stuck in the middle.
