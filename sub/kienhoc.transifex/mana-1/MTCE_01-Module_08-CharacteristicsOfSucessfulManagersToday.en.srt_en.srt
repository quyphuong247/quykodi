2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,420
So let's have a look at
what characterises

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,440
a successful manager.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,259
And if you just have a brief
research on the internet,

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:23,730
you'll find that there are
lots of articles that are

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,000
concerned around identifying
characteristics of a

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,150
successful manager today.

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,010
What I would like you to do is
basically just quickly pause

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,680
that video and go down into the
forum and try to start a

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:47,769
discussion, or try to answer, or
give recommendations to the

11
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,410
other participants in that
course what you actually think

12
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,370
determines a successful
manager today.

13
00:00:54,370 --> 00:01:01,360


14
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,260
So rather than running through
a whole list of

15
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,480
characteristics that identify
a successful manager today

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,270
from one to 10, what I would
like to do is have a look at

17
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,960
Peter Drucker.

18
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,139
Peter Drucker, who is unarguably
one of the most

19
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,460
influential management gurus
in the past 30, 40 years.

20
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,720
He developed the theory of
management by objectives.

21
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,780
Management by objectives
basically means that managers

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,190
should manage their staff in
terms of giving them goals

23
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:43,179
rather than telling them how
exactly to achieve that goal.

24
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,730
So management by objectives is
basically setting this goal

25
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:51,670
there, telling an employee what
you expect them to do, or

26
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:56,130
a manager tells their
subordinates goals that they

27
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,259
should achieve.

28
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:01,020
And then basically letting
a worker, an employee, a

29
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,619
subordinate find their own way
in achieving that goal.

30
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:12,040
So the important characteristics
that formed

31
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:18,280
Peter Drucker's thought around
management by objectives are--

32
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,490
if I can quickly illustrate
that--

33
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,856
basically based around
involvement.

34
00:02:24,856 --> 00:02:28,720


35
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,900
Involvement in terms of when a
manager is identifying certain

36
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,570
goals for their staff, they
should make sure that staff is

37
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:44,060
with them and they identify
these goals together, which

38
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,760
basically means that they should
collaborate as well.

39
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,010


40
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,820
Furthermore, when it comes to
goal setting, it is very

41
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,500
important that these
goals aren't fuzzy.

42
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,160
So they should be clear.

43
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,560
So I put that down
as clear goals.

44
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,760
And lastly, communication is
another very important factor

45
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,570
that comes in.

46
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,739
I think you realised that we
have talked quite a bit of

47
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,560
communication already.

48
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,050
So communicating with your
staff is another very

49
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,070
important task for a manager.

50
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,910
Now let's have a look
at Richard Branson.

51
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,310
Richard Branson, founder of the
Virgin Group, and what he

52
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,950
defines as a successful
manager.

53
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:44,220
Richard Branson, he made a
statement once where he was

54
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,900
saying, if you water a flower,
it will actually flourish.

55
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,970
If you don't put water on a
flower, it will shrivel up and

56
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,450
eventually die.

57
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,390
And this is where his thought
of management, or people

58
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,750
management I should say,
is coming from.

59
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,500
He's a firm believer that his
organisation is only as

60
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,440
strong, as good, as the people
that are within this

61
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,380
organisation.

62
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,820
And consequently, he's trying
to motivate staff and ensure

63
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,649
that everyone's on board.

64
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:21,019
And he is very motivational
and inspiring around that.

65
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:25,300
So to summarise, Peter Drucker
and Richard Branson determine

66
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:31,420
successful managers as being
able to collaborate with their

67
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,990
employees, with their workers.

68
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,370
To motivate them.

69
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,040
To inspire them.

70
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,534
And consequently, motivated
staff will achieve great

71
00:04:41,534 --> 00:04:42,930
outcomes for the organisation.

72
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,302
