00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,130
In this topic, we'll talk
about leadership and how

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,070
leadership is actually different
to management.

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,700
So I think the question that we
need to ask ourselves first

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,680
is, well, how is a
manager actually

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,830
different to a leader?

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:30,630
So a manager is usually a person
that is looking after

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,890
efficiencies in an
organisation.

9
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,250
And they're trying to
ensure productivity.

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,110
Managers are also more
for the short term.

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,180
And if we were to compare that
with a leader, a leader is a

12
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,820
very inspiring person.

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,950
Rather than being focused on
efficiency, leaders will be

14
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:57,040
focused on the mission and the
vision statement, often

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,680
organisation, and trying to
achieve what's behind that.

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,390
And leaders are usually, also,
in the long run for an

17
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,640
organisation.

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,410


19
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:14,830
OK, what are some traits that
come with successful leaders?

20
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,460
Leaders are usually very
confident in what they do.

21
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,220
They have a desire to lead.

22
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,510
They are passionate.

23
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,950
They demonstrate a great
level of confidence.

24
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,780
They have business knowledge.

25
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,450
They motivate staff.

26
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,040
They are consistent in what
they say and what they do.

27
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,670
And they also project a high
level of authenticity.

28
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,910


29
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,399
Let me give you a few
examples of leaders.

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,310
And Oprah Winfrey, who is a very
successful businesswoman

31
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:53,970
but also a TV presenter, she
is very passionate about

32
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,310
education for underprivileged
children.

33
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,945
And recently, she opened up the
Oprah Winfrey Leadership

34
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:05,529
Academy for Girls in South
Africa, where young girls in

35
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,419
South Africa are being taught
leadership skills.

36
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,640
An example of an authentic
leader would be Sam Walton.

37
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,329
He's the founder of
Walmart in the US.

38
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:21,210
And Walmart's company policy
is sort of trying to save

39
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,610
money on all ends.

40
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,070
And Sam Walton lives that.

41
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,120
He's very authentic about it.

42
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,850
Despite the fact that he's
incredibly rich, when he's

43
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,220
travelling for business, he's
travelling in cheap cars, and

44
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,640
he also stays at inexpensive
hotels.

45
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,470


46
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,450
A leader should be able
to motivate staff.

47
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,630
And even if the whole team is on
the ground, they're coming

48
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,549
in with their energy and
their motivation.

49
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,540
And they can inspire people
to follow them and

50
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,900
do what they want.

51
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,230
A leader should also have
technical skills.

52
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,910
Just imagine you are being led
by someone who actually

53
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,940
doesn't have no clue of the
work that they're doing.

54
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,890
That wouldn't be very
inspiring, would it?

55
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:14,790
A leader should be, also,
personable and very authentic,

56
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,489
how they are personable.

57
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:23,030
So have you ever realised or
experienced that somebody was

58
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,230
actually rather pretending that
they cared than actually

59
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,390
really caring about you?

60
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:33,950
So here, a leader will be
personable and care about the

61
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,040
people that follow him.

62
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,320
So in summary, leaders,
very confident.

63
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,540
They are motivational.

64
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,980
They have a great
level of spirit.

65
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,540
They're consistent.

66
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,140
They are authentic.

67
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,329
And they have technical
skills.

68
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:57,280
And they're also able to sort
of come across as very

69
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,640
personable.

70
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,839
And this pretty much summarises
what I wanted to

71
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,200
tell you about leadership.

72
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,410
