2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,530
In the previous topic, you've
learned the fundamentals off

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:13,690
the GE Matrix.

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,300
Now, what I would like to do
now is bring that into life

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,760
and actually apply it.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,150
What I've done is I've prepared
as an example of a

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,029
fictional company which I
have called Global Corp.

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,020
Global Corp. Is a very big,
multinational organisation

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,650
that is operating in many
different countries.

10
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,410
They've got six strategic
business units.

11
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,569
They're an agile, flexible
business, and they're very

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,140
responsive to what's happening
in the external environment.

13
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,830
The six strategic business units
that Global Corp. has

14
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,699
are as follows--

15
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:55,090
medical devices, renewable
energy, automotive parts.

16
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:00,140
Then they've got an SBU in power
plant turbines, white

17
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,870
goods such as fridges
and dishwashers.

18
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,520
And then another strategic
business unit that is more

19
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,420
concerned around printers
and scanners.

20
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,500
They are constantly evaluating
the business environment.

21
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:23,190
And it helps Global Corp.
greatly to use the GE Matrix

22
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,600
in terms of to develop strategy
in the future.

23
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,559
So what we're going to do is
we'll just focus on the first

24
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,250
three strategic business units
here, looking after medical,

25
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,570
renewable energy, and
automotive parts.

26
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:41,210
So let me give you an example
what their medical business

27
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,570
unit could look like.

28
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,710
And first of all, I think we
should have a look at market

29
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,050
attractiveness.

30
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:58,330
The medical business unit of
Global Corp. is growing, and

31
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,590
it's growing because it's a
very attractive market.

32
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,560
The middle class in China is
growing, so more and more

33
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,190
people get access to
health care there.

34
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,780
Private health care
is growing.

35
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:16,880
And in Europe and in Asia,
the markets are growing.

36
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,400
There are, however, huge
investments that have to be

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,950
made into research and
development for these devices.

38
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,170
So consequently, big market,
but not very attractive for

39
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,420
competitors to come in, as
research and development

40
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,170
requirements are very high.

41
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:37,980
In terms of business strength,
the company's very innovative.

42
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,140
It has a solid track record of
innovation for 40 years.

43
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,130
They are an established brand.

44
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,049
They have established
distribution channels, and

45
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,560
that is going very well.

46
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,410
So if I was to figure out where
that is, business unit

47
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:58,320
strength is very high,
attractiveness is high, so it

48
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,970
must be in the upper-left
corner.

49
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:06,190
What we need to know
now is how big is

50
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,760
actually this market?

51
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,560
And it's a fairly big market
that we're looking here into,

52
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,250
and I'll illustrate that here
with a big circle that I'm

53
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,170
again drawing in the
top left corner.

54
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,380
It's a big market.

55
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,010
It's $150 billion overall
per annum.

56
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:28,920
And actually, Global Corp. has
and market share of 50%, which

57
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,209
I'm illustrating here.

58
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,750
Now, also considering that
there's a lot of potential in

59
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,000
the future, the market is
growing and the business is

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,620
doing well, I'm allocating an
arrow in the upper-left

61
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,660
position as it is a really
attractive, good market.

62
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,780
So here we have our first
business unit illustrated in

63
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,150
the GE Matrix.

64
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,600
Now let's have a look at
renewable energy, so the

65
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,489
second business unit that
I would like to

66
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,000
discuss with you.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,640
Here let's have a look at the
market attractiveness, which

68
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,519
is obviously one of the areas
we need to look at.

69
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,600
And the market is attractive,
because there are lots of

70
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,579
subsidiaries from the
government that the

71
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,570
organisation is receiving.

72
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,570
However, there is fierce
competition from China who are

73
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,050
coming in with very
cheap renewable

74
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,720
energy solar devices.

75
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,650
So growth is high, but
competition is high.

76
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,570
So I would say it's in
the medium space.

77
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,430
The same applies to business
unit strength.

78
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,570
They have a track record, they
are experienced, they're

79
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,670
profitable, but not as
profitable and as experienced

80
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,400
as compared to medical
devices.

81
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,390
The market share, we've
identified that as $100

82
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,205
million, so let me
draw that in now.

83
00:04:52,206 --> 00:04:57,370
So you realise it's slightly
smaller than the $150 billion

84
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,490
market share that
we had before.

85
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:07,930
And in fact, the market share
here is only 30%.

86
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:13,230
If we look at it, what are the
prospects, we realise it's in

87
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,560
the medium range.

88
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,920
And we indicate that with an
arrow, probably more pointing

89
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,950
to the left.

90
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,039
So here we have our second
business unit.

91
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,150
Now, let's have a look
at the last one for

92
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,239
demonstration purposes.

93
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,520
The last one is automotive
components.

94
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,609
Now, the market attractiveness
for automotive components is

95
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,730
fairly low.

96
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,610
There isn't a lot
of growth, and

97
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,360
competition is fairly high.

98
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,900
Business strength is fairly low,
as the organisation is

99
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,739
operating in high cost
labour countries.

100
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,870
And the recession had a
significant impact on

101
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,980
profitability in that area.

102
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,620
People aren't buying that many
cars anymore, so consequently

103
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,670
we had a decrease of profits.

104
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,720
So that already gives us
an idea that market

105
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,930
attractiveness and business
strength are fairly low.

106
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,140
So it has to sit in the
lower-right corner.

107
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,990
Now let's have a look
at the market size.

108
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:21,130
So I can indicate that with my
circle here for that strategic

109
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,360
business unit.

110
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,650
And it's actually $25 billion.

111
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,140
And in terms of market share,
we've identified that our

112
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:34,890
market share here
is solidly 20%.

113
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:38,360
If we look at it in terms of
attractiveness and business

114
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,910
strength, we identify it's
probably a market that is not

115
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,030
the most attractive one, nor
are we very strong with it.

116
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,909
So I would indicate that with
an arrow pointing in the

117
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,380
bottom-right.

118
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,580
Now, I know it's been a lot
of information to take in.

119
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,140
But I hope I was able to
illustrate that in a nice way

120
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,289
so you can get across
that fairly quickly.

121
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,560
And consequently, you can put
many more strategic business

122
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,730
units into that portfolio.

123
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,650
And that will help you to decide
whether to invest,

124
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:20,299
divest, or to keep up the kind
of investment that you have in

125
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,550
that business unit.

126
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,893
