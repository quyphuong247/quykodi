https://youtu.be/mHsPnaDlXnI

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,500
So let's now have a look
at a SWOT Analysis.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,840
And a SWOT Analysis is basically
identifying the

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,220
Strength, the Weaknesses, the
Opportunities, and the Threats

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,320
of an organisation.

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,310
The SWOT Analysis
was developed by

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,349
Albert Humphrey in 1960.

8
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:32,490
And you can use the SWOT
Analysis as a very basic sort

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,750
of tool to assess your personal
life, but you can

10
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,400
also use it as a sophisticated
management tool.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,480
How I'm going to use the SWOT in
the following is basically

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,250
going through the theory now and
applying the theory later

13
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,090
on, but I'm going to apply
it in a business context.

14
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,940
So let me illustrate what
exactly a SWOT Analysis is.

15
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,589
So in a SWOT Analysis, as
explained before, we're

16
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:09,090
basically looking here at
strength, weaknesses,

17
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,180
opportunities, and threats.

18
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:16,850
So here I illustrate strength
with an S, weaknesses W,

19
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,419
opportunities and threats.

20
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,410
Now, you've probably realised
that when we're talking about

21
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:28,229
strength and weaknesses, were
actually referring to the

22
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,050
organisation itself.

23
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,185
So here we're talking about
the internal environment.

24
00:01:33,185 --> 00:01:40,450


25
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,360
Whereas when we talk about
opportunities or threats,

26
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,655
we're referring to the external
. environment.

27
00:01:46,655 --> 00:01:52,720


28
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,179
Also, when we talk about
strength or opportunities,

29
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,370
these are positive factors
that we're discussing.

30
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,166
So we'll put them down
as positive.

31
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:06,100


32
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,978
And obviously, weaknesses and
threats are negative things

33
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,780
that impact on the business.

34
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,775
So let me put them
down as negative.

35
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:19,000


36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,600
Now, let's start and
have a look at the

37
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,880
strength of a business.

38
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,630
And here, when you look at
strength of a business, you

39
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,465
would look in terms of actually
the competencies of

40
00:02:32,465 --> 00:02:33,790
this business.

41
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,310
What are they substantially
better than the competition?

42
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,440
And just list those
in the diagram by

43
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,970
having a plus in there.

44
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:47,160
Obviously for these I'm not
putting down all the terms, I

45
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,180
just indicate them
with a plus.

46
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,350
So what are, for example, some
low-cost resources that you

47
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,980
can utilise?

48
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,505
What are some competitive
strength that you have that

49
00:02:59,505 --> 00:03:01,280
the competition doesn't have?

50
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,405
Or what is enabling you
to get the sale?

51
00:03:05,405 --> 00:03:08,140


52
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,359
Now, when you look at strength,
try to be sincere

53
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,710
and try to be honest.

54
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,880
Don't identify strength that
pretty much everyone in the

55
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,230
industry has, because that's
not really a strength.

56
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,899
That's more what I refer to as
a hygienic factor, something

57
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,930
that you need to have
to compete in the

58
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,590
market space anyways.

59
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,070
Let's now have a look
at the weaknesses.

60
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,180
When we talk about weaknesses,
again, we're looking into the

61
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,890
internal environment.

62
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,260
We're probably looking at
areas of improvement.

63
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,170
Also maybe, what are some
factors that we should

64
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,000
definitely avoid within
the business?

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,410
What are probably some
weaknesses that our customers

66
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,910
or our competitors would
identify for us?

67
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,450
Or, in other words, what is also
resulting in a loss of

68
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,890
sale for our business?

69
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,859


70
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,150
Again, when you look
at weaknesses,

71
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,910
try to be very honest.

72
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,200
Try to be sincere--

73
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,320
don't try to talk it nice.

74
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,329
Be very critical, and if it's
a weakness, it's a weakness.

75
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:19,269
Put it down there, even if your
manager doesn't like it.

76
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,520
But it's important that you do
that for your business so you

77
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,930
get a good understanding what
are potential weaknesses of

78
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,410
the organisation.

79
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,230
Let's now have a look at
the opportunities.

80
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,920
And here you would identify
general opportunities.

81
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,620
For example, what are some
trends that are emerging that

82
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,920
you could leverage
and build on?

83
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,230
What are some new markets or new
technology that is coming

84
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,160
in that you can utilise?

85
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,740
What are some policies or
regulations that the

86
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,240
government is putting in place,
or will put in place in

87
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,620
the near future which might help
you financially and get

88
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,900
some aid here?

89
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:09,580
Or basically, what are some
changes in the demographics or

90
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,039
in the lifestyle of people
that you can

91
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,120
utilise and build on?

92
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,900


93
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,520
Looking at threats, here again
looking at the external

94
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,039
environment.

95
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,900
You're looking at any
kind of obstacles.

96
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,780
What is actually the
competition doing?

97
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,690
Is that threatening
your business?

98
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,510
Is technology threatening
your business?

99
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:41,650
And, in that respect, we
already had three good

100
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,109
examples here referring to the
music industry, to the

101
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,950
publishing industry.

102
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:51,320
But also to the filming
industry, and how technology

103
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:57,040
or changes in technology are
affecting those businesses.

104
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,570
Other areas you could look into
would be weaknesses, and

105
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,890
are they actually developing
to become a threat?

106
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:11,620
Or do you have cash flow
constraints in your business

107
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,530
which is becoming a
threat as well?

108
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,940
Now, we've talked about threats
and I've introduced

109
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,900
the SWOT Analysis as looking
to strength, weaknesses,

110
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,500
opportunities, and threats.

111
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,100
When we talk about threats, I
actually prefer using the term

112
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,800
&quot;challenges.&quot; I think that's
a bit more up-to-date

113
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,010
terminology.

114
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,480
However, according to Albert
Humphrey and the model that he

115
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,210
developed in the 1960s, it is
actually a SWOT Analysis

116
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,817
