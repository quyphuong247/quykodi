00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,720
In our previous topic, we talked
about the importance of

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,550
goals, and that goals actually
have to be SMART.

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,810
Now what I would like to do
with you is give you an

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,330
example how you can ensure that
the goals that you're

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,389
setting are actually SMART.

7
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,380
So let's start from
the beginning.

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,150
What kind of goal do most
organisations have?

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,500
And it doesn't take me long
to think about it.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,980
I think it's profit, right.

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,480
So can we just put
down profit?

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,569
I mean, profit applies to most
organisations, unless you're a

13
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,670
nonprofit organisation.

14
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,320
But I guess profitability is
something most organisations

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,700
want to achieve.

16
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,710
So is that a SMART goal, or
a SMART objective, yet?

17
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,090
Well, I don't think so.

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,650
It's not specific at all.

19
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,680
So let's make this specific.

20
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,240
So we need to identify what we
want to make a profit with.

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,070
And let's say it is a
manufacturer that is producing

22
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,770
different products, has
different product lines.

23
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,350
And I would say, make profit
with product line A.

24
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,339
So let me put that on there.

25
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:29,020
Make profit with product
A. Let's not

26
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,210
specify this product.

27
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,610
Let's keep it open,
what product A is.

28
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,040
OK.

29
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,860
I make this specific now, but I
think you can see, it's not

30
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,100
measurable yet.

31
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,130
So let's try to make
this measurable.

32
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,580
Make a profit with product
A. How much profit

33
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,440
do we want to make?

34
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:54,310
And maybe, I would
say $1 million.

35
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,990


36
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,309
And we sort of look
at that, and that

37
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,020
sounds great on paper.

38
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,119
But once we've communicated that
to other stakeholders and

39
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,180
we talk to management, we're
starting to realise that it's

40
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,440
actually not really
achievable.

41
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,890
So we need to revise our goal.

42
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,769
And making a profit of $1
million is probably a little

43
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,770
bit unrealistic, so
let's erase that.

44
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:31,300
And let's say profit of actually
$0.5 million is

45
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,880
probably achievable,
and also realistic.

46
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,870
Now is that relevant?

47
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,840
I would say, making profit for
an organisation, we've

48
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,490
identified, earlier, that
this is highly relevant.

49
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,530
All organizations, most of them,
want to make a profit.

50
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,040
Is that time framed yet?

51
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,329


52
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,820
There is no time frame here.

53
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:59,260
Do we want to make this profit
within three months, tomorrow,

54
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,850
two years, five years,
10 years?

55
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,150
We haven't identified that.

56
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,980
I would say we put a clear
time frame on that.

57
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,799
Let's say, to make a profit,
with product A, of $.05

58
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:34,460
million by the end of the
financial year 2013.

59
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,850
In Australia, that would
mean the 30th of June.

60
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,650
In the US, it would be
the 31st of December.

61
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,770
As we are here in Australia, I
define it as the 30th of June.

62
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:49,520
But it probably signalises
the importance of

63
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,930
setting clear dates.

64
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,980
And probably, it's a good idea
to put a date on there.

65
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:59,760
So to summarise, you've seen a
good example of a SMART goal,

66
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,019
here around profitability
of businesses.

67
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,990
I think you've got an idea, now,
how to develop specific,

68
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:11,070
measurable, achievable,
relevant, and time framed, or

69
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,160
timely, objectives and goals.

70
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,120
And that will help you to keep
on track with what you want to

71
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,060
achieve, and also
stay motivated.

72
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,173
