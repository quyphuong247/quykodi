00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,500
Welcome to our last topic
in week three.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,790
In our previous topic, we had
a look at a sustainable

4
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,419
competitive advantage
and we defined that.

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,000
What I would like to do here is
I would like to expand on

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,560
this a little bit further.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,049
I think a very good example
to look at a sustainable

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,270
competitive advantage would be
to look at the size of an

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,720
organisation.

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,940
Some organisations have a

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,690
sustainable competitive advantage.

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,169
So again, an advantage that
is very difficult for the

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,520
competition to replicate
and it lasts,

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,640
consequently, for a long time.

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,580
So some organisations have
a sustainable competitive

16
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,230
advantage just by their
sheer size.

17
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:01,099
To give you a few quick facts
and a few numbers around that,

18
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,670
have a look at Walmart.

19
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,410
Walmart, in terms of revenue,
would be defined as the 25th

20
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:13,600
biggest country in the world
if Walmart was a country.

21
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,089
Nike, with their annual revenue
of approximately $19

22
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,040
billion, they would be
the 102nd biggest

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,790
country in the world--

24
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,260
bigger than Paraguay,
who has an annual

25
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,180
revenue of $18 billion.

26
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,060
Other examples would be Apple
would be bigger than Ecuador,

27
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,170
Microsoft would be bigger than
Croatia, the Bank of America

28
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,910
would be bigger than Vietnam,
and General Motors would be

29
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,039
bigger than Bangladesh.

30
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,340
So I think you get the notion.

31
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,330
Size is a factor that can
contribute to a sustainable

32
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,970
competitive advantage.

33
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:57,480
Obviously, a competitor is not
becoming that big overnight.

34
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,750
Let's have a look at
another example.

35
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,440
Here in Australia in the grocery
retailing industry, we

36
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,670
have two major players,
and they're Cole's and

37
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,860
Woolworth's.

38
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,580
Combined, Cole's and Woolworth
have a market share of over

39
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,380
70% in the grocery retailing
market, which is

40
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,920
a very, very big.

41
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,609
Consequently, it becomes very,
very difficult for a new

42
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,260
player to come into this market,
because it's pretty

43
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,200
much already dominated by
these two very big,

44
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,250
well-established players.

45
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,420
I mean, there are other ones.

46
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,880
We mentioned Aldi before, and
in fact, Aldi has come to

47
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,019
Australia almost 10 years ago.

48
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,450
And they are doing fairly well,
but it takes them and it

49
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:49,130
took them a long time to start
to succeed in Australia.

50
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:54,440
Just to give you a rough idea,
the Albrecht brothers and the

51
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,710
founders of Aldi, they basically
dedicated $1 billion

52
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:04,450
to Aldi to gain traction
in Australia.

53
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,890
And in fact, it took Aldi over
three years, I think four

54
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,299
years, until they actually broke
even and they started to

55
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,183
generate money with
their operations.

56
00:03:14,183 --> 00:03:16,780


57
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,940
In the airline industry, which
we talked about earlier, what

58
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,470
would be some sustainable
competitive advantages here?

59
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,680
For me, this is very
hard to tell.

60
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,190
An example would be
Russia's airline.

61
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,040
And due to the regulations that
Russia had in the air

62
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:43,709
space, Aeroflot Russia was the
only airline that was actually

63
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:48,100
allowed to fly from Moscow to
Stockholm, to Brussels,

64
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,680
Amsterdam and other
international locations.

65
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,460
Now, that has been deregulated
by the Russian government and

66
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,420
consequently new airlines have
come into the market, now

67
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,470
competing with this
Russian airline.

68
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,680
So other aspects in the airline
industry, such as

69
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,080
technology--

70
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,310
offering iPads or other
technological devices, or the

71
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,560
greatest entertainment
system on the plane.

72
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,690
Well, that's something that's
very easy for a competitor to

73
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,850
replicate and to imitate
eventually.

74
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,500
So competition is offering
iPads in the airplane?

75
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,700
Well, guess what the other
competitor is doing pretty

76
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,400
much straight after that.

77
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,120
Also, when it comes to customer
service, all airlines

78
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,090
claim that they're the best and
utmost fantastic when it

79
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,880
comes to customer service.

80
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,219
So who's not good at
customer service?

81
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,520
Well, pretty much almost
everyone is.

82
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,919
So I think you start
to get an idea.

83
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,380
It's actually very, very
difficult in the airline

84
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,820
industry to obtain a sustainable
competitive

85
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,790
advantage that lasts for two
or three years at least.

86
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,660
So to summarise I would say,
and give you just a little

87
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,920
hint here, when you're applying
for a job, or even

88
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,310
the company that you're working
for at the moment, sit

89
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,940
down and try to analyse does
my organisation, or the

90
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,770
organisation that I'm applying
for a job, do they actually

91
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,060
have a sustainable competitive
advantage?

92
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,430
And if you can't identify at
least one of these sustainable

93
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:33,580
competitive advantages, I would
say that business is

94
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,609
probably not sustainable.

95
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,400
So when you go for a new
job, try to look for an

96
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,810
organisation that has a

97
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,300
sustainable competitive advantage.

98
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,230
Now, this topic pretty much
summarises or concludes what

99
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,790
we've done in week three, and
I look very much forward to

100
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,260
see you in week four.

101
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,938
