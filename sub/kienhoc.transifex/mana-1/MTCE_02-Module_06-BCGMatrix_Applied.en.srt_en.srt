00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,719
In our previous topic, I've
given you an overview of the

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,940
BCG metrics.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,509
And you got an idea
how it applies.

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,790
And we had a look here at
question marks, at stars, at

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,720
dogs, and at cash cows.

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,160
What I would like to do
now is to apply that

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,890
a little bit more.

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,660
So let's have a look at
some stars first.

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,440
And you can see I've already
illustrated that here.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,430
So let me put a star in there.

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,700
Or, at least, it looks
like a star.

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,960
So I think technological
companies, such as Apple, with

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,430
their iPhone or Samsung or
LG, coming out with their

15
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,730
smartphones, these products
are pretty much stars.

16
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,160
So you could refer
to them as stars.

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,830
They shine very bright, but
heavy investment is required

18
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:06,350
to maintain them shining
and, eventually, turn

19
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,729
them into a cash cow.

20
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,520
Nokia was a bright star
in the '90s, with

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,660
their mobile phones.

22
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,990
However, that's been taken
over by Apple, with the

23
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,500
iPhone, now.

24
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,290
If you look at Apple in the
1980s, that was a bright star

25
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,930
as well, very, very shiny.

26
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,730
But then Microsoft came
into the game.

27
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,970
And in the 90s, it was
all about Microsoft.

28
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,500
I guess a more recent example
would be Yahoo.

29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,830
Yahoo is shining very
bright out there.

30
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,630
However, Google eventually
took over.

31
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,030
And now everyone is googling
and not yahooing.

32
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,860
Let's move on to the cash cow.

33
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,530
It's here illustrated with
the dollar number.

34
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,170
And again, you should
milk them.

35
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,960
I think a good example for a
cash cow is the iTunes store.

36
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,649
It's, in terms of market
share, very high.

37
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,790
It's probably not growing
that much anymore.

38
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,410
But it's generating good
money for Apple.

39
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,149
The same applies
to the iPhone.

40
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,750
I understand constant investment
is required to

41
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,038
update it, from the
first generation,

42
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:11,609
second, third, fourth.

43
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,430
And we'll see what the
future is bringing.

44
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:21,900
But essentially, the iPhone is
actually a cash cow for Apple.

45
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,320
Let's have a look at some
question marks.

46
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,930
Question marks, their
future is uncertain.

47
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,420
In terms of growth, probably
fairly high, but market share

48
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,269
is very little, fairly low.

49
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,600
Good examples would be Instagram
or Pinterest or, in

50
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,200
some respect, I would
almost say Facebook.

51
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,589
Because Facebook is there.

52
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,340
Everyone's using Facebook.

53
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,880
But apparently, it's a challenge
to really make money

54
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,540
with Facebook, because
it's for free.

55
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,170
So advertising is the
main financial

56
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,059
driver here for Facebook.

57
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,320
And we'll see what's going
to happen in the future.

58
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,875
Or think in terms
of Wikipedia.

59
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,780


60
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,900
We'll see how long Wikipedia
will be around, because there

61
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,280
is no money to be made with
Wikipedia, so, in that

62
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,700
respect, also a question mark.

63
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:23,769
If we look at the dogs,
a dog here.

64
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,920
I would say a really good
example for a dog is Siemens

65
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,709
mobile phone business unit
that they had until 2005.

66
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:38,070
In 2005, that business unit was
running at a loss of a $1

67
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,049
million per day.

68
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:45,010
And consequently, Simmons
started to look into other

69
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,660
organisations potentially being
interested in buying off

70
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,770
that unprofitable
business unit.

71
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,930
And they found a buyer, BenQ.

72
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,560
BenQ bought Siemens mobile.

73
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,090
They didn't do much about it.

74
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,160
It still generated losses,
$1 million a year.

75
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,100
And, consequently, in 2006,
it went bankrupt.

76
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,780
So I think you've got a
comprehensive or more

77
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,620
comprehensive overview, now,
over our stars, our cash cows,

78
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,649
question marks, and also the
dogs, and hoe that actually

79
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,689
applies to the BCG matrix.

80
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:21,735
