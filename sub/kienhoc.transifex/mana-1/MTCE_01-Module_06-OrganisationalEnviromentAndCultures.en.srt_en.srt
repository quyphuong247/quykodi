2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,710
Let's have a look at the
external environment.

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,550
Or in other words, the
environment that organisations

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,800
are operating in.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,820
And also, let's have a look at
organisational culture and how

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,920
organisational culture actually
contributes to the

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,160
success of an organisation.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,230
The external environment
is changing at a

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,200
very, very rapid pace.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,910
And things will continue to
change at a rapid pace.

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,860
And in fact, things will change
faster and faster.

12
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,390
And it's becoming increasingly
difficult for organisations to

13
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,380
really adapt to all
these changes.

14
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,380
Now, if you're thinking well,
things are changing all the

15
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,340
time and that's something I'm
across, well let's have a look

16
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,350
at the history of some
industries and how they

17
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,430
actually approach change.

18
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,830
I think a very prominent
example would

19
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,629
be the music industry.

20
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,420
So let me illustrate this.

21
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,940


22
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,240
The music industry basically
has undergone significant

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,149
changes in the past
20-30 years.

24
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:17,360
People used to buy LPs,
after that CDs.

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,700
Or even before the CD, people
used to buy cassettes.

26
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,380
Obviously these days almost no
one is buying CDs anymore.

27
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:31,039
And people are downloading music
by digital means, so the

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,430
MP3 file and iTunes pretty
much have taken over.

29
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,810
Now, if you look at that and
the transformation and the

30
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:43,730
change that the music industry
has gone through, it becomes

31
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:48,270
very apparent that the music
industry initially tried to

32
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,000
fight this change.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,890
They tried to make it more
difficult for their customers

34
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:59,290
to illegally download music.

35
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:04,000
Now, only recently or in the
past few years, recording

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,460
companies have actually
identified that they have to

37
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,630
simplify the process and also
offer music via digital means

38
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,480
at a price that consumers are
willing to spend for it.

39
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,119
So these days an iTunes music
file will cost you $1, $2, or

40
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,880
$3, which is a price
which pretty much

41
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,240
everyone can live with.

42
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,790
Another very prominent example
would be the book industry.

43
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,859
Now, let me illustrate the book
industry or publishing

44
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,670
industry over here with
a little book.

45
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,670
The book industry these
days, things are

46
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,679
changing here very rapidly.

47
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,750
There are hardly any of my
students who still buy books--

48
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,720
the traditional hardcopy book.

49
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,350
Most students are buying e-books
these days, and that's

50
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,850
basically a way where the
industry's going.

51
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,170
So I'm not promoting or saying
that the book will die out.

52
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:03,299
But what certainly will happen
is that the book industry, in

53
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,600
terms of issuing and printing
hardcopies, will move to an

54
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,900
electronic format.

55
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,010
And the future will be looking
at newspapers and written

56
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:19,579
content, not so much on paper,
but on a device.

57
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,980
Another example would be
the filming industry.

58
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,619
Let me illustrate that with
a little camera here.

59
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,060
The filming industry's undergone
quite a bit of

60
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,070
change as well with technology
coming in.

61
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,970
So movies are now mainly
distributed

62
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,590
via electronic means.

63
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,210
And even for the ones of you who
are still going to a DVD

64
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:46,930
shop to rent DVDs and Blue Rays
these days, you'll find

65
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,820
these DVD shops there are
very few of them.

66
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:54,160
In fact, quite a few big DVD
rental businesses have gone

67
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,660
bankrupt in past few years.

68
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,850
So most people would now go to
a video kiosk, conveniently

69
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,130
located at their supermarket
and get

70
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,730
their DVDs from a kiosk.

71
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:13,970
However, the future will move
into a way of distributing

72
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,860
music and also movies via
electronic means.

73
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,600
So consumers in the future, and
that pretty much includes

74
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:29,550
you, will consume and buy films
and movies from their

75
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,300
own home, just watching
TV and doing that

76
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,550
over the remote control.

77
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,880


78
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,530
Now I think you got
an idea how the

79
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,780
environment is impacting.

80
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:47,169
And change actually is something
that organisations

81
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,100
need to address, and they'd
better do it quicker rather

82
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,630
than later.

83
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,440
Let's also have a look now at
organisational culture and how

84
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,370
that impacts on performance
of an organisation.

85
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,270
Corporate culture greatly
impacts on success.

86
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,060
And good businesses that are
out-performing other

87
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,480
businesses have a very strong,
positive corporate culture

88
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,380
that employees can themselves
identify with.

89
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,400
It also means there's high
involvement by employees.

90
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,370
Employees are actually
able to identify

91
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,480
themselves with their company.

92
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,030
And also management and staff
overall stays more focused on

93
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,020
the goals and the objectives
that the company

94
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,880
is trying to achieve.

95
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,710
I guess a good example for
that would be Richard

96
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,380
Branson's Virgin Group.

97
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,350
Virgin Group is a big
organisation that has

98
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:46,670
approximately 300 to
400 other Virgin

99
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,680
brands under their umbrella.

100
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,650
And the overall corporate
culture statement, or mission

101
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:58,320
statement, that the Virgin
Group has is to provide

102
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,659
amazing customer service
inside and out.

103
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,900
And you can see when you're
dealing with Richard Branson,

104
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,330
or if you're dealing with Virgin
Group, any of the 300

105
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,940
or 400 companies, that this is
something that is deeply

106
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:18,600
embedded in the thinking and
how employees of the Virgin

107
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,280
Group are actually acting.

108
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,909
And consequently, most of the
brands that Richard Branson is

109
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,410
managing are very successful
today.

110
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,328
