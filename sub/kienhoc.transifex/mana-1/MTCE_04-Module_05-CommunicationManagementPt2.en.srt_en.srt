00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,639
Welcome back.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,660
In this topic, I would like
to elaborate further on

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,330
communication and introduce
you to the

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,520
communications model.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,490
In the communications model,
what we'll discuss is

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,110
basically two individuals
communicating with each other.

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,590
And we'll illustrate that
in a very basic model.

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,590
So let me draw that up here.

10
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:35,750
So here, we've got the first
person, the sender of the

11
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,070
information.

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,000
So here, we've got the sender.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,050
And on the other end, we
have the receiver.

14
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:49,739


15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,690
Now what the sender is doing
when he's trying to get a

16
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,070
message across, actually, first
of all, this person will

17
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,230
think about what they say.

18
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:04,920
And while they think about it,
they then convert that into a

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,980
message which could be either
verbal or in writing.

20
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,950
Now this process, we
call that encoding.

21
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:18,660
So here, the message
is encoded.

22
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,520
Now once a message has been
encoded, it needs to travel

23
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,530
through a channel.

24
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,660
And that channel could be either
through media, so it

25
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,580
could be through the internet.

26
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,950
It could be through
a telephone line.

27
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,910
Or it could be also
face to face.

28
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:43,850
But this message is also
prone to interferences.

29
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:49,869
And interferences, we call
them noise in this model,

30
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:55,680
could be anything that distorts
the information, any

31
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,130
noise that is coming
from outside.

32
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,929
Let's say you're standing on
a noisy street or you're

33
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,850
communicating on
the telephone.

34
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,399
A battery goes flat.

35
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,300
Or once you're having your video
conference, the internet

36
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,139
breaks down.

37
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:14,580
And consequently, the message
is either not fully

38
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,090
communicated or there are
interferences in between.

39
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,260
I'm pretty sure you had a phone
connection that wasn't

40
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,459
100% where you actually had real
noise in the background.

41
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:31,490
So now, going back from encoding
where the message is

42
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,890
travelling through the channel,
what the receiver is

43
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:39,109
actually doing is they are also
decoding that message.

44
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:45,350
And again, once they're decoding
that message, another

45
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,290
factor of noise could
come into play.

46
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,980
And this is not only technical
noise, but also from a

47
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,790
psychological perspective.

48
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:59,440
So the culture of the person
or their background or,

49
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,230
basically, selective
hearing kicks in.

50
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:07,440
So the person only hears what
they actually want to hear.

51
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,800
So this is, basically, a rough
overview over a generic

52
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,130
communications model.

53
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,390
What I would like to introduce
you next to are three

54
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,709
different kinds of formal
communication.

55
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,880
And it's very simple.

56
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:28,190
So I'm distinguishing here
between upward communication

57
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,320
and, on the other hand,
between downward

58
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,290
communication.

59
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,900
Downward and upward
communication happens between

60
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,670
managers and their staff,
for example.

61
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,690
So a manager is communicating
something to their

62
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,650
subordinate.

63
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,600
Obviously, there is downward
communication happening.

64
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,420
Whereas, on the other side, if
an employee, a subordinate, is

65
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,589
talking to their manager,
we have the

66
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,150
opposite process here.

67
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,010
So here, we have upward

68
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,820
communication actually happening.

69
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,109
And that's very important that
you have that kind of process

70
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,700
in place in any organisation
where managers are not only

71
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,170
communicating downwards, but
employees and staff are also

72
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,579
able to communicate upwards.

73
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:23,870
Now when staff and staff here
on the bottom or on the top

74
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:31,370
managers, when they're
communicating on the same

75
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:37,370
level, we call that horizontal
communication.

76
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,380
So here, basically, two managers
on the same level

77
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,520
communicating with each other or
two staff members or front

78
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,219
line workers communicating
with each other.
