00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,420
Welcome to Topic 3.

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,180
Now, what I would like to do
here is I would like to apply

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,780
Tuckman's Group Development
Model on an example.

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,740
Let's imagine you're going on
a sail cruise, and let me

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,659
illustrate that here
with a little boat.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,170


8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,080
And on this sail cruise that
you've booked which is leaving

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,049
Sydney Harbour and you're
supposed to

10
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,860
go to Auckland Harbour.

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,100
You've actually booked that by
yourself-- you're not going

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:37,920
with friends.

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,250
And when you arrive on the
sailing ship, you're pretty

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,790
much all by yourself.

15
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,420
And I think the first thing that
you do during the forming

16
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,690
stage, obviously you are in a
team in a group on that boat,

17
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,059
is you need to get to
know each other.

18
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,530
Obviously, you wouldn't bring
up any issues at this stage.

19
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,920
You're probably a little bit
hesitant as well, so you act a

20
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,510
little bit independently.

21
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,010
And that's usually where the
captain comes in and gives a

22
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:14,080
few instructions and helps out
to get to know members of the

23
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,050
sailing cruise.

24
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,800
Now, let's imagine you just
left the harbour.

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,460
And actually a storm is brewing
up and the waves are

26
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:29,119
becoming very high and people
are starting to

27
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,240
panic a little bit.

28
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,399
There are even some team members
on the cruise who are

29
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,350
saying let's return.

30
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,970
Let's go back to
Sydney Harbour.

31
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,840
They're really scared.

32
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,360
Conflict is emerging.

33
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,880
People don't know what exactly
they're supposed to do.

34
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,360
And here the team leader, the
captain, has to give some

35
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,410
clear instructions.

36
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,460
Now you haven't developed
that clear goal yet.

37
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,619
So some of the team members on
board want to go back to

38
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,330
Sydney Harbour, and some
want to continue

39
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,240
going to Auckland Harbour.

40
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,020
Now that goes on, and overnight,
in the next

41
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,980
morning, the waves have started
to calm down and you

42
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,859
are moving now into
the norming phase.

43
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,890
Now, everyone's still on
board, quite literally.

44
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:23,420
And everyone has agreed OK,
let's do this together.

45
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,089
Let's go to Auckland.

46
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,390
We can do this.

47
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,410
And a clear hierarchy has
been established.

48
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,670
Everyone knows what is their
task on this sailing ship to

49
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,160
ensure that the sailing ship
is now moving into the

50
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,859
performing stage here.

51
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,840
So I illustrate that here with a
little sail, and the wind is

52
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,670
blowing into that sail.

53
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:53,339
And now you're moving very fast
to your destination to

54
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,690
Auckland Harbour.

55
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,840
And everyone knows what
they're doing.

56
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,760
You're a team.

57
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,410
You're working together like
a well-oiled machine.

58
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:08,260
And finally, you reach the port
in Auckland and you're

59
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:14,429
disembarking the sailing
vessel, and

60
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,680
it's time to say goodbye.

61
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,560
And you've probably made
some good friends here.

62
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,820
It was quite an experience going
on that sail cruise and

63
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,200
sometimes it's hard
to say good bye.

64
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,299
And you might decide
that you want to do

65
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,670
that sail cruise again.

66
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,320
You might want to do
it somewhere else.

67
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,030
And you might want to do it with
different people, or you

68
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,050
agree to do it with the
same team again.

69
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:42,440
I think that example has
illustrated nicely how a group

70
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,200
on a sail cruise is actually
going through the forming,

71
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,119
storming, norming, performing
and adjourning stage.

72
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,405
