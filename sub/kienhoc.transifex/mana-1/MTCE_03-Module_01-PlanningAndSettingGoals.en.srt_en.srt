Hello, and welcome, everyone,
to week three to Management

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,070
Tools for a Competitive Edge.

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,660
In this topic, I would like to
talk about the importance of

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,170
actually setting goals
and planning.

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,260
Setting goals is very important,
because research

7
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,600
has actually shown that
it can increase

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,900
productivity by up to 50%.

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,989
If you want to succeed in the
long term, but also in the

10
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:39,340
short term, you should
set some clear goals.

11
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,780
If you don't set clear goals,
if you don't plan ahead, you

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,790
are much, much more likely to
fail in what you're doing.

13
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,200
What I also want to stress is
some people sort of have an

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,370
idea of what they're doing.

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,330
An idea is not a goal.

16
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,900
You need a clear pathway in
what you're doing that

17
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,710
motivates you, and clear
goals will do that.

18
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,239
So goal setting.

19
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,600
What does that apply to?

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,030
Well, it can apply to pretty
much anything and everything--

21
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,180
to your private life, to your
job, the work that you do,

22
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,100
your own business that you're
running, or even if you're

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,179
working somewhere.

24
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,340
And if you are in a management
position, you might even set

25
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,430
some goals for your staff.

26
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:31,030
Goals will enable you to
circumnavigate distractions.

27
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:35,080
Sometimes if you have big
goals, they might be

28
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,050
overwhelming, especially if it's
in the long run-- let's

29
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,869
say three to five years.

30
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:44,370
And what you should do here is
split them up into smaller

31
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:50,310
goals, so one step after
another, and that will keep

32
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,580
reaching this goal manageable,
and will

33
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,899
also keep you motivated.

34
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,900
I'll give you an example,
if you're not

35
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,700
sure about goal setting.

36
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,630
Well, I believe you hardly ever
jump into the car and you

37
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,289
don't know where you're going.

38
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,430
You always have a destination,
or in most occasions, where

39
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,250
you want to go.

40
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,840
So let me illustrate that.

41
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,890
So here we've got a little flag,
and this is our goal.

42
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,299
This is where we want
to get with our car.

43
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:24,810
Now here we've got our car, and
obviously, we're trying to

44
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:30,520
take the straightest direction
to get there, and I'll

45
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,910
illustrate it there.

46
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,170
But sometimes you might find
that actually, the street is a

47
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,399
little bit congested.

48
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,130
There's after work traffic,
et cetera.

49
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,920
And probably the most direct
route is not the quickest

50
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,839
one-- not the best way to go.

51
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,150
And consequently, you might
take a route that looks

52
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,420
something like that.

53
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,109
And the same applies
to goal setting.

54
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,050
Have a clear goal, but how you
get there-- that might change

55
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,510
a little bit over time, and
you have to amend that.

56
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:04,000
Look, if you have no goals,
it's very hard to motivate

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,500
yourself, to motivate others, to
reach the goals that you've

58
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,100
pretty much set for them, and
that's why it's important to

59
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,350
have clear goals.

60
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,928
