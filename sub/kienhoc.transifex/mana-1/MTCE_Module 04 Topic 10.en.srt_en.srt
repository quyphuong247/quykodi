2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,450
Welcome to this last topic,
leadership styles.

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,809
The very last topic in
this course indeed.

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,770
And what I want to do is discuss
leadership styles with

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,900
you, and that will help you
greatly for your final

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,869
assignment.

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:28,180
So the first leadership style
that I've come up with is an

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,830
autocratic leader.

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,930
An autocratic leader
is a leader that is

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,500
striving after power.

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,130
They make quick decisions
and usually you

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,300
find them in the military.

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,510
A good example would be
Napoleon Bonaparte, or

14
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,000
Alexander the Great.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,620
Transactional leaders are
leaders that usually don't

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,599
allow their followers to
ask any questions.

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,180
They are punishing leaders if
they don't perform to their

18
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,830
expectations--

19
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,399
again, they're very performance
oriented--

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,310
and usually they're after
short term goals.

21
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,930
So a good example for that
would be a coach

22
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,120
for a sports team.

23
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,280
So maybe you Joachim
Low, for the German

24
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,800
national soccer team.

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:25,310
A bureaucratic leader is a
leader that is following

26
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:30,390
procedures, following
regulation, rules, and they're

27
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,890
very good in performing
routine tasks.

28
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,430
They're usually not the
most creative leaders.

29
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,660
I think a good example for that
would be a fire worker.

30
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:45,520
Just imagine a fire worker has
a really dangerous job, I

31
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,270
would say, and therefore it's
very important for them that

32
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,610
they follow clear procedures to
make sure that everyone's

33
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,940
safe, including themselves.

34
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:01,080
Charismatic leaders are these
leaders who transform teams.

35
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,760
They're highly inspiring.

36
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,830
Usually they're fairly
self-focused, and the success

37
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,270
of the whole team is
highly dependent on

38
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,160
this charismatic leader.

39
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,799
Another leadership style is the

40
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,560
democratic leadership style.

41
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,460
A democratic leader will
listen to what

42
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,960
followers are saying.

43
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,190
A democratic leader is
encouraging creativity, and

44
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,120
usually they're after a lot of
input, and in many occasions,

45
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,060
that makes decision making
fairly slow.

46
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,400
I think a great example
of a democratic

47
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,340
leader is Barack Obama.

48
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,760
Barack Obama, when he won the
elections, one of the

49
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,179
statements that he gave
was, I listen to you.

50
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,070
Saying he listened to the
Americans, and he wants to do

51
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,730
what the Americans want to do.

52
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:03,340
So again, he has that open
ear to his followers.

53
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,940
Another leadership
style with the

54
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,990
laissez-faire leadership style.

55
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,530
Pretty much, laissez-faire comes
from the French, and if

56
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:17,146
I was to translate it, it
would mean let it be.

57
00:03:17,146 --> 00:03:22,630
A laissez-faire leader is more
supportive, and usually gives

58
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:27,950
advice but very little support,
and usually followers

59
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,530
can pretty much do whatever
they want.

60
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,600
You've probably come across some
people in a supermarket,

61
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,930
very young mother was maybe
struggling with their kids,

62
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,430
because the kids could only do
whatever they wanted to do,

63
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,160
and that's a good example of a

64
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,252
laissez-faire leadership style.

65
00:03:46,252 --> 00:03:50,900
A people oriented leader
is a leader that

66
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,340
is supporting teams.

67
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,570
This leader is after
collaboration, communication,

68
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,730
and very much about social
aspects in an organisation.

69
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,869
I think a nice example would
be Richard Branson.

70
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,540
Richard Branson is the
founder of Virgin,

71
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,780
of the Virgin group.

72
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,640
He's actually happily giving his
email, his phone number,

73
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,680
away to all his followers, and
they are able to contact him

74
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,300
pretty much at every time.

75
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,650
So he has this really
strong people focus.

76
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,460
The last leadership style that I
want to discuss with you are

77
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,680
transformational leaders.

78
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,300
Transformational leaders are
after efficiencies and

79
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,430
productivity, and they're
usually also highly motivated.

80
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,680
I would say Jack Welch, as
the former CEO of General

81
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,210
Electrics, demonstrated
transformational leadership

82
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,719
when he sort of had to
restructure General Electrics.

83
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,360
And what he tried to do was to
eliminate waste, to create

84
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,370
more efficiencies within the
organisation, and also

85
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,910
dismantle bureaucracy
in an organisation.

86
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,490
He believed organisation should
only operate in an

87
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,490
environment where they
are best at, or at

88
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,280
least second best.

89
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,400
This concludes our course.

90
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,830
Excellent, very well done.

91
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,859
You can tap yourself
on the shoulder.

92
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,530
You've completed this, you can
be very proud of yourself.

93
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,780
So obviously, to finish this
course, you only need to

94
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,070
finish the last assignment that
you have, and then you're

95
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,180
pretty much through with it.

96
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,480
I really hope that you got
something out of this course,

97
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,100
and I hope you will be able to
apply some of the knowledge,

98
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,510
the theories, and the concepts
around management that we've

99
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,460
covered in your work line, or
in your private lives, and I

100
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,349
want to wish you all
the best future.

101
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,600
Good luck.

102
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,892
