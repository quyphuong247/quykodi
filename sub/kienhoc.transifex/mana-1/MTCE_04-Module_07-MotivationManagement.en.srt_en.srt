00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,110
In this topic, I would like to
introduce you to Maslow's

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,629
hierarchy of needs.

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:19,150
Abraham Maslow was an American
psychologist who conducted

5
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,340
research around motivation.

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,900
Now he identified five
basic needs that

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,720
every individual has.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,279
These are as follows--

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,670
physiological, safety,
social, esteem, and

10
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,740
self-actualization.

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,765
Now let me illustrate that
for you in this pyramid.

12
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:46,270


13
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,730
The first need that
he identified was

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,044
physiological needs.

15
00:00:51,045 --> 00:01:04,489


16
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:10,650
Physiological needs are needs
such as water, air, food, and

17
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,190
also shelter.

18
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:16,480
And once an individual has
fulfilled these physiological

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,170
needs, they move on
to the next stage.

20
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,175
And they're developing
needs for safety.

21
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:31,759


22
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,060
Safety needs include protection
and security, and

23
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,630
also law and order.

24
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,839
And once the safety needs have
been fulfilled, an individual

25
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,830
develops a need for
social needs.

26
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:53,870


27
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,760
Social needs include pretty
much everything around

28
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:03,610
relationships or friends,
family, affection, and love.

29
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,610
And once that has been
developed, the individual

30
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:11,080
moves up the ladder and they
develop esteem needs.

31
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:20,060


32
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,420
Esteem needs include
self-awareness, achievement,

33
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,720
status, prestige, and
also independence.

34
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,280
And once an individual has
achieved that, this individual

35
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,310
moves into the last stage of
Maslow's hierarchy of need,

36
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,690
which is self-actualization.

37
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:56,910


38
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,950
Self-actualization is the
highest need of the basic

39
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,200
needs that Maslow identified.

40
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,609
And it's basically where a
person is fully satisfied with

41
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,550
their life.

42
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:17,320
So in summary, Maslow identified
five basic needs--

43
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,900
physiological, safety,
social, esteem, and

44
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,720
self-actualization.

45
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,570
Now let me put this
into an example.

46
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:31,160
Just imagine a student who has
just arrived in Sydney.

47
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,870
This student is an international
student and he

48
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,440
arrived via airplane.

49
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,690
So the first need that this
student will have when he

50
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,320
arrives in Sydney are obviously
a need for food and

51
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,579
water, but also accommodation.

52
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,150
And this student has booked a
nice hotel in King's Cross.

53
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,050
Well, King's Cross is the red
light district, and obviously,

54
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:59,210
things aren't turning out what
he expected from the brochure.

55
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:03,410
And the student is developing
a need for more safety in a

56
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,760
safer suburb.

57
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,359
So consequently, because the
student doesn't feel that

58
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,320
safe, he moves into a safer
suburb within Sydney, where he

59
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,130
now feels safe.

60
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,519
Now university has started
for the student.

61
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,890
And the student, who's now
living in a good suburb,

62
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:26,310
develops a need for friends,
for belongingness.

63
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,490
And obviously, during his
course, during his studies,

64
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,740
he's developing friendships
with others.

65
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,120
Now after he developed all these
friendships, the student

66
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,380
starts to realise that
he's actually

67
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,550
developing a need for esteem.

68
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,530
And the student realises that
he actually wants to be

69
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:52,880
acknowledged by his lecturer,
and he really starts to excel

70
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,800
in his studies.

71
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,620
He's starting to wear
nice clothing.

72
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:03,860
And if we forward just a few
years from that, the student

73
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,830
has now finished his studies.

74
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,550
He actually gets a job offer in
exactly that field that the

75
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,020
student has studied.

76
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,310
It's his dream job.

77
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,040
It's the role that he
always wanted to do.

78
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,420
And this is where the
student experiences

79
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,610
self-actualization.

80
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:28,320
So here, doing exactly what he
wants to do in life and being

81
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,570
very happy and content
how things are going.

82
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,210
And this is pretty much the
highest level of Maslow's

83
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,539
hierarchy of needs.

84
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:41,140
So again, to summarise, Maslow's
hierarchy of needs

85
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,919
pretty much determines
that individuals

86
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,720
have different needs.

87
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,360
And those are physiological,
safety, social, esteem, and

88
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,610
self-actualization.

89
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,403
