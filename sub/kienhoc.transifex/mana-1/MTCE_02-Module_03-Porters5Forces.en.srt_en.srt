00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,150
https://youtu.be/5svFs59E0gI

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,230
Now that we had an overview over
the PESTEL Analysis, and

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,780
we've applied the PESTEL
Analysis, we've looked at the

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,900
macro environment here
by doing that.

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,000
I want to have a look at the
micro environment that

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,810
businesses are operating in.

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,950
And a very useful tool
to do that is to use

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,060
Porter's Five Forces.

9
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,220
Michael Porter developed
Porter's Five Forces in 1979.

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,010
He's a professor at Harvard
University.

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,239
And again, it's a very useful
tool to look at the micro

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,350
environment that organisations
are operating in.

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,120
So what the area are we're
looking at here?

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,860
Michael Porter stipulated that
if you look at the micro

15
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,180
environment to get a
comprehensive overview, you

16
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,300
should have a look at the
competition indicating that

17
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,629
here looking at the
industry rivalry.

18
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,890
When you look at the
competition, here you would

19
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,290
look at it in terms of how
many competitors are

20
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,120
actually out there?

21
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,180
Who is competing with me?

22
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,260
Are there just a vast number
of small competitors, or is

23
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,580
there a very big competitor
and a few small ones?

24
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,310
Or are there two or three really
big ones competing

25
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,920
which makes it really,
really difficult?

26
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,860
What are the growth prospects
of these competitors?

27
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,980
Are they going to stay small,
are they going to stay big, or

28
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,370
are the smaller ones succeeding
in the future?

29
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:41,780
And also, how diverse
is the competition?

30
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,400
Porter then stipulated that you
should also have a look at

31
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,086
the threat of new entrants or
new competitors coming in.

32
00:01:50,086 --> 00:01:54,330
I'll illustrate that
here with an arrow.

33
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,950
Here you would look at it in
terms of how easy is it

34
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:03,470
actually for someone else, for a
competitor, to enter exactly

35
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,550
that industry that you're
competing in, or to offer

36
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,940
exactly the same products
and services?

37
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,930
Are there any barriers, like
financial barriers, start up

38
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,070
costs, licence requirements,
et cetera, that make it

39
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,239
difficult to enter
this industry?

40
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,680
Just think in terms of setting
up an airline, an insurance

41
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,400
company, versus setting
up a corner shop

42
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,230
just around the corner.

43
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,549
And also, how profitable is
that industry that you're

44
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,560
operating in?

45
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,250
Obviously, if it's highly
profitable, a lot of

46
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,380
competitors want to
come in as well.

47
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,630
Let's now have a look
at the substitutes.

48
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,359
And substitutes, well,
let me give you a few

49
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,545
examples for that.

50
00:02:46,545 --> 00:02:50,820
For example, cars are running on
fuel, on petrol, whereas as

51
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,150
these days not necessarily
anymore.

52
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,700
A lot of cars are running on
gas, and an increasing number

53
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,839
of cars are starting to
run on electricity.

54
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,690
So here, different types of
energy are replacing basically

55
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,400
the traditional fuel.

56
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,990
Think about in terms of if you
can't get coffee, you might

57
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,720
have a tea.

58
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,470
Or if you're after that caffeine
kick, you might just

59
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,310
have a Red Bull.

60
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,970
Think also not in terms of
direct substitutes, but for

61
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:27,490
example, a Skype call could
replace a flight.

62
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,975
Now business people don't have
to fly for meetings.

63
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:35,280
They have a video conference,
and consequently a Skype call

64
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,680
is replacing that
business flight.

65
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,380
Or think about catching public
transport rather than driving

66
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,950
your car, or just going
on a bicycle, or even

67
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,929
just walking by foot.

68
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,530
Now, let's have a look at the
bargaining power of suppliers

69
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,610
and how that impacts
on the business.

70
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,510
Well, you would have a look here
in terms of how easy is

71
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,120
it to get access to suppliers?

72
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,720
Are there a lot of suppliers
available or is there a high

73
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,340
concentration of suppliers?

74
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,940
Well, in that case I guess
they have very little

75
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,450
bargaining power.

76
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,690
However, if it's a unique
provider who is providing your

77
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:24,360
business, your industry with
this little item module that

78
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,050
you need for your device, then
obviously they have strong

79
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,930
bargaining power.

80
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,330
It's also worthwhile looking
at them in terms of how

81
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,830
important is that supplier
actually for your business?

82
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,180
Can you just drop them?

83
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,250
And also, what are the savings,
or what are the costs

84
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,540
actually switching
that supplier?

85
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:49,900
The last force that Porter
looked at was the bargaining

86
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,640
power of customers.

87
00:04:52,640 --> 00:05:00,169
And he would have a look at how
sensitive customers are to

88
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:04,430
price and changes in price.

89
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,820
Would a customer, if you charged
them just a little bit

90
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,980
more, go to the competition
because

91
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,900
they can get it cheaper?

92
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,229
How transparent is
that market?

93
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,460
Think about booking flights.

94
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,969
There are websites that are
comparing different airlines

95
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,720
and their prices, and a few
dollars might make a big

96
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,350
difference if you're
getting the sale.

97
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,410
Also think about it in terms
of how important is that

98
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,790
customer to you?

99
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:34,620
Is that customer contributing
20%, 30%, 40%, maybe 50% of

100
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,290
the revenue for your business.

101
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,170
Obviously, that's a very
important customer for you,

102
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,210
and consequently they
have quite a bit

103
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,960
of bargaining power.

104
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,140
Also think in terms of the
uniqueness of your product.

105
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,979
If you have a unique product,
your customers can't get it

106
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,000
anywhere else, you'll be
in a safe position.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,270
So in summary, Porter's Five
Forces is a very useful tool

108
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,609
to analyse the direct micro
environment that organisations

109
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,840
are operating in.

110
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,099
And it's just a fantastic tool
to complement a macro

111
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,210
environmental analysis here
using the PESTEL Analysis that

112
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,560
we've done prior to that.

113
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,360
And here that Porter's Five
Forces really greatly complete

114
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,200
the whole picture
that you need.

115
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,780
Not only looking at the macro,
but looking at the micro

116
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,030
environment.

117
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,378
