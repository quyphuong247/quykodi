2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,946
So what is management?

3
00:00:10,946 --> 00:00:15,270
Well, management doesn't only
apply to a manager of a

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:19,470
multi-domestic organisation for
a domestic manufacturer.

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,770
It also applies to a coffee shop
owner, to a plumber, if

6
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,810
you're running your own
one-man business in

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,000
consulting, if you're selling
iTunes over eBay, or if you're

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,660
a mom staying at home looking
after the household and the

9
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,360
kids, or even just completing
this course.

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,920
All this requires significant
management skills.

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,190
Let's have a look at a few
examples that probably

12
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:51,199
exemplify some severe
management mistakes.

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,510
Let's have a look at
a car manufacturer.

14
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,360
And just imagine that car
manufacturer figured out that

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,450
one out of one million cars
that is coming off their

16
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,640
production line has a problem
with their brakes which could

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,060
potentially lead into fatality
of the driver and the

18
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,450
passengers.

19
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:15,920
Think about an airline that is
trying to reduce their costs

20
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,340
in maintaining their airplanes
by extending maintenance

21
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,230
cycles, and also reducing
training for their pilots.

22
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,930
Or, think about a pharmaceutical
organisation

23
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:35,630
that is manufacturing
pacemaker devices.

24
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,119
And they realise five years down
the track after already

25
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,730
thousands of these devices have
been transplanted that

26
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,470
there are some malfunctions and

27
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,390
problems with these devices.

28
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,130
So I think you start to realise
that management is a

29
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,679
very important task.

30
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,510
And there are reasons why
businesses are spending

31
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:59,570
millions of dollars, well in
fact it's billions of dollars,

32
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:04,789
every year to ensure that staff
is adequately trained

33
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,440
and educated and can fulfil
their management roles in an

34
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,440
effective and efficient
manner.

35
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,579
If we look at some ivy schools
in the US, the top league ivy

36
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,360
schools, you'll find that MBA
courses are actually very

37
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,140
expensive and also require
significant time commitment by

38
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,959
the participants of sometimes
one or two years.

39
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:33,150
Or myself, I've done my
MBA over five years.

40
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:39,540
Now essentially I would say
management is not to do

41
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,500
everything by yourself,
but to get others to

42
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,020
get the work done.

43
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,650
If that sounds a little bit
unethical or even too laid

44
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,880
back for you, as the Australians
might say, let me

45
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,100
give you an example that
exemplifies that

46
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,489
a little bit better.

47
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,420
From my experience when I'm
teaching students at

48
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,950
university, I get the class to
form groups at the beginning

49
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,859
of the course.

50
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,960
Students usually don't have a
problem forming groups, but

51
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,940
when I ask them to appoint a
group leader or a person that

52
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,690
is managing the group, usually
students are very hesitant

53
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,870
doing that.

54
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,400
And when I explain to them well,
all I want this team

55
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,560
leader or this manager of the
group to do is to follow the

56
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,310
four functions of management,
which are

57
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,880
pretty much as follows.

58
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:36,030
So if I was to illustrate that
on this iPad in a square, and

59
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,720
I just the abbreviations to
make it a bit easier.

60
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,560
But basically the four
functions of

61
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,470
management are planning--

62
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,116
I'll just abbreviate
that with a P--

63
00:03:46,116 --> 00:03:54,500
are organising, are leading, and
they are also controlling.

64
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,260
Now, once I've explained that to
the students, usually I get

65
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,649
quite a few volunteers who want
to become team leader and

66
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,560
manage the project.

67
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,760
And I usually appoint the first
one who's up for it.

68
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,920
Long story short, at the end
of the course they usually

69
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:18,289
realise that there's much more
to it than just planning,

70
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,380
organising, leading,
and controlling.

71
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,630
And they realise that this
is actually a very, very

72
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,540
comprehensive task that
requires significant

73
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,870
skill and effort .

74
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,160
If you can't relate to this
example, just think about the

75
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,650
last time you went to the
movies with a couple of

76
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,299
friends and you tried to
organise a movie that suits

77
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,350
everyone, a location that's
suitable, and also a time that

78
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,240
suits everyone.

79
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,310
Or think about a barbecue that
you've organised, making sure

80
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,360
everyone's bringing drinks,
their food, a barbecue is

81
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,170
there, the location is right
and also the timing,

82
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,760
everyone's arriving pretty much
on time for the barbecue.

83
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,210
I think these examples exemplify
nicely that the four

84
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,020
functions of management.

85
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,580
Your planning, organising,
leading, and controlling are

86
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,200
not as simple as
they may sound.

87
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,020
And we're going to have a bit
more about this in the

88
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,270
following topics.

89
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,650
