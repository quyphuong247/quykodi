00:00:08,143 --> 00:00:11,990
In this topic, I would like to
explain to you what economies

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,100
of scale are.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,900
We've used that term quite a few
times during the course.

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,509
And I just want to make sure
that everyone's really across

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,550
what economies of scale
actually are.

7
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,670
A lot of people think oh, yeah,
economies of scale.

8
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,450
That basically means
the more I produce,

9
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,950
the cheaper it becomes.

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,100
The more I'm buying, the
cheaper I can buy it.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,440
And that is sort of correct, but
let me ask you a question.

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,809
Why does it become cheaper?

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,140
Why can you buy product
at a cheaper price?

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,050
Why is it cheaper for a
manufacturer to produce?

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,129
You've got the answer?

16
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,450
Well, if you don't have the
answer, don't worry.

17
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,080
I'm going to explain that here
on the example of a cotton

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,379
shirt manufacturer.

19
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,750
So it's a very simplistic
example.

20
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,650
Don't apply that to a real
cotton shirt manufacturer.

21
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,490
But I'm trying to keep it
as simple as possible.

22
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,310
Now let's imagine we have a
cotton shirt manufacturer who

23
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:27,470
has manufactured 100,000
shirts in 2010.

24
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,950
Now, when you are a cotton shirt
manufacturer, you can

25
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,630
distinguish between
two costs--

26
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:41,009
they will be your fixed costs
and your variable costs.

27
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,770
Your fixed costs are costs that
don't change over time.

28
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,270
They're always constant,
no matter

29
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,229
how much you're producing.

30
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:52,080
So for example for this cotton
shirt manufacturer, fixed

31
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,179
costs would be the rent that
they have to pay for the

32
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:00,380
premises, electricity, running
the air conditioning in the

33
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,030
manufacturing plant,
et cetera.

34
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,810
So these are costs that really
don't change over time, and

35
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,350
that also includes general
overheads.

36
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:16,579
So let's just put down $1
million as fixed costs for

37
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,960
this cotton shirt
manufacturer.

38
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,110
Now, variable costs are costs
that are variable, so

39
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,630
consequently they change
with volume.

40
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,859
Variable costs for a cotton
shirt manufacturer here would

41
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,290
be the cotton that
they're using.

42
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,840
So every shirt needs, I
don't know, one or two

43
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,790
square metres of cotton.

44
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,230
Obviously there are a few other
things that go into a

45
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,489
cotton shirt, such as the
buttons, et cetera, but let's

46
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,500
just ignore those.

47
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,310
Let's just go with the cotton.

48
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,760
And I've pretty much identified
that variable costs

49
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,480
per shirt are actually $1.

50
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,166
Now, if we are manufacturing
100,000 cotton shirts at a

51
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:06,790
price of $1 per shirt in terms
of variable costs for the

52
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:16,640
cotton, that will bring me to
$100,000, or 0.1 million.

53
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:23,649
100 times $1 for the cotton,
100,000 times $1 for the

54
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,390
cotton for the shirt,
consequently must be $100,000

55
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,869
in variable costs, so we
have that here now.

56
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,405
Now, I can easily calculate my
total cost, which I abbreviate

57
00:03:34,405 --> 00:03:43,130
here at TC, and my total costs
are consequently 1.1 million.

58
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,040
Now, it'll be interesting to see
how much does it actually

59
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,709
cost to manufacture one shirt?

60
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:53,030
And all I have to do is I have
to divide it by 100,000 shirts

61
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,720
that we've produced, and
consequently I get a price of

62
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,650
$11 per shirt.

63
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:08,210
And this is basically the
price that it costs this

64
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:12,080
cotton shirt manufacturer
to produce one shirt.

65
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,450
Now, you're probably asking
so how does it relate to

66
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,079
economies of scale?

67
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,220
We're getting there.

68
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:24,880
Now, let's say in 2011 this
cotton shirt manufacturer had

69
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,420
a really good year.

70
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:31,150
The marketing team has
done a great job.

71
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,960
They promoted the cotton shirts
in a good manner.

72
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,090
And the cotton shirt
manufacturer has actually sold

73
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:42,419
200,000 of these shirts.

74
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:49,380
Fixed cost are still, guess
what, they're the same--

75
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,300
1 million.

76
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,250
We said they're fixed,
they don't change.

77
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,640
Our variable costs, however,
they've gone up because we've

78
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,710
produced 200,000 shirts.

79
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:03,349
So consequently, my variable
costs for 200,000 shirts are

80
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,910
$0.2 million now.

81
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:14,530
So as total cost, we are having
now $1.2 million.

82
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:19,750
Now, because I produced 200,000
shirts in that year, I

83
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,630
need to divide that
by 200,000.

84
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:29,990
And I realise that my cost per
shirt have actually gone down

85
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:35,270
to $6.00 per shirt.

86
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,200
And now you start to realise
that actually the more a

87
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,599
manufacturer is producing,
the lower the

88
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,090
costs become per unit.

89
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,419
So if I was to put that into
one sentence, economies of

90
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:57,020
scale essentially mean that the
more output a manufacturer

91
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,060
is producing, the more volume
they manufacture.

92
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,930
They're able to spread their
fixed costs over a high output

93
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:11,600
volume, which consequently
enables them to reduce costs

94
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,390
per item, per product that
they've manufactured.

95
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,870
And that's no different
in sales as well.

96
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:23,820
So you've seen here a very quick
example on economies of

97
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,800
scale and why products are
actually becoming cheaper the

98
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,540
more a manufacturer
is producing.

99
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,240
And it also applies to sales.

100
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,320
Or the more you buy, the cheaper
it becomes because,

101
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,820
obviously, more of your
risk involved.

102
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,772
