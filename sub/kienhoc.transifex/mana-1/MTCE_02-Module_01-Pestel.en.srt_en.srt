2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:08,960
All right.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,250
Welcome, everyone, to Module
number 2, where I'm going to

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,500
introduce quite a few management
tools to you.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,350
What I want to focus on in this
topic and the next one is

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,300
how to conduct a PESTEL
analysis.

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:28,970
PESTEL analysis is a very, very
useful tool to look at

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:33,790
the external environment and
here, looking at factors such

9
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:38,810
as the Political, Economic,
the Sociocultural, the

10
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,710
Technological, the Environment
itself, and the Legal

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,820
environment.

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,850
But let's kick off with the
political environment.

13
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,220
So let me illustrate that
here, political.

14
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,060


15
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,950
And what exactly are we looking
at when we look at the

16
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,910
political environment?

17
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,610
One crucial factor would
be, for example, taxes.

18
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,360
In Australia, the government
just introduced the mining

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,450
tax, which had quite a bit of
an impact on the big miners,

20
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,710
such as Rio Tinto and
BHP Billiton.

21
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:21,539
Other examples would be the
income tax of 75% for top

22
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,230
earners in France,
for example.

23
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,290
Another good example for taxes
that the government is

24
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,950
imposing is the goods and
services tax or the VAT, as

25
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,500
the Americans call it.

26
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,270
So basically that is just
increasing the price of goods

27
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,630
and services that consumers
purchase.

28
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,020
Here in Australia, we have a GST
of 10%, whereas in Europe

29
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,550
the GST, for example, in Germany
is 19%, which is twice

30
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,369
as high, and consequently makes

31
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,170
goods much more expensive.

32
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,990
Another area we'll be looking
in the political environment

33
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,020
would be tariffs.

34
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,610
Typical tariffs would
be import taxes.

35
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,830
For example, the government in
Germany is imposing import

36
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,829
taxes on cars from Japan.

37
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,910
And that makes quite sense,
because what they're trying to

38
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,420
do is they're trying
to protect the

39
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,359
car industry in Germany.

40
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,500
So here, the premium car
manufacturers, such as BMW,

41
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,370
Audi, Mercedes, Volkswagen,
Porsche, et cetera, are

42
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,810
protected by these taxes.

43
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,600
And consequently, if the
Japanese are trying to import

44
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,210
a Toyota or another Japanese
car, these cars become more

45
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:41,010
expensive and consequently less
attractive than German

46
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,959
manufactured cars.

47
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,670
Another example for a tariff
would be-- let's just think

48
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,010
about China.

49
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,570
A lot of things are manufactured
in China these

50
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:56,000
days, especially when we look
at clothing and at garments.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,060
And just imagine the Chinese
government is deciding at some

52
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:08,310
stage to impose a 20% tariff on
all exports to Europe, to

53
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,400
the US, to Asia Pacific, which
would basically mean that

54
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,580
goods that are being
manufactured in China that are

55
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,330
now exported or imported to
European countries will become

56
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,870
20% more expensive.

57
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,720
And 20% more on imports, that's
quite something that

58
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,430
organisations have to carry.

59
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,290
Another area you might want
to look at is regulations,

60
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,670
regulations such as trading
hours, for example.

61
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:45,220
Stores can't open in most
countries 24/7.

62
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:50,200
Other areas that you might want
to look into are working

63
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,260
hours of workers and employees,
which in some

64
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,890
countries, for example, in
France in some industry are

65
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,829
restricted to 35
hours per week.

66
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,790
Or look at Australia, the
regulations around selling and

67
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,239
promoting alcohol.

68
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,390
I guess the same applies
in the US.

69
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,209
Or looking at the plain
packaging regulation that was

70
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:15,440
just introduced for cigarettes
being sold in Australia.

71
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,050
So I think you start to get an
idea what we're looking at

72
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,860
when we're looking at the
political environment.

73
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,270
OK.

74
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,640
The next area that I would
like to look into is the

75
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,890
economic environment.

76
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,240


77
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,870
Economic.

78
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,600
There we go.

79
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,420
The economic environment is
pretty much concerned around

80
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,130
business and consumer
sentiment.

81
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,990
If business sentiment or
consumer sentiment are very

82
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,410
high, that is good times for
business, because consumers

83
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,850
and businesses are purchasing.

84
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,330
It sort of means we are
looking at the mood of

85
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,909
businesses or the mood
of consumers.

86
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,390
And if they're in a good mood,
if sentiment is high,

87
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,550
consequently their purchasing
product.

88
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,430
Now, the economy always
goes through cycles.

89
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,300
And I think you're all aware of
the global financial crisis

90
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,840
that we went through in 2007,
which has actually resulted

91
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,049
into recession in the US, in
Germany, lots of other

92
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,750
European countries.

93
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,900
And well, I can say in Australia
we were lucky.

94
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,210
We never had recession.

95
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,150
If you were to define recession,
just on the side,

96
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,060
it's actually two consecutive
quarters of negative

97
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,470
growth of the GDP.

98
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,420
And that basically means six
months of negative growth, or

99
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,600
decline in the GDP, and that
something Australia has

100
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,950
successfully circumnavigated
in the past few years.

101
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:54,300
During tough economic times that
we've seen in the past,

102
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,340
usually consumers sort of
reduce their spending on

103
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,900
discretionary items.

104
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,440
Discretionary items are
nonessential items that

105
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,540
consumers don't need.

106
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:14,780
And you could count under those
holidays, a big plasma

107
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,130
TV or LED TV, whatever the
new technology is.

108
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,240
These are all items you don't
necessarily need, but you

109
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,890
would like to have them.

110
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:27,010
Now if you're sure that you're
going to maintain your job for

111
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,800
the next couple of years and
everything is looking

112
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,870
prosperous, business are
growing, consequently

113
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:38,580
businesses spending money
and so do consumers.

114
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,280
I'll give you an example of
industries that are typically

115
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,799
affected by the economic
environment.

116
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,680
So have a look at the
recruitment industry.

117
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,280
Quite understandably, during
times of recession or economic

118
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,059
slowdown, companies
aren't recruiting.

119
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:00,180
So consequently, recruitment
companies are not selling

120
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,150
recruitment candidates
to organisations.

121
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,380
So their services will
be less in demand.

122
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,719
On the other hand, if we look
at sales of Domino's or

123
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,480
McDonald's, we saw that during
the recession that we've seen

124
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,510
in the US and in Europe, sales
of Domino's and McDonald's

125
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,760
have actually been
quite unaffected.

126
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,640
In fact, they have slightly
increased during that time.

127
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,590
So just to give you an idea,
recession is not necessarily

128
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,429
something that is negative
for all businesses.

129
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,660
Obviously fast food businesses
are probably

130
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,320
thriving in those times.

131
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,320
However, premium goods or luxury
good manufacturers are

132
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,050
having a hard time.

133
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,700
Let's now move on to the
social or sociocultural

134
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,950
environment.

135
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,920


136
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,860
The sociocultural environment,
what we're looking here at is,

137
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,540
for example, demographics.

138
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,000
When we're talking about
demographics, we mean age,

139
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,160
gender, education, income,
et cetera.

140
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,590
So in that respect we're also
looking at what's the size of

141
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,080
the family unit.

142
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,099
And if we have a look at family
units over the past 50

143
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,920
years, let's say, we
realise that family

144
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,760
units have become smaller.

145
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,789
There's hardly anyone out there,
especially in Europe or

146
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:32,820
in the US, if we exclude the
southern Mediterranean

147
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,390
European countries, where
grandma and grandpa are still

148
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,990
living with the family.

149
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,110
Family size is becoming
smaller and smaller.

150
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,930
Young couples are sort of
pushing the time when they

151
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,290
have children further
and further back.

152
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,050
And that has an impact on
businesses and the goods that

153
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,569
they're selling.

154
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,610
Also, the role of the woman.

155
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,250
The woman nowadays is not
staying at home anymore and

156
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,240
just looking after the kids.

157
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,240
Women are in the workforce.

158
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,730
And if you think about it, well,
who's doing the cooking?

159
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,530
Who's cleaning up the house?

160
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,990
Who's doing the ironing?

161
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,490
Who's looking after the kids?

162
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:16,310
Well, these are all services
that are highly in demand now

163
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:19,599
due to the change in the
sociocultural environment,

164
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,840
here just illustrating the
change that women now being in

165
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,520
the workforce, not staying at
home, and how that impacts on

166
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,640
the business environment
in general.

167
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,790
Another good example would
be an increase

168
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,730
of ready-to-go meals.

169
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,020
People are becoming increasingly
time poor.

170
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,280
It's all about time.

171
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,370
Time matters.

172
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,120
And you've probably heard
time is money, right?

173
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,670
So cooking at home for one hour
and relaxing after that

174
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,099
is not an option anymore.

175
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,060
You come home.

176
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,339
You quickly want to have food,
and then you want to have

177
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,750
leisure time or you want
to go to bed if you

178
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,050
work very long hours.

179
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:06,120
Consequently, the industry for
fast ready-to-go meals, so to

180
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,960
say, is growing.

181
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,280
And that is an industry
I would definitely

182
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,126
invest my money in.

183
00:10:12,126 --> 00:10:12,520
OK.

184
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,965
Now that we've discussed the
sociocultural environment,

185
00:10:14,965 --> 00:10:17,715
let's have a look at the
technological environment.

186
00:10:17,715 --> 00:10:21,360


187
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,080
Technology.

188
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,990
OK.

189
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:30,850
In terms of technology,
changes are so rapid.

190
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,250
Changes are pretty much
happening every day.

191
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:39,050
The iPad, the iPad mini, new
generations of the iPhone are

192
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,130
coming out.

193
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:44,620
The Australian government is
rolling out the NBN network,

194
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,940
which is enabling Australia to
have internet speeds of up to

195
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,080
100 megabits.

196
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:55,540
In that respect, technology is
making the world a smaller

197
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,819
place to do business in.

198
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,860
Online retailers around the
globe are succeeding in

199
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,750
selling goods not only in their
home country, in their

200
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,760
domestic area, but also
overseas and in

201
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,170
international markets.

202
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:17,060
Shipments, technology around
shipping products from A to B,

203
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,719
all this is going hand in hand
and is enabling businesses to

204
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,760
do business more easily
overseas.

205
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,860
And consequently, the
world is actually

206
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,480
becoming a smaller place.

207
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,780
Think about online retailing.

208
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:36,030
Think about the IT industries.

209
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,189
These are all industries
and areas

210
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,370
that are growing heavily.

211
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,230
OK.

212
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:46,000
Let's have a look at the
environment and how that

213
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,010
actually impacts
on businesses.

214
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,140
Well, just think about
climatic changes.

215
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:00,680
Here in Australia, we had very
dry periods, heatwaves.

216
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,469
There have been tornadoes,
cyclones.

217
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,470
And all this is happening
probably

218
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,320
due to climatic changes.

219
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,770
Now, obviously that impacts
on tourism.

220
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:18,740
And also if you think about the
industry that is selling

221
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,660
heaters, fans, and air
conditioning, of course the

222
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,430
climate, an increase in climate
or decrease, will

223
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,160
impact on these businesses.

224
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,790
So global warming is something
that is of interest for quite

225
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,480
a few businesses and
opens new doors.

226
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,680
The last area that I would like
to look at is the legal

227
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,510
environment.

228
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,180
So let's have a look at
the legal environment.

229
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,500
Now, you'll find that the legal
environment is sometimes

230
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,020
included in the political
environment.

231
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,220
But I would like to look at
it separately for now.

232
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,510
So under the legal environment,
we would have a

233
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:59,439
look at employment laws, for
example, consumer laws in

234
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,440
different countries, health
and safety regulations and

235
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,640
laws, taxation laws, and legal
obligations that come with an

236
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,920
organisation operating in
different countries.

237
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,699
To summarise I think you've
seen that the external

238
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,930
environment is quite big.

239
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,060
There are quite a few areas.

240
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,680
I've given that now a structure
with my PESTEL

241
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,800
analysis, so here again looking
at the Political, the

242
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,310
Economic, the Sociocultural,
the Technological, the

243
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,560
Environment itself, and
the Legal environment.

244
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,930
And I think you start to
understand that this kind of

245
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,729
framework is a very useful tool
if you want to have a

246
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,960
comprehensive overview and
analysis of the external

247
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,750
environment that a business
is operating in.

248
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,853
