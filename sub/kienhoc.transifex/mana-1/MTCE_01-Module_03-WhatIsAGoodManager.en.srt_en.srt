2
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,799
I would like to have
a look at different

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,630
kinds of managers now.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,550
So we can distinguish here
between top managers, middle

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,010
managers, first-line managers.

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,090
But we're also going to have a
quick look at team leaders.

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,130
When we're looking at top
managers' usual roles, we

8
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:30,040
would look at for example the
CEO, the Chief Executive

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:36,120
Officer, the CIO, the Chief
Information Officer, and

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,019
corporate heads of
an organisation.

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,690
If we look at middle management,
we're typically

12
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,250
here looking at a
factory manager,

13
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,250
at a regional manager.

14
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:55,720
And their task is actually
to build the strategy.

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,940
Or not so much build the
strategy, but achieve the

16
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,760
goals that have been defined
by top management.

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,039
First-line managers are
basically an office manager,

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,380
or a department manager,
or a supervisor.

19
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:16,440
And their job is pretty much
the daily operational

20
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,910
management in that sense.

21
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,850
And they're also there to
motivate their staff, and to

22
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,179
look after their staff,
and put certain

23
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,490
rewards into place.

24
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,199
Team leaders, obviously
they're leading teams.

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,660
And what they do, they're
ensuring that the goals and

26
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,310
objectives that have been,
again, identified by middle

27
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,800
management or top management
that they achieve these goals

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,480
in an effective and
efficient manner.

29
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,880
And, of course, that they are
there for their staff and for

30
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,800
their team members if they
have any issues.

31
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Let's have a look at the
different roles that actually

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,500
come with management.

33
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,820
And the four roles that I would
like to address are

34
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,679
first of all an interpersonal
role, but also an informal

35
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,280
role, a decisional role,
and a negotiator role.

36
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,930
An interpersonal role--

37
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,720
think of a manager like a
figurehead of an organisation.

38
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,490
They are a leader.

39
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,000
They are a person
to liaise with.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,700
They are pretty much the person,
if there is a meeting,

41
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,000
if problems are rising,
that are on the

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,250
front of the business.

43
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,970
An informal role could be
described like the manager

44
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,160
here being a disseminator
of information.

45
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,790
They make sure that they
monitor the external or

46
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,579
internal environment and take
actions accordingly, but

47
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,780
they're also a spokesperson
for the organisation.

48
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,120
A manager also has a
decisional role.

49
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,800
So here a manager would act as
an entrepreneur doing what's

50
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,070
right for the business.

51
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,970
They handle disturbances,
issues that have arised.

52
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,510
And they're also a resource
allocator, here negotiating

53
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,140
with different management
levels, ensuring that adequate

54
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:11,010
resources are, for example,
allocated to that team leader.

55
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,560
And there are also
negotiators.

56
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,170
You'll find yourself, if you are
in a management position,

57
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,339
that you're constantly
negotiating with different

58
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,150
parties internally within the
organisation, but also

59
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,550
externally with suppliers
and customers.

60
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,230
So what really defines
a good manager?

61
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:34,590
Well I would say the good
manager has technical skills,

62
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,430
interpersonal skills, and
conceptual skills, but is also

63
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,630
able to motivate staff.

64
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:46,000
Technical skills are obviously
necessary to demonstrate that

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,480
they're across what they're
actually managing.

66
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,609
That's in particular important
in Australia or in the US,

67
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,110
where managers should have
high technical skills.

68
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,310
Interpersonal skills, we
addressed that already.

69
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:05,260
Relating to people, coming
across as a person that is

70
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,790
easy to talk with.

71
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:12,510
And conceptual skills in terms
of being able to put the dots

72
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,480
together to analyse things
critically and taking the

73
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,040
right decisions.

74
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,029
And also being motivational.

75
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:24,170
So here motivating and ensuring
that everyone's on

76
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:28,700
board and that there is this
positive spirit that is pretty

77
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,870
much around them.

78
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,110
Managers that are appointed into
a management role, they

79
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,700
usually go through a
transition process.

80
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,500
At the beginning, these
managers will feel

81
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,550
like I'm the boss.

82
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,290
I need to tell people what
they have to do.

83
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,510
And this is how I do it,
my way or no way.

84
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,690
Usually within three or six
months they start to realise

85
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,410
that actually they had
probably some wrong

86
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,950
expectations.

87
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:04,180
Probably the workload was too
heavy that they've given to

88
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,160
their staff, to their
subordinates.

89
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,190
And they start to realise this
role is much more about

90
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,680
solving problems, dealing with
people, negotiating,

91
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,620
communicating and motivating
staff.

92
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:20,380
And consequently, after six
to 12 months, these newly

93
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,800
appointed managers move into
roles where they listen.

94
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,420
Where they develop and have
a strong interest

95
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,540
in developing others.

96
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:36,090
Where they control things and
they also ensure that stress

97
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,760
levels are adequate within their
team and the people that

98
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,740
they're managing.

99
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,240
And, of course, they come across
as a great motivator in

100
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,490
their role.

101
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,530
