3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,959
In this topic, I would like to
talk about communication.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,950
Communication is just
utterly important.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,700
And we talked about
communication before.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,540
So some managers actually spend
more than six hours a

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,290
day just communicating
with their staff.

8
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,000
Communication is important, for
example, if you want to

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
ensure that your team is
motivated, if you want to

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,720
provide positive or sometimes
also negative feedback.

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,879
And consequently, communication
is pretty much

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,940
omnipresent in pretty much
all management tasks.

13
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,959
Communication can happen face to
face, so if you're talking

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,140
face to face with someone.

15
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,870
You could just type a text
or an email, or you could

16
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,560
communicate over the phone,
via a video conference.

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:10,340
Or even body language is a
communication tool as well.

18
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:18,150
Now, what I would like to look
at are some common barriers to

19
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,030
communication.

20
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,455
And a fairly common
one is filtering.

21
00:01:23,455 --> 00:01:26,380


22
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:33,839
Filtering is basically the
concept of only communicating

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,250
what your boss, for example,
wants to hear.

24
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:41,895
Or you are communicating with
someone, and you realise,

25
00:01:41,895 --> 00:01:45,420
well, actually, I have to dim
that down a little bit so this

26
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,240
person actually understands
it.

27
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,250
So you're actively filtering
information to ensure that

28
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,110
this person actually understands
what you're

29
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,120
talking about.

30
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,510
Selective perception
is another one.

31
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,590


32
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:11,240
Selective perception pretty much
applies to the fact that

33
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,610
every person has sort of their
own bias and their own

34
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,910
motivation.

35
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,890
And consequently, they will
only listen to what really

36
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,609
interests them, or sometimes
what they want to hear.

37
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,060
So your selective perception
kicks in.

38
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,120
And it helps to understand that
not everyone's listening

39
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,790
to everything that
you are saying.

40
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,670
Sometimes people only listen to
actually what they want to

41
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,369
hear, and will retain
that information.

42
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,420
Another one is information
overload.

43
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:51,149
So information overload is
basically too much information

44
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,570
that you have to deal with.

45
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,239
Just imagine you are in a
meeting, and that meeting is

46
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,390
going on for four hours.

47
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,920
And consequently, you're not
able after half an hour to

48
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,049
retain all this information.

49
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,670
So what you would do in this
instance is you would take

50
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,030
notes, and also an agenda
of the meeting.

51
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,240
And some notes that you're
taking out of the meeting

52
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,830
after the meeting has finished
will greatly help you to avoid

53
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,940
an information overload.

54
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,320
The last barrier that
I would like to

55
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,910
discuss would be language.

56
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,560
I think that's a quite
obvious one.

57
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,490
Just try to think or remember
the last time that you went on

58
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,530
a holiday to a country
where they

59
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,370
didn't speak your language.

60
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,480
And just imagine you went to a
restaurant and you tried to

61
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,420
order food, and you couldn't
read the menu, nor could the

62
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,530
waiters speak the language.

63
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,380
And I guess it becomes really,
really difficult to order the

64
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:57,280
right food that you want to
order in that instance.

65
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,600
Give you another example for
problems in communication.

66
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,560
Just imagine employee who has
given the task by their

67
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,380
manager to manage a
certain project.

68
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,799
Now, that manager, he's
a good communicator.

69
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,500
He's following up on
many occasions.

70
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,620
And the employee is just
signalling yes, everything's

71
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,180
going fine, I'm on
track with that--

72
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,800
only to realise that at the very
last day when the project

73
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,720
was actually due that the work
hasn't been completed, not

74
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,670
even marginally completed.

75
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:42,050
I think that sort of illustrates
that communicating

76
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,460
is very important, but it's also
important that you create

77
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,780
an atmosphere that is open,
and where people can talk

78
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,729
about problems, where they
can be critical.

79
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,580
And that sort of ensures that
people also address problems

80
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,109
and come up with problems
as they appear.

81
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:08,630
Other examples would be think
about a manager has to fire an

82
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,430
employee for misconduct.

83
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,520
You wouldn't do that
via email.

84
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,510
That would be just not the
correct communication tool.

85
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:24,770
Other examples would be if you
have to communicate bad news.

86
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,990
What you would try to do is
communicate the bad news

87
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:33,680
first, and after that, you would
have some good news.

88
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,290
Just bear in mind when you are
communicating to management--

89
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:43,670
actually, a manager, in most
instances, will only retain

90
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,260
25% of the information
that you've just

91
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,520
communicated to them.

92
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,549
So what I tried to do here
is just give you a little

93
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,070
introduction into communication,
communications

94
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,330
management, and the importance
of open communication.

95
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,479
And we'll discuss that further
in our next topic.

96
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,730
s

00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,340
