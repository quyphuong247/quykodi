3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,060
Welcome to week four.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:10,930
I'm excited.

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,239
And this is your last module,
which will be around leading.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,990
Now in this topic we'll
address teamwork.

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,110
So what exactly is a team?

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:24,619
Well, a team is a group of
people that share a common

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,410
goal and they're collectively
working towards

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,900
achieving that goal.

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,580
And because they're working in
a team with different people,

12
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,080
they're usually very effective
and efficient in the work that

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,989
they're doing.

14
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,430
So it's important that they
do that cohesively.

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,610
That they put not themselves
first, but the task.

16
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:51,440
And for this topic, there are
differences between teamwork

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,599
and group work.

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,710
But for the sake of this topic,
we'll just put it into

19
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,100
one pot and treat it pretty
much as the same.

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,540
So let's have a look
at the positive

21
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,480
aspects of group work.

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:10,410
I think positive aspects are
that groups are a collective

23
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,750
group of individuals who
have different skills

24
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,810
and different knowledge.

25
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,330
And they sort of complement
each other.

26
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,570
So some team members are good at
some things, not so good at

27
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,389
other things.

28
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,170
And that's where another team
member comes in and sort of

29
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,000
complements that.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,800
Other advantages would be that
there is training provided

31
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
between team members.

32
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,000
Leadership roles can
rotate during the

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,880
group work or the teamwork.

34
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,899
And you get a lot of different
views and sort of different

35
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:50,990
levels of knowledge and points
of view into the work that

36
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,839
you're doing in a team.

37
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,030
Of course, group work isn't
that harmonious and

38
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,770
nice all the time.

39
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,330
There are some negative
aspects to it.

40
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,230
So for example, you have two
group members who are sort of

41
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,350
enforcing their point of view
onto other group members.

42
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,920
It sort of makes it difficult
for these other group members

43
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,559
to express their ideas.

44
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,760
Maybe you have a few group
members or team members that

45
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,299
don't contribute equally.

46
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,230
Things like that can
create conflict.

47
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,820
Maybe you have a high turnover
in your team--

48
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,900
team members dropping out, new
team members coming in, and

49
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,120
that can make it also
fairly difficult.

50
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,450
You'll find in a team you
have different opinions.

51
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,970
You have people with different
personality, and here you can

52
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,970
sometimes observe personality
clashes.

53
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,760
Or how people work in their work
styles, it doesn't really

54
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,410
fit and mould.

55
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:55,900
And obviously that becomes much,
much bigger and more

56
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,690
difficult to manage if we were
to look at cross-cultural

57
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,440
teams and teams here when
members actually come from

58
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,740
different cultural
backgrounds.

59
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,980
OK, now let's have a look at the
different types of teams.

60
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,820
There are, for example,
project teams or

61
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,310
work-related teams.

62
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,570
They usually have very little
input, I would say they have

63
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:24,549
no input at all in what they're
actually supposed to

64
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,460
do or the goals that
they have.

65
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,570
That will be defined by
senior management.

66
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:33,510
And basically that team is
then just on the task.

67
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,870
They don't make decisions
around it,

68
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,240
what has to be achieved.

69
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,040
There is very little or no
problem solving involved.

70
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,329
And again, there is very little
input from that team

71
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,390
when it comes to the actual
definition of the goal and

72
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,000
what they're supposed
to achieve.

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,880
Semi-autonomous teams,
they have an input on

74
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,910
what has to be done.

75
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,520
There's also problem solving
involved and they'll probably

76
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,360
sit down together with the
management team at the

77
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,280
beginning and define what
exactly needs to be done.

78
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,060
Then we also have
self-autonomous teams.

79
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,930
They give their own direction.

80
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,470
Just think of a management
consulting team coming into an

81
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,270
organisation and basically
telling management what they

82
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,659
have to do and how they
should do it.

83
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,840
And basically these are self-led
teams who will

84
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,880
identify their own goals,
problem solving, and they

85
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,880
operate pretty much without
supervision.

86
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,219
So now let's have a
look at what are

87
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,920
actually effective teams.

88
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,280
Effective teams are teams where
team members work well

89
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,729
with each other.

90
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,990
They are committed to the tasks
that they're completing.

91
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,410
And usually because they're
working very well with each

92
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,670
other, they are faster, more
effective, and more efficient

93
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,630
in what they do.

94
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,780
And this is mainly due to the
fact because they have

95
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,130
different skills that
come together.

96
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,810
Let me give you an
example here.

97
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,990
Just imagine a website needs
to be developed.

98
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,250
Now, first thing that you think
about is probably, OK,

99
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,120
it's a website.

100
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,680
We need a web developer
in our team.

101
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,920
And that's right.

102
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,500
But you shouldn't just have web
developers and people from

103
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,920
IT in that team.

104
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,880
You should probably also have
a marketing manager, because

105
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,460
that marketing manager, he
sort of understands how

106
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,609
customers tick and what kind of
message has to come across

107
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,910
with that website.

108
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,750
You probably need someone from
customer service who ensures

109
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,090
that the website is
customer friendly.

110
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,989
You also need someone from
finance in your team because,

111
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,790
obviously, you might have, well,
I'm pretty sure you will

112
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,380
have a budget with that.

113
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,750
And there is also sort of a
time frame around that.

114
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,540
So probably someone with project
management skills will

115
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,950
be very beneficial for that
project, developing

116
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,610
a website, as well.

117
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,180
So I think you see teams where
you have team members who

118
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,330
fulfil different roles and bring
in different skills and

119
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:19,539
knowledge are the good teams,
the very effective teams.

120
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,350
So in a nutshell, I would say
if we're talking about

121
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:28,130
effective teams there are three
main factors that are

122
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,060
really contributing to that.

123
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,120
So the first factor
is clear goals.

124
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,070
And remember, we discussed
smart objectives before.

125
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,120
So that comes in here as well.

126
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,830
So make sure that your team,
or the team that you're

127
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,950
working in, has a clear goal and
collectively everyone's on

128
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,860
board working towards
that goal.

129
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,706
So I've already used my second
term here, collectivism.

130
00:06:55,706 --> 00:07:02,310


131
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,500
So the opposite of collectivism
is, obviously,

132
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,730
individualism.

133
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,660
Now, in a team you need
to solve something

134
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,410
together as a group.

135
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:16,180
So individual approaches are
good, but they're only good if

136
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,240
it works together
with the team.

137
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,160
And sometimes you need to give
in and sort of comply and do

138
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,940
what's better for the
team as a whole.

139
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,719
And one last thing that I find
extremely crucial in good

140
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,150
teamwork and having an
effective team is

141
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,400
communication.

142
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,900


143
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:43,659
Communication is, for
me, a main criteria

144
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,190
in effective teamwork.

145
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,410
If there are no good
communication flows, no matter

146
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:55,080
whether it's face to face or if
it's in writing via email

147
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,719
or in meetings, you need to
communicate on all ends very

148
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,360
well in a team so everyone
knows what

149
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,620
the others are doing.

150
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,180
OK.

151
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,120
So to summarise, effective
teams are teams that have

152
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,920
clear goals.

153
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,360
They work collectively on
achieving these goals.

154
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,610
And they also communicate
very well.

155
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,645
