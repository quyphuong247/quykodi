2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,620
In the previous topic, you had
an overview of what actually a

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,280
PESTEL Analysis is.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,439
What I would like to do now is
to give you an idea that this

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,810
is not all some abstract
management stuff that only

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,070
managers do.

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,650
We're actually going to apply
that to the airline industry.

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,459
So I'm going to give you a
practical example, and

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,880
consequently what you can do
then is apply that to your

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,460
industry or to your business.

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,790
So let's have a look at the
political environment, and how

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,153
that actually impacts on
the airline industry.

13
00:00:41,153 --> 00:00:43,830


14
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:51,940
If you look at the airline
industry and the regulations

15
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,750
that actually are coming into
place by the government, you

16
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:03,280
could observe that airport
landing slots could change.

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,160
For example, airport times and
when airlines are actually

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,810
allowed to land at the airport
could be restricted until 11

19
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,310
o'clock or 12 o'clock, dependent
on the governmental

20
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,080
body on the country or even
the state behind it.

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,620
There are taxes that airlines
have to pay--

22
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,490
there are landing challenges,
there are capacity

23
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,000
restrictions.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,760
And airlines are also very
sensitive to oil prices.

25
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,680
So especially the political
conflict that we're seeing in

26
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,990
the Middle East is affecting oil
prices, consequently it's

27
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,710
affecting the airline
industry.

28
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:48,419
If we look at the economic
environment and how that

29
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,270
impacts on the airline industry,
it's pretty much

30
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,410
straight forward.

31
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,420
As the economy's going well,
more people fly, business

32
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,600
flourishes, more business
flights are undertaken.

33
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,690
People have more money in their
pockets, they go on

34
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,520
holiday, so consequently the
airline industry is booming.

35
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,948
Whereas during recessionary
periods in the economy, or

36
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:12,430
during economic slowdown,
obviously not that many

37
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,980
people, not that many business
travellers are taking flights.

38
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,130
If we look at the social culture
environment, it's

39
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,850
quite interesting.

40
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:27,299
I used to fly business probably
10-15 years ago, and

41
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,460
it was pretty cool having a
business class airline ticket

42
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,630
in your pocket sitting there.

43
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,650
And everyone could see wow, this
guy spent a lot of money

44
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,680
on his fight.

45
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,420
I realise it's much, much cooler
to go with a low-frill

46
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,200
airline and actually just
spend $1 on a flight and

47
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,869
announce that loudly
in the lounge.

48
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,610
And I guess business travellers
are thinking twice

49
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,630
about whether it's actually
that important to fly

50
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,859
business, or if it's actually
cooler flying

51
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,410
low-frill for $1.

52
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,460
If we look at the technological
environment,

53
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,470
obviously technology has
changed dramatically.

54
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:14,175
Who would have thought about 10
years ago, 15 years ago, or

55
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:18,030
even five years ago that we can
board airplanes using our

56
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,260
laptop and Wi-Fi on them?

57
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,899
And even if we board,
we board with our

58
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,440
iPhone, we have barcode.

59
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,550
And even when we book flights,
we can now cut out the

60
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,370
middlemen and basically book
directly with the airline.

61
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,920
Technology enabled all
this, and there are

62
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,260
changes as you can see.

63
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:45,709
If we look at the environment,
not the economic one, we had

64
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:49,650
that earlier, here for
example the weather--

65
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,050
snow storms, blizzards,
flooding.

66
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,740
That all has an impact,
obviously, on airlines.

67
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:05,000
And despite the fact that these
are things, events that

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,030
airlines have no control over,
consumers are still getting

69
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,870
upset when their flights
are being delayed.

70
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,420
So other areas where the
environment comes into play

71
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,060
would be the carbon emission
rules and a

72
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,510
pricing around that.

73
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,260
And also, more and more
people going green.

74
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,210
So you might have seen when you
tried to book your last

75
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,680
flight, you can pay some
extra to fly green.

76
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,350
If we look at the legal
environment, well, there are

77
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:40,080
quite a few regulatory burden
for airlines which is

78
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,760
increasing operational costs.

79
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,740
Just look at 9/11--

80
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,960
the restrictions that we're
seeing now in airports and

81
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,390
security screening has an impact
on turnaround times.

82
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:55,310
And another impact would be,
in my opinion, much, much

83
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,850
tighter compensation laws, for
example, for consumers and

84
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,670
businesses if flights are being
cancelled or if flights

85
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,920
are being delayed.

86
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,700
So in summary, I think
we've ticked it off.

87
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,560
We've had a look at the
political, the economic, the

88
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,780
social cultural, the
technological, the

89
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,650
environmental and the
legal environment.

90
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,659
And I think you got an idea
that's not some theory that's

91
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,020
just floating around, it's
actually very useful.

92
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,447
