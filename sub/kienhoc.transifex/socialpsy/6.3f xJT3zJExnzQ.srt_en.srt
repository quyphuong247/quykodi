00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,920
Imagine you are out in your neighbourhood collecting for your favourite charity.

1
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,420
You knock on someone’s door and they don’t seem like they want to talk to you about making

2
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,019
a donation.

3
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:19,380
You might reassure the person that “Even a very small donation would help!”.

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,000
This makes it very difficult to refuse without appearing unhelpful, after all, who can’t

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,570
make a small donation to help out?

6
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,550
It’s important that you are not specifically asking for a small amount, it simply reduces

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,970
the individual’s ability to give nothing at all and still see themselves as a helpful

8
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,300
individual.

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,200
People still tend to give the typical amount they would otherwise give.

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,760
What if you are on the receiving end of a request to make a donation?

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,680
You’ve just got home from work or study, you’re tired and maybe a bit grumpy.

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,730
The phone rings, and it’s a caller from a charity, and you know they are going to

13
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,730
ask for a donation.

14
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,010
It’s the last thing you want to be doing right now.

15
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,900
Instead of coming straight out with the request for a donation, the caller instead asks you

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,620
a different question… they ask “How are you feeling this evening?”

17
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,670
Now, there are schemas, or scripts that we follow when someone asks us how we are feeling.

18
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:14,080
We rarely ever say how we are really feeling, especially if it is a stranger.

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,720
The general social rule is to reply with something like “I’m fine!”, or “I’m well,

20
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,290
thanks”, or perhaps even “Couldn’t be better!”.

21
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,740
Unfortunately, once you give one of these polite responses, you are totally trapped.

22
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,160
Typically, the caller will quickly reply, “We’ll I’m glad that you are well, but

23
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,920
there are a lot of people who are doing much worse than you…and they could use your help.”

24
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,350
This is sometimes called the “How are you feeling” technique, and works on the principle

25
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,659
that once you have said you are going well, it is more difficult to appear stingy when

26
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:47,840
you are asked to help others less fortunate than yourself.

27
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,476
A good example of this is in a study by Howard (1990).

28
00:01:51,476 --> 00:01:56,110
In that study, the researchers called homeowners to ask if they would agree to allow a representative

29
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:01,130
of Hunger Relief Committee to come to their house and sell fundraising biscuits.

30
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,610
When tried on its own, this request received only 18% agreement.

31
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,879
However, when the researchers used the “how are you feeling” technique, 32% of the people

32
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:16,940
now agreed to the request and 89% of these agreed to purchases some biscuits when the

33
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,490
representative actually turned up.

34
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:25,000
So, this consistency technique puts the person in a situation where if they refuse the request

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
that would be inconsistent with the characteristics or values that we just made them think about.
