0
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,660
Do we just passively observe the social

1
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,820
world? Obviously not. The way we perceive

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,490
the social world is motivated by me to

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,199
predict and control and social

4
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,330
environment. We want to be able to work

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,150
out why people behave the way they do so

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,740
that we can maximize the chance that

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,570
something good will happen to us and

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,340
minimize the chance that something bad

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,650
will happen to us. To understand the

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,630
behavior of others and ourselves

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,510
actually, we try to infer the cause of

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,500
the behavior.

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,329
This process is called attribution.

14
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,809
According to Heider, we try to attribute

15
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:41,640
a behavior to a cause that is either

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,940
external or internal to the actor. An

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,280
external cause could be a stimuli that

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,530
was in the environment. Heider called

19
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,710
these situational factors. We learn the

20
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,420
sorts of behaviors that most people

21
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,370
perform in different situations.

22
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,829
Basically we develop schemas associated

23
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,500
with situations. When a person&#39;s behavior

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,270
is different from what is expected in a

25
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,880
schema we can make what is called an

26
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,150
internal attribution. An internal cause

27
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,680
would be one that is related to a

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,170
person&#39;s personality characteristics or,

29
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,600
in Heider&#39;s terms, dispositional factors.

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,540
Now Heider was thinking about how we

31
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,670
attribute causes for single behaviors

32
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,799
that we observe. It&#39;s quite common that

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,570
we get to see a person behave more than

34
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,340
once, however, especially our work

35
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,430
colleagues, friends and family. In this

36
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,259
instance we have more information than

37
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,090
just our schema associated with the

38
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,979
context that the behavior is performed

39
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,400
in. Kelley&#39;s covariation model describes

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,020
the sorts of additional information that

41
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,790
we have been observing multiple

42
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,100
behaviours, and how we can use that

43
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,439
information to make different types of

44
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,290
attributions. The idea that Kelley

45
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,149
proposed was that we attribute a behavior

46
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:53,729
to the cause with which it co-varies over

47
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:56,579
time. This is called the covariation

48
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,610
principle. To help us do this

49
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,439
Kelley thought that we paid attention to

50
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,170
three particular types of information.

51
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,479
The first of these is consensus

52
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,670
information, which is whether other

53
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,340
people perform the same behavior or not.

54
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,480
The second type of information is

55
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,400
is distinctiveness information,

56
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,950
and this is whether the behavior is only

57
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,200
performed towards this particular target

58
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,390
or person, or whether it&#39;s performed

59
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,840
towards other targets as well. The final

60
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,519
type of information that helps us make

61
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:29,409
an attribution according to this model

62
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:32,500
is consistency information. Which is

63
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,870
whether the behavior is performed all

64
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,799
the time or not. So, the three types of

65
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:40,450
attributions that we could make using

66
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,790
this information are a person attribution,

67
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,970
a target attribution and a situational

68
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,879
attribution. A person attribution is when

69
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,500
we attribute the cause of the behavior

70
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,200
to the person performing the behavior. We

71
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,150
would make this attribution when there

72
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,829
is information about a low level of

73
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,959
consensus in performing the behavior.

74
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,410
This person performs the behavior but not

75
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,260
other people. We can make a target

76
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,790
attribution when there&#39;s information

77
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,890
that the behavior is highly distinctive.

78
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,290
That is, we would say that the person who

79
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,970
is the target, or the recipient of the

80
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,459
behavior, is the cause when the behavior

81
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:17,950
is enacted towards this target, but

82
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,260
not other targets.

83
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,239
Finally, we could make a situational

84
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,639
attribution when that behavior is due to

85
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,980
something in the context or situation,

86
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,079
when there&#39;s low consistency in

87
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,549
performing the behavior.

88
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:32,290
This means that the behavior is

89
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,750
performed in some contexts or situations,

90
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,069
but not others.

91
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:38,260
So you can see that when something

92
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,239
covaries with the behavior, either the

93
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,069
person performing the behavior, the

94
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:44,019
target or the recipient of the behavior,

95
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:45,910
or the situation that the behavior is

96
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,669
performed, in we see that thing as the

97
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:51,549
cause of the behavior. So let&#39;s look at

98
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:53,049
an example that makes this a bit more

99
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:58,380
concrete.
