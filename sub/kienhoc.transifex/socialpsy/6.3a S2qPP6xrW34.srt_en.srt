00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:11,099
Have you ever found yourself knee-deep in a job that keeps getting bigger and bigger,

1
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,740
but you stick with it despite the fact that it’s now much more effort than it’s worth?

2
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,640
Why wouldn’t you just quit?

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,820
Well, we strive to be consistent in life.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,290
And this is a powerful motivator both of our thoughts and behaviours.

5
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:31,149
Consistency is the second of the six principles of influence that Cialdini identified.

6
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:36,020
We see lots of evidence of this in studies looking at attitude-behaviour relations.

7
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,930
According to both Festinger’s (1957) cognitive dissonance theory and Heider’s (1957) balance

8
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,910
theory, we are strongly motivated to maintain a consistent set of thoughts.

9
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,680
Festinger thought that inconsistency was actually aversive, or uncomfortable, and the drive

10
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,740
to restore consistency was similar to our drive to satisfy our hunger and thirst.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,570
It’s not just the drive to be consistent that influences us.

12
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:04,140
According to Roy Baumeister (1982) the desire to appear consistent is also very influential.

13
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,060
So, after committing yourself to a thing or position, you should be more willing to comply

14
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,330
with requests for behaviours that are consistent with that position.

15
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,250
There are a number of different ways that consistency can influence us, or ways that

16
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,210
we can use consistency to influence other people.

17
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,530
The first of the consistency techniques that we are going to talk about is called the ‘foot

18
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,370
in the door technique’, which is a two-step procedure.

19
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,440
You start off by asking for something small, something that people are almost certainly

20
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,190
going to say yes to.

21
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,920
And once you’ve locked them in with that very small favor, you crank it up.

22
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,090
 You ask the real favour, which is much bigger.

23
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,090
Then they really feel pressured to agree.

24
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,650
For example, if anybody has ever asked you, “Do you mind coming around to help me shift

25
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,010
my couch?”

26
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,780
Before you know it, they’re asking you to help to move the entire house.

27
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,180
If so, then you’ve been a victim of the “foot in the door” technique.
