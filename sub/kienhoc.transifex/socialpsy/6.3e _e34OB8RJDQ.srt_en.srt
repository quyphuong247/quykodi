00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:12,490
So, we’ve seen so far how commitment strategies are used very effectively by marketers, but

1
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,860
consistency technique has also been used to “brainwash” American prisoners of war

2
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,939
during the Korean War.

3
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:23,080
In this war, the communists in Korea were backed by the Chinese communists fighting

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,240
the West.

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,310
It was a terrible long war, and millions of people died.

6
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,910
Let’s fast-forward through all that, and get to the end.

7
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,160
American soldiers who have been held captive by the enemy are starting to come home, and

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,470
people start to notice this bizarre thing which is that many of them came home with

9
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:45,630
pro-communist attitudes, and many of those people it turned out, had collaborated with

10
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,480
the enemy.

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,700
This is really bizarre because that’s not something that American soldiers were known

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,700
for.

13
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,960
In World War 2, in the face of brutal treatment by the Japanese soldiers, there was very little

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,610
collaboration with the enemy, very little betrayal and yet here it was quite high.

15
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,150
Something that really concerned people was that it wasn’t every Prisoner of War or

16
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,680
POW camp that was effective in doing this.

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,870
For the Korean-run POW camps, those soldiers came back relatively normal.

18
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:19,470
It was the Chinese-run POW camps that seemed to cause these conversions into communist

19
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,540
sympathisers.

20
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,960
The American officials panicked.

21
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,950
They’re like, “What is the secret of these Chinese that allows them to brainwash the

22
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:28,960
soldiers?”

23
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,990
The CIA had people within their organisations doing crazy experiments on telepathy, hypnosis,

24
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:41,110
LSD, and all sorts of crazy things, trying to work out what this mind power was.

25
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,190
Turns out the Chinese weren’t using LSD to brainwash.

26
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,250
It wasn’t hypnosis.

27
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,900
It’s just straightforward social psychology.

28
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,550
What the Korean soldiers were doing, which was ineffective, remember, is classic torture

29
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:59,490
techniques: beating people up, depriving them of sleep, putting a gun to their heads, screaming

30
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,850
abuse at them, trying to get them to shout out communist propaganda.

31
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,909
You can pretty much get people to say anything with a gun pointed at your head.

32
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:11,620
That’s not a particularly good influence technique because as soon as the gun is gone,

33
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,530
those people are just going to go back to their original attitudes.

34
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,750
What the Chinese interrogators did is quite different though.

35
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,300
They had quiet conversations with the captives, and they tried to get them to admit to something

36
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:30,281
mildly pro-communist, or mildly anti-American, such as asking them “Can you admit that

37
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:32,810
America is not perfect?”

38
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,060
This didn’t seem like such a big deal.

39
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,660
People would go, “No country is perfect, so, yes, I guess I can admit that.”

40
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,560
And they’re like, “Really?

41
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,560
How?

42
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,640
You must have reasons.”

43
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,430
They might come up with three or four reasons why America is not perfect.

44
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,490
And they’re like, “Okay, what you just told me, do you mind writing that down in

45
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,349
bullet points?”

46
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:58,670
Now you’re writing down three or four problems of America.

47
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:03,380
“Okay, well, that was kind of helpful, but maybe it would be even better if you just

48
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,910
elaborate on those bullet points.

49
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,849
Now just turn it into an essay.”

50
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:10,239
Can you see what’s happening?

51
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,480
Remember, there’s no gun pointed at your head, no threat, no rewards.

52
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,640
You find yourself writing this anti-American essay.

53
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,330
“Do you mind reading out that essay to me?”

54
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:24,761
So, you’re reading it, and they record it, and they play it back to you.

55
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:30,660
You hear your own words, and they play it back over the loudspeakers in the POW camps.

56
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,820
Everyone around you can hear you reading out that essay, and you have to try and make sense

57
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,349
of that: “Why did I do that?”

58
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:41,379
Often, if you find yourself behaving in a certain way that seems different from your

59
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:45,990
self-image, your self-image can shift to align with that behavior.

60
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,510
People start to see themselves potentially as communist.

61
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:54,620
They start to see themselves as potentially collaborators and work from that.

62
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,140
By the way, if you’re wondering if any of this can be used for something positive in

63
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,230
this day and age, there’s another study.

64
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,700
The American Cancer Foundation relies on door knockers to get money.

65
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,711
They were struggling to find volunteers, and they approached the social psychologist, and

66
00:04:09,711 --> 00:04:12,310
he said, “Leave it with me.”

67
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,500
What he did is he rang a whole bunch of people in a community and pretended to be asking

68
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,329
them this personality questionnaire.

69
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:25,470
One of the questions was, “Imagine, hypothetically, a charity calls you and wants to know if you

70
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,969
are prepared to donate some of your time to do door knocking.

71
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,969
What do you think you’d say?”

72
00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:33,960
Now, imagine if you got that question in a phone survey.

73
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,150
I don’t know what kind of person you are?

74
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,740
Maybe you would do that; maybe you wouldn’, but I’m pretty positive that you’d like

75
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,749
to think of yourself as the kind of person who would do that.

76
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:48,120
Many people would say, “Yes, yes, I think actually, I think I would.”

77
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,069
Now, of course, a few days later, the American Cancer Foundation actually rings asking for

78
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:56,639
door knockers, and of course, you say yes.

79
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,449
 Turns out, this intervention was successful in increasing volunteerism by 700 percent.

80
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:08,139
It’s really cheap as chips to make this additional call ahead as an intervention,

81
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:10,710
but it gives a massive payoff.

82
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,400
So, the consistency technique can be really effective when it’s possible to point out

83
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,580
an existing commitment or belief that’s consistent with the request being made.

84
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,729
Basically, what you do is make an existing commitment more salient.

85
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:29,900
When we do this, our desire for consistency then influences our behaviour so that it is

86
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,050
more in line with our past behaviours.
