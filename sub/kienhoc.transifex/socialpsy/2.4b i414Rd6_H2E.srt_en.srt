00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:09,320
People have their own theories about how liars behave.

1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,260
You’ve probably got some ideas about what to look for.

2
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,910
Maybe people look up and to the left when they are about to lie?

3
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,039
Maybe they fidget more?

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,840
Maybe they pause before they start speaking?

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,860
Well, researchers have their own theories about deception too.

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,820
The first is the emotional approach, proposed by Paul Ekman (1985).

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:32,460
This perspective suggests being deceptive causes certain physiological reactions such

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,840
as high blood pressure and increased heart rate.

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,380
These reactions are the result of heightened arousal associated with guilt, fear or perhaps

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,380
excitement.

11
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:47,350
It is also this arousal which is thought to affect nonverbal behaviour.

12
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,900
The second theory is Burgoon and colleagues cognitive approach (Burgoon et al., 1989).

13
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:56,399
According to this perspective, being deceptive is a cognitively complex task, and because

14
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,850
of the cognitive load associated with deception, body language gets neglected.

15
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:07,220
As a result, there is a reduction in the overall amount of movement, slower speech, and more

16
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,040
pauses in speech.

17
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,420
The final theory is DePaulo’s attempted control approach (DePaulo, 1992), or the self-presentation

18
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,680
perspective.

19
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,110
It argues that deceivers will try to control their behaviour, but because they are not

20
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:26,750
very practised at being deceptive, their behaviour appears more rigid and inhibited.

21
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,500
The interesting thing is that these three approaches all predict that different, and

22
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,870
sometimes contradictory, behaviours are markers of deception.

23
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:39,160
The emotional approach predicts that increased movements are associated with being deceptive.

24
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,990
The emotional and cognitive approaches predict an increase in speech disturbances.

25
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,380
Whereas the attempted control approach suggests that there should be a reduction in movement

26
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,680
and speech.

27
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,610
So, what actually happens when people are deceptive?

28
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,130
Well, that depends on the type of lie that is being told.

29
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,520
Let me explain.

30
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,330
We know what people do when they lie and what people do when they don’t lie because you

31
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:06,659
can do that in a lab: Get people to come in and tell a story that’s theirs or tell a story

32
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,869
as though it’s them but it wasn’t, or get people to say what they think about capital

33
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:16,200
punishment versus saying the opposite of what they think about capital punishment.

34
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,920
In DePaulo and colleague’s 1989 study, deception was associated with more speech disturbances

35
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,380
and slower speech rate.

36
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:29,480
In Vrij’s 1995 study however, people showed fewer speech disturbances and faster speech

37
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,050
rate when being deceptive.

38
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,750
One of the reasons for these differences is that the rate of speech and number of disturbances

39
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,920
depends on the type of lie that is being told.

40
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,500
Making up information, rather than just concealing the truth, is harder to do and so leads to

41
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,780
more speech disturbances and slower speech rate.

42
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:54,020
Vrij’s 1995 study also tells us that when people are being deceptive, they move less,

43
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,980
they don’t move their arms, the feet and legs so much.

44
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:03,709
Despite what you might think, that study also showed that gaze, smiling, shifting position

45
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:06,640
are not really reliable indicators of deception.

46
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,240
So, the old adage about looking up and to the left as a marker of deception is probably

47
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,780
not supported by the results of research.

48
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,069
One thing that most studies agree on however, is that voice pitch does seem to be a pretty

49
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:21,379
reliable indicator of deception.

50
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:24,330
It tends to go up when people are lying.

51
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,040
The interesting thing is that we can control some of our nonverbal behaviour better than

52
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,140
others.

53
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,970
Maybe you can hide your guilty little smile.

54
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,920
Or stop yourself from wringing your hands, or jiggling your legs.

55
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,980
There are certain things you can’t control so well.

56
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,489
You can’t control the voice.

57
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:41,230
It’s through the voice that you give the game away.

58
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,710
In fact, people are somewhat better at telling whether other people are lying if they’re

59
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:49,550
talking to them on the phone than if they’re talking to them face to face.

60
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,650
But why would that be?

61
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,400
Well, because when we talk to them face to face, we’re distracted by all these things

62
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,340
that we think give the game away but don’t, like the restlessness, the shiftiness, the

63
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,340
smiling.

64
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,349
On the phone, you’ve got no choice but to listen to the voice.

65
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:10,769
That’s when you focus on the voice, and people are a little bit better at detecting deception

66
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:12,170
when they listen to the voice.
