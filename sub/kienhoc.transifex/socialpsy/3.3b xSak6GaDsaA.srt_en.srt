00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,440
Psychology stumbled upon this phenomenon of people thinking they are better than they

1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,809
actually are - and the evidence started mounting up in the 1970s.

2
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:20,310
Early on, somebody did a survey asking people to rate how good they were at driving.

3
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,770
Ninety percent (90%) of the people said they were above average.

4
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,140
So, they thought that was funny.

5
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,420
But then they found the same pattern in all these different studies with different phenomena.

6
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,960
So, yes, the average person thinks he or she is above average in lots of different ways.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,880
And at some point, surveying all the literature, psychologists came to the conclusion let’s

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,140
put these together there are three of what they call Positive Illusions - where people

9
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,790
generally overestimate the positivity of their lives.

10
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,730
So the first one is simply rating your abilities and your successes as higher than they really

11
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:53,730
are.

12
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,520
You downplay your faults and your failures, and you overestimate all your good points.

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,950
That’s one way you end up thinking you’re a more capable and successful person than

14
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,070
the facts would warrant.

15
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:08,280
The second positive illusion is that we overestimate how much control we have over life.

16
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,009
People tend to think they can steer their fate and produce the results that they want.

17
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:14,219
They can get where they want to go.

18
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:15,469
They can take charge.

19
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:20,090
So, when people estimate how much they are in control of their own fates, people overestimate

20
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,159
how much control they have.

21
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,079
This is borne out even in very carefully controlled laboratory studies - where you can make the

22
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:32,490
outcome partly a result of what the person does and partly by random chance the laboratory

23
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,359
computer controls and ask them how much.

24
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,469
People don’t acknowledge the random chance aspect of the computer as much.

25
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:41,649
Rather I should say most people don’t do that.

26
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:46,971
It turns out that people who are experiencing depression tend to be more accurate, now this

27
00:01:46,971 --> 00:01:47,971
is interesting.

28
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:53,289
Back in the 1960s, when psycho-therapists began to look for new ways of treating depression,

29
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:58,170
they thought, how can we change their thinking style, these people are twisting everything

30
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,280
into a negative frame, how can we get them to stop doing that.

31
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,270
If we could only get them to see the world more accurately, they would stop being depressed.

32
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,929
But then researchers began to find that depressed people were seeing things accurately.

33
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:15,430
It was the non-depressed, the seemingly mentally healthy people, they’re the ones that are

34
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,629
twisting things.

35
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:18,290
But in a positive way.

36
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,450
The third positive illusion is optimism.

37
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,680
People are unrealistically optimistic.

38
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,000
They think good things are more likely to happen to them than to the average person,

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,819
and bad things are less likely.

40
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:32,980
People have been asked in studies questions like, what are the odds that you’ll get

41
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,560
a big promotion at work someday, what are the odds that you’ll ever get sacked from

42
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,340
work, and what are the chances that you’ll have a happy marriage, and what are the chances

43
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,209
you’ll get a divorce, and so on, over and over.

44
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:47,599
And people say compared to others, the chances are more good things will happen to me and

45
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,439
fewer bad things will happen to me.

46
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:55,230
Again, we don’t know which people are distorting, but we know people in general - the average

47
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,420
person - is overestimating their good qualities and their positive future.
