Let’s take a look at what they found.

1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,990
On the y-axis we have the percentage of conformity.

2
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,240
And on the x-axis we have the three different levels of fear.

3
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,410
When Janis and Feshbach (1953) looked at the net change in conformity with the dental hygiene

4
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,720
recommendations in the persuasive message, they found that it was actually the group

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,160
of participants who received the low fear message who went along with the message the

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,430
most.

7
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:35,539
These results suggest that fear can have the opposite effect that to what we want.

8
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:38,480
Researchers call this a “boomerang effect”.

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,480
This seems surprising.

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,969
You might have expected that the high fear message would produce the most conformity.

11
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:49,370
But it seems that a high fear message can sometimes result in increased resistance from

12
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,819
the audience as they try to block out the fear-inducing message.

13
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:57,870
This is not always the case however, and other researchers have found the opposite pattern

14
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,160
of results, with high fear messages being more persuasive.

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,980
It turns out that it depends on whether you provide information about how to effectively

16
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:12,140
respond to the fear inducing threat that’s included in the persuasive message.

17
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:18,690
Exactly how to do this was set out in 1983 by Rogers in a revision of Protection motivation

18
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:19,870
theory.

19
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:25,070
According to Rogers, for fear to increase the persuasiveness of a message, the message

20
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:30,670
needs to tell you that the threat is severe, that it can affect you, but that there is

21
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,920
an effective behaviour to avoid the danger posed by the threat, and that your able to

22
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,259
perform whatever behaviour that is.
