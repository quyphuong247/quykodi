00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,210
One of the first studies to look at how things related to the person who communicates a message

1
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:16,660
might influence us was conducted by Hovland and Weiss in 1951.

2
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:22,110
It’s not really that surprising that we would assume that people high in credibility

3
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,230
would be more persuasive compared to communicators who were lower in credibility.

4
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:32,230
This seems like common sense, and is probably why advertisers often have actors wearing

5
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:37,730
white laboratory coats and safety glasses talk about the benefits of particular moisturisers

6
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:38,930
and other beauty products.

7
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:44,360
They try to make the actor look like a scientist because that seems more credible.

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,479
To test this idea, Hovland and Weiss asked participants to read an article about the

9
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,360
practicality of building a nuclear-powered submarine.

10
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:58,860
Now, keep in mind that at this point in time, which was the early 1950’s, no such submarines

11
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,260
existed.

12
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,920
In fact, while construction of the first nuclear powered submarine was coincidentally authorised

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,620
in 1951––the USS Nautilus––it did not set out to sea until early in 1955.

14
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,170
Hovland and Weiss told half of their participants that this message came from a source high

15
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:24,920
in credibility––Robert Oppenheimer, a famous and respected physicist who had been

16
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,680
involved in the development of the atomic bomb.

17
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,920
He was sometimes called the father of the atomic bomb because he led the effort at the

18
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,450
Los Alamos laboratory.

19
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,100
The other half of the participants were told that the message came from the Soviet newspaper

20
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:48,560
Pravda, which to the American research participants would have been a source that was low in credibility.

21
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,910
To measure how much participants were persuaded by the message, they were asked to say how

22
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,570
practical it was to build a nuclear-powered submarine.

23
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:01,130
After waiting four weeks, Hovland and Weiss got back in touch with the participants and

24
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:07,020
asked them a second time how practical it was to build a nuclear-powered submarine.

25
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,030
So, what do you think they found?

26
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,000
Which communicator was more persuasive at each time?
