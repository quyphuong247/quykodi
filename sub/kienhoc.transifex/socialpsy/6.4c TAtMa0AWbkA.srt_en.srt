BLAKE MCKIMMIE: Well, thanks for joining us, Yolanda.

1
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,630
JOLANDA JETTEN: You&#39;re welcome.

2
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:13,280
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: So, we&#39;ve been hearing in the course about Asch&#39;s Law and Length study, and how

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,690
people sometimes go along with the group.

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:21,320
And often, how that&#39;s interpreted is that people conform-- the majority of the people

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,470
conform, at least some of the time, to the group.

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,390
Is that the main message we should take away from that study?

7
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,730
JOLANDA JETTEN: Yeah, I guess.

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:35,670
The studies have always been seen as showing in a very powerful way how important it is

9
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,660
for people to fit in, to be part of something, and how stressed they actually get when they

10
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,050
feel that their responses are not aligned with others.

11
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:50,610
So, they are even happy to sort of go along with a majority that&#39;s clearly incorrect.

12
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,010
So if that means that they can just don&#39;t have to stand out as the only person who says

13
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,430
something different.

14
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,370
So that that is a very powerful demonstration of a conformity effect.

15
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:06,689
But it is interesting that if you actually look at the studies, and the way that also

16
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:12,821
Asch wrote about that, it&#39;s very clear that there is a lot going on in that study, and

17
00:01:12,821 --> 00:01:15,460
there&#39;s a lot more to say about their studies.

18
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:21,530
One of the interesting things is, for instance, that Asch was talking after the study, to his

19
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,829
participants, and asked them, so, how did you go?

20
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:26,350
Well, what did you think was going on?

21
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:32,009
And, it is interesting that-- well, I mean interesting, also, but sad in a way-- that

22
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:40,079
participants felt quite upset, they were very distressed, and in very different ways, they

23
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,369
tried to make sense of what just happened.

24
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:47,619
So it must have been a very bewildering experience for them to sit there and to see all these

25
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:52,259
people call out the wrong answers when it&#39;s so clear that they&#39;re wrong.

26
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:53,259
Right?

27
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:59,039
So you must start to worry about everything you believe in; your own eyes, everything.

28
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,909
So how do people make sense of that?

29
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:08,119
So when you actually look at how Asch talks about these studies, you see that a lot is

30
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:13,470
going on there, and there are many different ways in which people make sense of the situation.

31
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,810
So one of them people typically will say, look, maybe it&#39;s just that there&#39;s something

32
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,030
wrong with my eyes, I must not see this correctly.

33
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,350
And they truly believe then that, look, let&#39;s just go along with the majority, that seems

34
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,390
to be the most sensible thing to do.

35
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:34,350
There are also those who see that the first person actually giving the wrong answer has

36
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:40,650
glasses, so they see maybe there&#39;s wrong something with his or her eyesight, and all the others

37
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:46,180
are too polite to point out that that person gave the wrong response, so they sort of make--

38
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:51,820
then they say, look, I&#39;ll do that too, let&#39;s not sort of put that person on the spot.

39
00:02:51,820 --> 00:03:00,110
So, there&#39;s all these different theories that people develop to justify what they&#39;re doing.

40
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:05,360
But it is interesting too that if you read what Asch is writing about, it is-- well, a

41
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,870
few things are interesting.

42
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:13,370
One is that, it becomes clear that, yes, there is a percentage of people who will conform

43
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:20,030
on the critical trials, but there are also quite a lot of people who resist and stick

44
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,760
to what they think they believe.

45
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,050
So that must be quite painful, for half an hour you go through this routine and everyone

46
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:31,100
seems to be seeing something else than you do, but you just stick to that.

47
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,020
And it is interesting to see what those people say afterwards.

48
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,580
And they will often say, look-- they say, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on around me, I

49
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,730
just don&#39;t-- I don&#39;t listen to them.

50
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,870
I can only tell you what I see, and this is what I see.

51
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,960
So, they also come up with a way of dealing with a very difficult and bewildering situation

52
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:57,530
that they find themselves in, and that expresses itself in sticking to what you think is happening

53
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,530
there.

54
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,700
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: Does it sort of tell us about some of the things that lead people to resist the

55
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,700
group?

56
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:08,150
JOLANDA JETTEN: Well, actually, if you look at the majority of responses is showing signs

57
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,740
of rebellion.

58
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:14,770
Most of the time, are actually people sticking to what they think they see and don&#39;t go along

59
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,239
with that incorrect majority.

60
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:23,830
And so, it seems as if they almost negotiate, you know, what they see, being true to what

61
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,830
they see.

62
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,580
But at the same time, also, trying to be a little bit respectful to all those other people

63
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,750
there who, for whatever reason, are giving all these incorrect responses.

64
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,660
So sometimes they say, yes.

65
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,660
Yeah, you&#39;re right.

66
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:40,050
You know, I&#39;ll go along with the majority that gives the incorrect response.

67
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:47,060
So it looks as if there is a bit more going on than conformity versus rebellion.

68
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:54,340
People try and negotiate the situation, trying to make sense of this situation.

69
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,630
And I guess, actually, what is happening there, in the way that people make sense of that

70
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:05,190
situation, comes also across when you look at all the different variations that Asch had

71
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,930
to that classic paradigm.

72
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:15,690
So, in one, for instance, there&#39;s one other person who also sticks to-- you know, deviates

73
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,060
from the majority.

74
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:24,419
And that is interesting to see, because the naive participant is so grateful for that;

75
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,919
there&#39;s one other person in the world who sees what I see.

76
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,960
So, of course, then you see that conformity levels plummets dramatically, right?

77
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,720
I&#39;m not-- you know, I&#39;m not the only one who sees something else.

78
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,280
So that&#39;s very powerful.

79
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:46,830
And, interesting about that even is that plummeting of conformity levels even happens when that

80
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:53,130
person who also deviates from the majority also gives incorrect responds.

81
00:05:53,130 --> 00:06:00,690
What is even interesting here is that you find that conformity levels dropped dramatically

82
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:06,840
when there is a Confederate who also deviates from the majority, but it also gives an incorrect

83
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
response.

84
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,440
So, even though you know that there&#39;s a majority who give incorrect response, this one individual

85
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,100
who gives an incorrect response, but the mere fact that they also deviate from the majority,

86
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:24,060
that is reassuring and allows you then to stick to what you think you&#39;re seeing are

87
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,110
right in front of you.

88
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,820
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: So those studies tell us a bit about the pressures for conformity that people

89
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,820
experience.

90
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,090
But, I guess in our day to day lives, we&#39;re not often asked to judge the length of lines

91
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,910
in a group of other people.

92
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,310
What are some of the behaviors that we might experience these pressures for conformity

93
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,450
within our real lives?

94
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,630
JOLANDA JETTEN: Yeah, that&#39;s an interesting point.

95
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:48,780
And you are absolutely right that&#39;s the situation that these participants found themselves in

96
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,470
was very unusual, something that they had never experienced before, having to judge

97
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,560
these lines.

98
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,240
But perhaps, also, it is not something that they care too deeply about.

99
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,640
So, one can wonder what kind of findings you would have if it was about the issues that

100
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,030
people care deeply about; their personal beliefs, political opinions, et cetera.

101
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:12,889
So that is a bit of a question, would they still be willing to go along with a majority

102
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:17,600
that is sort of saying something that they deeply disagree with?

103
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,520
So that is an interesting point, first and foremost.

104
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,970
Maybe there&#39;s one other point I would like to make, and that is that, we often look at

105
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:33,360
it is as if these people do something that is so irrational and it shows blind conformity,

106
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,040
that it is something that we wouldn&#39;t expect.

107
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,260
But, I guess, and maybe it is this important point to make too, that very often we do of

108
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,610
course look at other people to help us to understand the world around us.

109
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:52,850
So, if other people see something that we don&#39;t see, then that is deeply disturbing,

110
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,070
and we&#39;re trying to make sense of that.

111
00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:01,290
A lot of the learning that we do in our lives is through conforming to or listening to what

112
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,490
other people say and taking that on board as something that will help us understand

113
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,660
the world.

114
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:11,850
It&#39;s just, in this particular experiment, you could say that people are being fooled

115
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,520
in a sense that they can no longer trust their senses.

116
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,880
So it&#39;s a powerful demonstration of that particular clash there.

117
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:26,410
But, it also does show the power of conformity and the importance that people-- how important

118
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:32,500
people think than it is to have their opinions and their views aligned with others that are

119
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,940
important to them.

120
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:41,149
And this has been used to explain things as diverse as bulimia, when people give in to

121
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:48,990
peer pressure for certain-- and that regulates their eating behavior.

122
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,200
It has also been used to explain hooliganism.

123
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,130
Why do people actually go along with the crowds, and perhaps engage in violent behavior, and

124
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,140
more extreme behaviors even?

125
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:05,990
The type of behavior you could see in Nazi Germany, why do people actually go along and

126
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:11,450
engage in genocides, just because that is what the majority seems to condone of?

127
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,450
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: Excellent.

128
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,450
Thank you.

129
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,000
JOLANDA JETTEN: You&#39;re welcome.
