00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,780
Ok, so that&#39;s how we sometimes estimate

1
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,860
the frequency of events occurring. But

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,570
how do we know whether someone or

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,820
something belongs to a particular group?

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,310
We often try to categorize each other

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,960
into social groups to help us make sense

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,510
of the social world and to do that we

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,400
may rely on a heuristic called the

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,039
representativeness heuristic. This

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,740
heuristic or rule basically helps us to

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,359
estimate the likelihood that somebody

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,250
belongs to a group by comparing the

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,800
features of that person to the prototype

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,770
for that group. The prototype is the best

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,050
example of a category. We use it to

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,910
represent what people from that category

16
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,969
are like. Assuming that our prototype is

17
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:45,989
accurate

18
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:47,700
this seems like a sensible rule to

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,070
follow but unfortunately it can make us

20
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,629
insensitive to other useful information

21
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:54,390
when trying to estimate whether someone

22
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,910
belongs to a particular category. Let&#39;s

23
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,550
try an example from a study by Kahneman and

24
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,940
Tversky in 1973. I want you to

25
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,769
imagine that there&#39;s a really hip and

26
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,990
happening party going on. At this party

27
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,150
there are 30 engineers and 70 lawyers.

28
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,549
I&#39;m going to tell you a bit about one

29
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:12,840
person at the party.

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,960
His name is Jack. &quot;Jack is a 45 year old

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,450
man. He&#39;s married and has four children.

32
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,810
He is generally conservative, careful and

33
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,210
ambitious. He shows no interest in

34
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,549
political and social issues and spends

35
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,229
most of his free time on his many

36
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,600
hobbies, which include home carpentry,

37
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,570
sailing and mathematical puzzles.&quot;

38
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,540
Ok, so now that I&#39;ve told you a bit about

39
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,420
Jack, do you think he&#39;s an engineer or a

40
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,659
lawyer?
