00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:10,730
Let’s look at an early study that tested the “foot in the door” technique.

1
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,920
Freedman and Fraser (1966) phoned 36 people and asked them for a little favour.

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,189
They asked people if they would answer a very short survey.

3
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:22,210
So, they asked: “Would you like to participate in a short phone survey?

4
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,279
It’s going to take two minutes.

5
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:28,029
We just want to ask you about the kinds of household products that you like to buy.”

6
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:30,800
So, it’s no big deal.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,140
Phone surveys were probably something of a novelty back then.

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,140
Everyone said yes.

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,739
Then, a few days later, the experimenter rang back and said: “That was really helpful

10
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:43,380
how you did that survey for our spot.

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,620
We need a bit more from you, and actually what we really would love is if you allow

12
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,129
the team of our researchers to come into your house and to go through your stuff and actually

13
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:56,579
catalogue the detergents you buy, the soaps you buy, and so on.

14
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,080
This is going to take about two hours.

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,550
Is that okay with you?”

16
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:06,610
That’s a pretty big favor but, all the same, more than half, actually 53% of the people

17
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,180
said, “Yes, by all means.

18
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,189
I’m happy for that to happen.”

19
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:12,290
This seems like a big number.

20
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,110
More than half of the participants are like, “Yes, send your team of strange men to go

21
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,290
through my stuff for two hours.”

22
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,290
But is it really?

23
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,409
How can we tell?

24
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:25,100
What we need is a control condition in which you don’t use the “foot in the door”

25
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,100
technique.

26
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,009
So, that’s what they did.

27
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:32,200
The researchers contacted another 36 people who were not involved in the experiment up

28
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,250
to this point and just came out with the big request: “Would it be okay if I send a team

29
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,450
of our men to go through your stuff for two hours?”

30
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:47,280
When they just cut to the chase like that, far fewer people agreed, this time, only 22%.

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,210
This is the “foot in the door” technique and we know this works across hundreds of

32
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,159
experiments, but why does it work?

33
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,840
The reason seems to be that agreeing to the initial request causes individuals to see

34
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,740
themselves as having certain characteristics, they start to think about themselves as that

35
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,380
kind of person.

36
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,460
This happens through the process of self-perception.

37
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:13,290
So, you agree to the initial request and you start to see yourself as the kind of person

38
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,410
who helps others out.

39
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:20,520
When you are asked a larger favour, you agree because doing so is consistent with the type

40
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,170
of person you are (Freedman &amp; Fraser, 1966).

41
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,910
Once you’ve made that initial commitment, you like to live up to that commitment even

42
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,550
as the cost of those commitments starts to climb.

43
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,790
It’s a nice thing about human nature.

44
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,410
It’s also something that leaves us vulnerable to being exploited.

45
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,330
Not all commitments are equally binding though.

46
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,770
We also know from studies that this type of technique is going to be most powerful when

47
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,170
the initial commitment is active (Bem, 1967), effortful (Aronson &amp; Mills, 1959), made publicly

48
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,120
in front of others (Deutsch &amp;amp; Gerard, 1955), and not coerced from you by pressure (Freedman,

49
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,120
1965).

50
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,020
Sometimes people say, if you want to set a target for yourself or whatever, just write

51
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,020
it down.

52
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,080
Put it on the fridge.

53
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,240
Put it above your bed.

54
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,480
You’ve then got your own words haunting you - quit smoking, study more, eat better,

55
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,000
whatever it is.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,030
Another thing you can do is run around and tell everyone about your target.

57
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,620
Tell everyone you’re going to give up smoking.

58
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,040
With these kind of public commitments, we feel the need to live up to them.

59
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,100
If you tell everyone that you’re going to give up smoking, the next time you’re tempted

60
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,010
to have a cigarette, you’re just imagining their judgment.

61
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,140
You’re thinking about all the shame that’s going to rain down on you as people see that

62
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,090
you’ve weaseled out of your own promise.

63
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,360
These things are binding, but here’s the trick, we’re talking about exploiting people’s

64
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,670
need to live up to commitments.

65
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:41,120
If you’re going to exploit it, if you’re going to manipulate people, the art in it

66
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,890
is to make them believe that they freely chose that commitment as opposed to being pressured

67
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:46,890
into it.

68
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:51,140
There’s no point, there’s actually very little point, saying to people: “Please

69
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,460
tell me you’re going to give up smoking.

70
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,070
You’ve got to give up smoking.

71
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,620
It stresses me out that you smoke all the time.

72
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,790
Please, please, please, I’m begging you.”

73
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,380
Now eventually they might just go: “Fine, I’ll give up smoking.”

74
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,940
That’s kind of a commitment but not one that’s particularly valuable because it

75
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,560
was forced.

76
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,530
The next time they feel like having a cigarette, they won’t really feel the need or obligation

77
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,780
to live up to that forced commitment.

78
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:21,160
So, we’re going to have to lure people into making their own commitments.
