00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:11,509
So, are we hopelessly at the mercy of advertisers who can manipulate us with attractive and

1
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:12,630
credible communicators?

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,280
I hope not, otherwise I’ve got a lot of skincare products to buy after we finish here!

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:23,300
Surely, sometimes we must be influenced by the content of the message itself.

4
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:28,610
Under what circumstances, does the content of the message influence our attitudes?

5
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:33,680
To answer this question, we need to consider the process by which attitudes can be changed.

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,840
There is a set of models in the attitude change literature called the Dual process models

7
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,330
that describe the way we are influenced by persuasive messages.

8
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:47,370
The two main Dual process models are the Elaboration likelihood model (Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986)

9
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,540
and the Heuristic Systematic (Chaiken, Liberman, &amp; Eagly, 1989) Model.

10
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:57,140
These are Dual process models because they describe two ways in which things happen.

11
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,980
According to Petty and Cacioppo in 1986, while there are some fine distinctions between the

12
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,281
two models, they generally make the same predictions.

13
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:10,080
So, for our purposes, we will focus on the Elaboration likelihood model.

14
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,640
This model describes two distinct modes or routes to persuasion - the “Central” and

15
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,390
“Peripheral” routes which involve different amounts of thinking.

16
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,840
Attitudes are influenced by different things according to which route is used.

17
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,160
We refer to the amount of thinking in terms of how much you elaborate about a persuasive

18
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,860
message.

19
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,550
Elaboration is measured by looking at the number of positive and negative thoughts you

20
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,800
have about a message.

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,520
So basically, if you can generate a lot of pros and cons when your given a persuasive

22
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,390
message, we would say you are showing a high degree of elaboration.

23
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,780
So, what happens when you hear a persuasive message?

24
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,570
How does that potentially change our attitudes?

25
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,090
For the “Central” route, the amount of favourable elaboration about the message influences

26
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,090
persuasion.

27
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:03,230
The more that you can think of benefits compared to costs, the more you’ll be persuaded.

28
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:07,030
Whether the message is associated with some sort of positive stimuli, like an attractive

29
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,390
communicator, is pretty unimportant.

30
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:15,130
Attitude change is a result of the quality of the argument itself.

31
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,200
For the “Peripheral” route, the strength of the message content is less important,

32
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,840
you are more persuaded if the message is associated with other things that are positively evaluated.

33
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,230
For example, if you have a positive stereotype about the type of person giving you the message,

34
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,740
you will be more persuaded by the message.

35
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:38,300
This means attitude change is more the result of some type of appeal to your emotion.

36
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:43,319
It sounds like we should always use the “Central” route to persuasion, as this makes use of

37
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,470
the most careful type of thinking.

38
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:50,080
The problem is that it takes time and effort to use that way of thinking about things.

39
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,230
We simply wouldn’t be able to get through the day.

40
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,990
If we got thirsty, we’d spend forever comparing the nutritional value of every drink in the

41
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,209
store before making a purchase.

42
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:02,280
So, when do we use each route?

43
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,340
We use the “Central” route when an issue is important to us, when we have the time

44
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,239
and the cognitive capacity to think about the issue.

45
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,239
We tend to use the “Peripheral” route when the issue is not so important to us,

46
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,599
when there is limited time to think about the message, or when we are distracted.

47
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,349
One of the underlying assumptions of all these models of attitude change is that message

48
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:28,370
recipients like to put in the minimum amount of cognitive effort possible.

49
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:33,040
This has led to some people referring to message recipients as &quot;cognitive misers&quot; (Fiske &amp; Taylor,

50
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,550
1984) or “mental sluggards&quot; (Gilbert &amp; Hixon, 1991).

51
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:40,300
Despite this somewhat pessimistic view about how we evaluate persuasive messages, these

52
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,980
models do highlight the distinct ways that we think about persuasive messages.

53
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,230
Sometimes we do take a lot of care in evaluating persuasive messages.

54
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,069
But, in other contexts, when there is limited time, we are more affected by factors such

55
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:56,700
as the credibility or attractiveness of the communicator.
