So what is high self-control all about? Well, there are three basic components of

1
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:17,170
it that can be analysed. The first is what we call Standards. Standards are ideas of

2
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:26,510
how you should be, they are goals, moral principles, ideals, norms, other people’s expectations.

3
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:33,180
If your standards are unrealistic or you have conflicting goals, you don’t know what you

4
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,590
want, well, self-control has trouble there. The second component of self-control is monitoring,

5
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,719
keeping track of the behaviour. It’s very hard to regulate something if you cannot keep

6
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,870
track of it. When people cease to keep track of their behaviour this possibly could be

7
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,229
due to emotional upset or simply because they don’t know what’s happening. Another example, alcohol

8
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:59,309
intoxication reduces your awareness of yourself and as we know people do all manner of stupid

9
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,379
things when they drink alcohol because they’re not really reflecting on how this will reflect

10
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,740
on them and how this will look in the morning. Alcohol stops people from keeping track of

11
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,392
their behavior in relation to their goals and values. That’s one reason that (alcohol)

12
00:01:12,392 --> 00:01:18,350
produces poor self-control. The third component is the capacity to change,

13
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:25,410
willpower is the popular term for it. If people expend all their willpower, self-control breaks

14
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,960
down. Any of these three components go wrong, it

15
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,640
can undermine your ability to control yourself effectively.
