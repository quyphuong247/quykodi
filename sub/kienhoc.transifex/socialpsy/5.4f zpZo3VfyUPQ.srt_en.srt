00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:11,070
Let’s finish by talking about an example of how dissonance theory can be used to bring

1
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,519
about behaviour change in a positive way.

2
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,869
One of the common targets for government funded advertising campaigns is to try and get people

3
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:21,670
to behave in a more prosocial manner.

4
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:28,890
For example, trying to get people to use sunscreen, drive more safely, or use less water.

5
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,141
Previously we talked about ways in which persuasive messages can help influence attitudes, and

6
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:38,620
perhaps behaviour, but the effect is sometimes tenuous.

7
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,770
Dissonance theory suggests that people’s own behaviour could influence their attitudes,

8
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,719
and because the persuasion is coming from within, rather than from an external communicator,

9
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,140
it should at least in theory be more influential.

10
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,800
The problem is that using the method that we described in the Festinger and Carlsmith

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,640
(1959) study, which is called Induced Compliance, we would have to get participants to act in

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,400
counter-attitudinal ways to change their behaviour.

13
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,290
As most people already have relatively positive attitudes towards being healthy, using less

14
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:13,070
water and so on, this would mean getting them to behave in the opposite way, which would

15
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,659
be completely counter-productive!

16
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,170
Dickerson and his colleagues suggested in this paper from 1992, that feelings of hypocrisy

17
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:26,329
could be used to motivate behaviour change that’s consistent with prosocial attitudes.

18
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:31,540
Their approach was based on Elliot Aronson’s revision to dissonance theory called the “self-concept

19
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,540
approach”.

20
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,130
The basic idea is that people generally have a positive self-concept, and feeling like

21
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:42,430
you are a hypocrite is inconsistent with a positive self-concept.

22
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,780
Hypocrisy is the feeling that your behaviours are different from your attitudes––you

23
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,360
don’t do what you say people should do.

24
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,649
Aronson thought that when the positive self-concept is threatened, we will be motivated to restore

25
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:56,829
a positive self-concept in some way.

26
00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:01,439
So, let’s look at Dickerson and colleagues’ 1992 study.

27
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,170
They were interested in how to get people to behave in ways that saved water.

28
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:11,790
The study was done in California, which at the time was experiencing a severe drought.

29
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,730
The researchers went to the public swimming pool, and as people got out of the pool, a

30
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:21,290
researcher approached some of them to ask about their past water conservation behaviour

31
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,520
by getting the swimmer to complete a checklist.

32
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,980
Now, this checklist was biased in such a way that it was difficult to answer yes to many

33
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,530
of the questions, even though the behaviours listed on the checklist were all sensible

34
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,120
water saving behaviours.

35
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,580
The questions from the checklist asked things like…

36
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,720
Did your shower take 4 minutes or less this morning?

37
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,920
Did you turn off the tap while shampooing your hair?

38
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,870
Did you turn off the tap while using the soap?

39
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,400
Did you catch the shower water with a bucket and use it on your garden?

40
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,510
Did you turn off the tap while brushing your teeth?

41
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,500
Some of the other participants were not reminded of their past behaviour that related to using

42
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
water.

43
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,420
Half of the participants were asked to make a public commitment to their attitude about

44
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:13,990
saving water by signing a petition advocating for people to take shorter showers and save

45
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,990
water.

46
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,560
They were told that this petition would be displayed around the neighbourhood so that

47
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,120
everybody could see that this person thought that saving water was a great idea.

48
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,570
The other half were not asked to sign the petition, so they did not make a public commitment

49
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,030
to their attitude.

50
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,670
The researcher then let the swimmers go back to take a shower.

51
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,860
A second researcher was hiding in the shower block however, and had a stopwatch to time

52
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,900
how long the swimmers spent in the shower, and also wrote down whether the swimmers turned

53
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,840
the taps off while shampooing their hair and so on.

54
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,510
So, who do you think took the shortest showers?

55
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,200
Let’s take a look at the results.

56
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,090
On the x-axis we have the two conditions where participants had either been asked to make

57
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,910
a public commitment to their attitude by signing the petition, or had not been asked to commit

58
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,760
to their attitude.

59
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,540
On the y-axis we have how long the shower was on for in seconds.

60
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,180
The blue shows the group of swimmers who had been reminded of their past wasteful behaviour

61
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,700
via the biased checklist, while the green are those who had not been reminded of their

62
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,030
past behaviour.

63
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:23,730
So, the greatest hypocrisy should be when swimmers make a public commitment to their

64
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:29,160
attitude and are reminded of their past wasteful behaviours.

65
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,260
These people should be the most motivated to change their behaviour to repair their

66
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,110
self-concept.

67
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:41,100
And we can see that it is precisely these people who took the shortest showers.

68
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,910
So, dissonance theory can also be used to change people’s behaviour to be more prosocial.

69
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:51,010
In fact, dissonance theory has turned out to be an incredibly useful theory.

70
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:56,750
It has been used in research on decision making, colour preferences, the socialisation of children,

71
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,150
and cures for snake phobias.

72
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:04,320
It has also been used to study interpersonal attraction, religious proselytising, gambling

73
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,550
behaviour, water conservation and safer sex practices.

74
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,360
It forms the basis of clinical interventions such as motivational interviewing.

75
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,880
One of the things that makes dissonance such a powerful motivator of attitude change is

76
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,150
that the persuasion comes from within us.
