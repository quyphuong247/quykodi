0
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:09,960
So, a lot of advertisements use attractive actors.

1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,920
This is most likely because there is an ethos that attractive and likeable people will be

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,570
more persuasive (Chaiken &amp; Eagly, 1983).

3
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,650
Therefore, it makes sense to select an attractive communicator to increase the persuasive power

4
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,339
of your message.

5
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:26,839
Chaiken suggested in 1979 that this might be because attractive people have attributes

6
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:32,369
apart from their looks that make them more persuasive, such as being more optimistic

7
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,060
and more fluent speakers.

8
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:39,320
Now, this doesn’t imply that there is some kind of genetic link between attractiveness,

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,450
optimism and communication ability.

10
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:46,230
It’s more likely that because people like spending time with and talking to attractive

11
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,630
people, attractive people get more practice at communication.

12
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:56,650
It’s possible that attractiveness also acts as a decision cue that helps us make an effortless

13
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,470
response to an attempt to persuade us.

14
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,009
In 1990, Debono and Telesca wanted to test this idea.

15
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:09,549
They gave participants a message about the benefits of using a suntan lotion called “Savage

16
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:10,549
Tan”.

17
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:15,000
They told participants that they were testing out advertisements before the product was

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,619
introduced to the market.

19
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,740
There were two parts to the advertisement.

20
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,420
In the first part, the experimenters manipulated the attractiveness of the woman.

21
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,659
Half of the participants saw a slide of a physically attractive woman who was darkly

22
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:30,659
tanned.

23
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,560
The other half saw a slide of the same woman who was made to look less attractive by changing

24
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,369
her hairstyle, what she was wearing and putting some glasses on her.

25
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:45,079
In the second part, the experimenters manipulated the strength of the argument.

26
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:49,770
For half of the participants, the advertisement involved an audio recording of either a strong

27
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,929
argument for using the sunscreen or a weak argument for using the sunscreen.

28
00:01:55,929 --> 00:02:00,520
In the “strong argument” condition, participants were told that the sunscreen was scientifically

29
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,490
proven to provide protection from harmful ultraviolet rays and contained special pigments

30
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,750
to prevent premature ageing and wrinkles.

31
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:15,440
In the “weak argument” condition, participants were told that the sunscreen was silky smooth

32
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,950
and easy to apply.

33
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:23,000
Finally, they asked participants what they thought about using Savage Tan, the sunscreen.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,750
Let’s take a look at what they found.

35
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,820
On this figure, we can see participants’ attitudes about the product on the y-axis,

36
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,860
with higher values indicating more favourable product attitudes.

37
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,140
On the x-axis, we have the attractive and unattractive communicator conditions.

38
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:47,440
The blue refers to the participants who heard the strong message about using Savage Tan,

39
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,460
and the green is used to indicate those who heard the weak message about using the sun

40
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,460
tan lotion.

41
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,580
Now, I haven’t actually mentioned this yet, but Debono and Telesca also measured how much

42
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:04,460
their participants were attuned to social signals, via a construct called self-monitoring.

43
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:10,140
The idea being that those who were more highly attuned, the high self-monitors, should find

44
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,010
attractiveness the a particularly engaging social cue.

45
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:19,080
As we can see in the results, for those scoring low on self-monitoring, they simply relied

46
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,230
on attractiveness as a cue to persuasion - they were more influenced by the attractive compared

47
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:29,800
to the unattractive communicator, regardless of how strong the message about using the

48
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,780
sunscreen was.

49
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:37,350
For participants who were more attentive to social cues however, the high self-monitors,

50
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,740
attractiveness did not act as a simple cue.

51
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:45,360
Rather, for the attractive communicator, participants were influenced more by the strong message

52
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,420
compared to the weak message.

53
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:53,570
The attractiveness basically increased the engagement with the message about sunscreen.

54
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,620
There was no difference in how much they were persuaded by each of the messages when the

55
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,160
communicator was unattractive however.

56
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,630
So, this suggests that communicator attractiveness serves at least two purposes.

57
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:11,500
For those of us driven by our own internal values and ideas, the low self-monitors, attractiveness

58
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,620
seems to be a simple cue to persuasion.

59
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:20,100
For those of us more attuned to external social cues, attractiveness helps grab our attention

60
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,690
and gets us to think more carefully about the persuasive message.
