00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:09,519
Ok, so what did Lapiere find?

1
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,829
Well, when they turned up at the various establishments, they were served by all but one establishment

2
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:19,960
- that’s over 99% of establishments serving them.

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,670
Six months later, when LaPiere got in touch with the places they had visited and asked

4
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,710
whether they would serve them, it was a different story.

5
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:35,960
He received 128 responses, and only one restaurant, or less than 1%, said that they would serve

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,980
the Chinese guests.

7
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:42,329
Seven percent said, that whether they would serve them or not, would depend on the circumstances,

8
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,219
and 92%, said that they would not serve them.

9
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:48,899
So, that’s a very small number saying that they would serve them.

10
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,289
That’s the opposite of what they found when they actually turned up though!

11
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:58,929
So, the conclusion was that the attitudes and behaviours of the people working in these

12
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:01,300
places didn’t match.

13
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,180
They served the three travellers when they turned up, but when asked in advance, they

14
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,640
said they would not serve them.

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,690
Subsequent research by Wicker in 1969 and others came to a similar conclusion about

16
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:19,520
the lack of a relationship between attitudes and behaviour.

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,500
People have criticised this initial conclusion for a number of reasons, however.

18
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,680
One of the main issues pointed out is that LaPiere was not necessarily measuring the

19
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,100
attitudes and behaviours of the same people.

20
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,030
The person who served them when they turned up at the establishment was not necessarily

21
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,050
the same person who replied when LaPiere talked to them six months later.

22
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:45,909
So maybe it’s not so surprising that the attitudes and behaviours were so different

23
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:51,750
- he was measuring one person’s behaviour and maybe another person’s attitude.

24
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,810
Later research has suggested that sometimes attitudes can predict behaviours, but it’s

25
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,850
somewhat complicated.

26
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:02,550
Part of the reason the early research didn’t find a strong relationship between attitudes

27
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:07,410
and behaviour was because of how people were measuring both of these things.

28
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:12,670
You’ve seen how LaPiere got it wrong by measuring attitudes and behaviours of different

29
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,670
people.

30
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,569
It also matters how you measure attitudes and behaviours, even if you are actually measuring

31
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:19,489
them for the same person.

32
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:23,280
You need to measure attitudes and behaviour in the same way, and in the same amount of

33
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,790
detail.

34
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,099
What I mean by this is, if you want to know if people will recycle for example, it’s

35
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:33,819
probably not a good idea to measure their attitude towards saving the environment.

36
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:38,620
This is because we have a relatively specific behaviour, which is recycling, and we’re

37
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,040
measuring a general attitude, which is saving the environment.

38
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,510
According to Fishbein and Ajzen, who published this paper in 1974, attitudes and behaviour

39
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,030
will be related when they are measured in the same way.

40
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,629
They called this the Principle of compatibility.

41
00:02:55,629 --> 00:03:01,920
The idea is that you need to measure attitudes and behaviours in a way that is similar or

42
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,920
compatible.

43
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,359
To do this, they said you need to take into account four things.

44
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:10,370
The target, or focus of the behaviour.

45
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,310
The action, the behaviour itself.

46
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,930
The time, which is when the behaviour is enacted.

47
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,590
And finally, the context, or situation that the behaviour is enacted in.

48
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:26,810
For example, if we are interested in measuring the relationship between attitudes towards

49
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:32,739
recycling and recycling behaviour, compatible measures might look like this:

50
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:37,620
To measure attitudes, we would ask &quot;To what extent do you support recycling all paper,

51
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,730
tins, and plastic over the next two weeks in your home?&quot;,

52
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,761
And two weeks later, to measure behaviour we could ask &quot;Over the last two weeks, to

53
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:54,450
what extent did you recycle all paper, tins, and plastic in your home?&quot;

54
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,549
The Target is &#39;all paper, tins, and plastic&#39;.

55
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:01,690
The Action is &#39;recycling&#39;.

56
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,090
The Time is &#39;over the next or last two weeks&#39;.

57
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,499
And the Context is &#39;in your home&#39;.

58
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:14,090
According to the Principle of Compatibility, we would expect that a specific attitude,

59
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:19,709
such as the one we just gave in that example, will predict a single behaviour better than

60
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,570
a general attitude (Davidson &amp; Jaccard, 1979).

61
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:27,140
We would also predict that if we use a general attitude measure, such as &quot;Do you think saving

62
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:32,590
the environment is a good thing?&quot;, then this will predict what we call a general behavioural

63
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,190
index, which is really just collection of behaviours (Weigel &amp; Newman, 1976).

64
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:41,430
So, we might measure recycling, but also how much water they save, whether they try to

65
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:47,729
use public transport instead of drive, and other behaviours to help to save the environment.

66
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:52,169
Another reason for why attitudes sometimes are not very good predictors of behaviour

67
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:57,610
is because other variables can become important in the relationship between attitudes and

68
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,610
behaviour.

69
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,120
For example, social norms also contribute to behaviour.

70
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,669
I’m sure you can think about a time when you thought one thing, but your friends had

71
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:08,610
a different attitude.

72
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,860
You might not have behaved in the way that your attitude would suggest, but instead went

73
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,520
along with your friends so that you fit in.

74
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,650
To further complicate things, the link between hearing a persuasive message and changing

75
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,949
your behaviour is not so simple and involves many steps.

76
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:30,039
For example, in McGuire&#39;s Chain of Persuasion Model, after someone sends persuasive message

77
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:35,300
in your direction, you have to attend to the message, and then comprehend the message,

78
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,669
before you can change your attitude and yield to the message, but then you still have to

79
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:43,550
retain that message in memory to be able to act on it.

80
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,740
So, all of those steps have to happen successfully for a persuasive message to have an effect

81
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,409
on your behaviour.

82
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:54,259
If any one of them doesn’t happen, then there’s no behaviour change.

83
00:05:54,259 --> 00:06:00,259
So, you can see, while attitudes do relate to behaviours, it’s a complicated relationship.

84
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:04,479
And we need careful research to fully understand how attitudes and behaviours will be related

85
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,270
in any particular context.
