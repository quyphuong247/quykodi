0
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:10,880
So, it seems like we take a pretty systematic approach when making attributions about the

1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,780
behaviour of others and ourselves.

2
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,950
But just how accurate are our attributions?

3
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,249
Well, when psychologists have compared the types of attributions that people actually

4
00:00:20,249 --> 00:00:25,300
make to the attributions that models suggest they should make, perhaps not surprisingly,

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,680
there are some systematic biases.

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,540
These biases lead to serious errors about the causes of our own and others’ behaviours,

7
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,449
so the attribution process is perhaps not an entirely rational one.

8
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:42,160
The first one that we will talk about is also possibly the most pervasive one.

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,829
This is the fundamental attribution error (Ross, 1977), which Ross described as the

10
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:51,809
tendency to attribute another person’s behaviour to his or her own dispositional qualities,

11
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:55,399
rather than to the situation that the behaviour is performed in.

12
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,520
This is also known as the correspondence bias (Gilbert &amp; Malone, 1995; Jones, 1976).

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,210
It is not quite as fundamental as its name implies though, it seems to be related to

14
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,890
the culture that we grow up in as there is some evidence that it is more prominent in

15
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,520
individualistic compared to collectivist cultures (Miller, 1984).

16
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,500
Miller compared the types of attributions made by North Americans, who are from an individualistic

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,620
culture, to those made by Hindu Indians, who are from a more collectivist culture.

18
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:26,530
The older that participants were, the greater the difference in the types of attributions

19
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:32,730
they made, with the North American participants making more internal dispositional attributions.

20
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:38,970
The idea is that in individualistic cultures, individual achievement is valued and so individuals’

21
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:44,140
goals and attributes are more likely to be seen as causal when explaining behaviour.

22
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,380
So, it seems that we learn to make the fundamental attribution error if we grow up in a culture

23
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,950
that values individualistic motivations.

24
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:58,360
A great demonstration of this effect was a study by Jones and Harris in 1967.

25
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,250
Jones and Harris had their American participants guess the true attitudes of some students

26
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:07,390
who had been asked to write speeches about Fidel Castro.

27
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:12,670
Now at the time, Fidel Castro was the leader of communist Cuba, and America and Cuba had

28
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,420
been locked in various political and military conflicts, and so it was somewhat counter-normative

29
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,450
to have positive attitudes about Fidel Castro for these American participants.

30
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,950
Jones and Harris told their participants that the students had written speeches either in

31
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,520
support of, or against, Castro.

32
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,030
Further, participants had been told that the student speech writers had either been given

33
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:40,700
a free choice about which topic they wrote about, pro or anti- Castro, or, participants

34
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,690
were told that the speech writers had been assigned a topic, either pro or anti-Castro,

35
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,180
to write about.

36
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,840
So, when we look at the results of the study on this figure, we can see the two choice

37
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,742
conditions along the x-axis and larger numbers on the y-axis indicate that participants thought

38
00:02:56,742 --> 00:03:01,890
the speech writer had a more positive attitude towards Fidel Castro.

39
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,110
Let’s start with the free choice condition first.

40
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,940
Here we see that when participants were told that the student speech writers had chosen

41
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,370
to write a speech in favour of Fidel Castro, they guessed that the speech writer had a

42
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,890
more positive attitude to Castro compared to the students who chose to write against

43
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,230
Castro.

44
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:24,110
In effect, the participants made an internal attribution - the student speech writer wrote

45
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,210
that speech because they really believed in the topic.

46
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:31,230
After all, they had a free choice of topics, so this makes perfect sense.

47
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,470
Okay, now let’s look at the no choice condition, where the student speech writers did not get

48
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,910
to choose which side of the argument they wrote about, either pro or anti-Castro.

49
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:46,069
Our participants make the same person attribution – they see those speech writers writing

50
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:51,459
pro-Castro speeches as has having more positive attitudes to Castro compared to those speech

51
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:56,510
writers writing anti-Castro speeches, even though they had no choice in the topic they

52
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,599
wrote about.

53
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,489
If we were being completely rational, we should not make any inference about the speech writers’

54
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:06,849
attitudes in the no choice condition, regardless of the topic they wrote about.

55
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:11,550
Essentially, the participants ignored the situational constraints on the speech writers’

56
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:15,020
behaviour, and still made a person attribution.

57
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,120
This is the fundamental attribution error in action.

58
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,150
So, do we explain our own behaviours in the same way as we explain other people’s behaviours?

59
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,969
It seems that we don’t.

60
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:30,870
The actor-observer bias describes the difference in how we think about our own behaviours compared

61
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,990
to the behaviour of others.

62
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,870
Jones and Nisbett (1971) hypothesised that we tend to attribute our own behaviours to

63
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,630
external factors and others’ behaviours to internal causes.

64
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:46,180
Now some people see this bias as being related to the fundamental attribution error, but

65
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,099
it is subtly different.

66
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:52,719
The fundamental attribution error explains how people infer dispositional attributions

67
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:54,729
from the behaviour of others.

68
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:59,710
The actor-observer bias on the other hand, is about what people see as the cause of their

69
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,030
own versus others’ behaviour.

70
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,460
Let’s look at a study that tests this idea.

71
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,819
In this study, participants were asked to rate themselves, their friend, and a TV newsreader

72
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:14,389
on whether they possessed a number of different traits or not.

73
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:19,680
So, for each trait, participants could say that the person possessed the trait, or the

74
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,270
person possessed the opposite trait.

75
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,659
Both of these are dispositional attributions because we would be saying that a person had

76
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,680
a certain characteristic.

77
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,930
Alternatively, participants could say that the person did not have either trait, and

78
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,039
the person’s behaviour depended on the situation.

79
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:38,669
This is a situational attribution.

80
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:42,330
When we look at the results of that study, we see the four targets of the ratings on

81
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:47,650
the x-axis, and the proportion of dispositional attributions on the y-axis.

82
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,289
The higher the numbers, the more dispositional attributions are being made.

83
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:56,370
What we can see is that participants made more dispositional attributions for people

84
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,280
they knew less well.

85
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,879
The less we know people the more we say their behaviour reflects their personality.

86
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,550
This seems a bit odd.

87
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,669
So why do we get this effect?

88
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:12,419
Well one idea is that we simply have more information about ourselves compared to others,

89
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:17,599
and this means we have more information about how our behaviour varies across targets and

90
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,819
situations.

91
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:23,860
If you think back to Kelley’s covariation model of attribution, this is distinctiveness

92
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,839
and consistency information, and both of these types of information helps us make external

93
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:33,159
attributions to either the target or the situation.

94
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:38,249
The second possibility is related to what we focus on when observing behaviour (Storms,

95
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:39,249
1973).

96
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:42,589
It is hopefully no surprise that our eyes are in the front of our faces.

97
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:46,990
This means that when we are observing someone else’s behaviour, our visual focus is on

98
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,999
them as a person, not the situation there in.

99
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:55,419
When we are observing our own behaviour, we can’t really see our body and our focus

100
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:57,949
is on the situation that we perform the behaviour in.

101
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:04,369
Thus, we are more prone to see the situation as the cause of our behaviour.

102
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:07,970
The actor-observer bias is not quite as simple as we’ve described.

103
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:15,430
A 2006 meta-analysis by Malle of 173 studies on this effect suggests that the actor-observer

104
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,449
bias is only apparent under a number of particular conditions.

105
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:23,990
For example, when the actor and observer are intimates of each other, or when trying to

106
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,349
explain negative events.

107
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:31,430
When trying to explain positive events, the direction of the effect actually flips over

108
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,240
and people explain their own positive behaviour in terms of their disposition to a greater

109
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,610
extent than the behaviour of others.

110
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,319
This brings us to an interesting question…

111
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:45,690
do we distort our attributions to look good to others and feel better about ourselves?

112
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,139
Let’s find out.
