00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,870
We had different views of self-esteem going back to the 1970s and 1980s – these were

1
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,320
the heyday of self-esteem.

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,290
Here is a quotation by Nathaniel Branden.

3
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,770
He was a celebrity therapist who became one of the leaders of the self-esteem movement

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,801
… “I cannot think of a single psychological problem — from anxiety and depression, to

5
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:31,559
fear of intimacy or of success, to spouse battery or child molestation — that is not

6
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:35,340
traceable to the problem of low self-esteem” (Branden, 1984].

7
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,000
That was probably an over statement even back then.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,790
But clearly a very bold statement of the idea that low self-esteem is the root of all manner

9
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,730
of all psychological problems.

10
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,920
This sort of thinking even inspired governments and schools and other institutions.

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,699
Many schools and parents and others were suddenly trying to raise their children’s self-esteem.

12
00:00:55,699 --> 00:01:00,670
The state of California in the United States, appointed a commission of experts to try to

13
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:05,980
raise self-esteem throughout California – they hoped by doing this they could address problems

14
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,680
of drug addiction, unwanted pregnancy, crime, and much more.

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,480
They even thought it was going to help balance the state’s budget, because people with

16
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,020
high self-esteem would earn more money and therefore pay more taxes.

17
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,850
It didn’t work.

18
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:24,190
In the late 1990s, the Association for Psychological Science (APS) commissioned a group of researchers

19
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,800
and said, okay, why don’t you guys find out what good is high self-esteem?

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,250
Do people with high self-esteem really benefit from it so that their lives are better?

21
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,260
And so, by extension, would it be worth just trying to boost everyone’s self-esteem?

22
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:43,280
Is this really a good thing - should psychology be persuading people in our civilization to

23
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,620
do this?

24
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:50,350
So, those of us on the panel, we read through thousands of journal abstracts, hundreds of

25
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:56,070
articles looking for objective evidence about the possible advantages of high self-esteem.

26
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,410
For example, we read lots of studies about school performance - school performance was

27
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:04,420
one of the big driving forces behind the self-esteem movement.

28
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,140
This was one of the things where they thought - wouldn’t it be great if school students

29
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,220
could learn better if they had higher self-esteem.

30
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,340
In America, we are always looking for ways to get students to learn their math better

31
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,999
without having to do more math homework.

32
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:22,319
Sure enough, the initial studies found that the kids with the highest grades had higher

33
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,620
self-esteem than the failing students, which gave rise to hope that well if we could raise

34
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,400
self-esteem, that would improve learning.

35
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,569
But psychologists had made the classic mistake of confusing correlation with causation.

36
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:39,329
Self-esteem turned out to be a result, not a cause, of doing well in school.

37
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:44,290
The way they found this out in large studies that tracked students over time.

38
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,819
Your self-esteem one year didn’t lead to better grades the next year.

39
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:52,640
But the other way around, your grades one year did predict your self-esteem next year.

40
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,040
So, the grades come first, then the self-esteem.

41
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,030
Unfortunately, that means that raising self-esteem doesn’t do any good at all in terms of improving

42
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,220
grades.

43
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,069
Thinking you’re good at math doesn’t make you good at math.

44
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:07,930
You really have to do the homework.

45
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,849
We looked at lots of other things too - such as getting along with others.

46
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:15,959
People with high self-esteem (Heatherton &amp; Vohs, 2000) say everybody loves me, I’m very popular,

47
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,689
I have lots of friends.

48
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:20,920
Even in a laboratory study (Brockner &amp; Lloyd, 1986) – where you would say bring in two

49
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,099
people, have them interact and get to know each other a bit, then the researchers will

50
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:29,569
separate them and say, “okay rate what do you think of that person, what do you think

51
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:31,410
that person thought of you?”

52
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:36,200
The person with high self-esteem says – “Oh, they love me, I made a great impression”.

53
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,469
But, when you look at the actual rating - it’s no difference, the other person didn’t really

54
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:46,010
love them - in fact sometimes, the high self-esteem person is seen as egotistical and kind of

55
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,700
annoying.

56
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,169
Some studies (Heatherton &amp; Vohs, 2000) have even found negative reactions.

57
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:51,680
But essentially, it’s no difference.

58
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,450
People with high self-esteem think others like them, t’s not really true.

59
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:03,379
There was also lots of concern among experts about teenage misbehaviour.

60
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:08,250
There was hope if we could boost the self-esteem of youngsters, they’ll be able to say no

61
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:13,599
when others try to get them to try smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol or having sex

62
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,290
and so on.

63
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,329
So we hope to reduce these negative patterns among kids.

64
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,560
But they did giant studies (Baumeister et al., 2003) tracking kids along through this,

65
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,030
it turns out smoking has nothing to do with self-esteem, high or low.

66
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,599
The high self-esteem kids smoke equal levels.

67
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:34,180
With alcohol, there was an effect but it was in the wrong direction.

68
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,710
It was the high self-esteem kids that are more likely to try alcohol earlier.

69
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,770
And the same goes with teen sex.

70
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:48,509
My take on this is that it probably happens because the popular cool kids in school, they

71
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:52,020
have higher self-esteem and they are more likely to be going to parties where they’re

72
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,030
drinking and fooling around sexually.

73
00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:00,720
But in any case, the idea that boosting self-esteem would promote virginity and help people abstain

74
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,130
from alcohol, evidence says that’s just wrong.
