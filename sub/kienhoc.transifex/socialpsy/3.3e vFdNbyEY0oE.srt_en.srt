00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,540
What do you say to a friend when they have a traffic accident or something bad happens?

1
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,160
You usually say, well, it could have been worse.

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,000
And that makes them feel better.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,279
This leads us into another self-deception strategy that people often use.

4
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:28,429
They choose whom to compare themselves to -- and they choose very selectively and strategically.

5
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:32,530
Typically, they’ll compare themselves to others that are similar but are a little bit

6
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,450
worse off than themselves.

7
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,700
An early study (Taylor, 1983) did research on women who had breast cancer.

8
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,320
There are different levels of severity of breast cancer.

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,090
You could have a small lump that is removed or you could lose a whole breast, or lose

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,250
both breasts and so on.

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,000
And they found that at each level of severity, the women mainly compared themselves to the

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,240
women at the next level down, the ones that were worse off.

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,300
This would come up over and over in their conversation - at least I didn’t lose my

14
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,260
breasts, things like that.

15
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,960
People make themselves feel better through what is called downward comparison.

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,280
They do this a lot.

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,950
You can convince yourself you’re doing pretty well just by choosing to compare yourself

18
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,909
to the right people, who are a little worse than yourself.

19
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:19,200
Other mental strategies (Campbell, 1986) include false consensus and false uniqueness.

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,479
These both have to do with how many people are the same as you.

21
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:28,750
False consensus is when you overestimate how many other people are the same as you.

22
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,079
False uniqueness is underestimating how many people are the same as you.

23
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:37,850
These two may sound like opposites - and I suppose they are - but people use them in

24
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,829
a very judicious way to protect their self-esteem.

25
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:43,189
People use false consensus with opinions.

26
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:46,950
So, they may say, pretty much a lot of people agree with me.

27
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,920
It doesn’t matter where you are in the political spectrum - liberal or conservative in the

28
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,399
middle- you tend to hang out more with people who agree with you and have similar opinions

29
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,579
to yourself.

30
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:59,560
And so people tend to think yeah, lots of people agree with me.

31
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,170
Everyone looks at things the way I do.

32
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,609
And that convinces you that your opinions are probably right since people agree with

33
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:06,609
you.

34
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:10,880
Now with abilities – that’s the other way around there you go for the false uniqueness effect

35
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:16,330
– You say - I can play the piano, not that many people can play the piano so my ability

36
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,630
makes me special.

37
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:23,170
In both of these in other words you can make yourself feel better than others even if you

38
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:28,030
recognise exactly where you stand simply by distorting how similar you are to other people.

39
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:32,370
And people with high self-esteem do this more than people with low self-esteem so this is

40
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,750
one of the factors that we think contributes to their high self-esteem - people with high

41
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,030
self-esteem aren’t really any better in general than other people, they aren’t any

42
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,210
smarter, or more beautiful or anything - they just think they are.

43
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:51,150
So, strategies like these enable them to set themselves apart and reassure themselves that

44
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,810
they really are terrific.

45
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:58,920
So, there are a few techniques that people use to sustain positive illusions of ourselves.

46
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,280
I’ll just mention one more.

47
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,560
People (Dunning, Meyerowitz &amp; Holzberg, 1989) measure success or abilities using different

48
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
criteria.

49
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,640
For example, if we asked you what makes you a good relationship partner - you might say,

50
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,400
well, I’m a good listener or I&#39;m a good talker.

51
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,630
I’m good in bed.

52
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,480
I’m good at holding my tongue.

53
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,320
You could think of lot of different things that might make you a good relationship partner.

54
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,320
It’s easy to see how many of us could think we are better than average - because most

55
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,200
of us could find something to focus on or emphasise.

56
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,850
In other words, we humans have slippery definitions of success.

57
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,220
My favourite summary of this strategy was in a book where the author (Thomas Gilovich)

58
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,260
said, “Well this strategy is how every child thinks that their dog is the best dog on the

59
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,340
street.”

60
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,350
Because there are all these different dogs, and dogs have different qualities and each

61
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:49,000
kid can point to something about their dog that is really special and cool.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,930
So people inflate their positive views of themselves, fooling themselves, using these

63
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,010
different self-deception strategies.
