Let&#39;s talk about gestures.

1
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:13,530
Before humans had language, presumably we had ways of communicating: pointing, touching,

2
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,300
and so on.

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,130
These things are called emblems.

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,750
They&#39;re things that communicate something without the need for words altogether.

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,720
Many of them are hand gestures.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,330
We have really primitive simple ones for saying &quot;Hello,&quot; for saying &quot;Goodbye&quot;â€”I guess it&#39;s

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,380
the same one.

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,269
Hello, goodbye, it&#39;s confusing.

9
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:33,580
&quot;Come here,&quot; &quot;Go away,&quot; and so on.

10
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:40,040
The head nod, the head shake, these are emblems for yes and no in the western culture.

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,640
We also have a bunch of emblems for insulting people.

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,940
I don&#39;t know if I need to actually demonstrate them to you.

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,880
There&#39;s probably about six or seven that are like that.

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
There we go.

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,860
I said I wasn&#39;t going to demonstrate, but there they all are.

16
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,590
There&#39;s a whole lot of theories about where they come from.

17
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,290
No one really knows, but many of them are hundreds and hundreds of years old.

18
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,340
Some of them, not so much.

19
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,220
This is a fairly recent one, right?

20
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,750
That&#39;s about twenty years old.

21
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,369
I don&#39;t know if people are still doing that.

22
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:13,220
That&#39;s something that kind of got imported from the West coast of America, the loser

23
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,690
gesture.

24
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,500
Some of them died out altogether, and then they come back.

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,580
Have you seen this one?

26
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,800
Do people do this?

27
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,760
I think it&#39;s making a bit of a comeback.

28
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,430
That&#39;s an old Shakespearian kind of thing.

29
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,670
Actually in &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; they say that, &quot;I bite my thumb at you.&quot;

30
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,370
You flick your front teeth with your thumbnail.

31
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,930
These are kind of fighting words back in Shakespearian days.
