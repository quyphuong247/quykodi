00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,470
How are you feeling?

1
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,010
What do you like?

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,210
What do you want?

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,360
Other people ask us about ourselves all the time.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,910
And we seem to have no difficulty in answering - most of the time.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,670
  Self-knowledge seems readily available.

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,930
But who or what makes the “self”?

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,930
There is one school of thought that people create their own self, that it is by the choices

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,000
you make.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,430
Existentialism in particular emphasised that you are defined by the decisions and actions

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,050
that you do.

11
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,030
  Another take is that you&#39;re born that way.

12
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,660
That you are born with certain predispositions and tendencies and that dictates the path

13
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,130
you will become.

14
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:48,130
A very different view is prevalent in some other social sciences, like sociology, where

15
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,579
they say you are a product of your times and your circumstances.

16
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:55,720
They say that society creates the individuals.

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,370
Society is a giant force, while each individual person is a tiny little product of that.

18
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:05,000
You are created and shaped by historical and social forces, and there is not much you can

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,500
do about that.

20
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,759
Well, certainly there are cultural differences in how selves are understood.

21
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:14,270
And there are historical differences.

22
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,899
People yet also do make choices.

23
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:20,389
So, I think the answer of who or what makes the self is probably not going to boil down

24
00:01:20,389 --> 00:01:24,130
to one or the other, there is probably some combination.

25
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,630
Of course, the sociologists and historians are right - to some degree you are a product

26
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,179
of your circumstances.

27
00:01:30,179 --> 00:01:35,109
And yet, circumstances can mould people in all different ways, people pick and choose,

28
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:38,090
often people reject the forces that operate on them.

29
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:42,859
I like the metaphor that it’s sort of like a buffet - that you can go to the buffet and

30
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:44,560
choose what to eat.

31
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,840
Society lays out the options so that you have to choose to eat from among what&#39;s there but

32
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,759
still you do make choices - and so the product that ends up on your plate is both a result

33
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,840
of what society made possible for you and what you chose among those choices, and how

34
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,559
you reacted within that framework.
