00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:11,570
Being more politically correct doesn’t necessarily mean certain stereotypes of White Americans

1
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,390
and Black Americans have improved.

2
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,700
What people are thinking doesn’t always reflect what they say.

3
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,800
And what people say doesn’t always reflect what they do.

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,610
So, if we’re going to grapple with the issue of racism in contemporary life, we have to

5
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,930
start with that knowledge.

6
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,520
I don’t know how many of you have ever been accused of being prejudiced at some point

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,520
in your life.

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,410
You told a joke, and people were horrified.

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,309
Or, you made some observation and people presumed you were being racist.

10
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:44,920
If this has happened to you before, almost certainly, other people around you panicked.

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,210
People don’t like to be accused of being racist, and they go out of their way to demonstrate

12
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,210
that they’re not.

13
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,260
It has become an extremely strong moral norm to be cool about race.

14
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,120
And yet, in some cases, these negative feelings still simmer underneath.

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,579
So, when do these negative feelings actually leak out and become prejudice?

16
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:10,040
Gaertner &amp; Dovidio in 1986, argued in their theory of aversive racism that most people

17
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,259
are motivated to maintain a non-prejudiced self-image––they find racial prejudice

18
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:20,610
aversive, and endorse fair treatment of all groups, and fear appearing prejudiced.

19
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,539
However, many of these people do subconsciously harbour negative feelings toward those from

20
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:27,099
minority groups.

21
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:32,779
And discrimination leaks out in situations where behaviour can be justified as non-prejudiced.

22
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:37,569
In 2000, Dovidio and Gaertner investigated the change in people’s racial prejudice

23
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:40,700
and biases over a 10-year period.

24
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,869
Dovidio and Gaertner asked white college students to assess the credentials of white and black

25
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:47,859
candidates for a job.

26
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:49,759
The actual qualifications for both white and

27
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,279
the black candidates were the same.

28
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:55,340
However, there were three sets of qualifications that differed.

29
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:01,539
The qualifications of both the applicants were either strong, ambiguous, or weak.

30
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:05,049
Strong qualifications consisted of information that included:

31
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:07,929
Being co-captain of the swim team in high school

32
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:10,670
Being a member of the disciplinary board in college

33
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:14,380
Being sensitive, intelligent, and relaxed.

34
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,340
Ambiguous qualifications consisted of information that included:

35
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,849
Being co-captain of the swim team in high school

36
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,250
Being sensitive, intelligent, and emotional.

37
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,599
Weak qualifications consisted of information that included:

38
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,219
Being co-captain of the chess team in high school

39
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:36,069
Being independent, forthright, and intense. Consistent with other research, Dovidio and

40
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:41,530
Gaertner found that general self-reports of prejudice were lower in 1998 when compared

41
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,129
to reports from 10 years prior.

42
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:49,320
However, in both time periods, white participants did not favour the white candidate when both

43
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,189
the candidates’ qualifications were clearly strong or weak.

44
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:57,390
In fact, participants actually viewed the black candidate more favorably than the white

45
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,749
candidate when their credentials were very strong or very weak.

46
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:04,870
However, participants were more likely to

47
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,790
recommend the white candidate for the job when the candidates’ qualifications were

48
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,810
ambiguous.

49
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,420
In line with the theory of aversive racism, it seems that, although self-reports of racial

50
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,780
prejudice may have declined over the years, it’s possible that there’s still subtle

51
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,560
manifestations of racial bias.Therefore, it seems that, in situations of uncertainty,

52
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,330
people are less likely to give the minority group members the “benefit of the doubt”.
