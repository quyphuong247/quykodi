The early work in social cognition compared the social judgements made by people to the

1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,670
judgements that you would expect from a rational model of inference.

2
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,750
So, a rational model of inference would predict that we systematically combine the information

3
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,449
that we have access to when arriving at a social judgement.

4
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:27,550
It&#39;s perhaps not so surprising that making this comparison shows us that people make

5
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,920
a lot of errors and have biases when they make their social judgements.

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,930
In particular, there is evidence that we use a range of mental shortcuts that are less

7
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:40,329
time-consuming strategies to get a quick solution to a problem.

8
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:44,489
These shortcuts are called heuristics (Kahneman &amp; Tversky), and they are generally functional.

9
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,840
We don&#39;t always have the time or motivation to think every judgement through in full.

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,410
Sometimes however, the quick solution suggested by the shortcut is inaccurate because the

11
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:58,630
general rule doesn&#39;t does not apply to every specific judgement.

12
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:03,020
The first heuristic that we are going to talk about is called the availability heuristic.

13
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,409
This is when people judge an event&#39;s frequency by the ease with which they can bring examples

14
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,230
of the event to mind.

15
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:13,020
So, let&#39;s try some examples to illustrate how this heuristic works.

16
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,840
In this activity, I’m going to ask you to think about a few different questions and

17
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,010
then decide what is most likely to happen.

18
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,370
You will be able to record your responses in the activity that follows this video.

19
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,790
The first question is: Is it more likely that a word in the English language starts with

20
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:35,210
the letter R, such as “Rabbit”, or has R in the third position, such as “March”?

21
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:39,920
To help you answer this question, try to think of some examples of words with R in the first

22
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,280
position and some examples of words with R in the third position.

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,540
The second question is: Which is more likely to kill someone?

24
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,620
A smoking related illness, or a car-related accident?

25
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,950
When answering this question, don’t think about whether you smoke or not or drive or

26
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:02,710
not, but rather what is the risk posed by each of these to the population as a whole.

27
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,840
Next, what animal kills the most people per year in the world?

28
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,800
Check the options in the activity and select one of those animals.

29
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,670
Finally, what causes the largest number of deaths per year in the Australia?

30
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,410
Is it shark attacks?

31
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,600
Floods?

32
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,790
Cyclones?

33
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,920
Ocean rips?

34
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,350
Or bush fires?

35
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,950
Ok, make sure you record your answers in the activity that follows.
