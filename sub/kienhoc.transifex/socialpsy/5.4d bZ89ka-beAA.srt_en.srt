00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:10,170
Well, here are the results for the Festinger and Carlsmith’s (1959) study.

1
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,840
You can see the three conditions on the x-axis, where participants either got paid $1 or $20

2
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,250
to say the tedious tasks were fun, as well as the control group where they didn’t have

3
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,450
to say anything about the tasks.

4
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:28,080
Those from the control condition didn’t really rate the tasks as enjoyable.

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,009
Those who were paid $20 thought the tasks were a bit more enjoyable than those from

6
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:38,530
the control group, but they still thought the tasks were not really enjoyable.

7
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,980
It might surprise you to notice that it was actually the participants who were paid only

8
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:49,180
$1 to say that the tasks were fun who ended up rating the tasks as most enjoyable.

9
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,720
You wouldn’t be alone if you were surprised by this finding.

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,719
It can seem rather counter-intuitive, surely if you are paid more money you should feel

11
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,379
more positively about saying the tasks were fun?

12
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:07,300
Well, it might help to look at the three conditions we have here in terms of the amount of cognitive

13
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,480
consistency or dissonance, in each.

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,550
So, we can see three elements, or cognitions here.

15
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:19,160
We have the behaviour, which is saying that the tasks were fun.

16
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,490
This cognition is fixed; we can’t do much about it because the behaviour was performed

17
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,750
in front of both the experimenter and the new participant.

18
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,270
  We also have the initial attitude, which is

19
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,130
thinking that the tasks were boring.

20
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,440
And we have the reward, which is either a $1 or $20.

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,260
Ok, so in the $20 condition, the cognitions are related like this.

22
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,000
We’ll work out the amount of cognitive consistency by comparing everything to the behaviour,

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,060
because it’s fixed.

24
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,680
Now, the attitude is inconsistent with the behaviour - thinking that the task is boring

25
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,560
is the opposite of saying that the tasks were fun.

26
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,260
The reward, is however, consistent with saying that the tasks were fun.

27
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,570
It’s perfectly consistent to get paid a reasonable amount of money to do something

28
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,899
you wouldn’t otherwise do.

29
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:10,879
It’s called having a job.

30
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:17,319
So, in the $20 condition, we have one pair of inconsistent cognitions, and one pair of

31
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:21,860
consistent cognitions.Let’s take a look at the $1 condition now.

32
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:28,220
Again, the attitude and behaviour are inconsistent, just the same as for the $20 condition.

33
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:34,940
This time however, saying the tasks were fun and getting paid only $1 is not consistent.

34
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:40,829
So, now we have two pairs of inconsistent cognitions, and so there is twice the amount

35
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:45,010
of dissonance in this condition compared to the $20 condition.

36
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,920
That’s why participants in this condition rated the tasks as being more enjoyable.

37
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,020
They were experiencing more dissonance, and because dissonance is aversive, they were

38
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,909
motivated to reduce that unpleasant feeling.

39
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:03,779
They did this by changing the only thing they could––their attitudes.

40
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:08,650
And so, they rated the task as being more enjoyable.For completeness, let’s look at

41
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,480
the control condition.

42
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,159
Here it’s easy to see that there is only one pair of cognitions, and these are consistent,

43
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:19,989
so no dissonance is created and there’s nothing to resolve by changing one’s attitude.
