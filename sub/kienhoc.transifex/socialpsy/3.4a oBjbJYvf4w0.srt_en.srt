00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,490
Some people have really positive views of themselves, others not so positive.

1
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,629
How do you view yourself?

2
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:17,131
Self-esteem is essentially a matter of how you evaluate yourself.

3
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:22,560
There are not that many people who have really negative views of themselves.

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,419
There are people who think really highly of themselves and others more in the middle.

5
00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:30,679
Mentally healthy people tend to have somewhat high self-esteem.

6
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:35,720
They tend to overestimate their good characteristics and have these positive illusions.

7
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,160
Depression goes with low self-esteem, people suffering from depression tend not to have

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,420
so many positive illusions.

9
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,220
This has been an ongoing issue in clinical psychology.

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:50,050
If you go back to the 1960s, people said, what’s wrong with depressed people, they’re

11
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,740
twisting everything and seeing the world in this negative way.

12
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,260
We’ve got to get them out of these twisted, negative ways of thinking.

13
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,980
If they could just see the world as it is, the depression would go away, and they’d

14
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,980
be fine.

15
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,210
But then (Alloy &amp; Abramson, 1979), when people started doing research on it, the research

16
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,150
started saying, oh, no, depressed people are actually seeing the world as it is.

17
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,510
It’s the non-depressed people (Taylor &amp; Brown, 1988) who are seeing it in a positive way.

18
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:15,220
So, then the idea that you could cure depression by getting people to see the world as it is

19
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,150
- no, that’s not the cure - that’s their problem.

20
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,290
Around this time, some psychologists began to turn away from the idea that seeing reality

21
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,010
accurately is the best thing.

22
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,600
Instead, there was a new movement to bolster self-esteem.

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,820
The view spread that many people must be suffering from low self-esteem.

24
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,470
Also, evidence began to accumulate that low self-esteem was correlated with a variety

25
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:43,780
of problems, including school failure, drug addiction, teen pregnancy, poverty, depression,

26
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,390
anxiety, and so on.

27
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:51,060
Seeing these links, thoughtful people began to say, maybe if we could increase everyone’s

28
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,330
self-esteem, it would solve a lot of society’s problems.
