00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,580
Let&#39;s now talk about facial expressions.

1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,210
What&#39;s the point of a face, right?

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,400
Why do we have faces apart from holding all the gunk in?

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,680
One of the major functions is that it communicates emotion.

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,970
It&#39;s really good at it.

5
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,200
It&#39;s almost too good at it.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,970
We don&#39;t always want to have our emotions broadcast to the world.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,090
Some of us have got very &quot;leaky&quot; faces in a sense that our emotions leak out really

8
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,090
quickly.

9
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,050
Humans are really, really good at picking up on them.

10
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:36,910
Now, there&#39;s an argument, and was originally made by Paul Ekman, that there are six basic

11
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,180
emotions.

12
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,440
Happiness.

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,710
Surprise.

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,970
Sadness.

15
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,240
Fear.

16
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,500
Disgust.

17
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,170
And anger.

18
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,510
You might be looking at that list going, &quot;Well, that&#39;s insane.

19
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,020
There&#39;s way more emotions than that.&quot;

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,020
There are.

21
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,120
But it&#39;s a bit like primary versus secondary colours.

22
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:02,060
The argument is that there are six basic emotions—six primary colors of emotions.

23
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,600
All the other emotions you can think of are blends of these emotions, blends of happiness

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,820
and surprise, or blends of sadness and disgust, and stuff like that.

25
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,650
The argument is that there are six basic emotions—and each have a distinct facial expression attached

26
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,280
to them.

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:25,120
Ekman did propose some additional basic emotions in the 1990’s – amusement, contempt, contentment,

28
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:35,300
embarrassment, excitement, guilt, pride, relief, satisfaction, sensory pleasure, and shame.

29
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,680
But let’s keep it simple and focus on the initial list of six.

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,680
Happiness.

31
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,670
You might be looking for an upturned mouth that is what we often do when we&#39;re happy.

32
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,810
We communicate through a smile.

33
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,850
You don&#39;t have to see an upturned mouth to actually register a smile though.

34
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,780
Sometimes, people have their smiling eyes.

35
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,000
You can tell that people are happy.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,030
But yes, stereotypically it&#39;s about the smile.

37
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,490
Obviously, we smile for a number of different reasons.

38
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,490
Why do we smile?

39
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,740
Okay, it&#39;s got to do with happiness.

40
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,100
To show other people that we&#39;re happy.

41
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,789
Some of you might be feeling perfectly happy right now, who knows.

42
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:13,470
You might not be showing that with a smile on your face though.

43
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,269
But if you&#39;re sitting at home on your own and you&#39;re happy, you might not be smiling.

44
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:21,790
If you&#39;ve ever walked down the street and seen someone smiling for no apparent reason,

45
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,069
you might cross the road to avoid them as they may look a little crazy to you.

46
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:30,060
When you are smiling, what you&#39;re trying to do is communicate that you&#39;re happy.

47
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,260
You can try to communicate that you&#39;re happy for a whole range of reasons, one of which

48
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,219
is that you&#39;re happy, right?

49
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:40,439
But it could be that you&#39;re just feeling flat, but you want other people to think that you&#39;re

50
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,900
happy.

51
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,989
Or you&#39;re trying to mask negative emotion, maybe you&#39;re trying to disguise that you feel

52
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:47,849
rejected at the moment.

53
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:51,959
It&#39;s surprisingly common when people have just been rejected for them to put on a little

54
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,529
smile to mask their true feelings.

55
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:59,269
You’ll often see this in reality TV shows, when there&#39;s someone who is evicted from the

56
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:03,930
show and they’re still smiling but they are really hurting on the inside.

57
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,650
You can try turning the sound down.

58
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,769
Often, it&#39;s hard to tell who&#39;s won, because the winner often looks concerned for the loser,

59
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:12,829
and the loser puts on a big smile.

60
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:16,970
Just like when you watch the Academy Awards, you see all the losers live as the names are

61
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:17,970
read out.

62
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,680
They&#39;re all so happy for the winner.

63
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,019
But I bet they’d much rather be the winner themselves.
