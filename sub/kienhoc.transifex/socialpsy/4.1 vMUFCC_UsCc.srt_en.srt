00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,970
So why do people behave the way they do in social settings?

1
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,719
And how do we think about ourselves and others?

2
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,500
We often create our own explanations for why people think and behave the way they do.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,940
We donâ€™t always however, do it in a very systematic way, our intuitive explanations

4
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,439
can sometimes be incorrect.

5
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,390
One of the goals of social psychology is to understand how people think and behave in

6
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:36,880
social settings by systematically testing theories about both thinking and behaviour.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,690
To do this, we need to know how people perceive, process, and organise information about other

8
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,019
people.

9
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:48,400
In social psychology, there was an early focus on social behaviour in groups, and you will

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,699
hear more about this in the other videos in this course.

11
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:56,379
It&#39;s important to note however, that while there are important group-related phenomena,

12
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:59,460
groups don&#39;t have the same effect on everyone.

13
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,530
To understand these differences, we need to understand the underlying cognitive processes

14
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,750
that explain group processes.

15
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,830
The area of psychology that helps us to do this is known as social cognition.

16
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,979
Social cognition makes use of the theories and methods of cognitive psychology and applies

17
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:18,159
those to social psychological phenomena.

18
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,569
We will be looking at impression formation, schemas, social inference, and attribution.
