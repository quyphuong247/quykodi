00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:10,650
All right, so there isn’t a lot of value yet that we’ve found with self-esteem.

1
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,980
But that raises another question, why do people care about self-esteem?

2
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,179
We know that they do.

3
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:22,670
Why did nature design us to care about something that has so little value?

4
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:28,630
One answer is that even though self-esteem itself might not matter that much, maybe it’s

5
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:32,230
basically something that keeps track of something that is important.

6
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:35,160
It could be like the gas gauge on your automobile.

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,690
The gas gauge tells you how much petrol is left in the tank.

8
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,559
The gauge itself does nothing for making the car move.

9
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:45,879
So, the car is like self-esteem, it doesn’t drive it, it doesn’t steer it, but it is

10
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:50,870
a measure of something that is very important, namely whether you are about to run out of

11
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,079
petrol.

12
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:56,949
Self-esteem could be a measure of whether other people will like you.

13
00:00:56,949 --> 00:01:01,170
That does matter in evolutionary history and it’s something we evolved to do which is

14
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,260
to get along with other people.

15
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,840
As human beings, we cooperate with each other, we’re part of social groups.

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,090
Being part of the social group is a key to survival and reproduction which are the criterion

17
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,119
of evolution.

18
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:19,780
So, we have to be concerned about our reputations, about being the sort of person that other

19
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:25,950
people want to be with, to hire, want to marry, want to invite to a party, and so on.

20
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:33,119
So, self-esteem is kind of our internal measure, our monitor, of, whether we are appealing

21
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,470
to others, do they like us, will they like us, do we have social acceptance, and also

22
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,189
social status.

23
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:41,530
  Nature doesn’t care at all what your opinion

24
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:47,010
of yourself is, self-esteem has very little direct bearing on survival and reproduction.

25
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:53,469
In contrast, what other people think of you, that matters a lot.

26
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:58,409
Self-esteem is part of that process, of enabling you to keep track of what others think of

27
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,590
you, or presumably what they should think of you.

28
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:05,600
Let’s go back for a minute to self-deception, to thinking you’re better than you really

29
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
are.

30
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,930
I mean is that really a good idea?

31
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,450
In practical terms, self-deception seems risky.

32
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,220
You want to base your decisions on reality.

33
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,950
If you overestimate how good you are at maths say, and you sign up for an advanced mathematics

34
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,290
class, well you’re going to fail.

35
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:27,100
By the same token, if you overestimate your physical attractiveness and sex appeal, and

36
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,070
you go trying to strike up a conversation or start a relationship with some utterly

37
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:36,450
gorgeous member of the opposite sex, they’re just going to reject you, it doesn’t work.

38
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,480
But, self-deception may be helpful toward fooling others to think well of you.

39
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,454
In my opinion, one of the most creative and important papers (von Hippel &amp; Trivers, 2011)

40
00:02:44,454 --> 00:02:48,680
on self-deception in the last 10 or 15 years was written by one of the Professors here

41
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,860
at The University of Queensland, Professor William von Hippel.

42
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,600
He started with social influence: We benefit if we can persuade others to do what we want

43
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,000
them to do.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,840
Telling them things is helpful toward that.

45
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,770
Of course, we could lie, tell them what we need them to think to do, what we want them

46
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,520
to do, but they may get skilled at spotting lies.

47
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,070
People are good at recognising if you’re faking, or lying or distorting.

48
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:16,170
So, if you know that you’re lying it can make it difficult to sell the message you

49
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,170
want.

50
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:22,100
But if you get yourself to believe it, believe what you’re saying, if you convince yourself,

51
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,880
then you can do a better job of convincing other people.

52
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,110
So, self-deception ultimately may become a means toward persuading others.

53
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,960
You want other people to think well of you, and so if you think favourably about yourself,

54
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,650
you’ll be able to present yourself to others in a way that will look good to them, and

55
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,650
that matters a whole lot.

56
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,420
Then they’re more likely to accept you and include you in their groups.

57
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:47,700
I think this is a key profound insight, that we fool ourselves in order to fool others,

58
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,420
because to get others to look upon us favourably, that’s tremendously important.
