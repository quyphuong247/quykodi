[MUSIC PLAYING] BLAKE MCKIMMIE: What I was hoping we might talk about is self-deception.

1
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,339
So in other parts of the course, we talk about people&#39;s ability to detect when other people

2
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:15,929
are lying to us.

3
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,360
But how is it that we actually develop the skills to get away with lying, and what does

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,480
that mean for the self?

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,000
Why would we develop those skills?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,070
BILL VON HIPPEL: Self-deception is a really interesting question.

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,560
First of all, how could I possibly tell myself a lie and then also believe what I just told

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,840
myself is a lie, right?

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,160
And then second of all, why on earth would I be motivated to do so?

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,480
It seems like the best thing I could possibly do is understand reality as it is, and then

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,960
try to bluff or use reality to my advantage.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,860
And Robert Trivers is the one who proposed an answer to this question, famously in the

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,400
preface to Dawkins&#39; book The Selfish Gene, where he simply said, look, there&#39;s pressure

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,989
on us to lie because we can gain advantages that way.

15
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:58,440
That means that there&#39;s pressures on those who are lying, too, to detect the deception.

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,770
And that introduces a co-evolutionary struggle, where each person, each animal or person,

17
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,420
develops a new strategy, and then a counter-strategy to detect that.

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,790
And one way of short-circuiting this co-evolutionary struggle, or adding a new weapon to it, is

19
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,540
to lie to yourself first.

20
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,250
Because if I can lie to myself first and convince me, well then I&#39;m not lying when I tell it

21
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,250
to you.

22
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,380
And whatever cues I typically admit emit I&#39;m lying, well, they&#39;re not being emitted anymore.

23
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,960
And so that&#39;s the underlying motivation.

24
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,240
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: So if you can successfully deceive yourself, you&#39;re no longer actually

25
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,240
deceiving anyone else?

26
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,240
BILL VON HIPPEL: That&#39;s right.

27
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,880
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: Because from your perspective, you are telling the truth

28
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,130
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: That&#39;s exactly right.

29
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,020
And so you won&#39;t emit any of the cues of conscious deception.

30
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,299
Now, of course, that doesn&#39;t answer the question of how we do deceive ourselves.

31
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:39,690
But that proves to be a lot easier than you think.

32
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,969
And when we think about deception, we think about telling a lie.

33
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:46,520
And so I tell you, Blake, I wasn&#39;t at the bowling alley on Friday night.

34
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,570
But deception is more than just that.

35
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,929
Deception is also hiding the truth.

36
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:51,929
It&#39;s avoiding the truth.

37
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:52,929
It&#39;s a lot of things.

38
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:57,820
And so, if you think that I&#39;m having an affair with your wife and you say, Bill, were you

39
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,210
at the bowling alley on Friday night?

40
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,900
And I don&#39;t want to answer the question, because it&#39;s not a good answer, I can say, You know,

41
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,219
Blake, I really love your tie.

42
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:05,219
Where did you get that?

43
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:09,620
And if I do a good job, you go, yeah, I got this tie at Harrods or wherever I got it.

44
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,909
And the conversation gets de-railed and I&#39;ve deceived you, but I&#39;ve never told you a lie.

45
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:17,130
Well, we do the exact same thing with ourselves all the time.

46
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,290
We learn the news that we want, and we know there may be contrary news around the next

47
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,050
corner and we just don&#39;t look.

48
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,400
You bought some item on a sale, you don&#39;t see what tomorrow&#39;s sale item goes for.

49
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,190
Now, not all of us do this, because self-deception is something that some of us will do some

50
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,750
of the time, others rarely, others often.

51
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,810
It varies, of course.

52
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,780
But the notion is that we can deceive ourselves just as easily by avoiding the truth, by casting

53
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:44,080
doubt on the truth, by learning some of the truth and not all of it.

54
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,060
And these things are actually much easier to do than you might imagine.

55
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,560
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: So there&#39;s quite a bit of research evidence already from things like

56
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,580
post-choice dissonance reduction, where you see the thing that you chose in a much more

57
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,209
positive light than the thing you didn&#39;t choose.

58
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,040
BILL VON HIPPEL: That&#39;s exactly right.

59
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,970
Dissonance is a great example of self-deception.

60
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,599
How else do you get to this sudden change in attitudes, right?

61
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:07,110
Self-serving biases are a great example of self-deception.

62
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,849
The key about all these things is that if you don&#39;t actually believe your own lie, well

63
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:12,110
then they wouldn&#39;t work.

64
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,860
And so in dissonance reduction, when I decide that the album I chose is better than the

65
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,560
album I didn&#39;t choose, I have to focus on its positive features.

66
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,939
And I do it in a way where I&#39;m using cognitive processes to get there.

67
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:26,689
But I&#39;m using them in a biased fashion to get to the answer that I want.

68
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:29,631
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: And you end up genuinely believing that you chose the right thing.

69
00:03:29,631 --> 00:03:31,170
BILL VON HIPPEL: You end up genuinely believing in the choice you made.

70
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,040
And there&#39;s lots of great evidence for these sorts of processes across all of social psychology.

71
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,280
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: So what does your research on self-deception tell us, then, about people&#39;s

72
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,019
strategies or motivations for self-deception?

73
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:46,330
BILL VON HIPPEL: Well, in social psychology in the past, what we&#39;ve always done is treated

74
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,140
this problem as a way of trying to make myself feel better.

75
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,860
To restore the integrity of the self.

76
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,849
From our perspective, though, it has nothing to do with restoring the integrity of the

77
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:54,849
self.

78
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:56,569
It has to do with persuading you, with persuading others.

79
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,760
Now it turns out that you can use a lot of those same social psychology paradigms and

80
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,230
show that, in fact, the motivation is actually to then convince others that you&#39;re a reasonable

81
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,230
human being.

82
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,230
That your actions make sense.

83
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,370
That you&#39;re a healthy individual.

84
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,599
All those sorts of things.

85
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,719
And so what we&#39;ve done in our lab is simply take these old great paradigms and twist them

86
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,780
around to, you have to convince somebody else.

87
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,389
And we get the exact same processes at play.

88
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:21,120
People show the same biases they do in the classic literature.

89
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,590
And the beauty is, in showing those biases, they become more persuasive for other people.

90
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,710
So others, then, regard them as having told a more persuasive story if they first convince

91
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,710
themselves.

92
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,970
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: So self-deception is a way to really maximize your success socially.

93
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,320
BILL VON HIPPEL: That&#39;s exactly right.

94
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,780
If I can convince the world that I&#39;m Bill plus 20%, then the world&#39;s going to give me

95
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,710
what a Bill plus 20% would get.

96
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,220
If I&#39;m only just Bill, I&#39;m not going to get nearly as many things as I might like to have.

97
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,169
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: So it&#39;s actually quite functional, then, to be good at deception, particularly

98
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:52,680
with the self, because it helps you deceive other people, then.

99
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,680
BILL VON HIPPEL: That&#39;s right.

100
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,250
To be good at deception, and also to know your own weaknesses.

101
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,030
And so, for example, in my case, I have terrible source memory.

102
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,750
I can never remember who said what.

103
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,470
Well, what that means is that if you and I collaborate, I&#39;ll think that all the good

104
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,710
ideas were mine because I can&#39;t remember that you came up with them.

105
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,690
And so I&#39;ve become very good at self-deceiving with where the good ideas came from.

106
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,490
But other aspects of my psychology aren&#39;t so malleable.

107
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,700
And so that&#39;s probably a strategy that I&#39;ll use.

108
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,360
You might use a different strategy, depending on where your shortsightedness or where the

109
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,449
holes are in your memory.

110
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:21,449
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: Excellent.

111
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:22,449
Thank you very much, Bill.

112
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:22,949
BILL VON HIPPEL: Sure.
