The media plays a role in stereotyping people.

1
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,170
Obviously, media influence can be explicit, but sometimes it influences stereotypes in

2
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,270
subtle ways too.

3
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:23,010
The explicit ways media can influence stereotypes is how they choose to frame ambiguous behaviour.

4
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,420
This is Britney Spears.

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,350
She is an American singer, dancer and actress.

6
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,790
  The caption says “...troubled star goes

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,870
wild outside the home of her estranged husband.”

8
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:38,280
The image appears to show a shaved-head Britney attacking a car with an umbrella.

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,829
Look at how this behaviour is framed.

10
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,899
This could be the kind of fight that anybody has, but it has been chosen to be framed in

11
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:50,409
line with a particular stereotype of women losing it emotionally, implying they’ve

12
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:53,030
become like children throwing tantrums.

13
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:58,469
This is an example of media framing behaviour that reinforces certain stereotypes.

14
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,429
The media loves stereotypes because they’re familiar and easily identifiable, plus people

15
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:06,640
kind of like them and find them funny.

16
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,530
Sometimes the media portrays stereotyping in really subtle ways.

17
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,890
This is called “face-ism.”

18
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,180
Face-ism refers to the difference in the way men and women are portrayed in photographs.

19
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,460
In the media, photographs of women tend to focus on their body, whereas photographs of

20
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,909
men tend to focus on their face (Archer, Iritani, Kimes, Barrios, 1983).

21
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:30,200
Photographs of men tend to be closely cropped to head and shoulder, signalling ambition,

22
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,200
intelligence, and social prominence.

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,859
Showing more of a woman’s body subtly indicates they’re valued more for the way they look

24
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:40,119
than for their intelligence.

25
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:46,939
Konrath and colleagues in 2012 gathered together over 6500 official headshot photographs of

26
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:54,159
all major political representatives across 25 cultures and six continents between 2004

27
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,149
and 2010, and analysed the way these politicians were photographed.

28
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:03,869
They used the chin to the top-of-the head ratio to determine whether photographs of

29
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:09,720
male politicians showed more of this ratio compared to those of female politicians.

30
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,280
Konrath and colleagues found that cultures that were normally seen as gender equal––for

31
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,140
example, North America and Europe––showed more evidence of face-ism bias in the way

32
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,580
their politicians were photographed, compared to cultures that are normally seen as having

33
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,670
less institutional gender equality––for example, Asia and Africa.

34
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,190
Konrath and colleagues speculated that this difference could have been due to a ‘‘postfeminist’’

35
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,870
backlash that sometimes occurs in cultures that are high in gender equality.

36
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,720
It could also have been due to the different ways that people from different cultures compare

37
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,420
their male and female politicians.

38
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,250
However, it’s unclear as to why we see this difference.
