When people are asked to imagine a French person, very often, they will think of a man.

1
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,480
Maybe he’s wearing a beret on his head, he’s got a stripey shirt and a scarf on,

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,150
and maybe a little moustache, and carrying a baguette?

3
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,730
So he might look a little bit like this.

4
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,880
You may have been thinking about these characteristics when you were describing a French person.

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,020
These characteristics may have popped into your mind, even though you knew there’s

6
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,940
probably not a French person alive who actually looks like this, right?

7
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:42,079
In your mind, you are able to hold your thought about the stereotype, as well as the knowledge

8
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,030
that you’re not taking the stereotype seriously, both, at the same time.

9
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,829
If I asked you to “think of a librarian”, “think of a criminal”, “think of a university

10
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:57,460
professor”, “think of an athlete”, “think of an environmentalist”, it’s likely that,

11
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,920
within a few seconds, something will form in your mind, sometimes in the absence of

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,680
any actual experience with these groups of people.

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,580
It’s likely that similar characteristics appear in our minds.

14
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,620
These are stereotypes and we’re going to cover stereotypes later.

15
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,170
The second component of prejudice is the affective component.

16
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,480
This includes the usually negative feelings about another group, whether it’s dislike,

17
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,140
resentment, or disgust.

18
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,820
The final component is the behavioral component of prejudice.

19
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,140
This is what the word discrimination refers to.

20
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,000
People who are the target of prejudice are being denied opportunities.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,090
They’re treated badly because of their disability, their gender, their sexuality, and so on.

22
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,890
So, these are the three components of prejudice: the cognitive component––the beliefs or

23
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,280
stereotypes people hold about different groups of people.

24
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,820
The affective component––how they feel about them, and the behavioural component––their

25
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,300
intention to behave negatively towards a group and its members.
