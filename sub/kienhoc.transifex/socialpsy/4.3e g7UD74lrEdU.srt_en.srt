00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,520
Blake: So, Jason we’ve talked a lot about how automatic shortcuts and heuristics can

1
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,230
bias our decisions and lead us to make errors but what are some of the times when those

2
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,120
automatic decisions can actually help us, when they can lead us to the right decision.

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,019
Jason: I mean we’ll all experts in a lot of things, right?

4
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:30,609
Presumably a lot of adults are pretty expert when it comes to reading or riding a bicycle

5
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:34,580
and you don’t even recognise it and that’s kind of the interesting thing.

6
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:40,390
We all make these kinds of judgements and decisions without real or whole lot of insight

7
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,360
into the basis of those judgments and decisions.

8
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,620
It’s this automatic process that you really kind of introspect much about.

9
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:57,240
But for experts it does seem pretty unusual, it seems impressive in a lot of cases.

10
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:04,070
For example, chess expert they see a chessboard very differently than we do and in fact what

11
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:08,240
you can do is take the pieces on a chessboard and scramble them in a particular way and

12
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,500
ask them to remember the particular configurations on a chessboard and they can do it, they have

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,610
an incredible memory for chess configurations.

14
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:22,970
Bird experts have incredible memory and discriminations ability when it comes to birds.

15
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,600
Mammograms, you have an expert radiologist looking at a mammogram they can tell whether

16
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,770
its normal or abnormal in milliseconds they can just flash on the screen and be able to

17
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,040
tell whether it’s a weird scan or not.

18
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:43,240
So, what seems odd to us is really just natural to them in the same way that reading or riding

19
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:49,870
a bicycle is to us so, and these are a result of the sort of heuristics or shortcuts and

20
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:54,920
the structure that they spent countless hours doing.

21
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,799
We spent countless hours reading, riding bicycles and so on, they spend countless hours staring

22
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:03,360
at that particular stimulus, and that’s how it happens.

23
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,479
Blake: So, it seems like heuristics or these learned automatic responses are kind of functional

24
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,379
generally in that they can sometimes represent something good that we’ve learnt something

25
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:14,800
to a high level of expertise.

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,159
It’s just that sometimes the general rule doesn’t always apply and we make mistakes

27
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,159
occasionally.

28
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,159
Jason: But there are a lot of experts out there who claim to be experts but actually

29
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,950
don’t have any real expertise.

30
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,340
They think they know what they are doing but in fact when you actually test them which

31
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,139
is why we have the scientific method.

32
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:36,120
When you actually test them to see whether they can actually do what they claim they

33
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,909
kind of fall short and so it seems to be exposure, yes, but also feedback.

34
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:46,340
You absolutely need to know whether you are right or not at those kinds of judgements

35
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,340
and decisions.

36
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,120
Blake: So, given that it can be difficult to know whether we should rely on someone’s

37
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,020
expertise, what are some of the ways we can evaluate people’s claims of expertise?

38
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:02,870
Jason: If you ask somebody whether they can do what they claim we often feel like we’re

39
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,480
all better then we actually are.

40
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,769
Everyone rates them themselves as an above average driver, for example, which can’t

41
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:10,919
be the case because it’s an average right?

42
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:16,140
If I claim to be a wine expert, you just don’t take my word for it you need to test me, right?

43
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,340
Put me in a circumstance where you know the truth and present the information to me where

44
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,920
you are actually testing whether I can do what I actually claim.

45
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,329
We’ve done a bunch of work with for example, fingerprint experts, these are people I talk

46
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:35,769
about the way that people spend their days, these are people that look at pairs of prints

47
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:41,340
8 hours a day every single day of their working days and that’s all they do.

48
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,150
They look at prints that match and those that don’t and they have an incredible amount

49
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,559
of expertise.

50
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:51,219
But we didn’t know whether they could actually do what they claimed or not for 100 years

51
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:53,669
of them actually testifying in court.

52
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:57,819
We had no idea whether they could actually match prints or not which is kind of scary

53
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:04,140
and so you need to do these kinds of experiments to actually kind of probe or prompt that sort

54
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,790
of expertise to actually see whether it exists or not and there’s a lot of different areas

55
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:13,680
where people are making these kinds of grand claims and we really have no idea whether

56
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:13,691
they can do it or not.
