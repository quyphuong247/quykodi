00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:12,430
In the 1950’s a group of researchers, led by Leon Festinger, infiltrated a cult that

1
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,770
believed that the world was going to end due to an impending flood before the dawn of December

2
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,699
21, 1954.

3
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,859
The cult’s leader, Dorothy Martin, revealed the prophecy via the process of automatic

4
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,060
writing––a psychic way of writing words without conscious effort.

5
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,989
Supposedly what you write comes from some sort of supernatural force.

6
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:39,329
Like a ghost communicating through you to the real world.

7
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,410
The believers in the cult thought that if they gave up all of their worldly belongings,

8
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,920
quit their jobs, and cut themselves off from their families and dedicate themselves to

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,079
praying for salvation, they would be rescued by aliens from the fictional planet Clarion.

10
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,850
These aliens were waiting nearby to Earth in their flying saucers.

11
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:04,530
As the prophesied hour for rescue from the flood passed with no sign of a flying saucer,

12
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,221
Festinger noted that there was a lot of concern in the group, they could not explain what

13
00:01:09,221 --> 00:01:10,820
was happening.

14
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:16,470
At about 4:05 am in the morning of December 21, the cult leader received another message

15
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,830
by automatic writing.

16
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,150
The message said that Earth was going to be spared from the destructive flood because

17
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:28,940
it had been saved by the prayers of the cult members, who had spread light across the world.

18
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,540
Festinger noticed a very interesting change in the cult members’ behaviour the next

19
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,810
day.

20
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,640
Previously the cult members had avoided any publicity and did not want to speak to outsiders.

21
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,270
After the prophecy failed however, the group contacted the media and began a campaign to

22
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,320
spread the news that it had saved the world.

23
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,050
Festinger was interested in the role that cognitive inconsistency might play in creating

24
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,220
this change in behaviour.

25
00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:01,640
He proposed a theory of attitude-behaviour relations called Cognitive dissonance theory.

26
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,150
Now when Leon Festinger proposed Dissonance theory in 1957, people thought that we would

27
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:11,560
tend to have more positive attitudes to things that are associated with positive outcomes

28
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,610
or rewards.

29
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,730
This was the behaviourist perspective based on reinforcement theory proposed by Skinner

30
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,060
in 1938.

31
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,670
Festinger thought that under some circumstances, precisely the opposite would be true––a

32
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,060
person would have a more positive attitude towards something when receiving a small reward

33
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,290
compared to a large reward.

34
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,340
This prediction caused quite a stir at the time, as it was rather counter-intuitive.

35
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,190
He thought that this would be the case because one of our fundamental drives or motivations

36
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,370
is to maintain cognitive consistency.

37
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:52,200
Any inconsistency in our thoughts or cognitions, what Festinger called dissonance, was not

38
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,260
pleasant and so we are motivated to reduce it.

39
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,069
He thought that dissonance reduction could be achieved by: changing one of the cognitions;

40
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:05,600
generating new cognitions that restore consonance, or by minimizing the importance of one or

41
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,840
more of the cognitions that are inconsistent.

42
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,600
The precise method we use for dissonance reduction depends on the constraints of reality.

43
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:19,100
For example, in the case of an inconsistency between someone’s attitude and behaviour,

44
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,770
the most readily changeable cognition is the attitude, especially if somebody else saw

45
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,150
the person behaving in the way that they did.

46
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,230
  The reality is that once behaviour has been

47
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,900
performed in front of another person, it is difficult to deny that you have behaved in

48
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,140
that way, and so the attitude is the cognition most open to change.

49
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:45,210
At the core of Festinger’s theory was the idea that cognitive consistency, rather than

50
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,629
reinforcement, was an important determinant of behaviour.
