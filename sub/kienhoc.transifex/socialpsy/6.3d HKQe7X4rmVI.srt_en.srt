00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:10,599
So, what does the experimental evidence for “low balling” look like?

1
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:16,139
Well, Robert Cialdini and his colleagues in 1978 asked some students, “Would you like

2
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,310
to help with an experiment of mine?”

3
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:23,380
They’re going to say, “Yes, that sounds like fun,” and in fact all of the students

4
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,680
that he asked agreed.

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,430
It was only after they’d said yes that he sprung the surprise.

6
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,360
It’s going to be a seven o’clock start in the morning.

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,179
How many people continued to agree to do this experiment after finding out this additional

8
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:38,239
information?

9
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,290
Well, 56% still agreed to help out.

10
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,749
Again, we don’t know if that’s a little or a lot.

11
00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:47,519
We need to have a control condition.

12
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:50,660
What happens if you do the honorable thing and you just admit from the beginning that

13
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,109
this is going to be an early start?

14
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:56,069
So, you’ve got a control group, people that had not been a part of this experiment up

15
00:00:56,069 --> 00:01:00,460
to this point, and you just ask them if they would like to do any experiment that starts

16
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,490
at seven o’clock in the morning, and much fewer people agreed-- only 31% now.

17
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,080
So, to protect yourself against low balling, be very mindful and wary of promises that

18
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,800
people make in order to get you to agree to do something.

19
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,330
Maybe you’re going for a job and they make all of these promises about your salary package

20
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,550
or working conditions, and based on that you make a lot of commitments - you might quit

21
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:27,960
your existing job, you may stop applying for other jobs, or maybe even move house.

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,040
If those promises are taken away, then you’re kind of stuck.

23
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,520
You feel the need to rationalise that it’s still okay to take the job, even though it

24
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,090
isn’t what you initially agreed to.
