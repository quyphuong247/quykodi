00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:08,109
So, what did you predict?

1
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:12,980
Let’s look at what Hovland and Weiss found and see if it is what you predicted.

2
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:18,380
On this graph, you can see the amount that participants were persuaded on the y-axis,

3
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,130
the larger numbers are indicating a greater extent of persuasion.

4
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,840
On the x-axis you can see the two times that participants were asked about the practicality

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,090
of building a nuclear powered submarine––immediately after the message was presented and four weeks

6
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,370
later.

7
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:39,780
The blue bars refer to those who thought the message came from a source high in credibility,

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,829
and the green bars refer to those who thought the message came from a source low in credibility.

9
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:49,879
You will notice, that in line with what Hovland and Weiss expected, immediately after the

10
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:55,059
persuasive message was presented, participants were more persuaded by the communicator who

11
00:00:55,059 --> 00:01:00,420
was higher in credibility compared to the communicator who was lower in credibility.

12
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,880
Interestingly, four weeks later, the picture changes somewhat.

13
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,000
You will see now that the participants were pretty much equally convinced by the message

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,440
about nuclear powered submarines, whether it came from the communicator high or low

15
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,220
in credibility.

16
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,830
Why would this be the case?

17
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,450
Hovland and Weiss called this the Sleeper Effect.

18
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,570
They thought it was due to two processes.

19
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:28,600
The first of these was “discounting”, which is when we give less weight to a message

20
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,670
from a communicator who is not very credible.

21
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,700
Discounting happens at the time that the message is presented.

22
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,740
The second process was “disassociation”, which is the uncoupling of who the communicator

23
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,750
is, from what they said.

24
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,230
Disassociation happens when there is a delay between when the message is presented by the

25
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,710
communicator and when participants’ attitudes are measured.

26
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,270
The Sleeper Effect is obviously a concern when we are thinking about contexts such as

27
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:04,090
election campaigns, advertising, and even jury trials, where people have to retain information

28
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:09,960
for an extended period of time, and then make a judgement based on this information.

29
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,849
There is the possibility that we can be influenced by unreliable information without realising.

30
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:20,150
In essence, if we can understand the message, who said it doesn’t matter so much over

31
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,569
time, as we forget where the message came from.

32
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:28,099
What about another communicator factor that advertisers really love using?

33
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:30,200
Let’s try another activity.
