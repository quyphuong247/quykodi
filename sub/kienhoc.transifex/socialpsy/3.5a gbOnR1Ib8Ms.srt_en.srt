00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:13,050
If you want one word of advice from me, forget about self-esteem, and concentrate on self-control.

1
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,110
Self-control is the real deal.

2
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,320
I was very gung-ho on studying self-esteem for a while and then I realised after about

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,790
a decade, it’s not really such an important key.

4
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,090
It’s really secondary in many crucial ways.

5
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,119
As we’ve seen, it doesn’t really do that much for you.

6
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:33,000
On the other hand, self-control measured at one point leads to much greater success later

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,820
on.

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,580
When you have your own children, or if you become a teacher or coach or whatever, when

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,110
you are trying to improve some of the young people, work on improving their self-control,

10
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,270
not their self-esteem.

11
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:49,600
That’s what going to be better for your child, your students, your athletes, or whatever.

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,100
Better for them, and better for society.

13
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,199
It leads to plenty of good outcomes.

14
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:59,589
There’s new evidence coming out in the research all the time, very much unlike self-esteem,

15
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:04,409
childhood self-control predicts all manner of successes in adulthood.

16
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,650
Self-esteem not so much, self-control yes.

17
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,820
People with good self-control do actually get better grades.

18
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,359
They are more successful in their work after they leave school, they earn higher salaries.

19
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:27,159
Lower self-control makes you more vulnerable to being unemployed.

20
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:34,990
People with good self-control are more popular, they have more stable, lasting friendships.

21
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,560
People with high self-control, they’re not miserable, it’s not like they’re this

22
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,539
puritan, doing their duty, suffering through “I’ve got to have discipline.”

23
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:48,020
They’re actually happier, partly because they have less stress in life.

24
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,430
I say one of the best ways to reduce stress in life is to stop screwing up and making

25
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,600
problems for yourself.

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,710
People with low self-control are more prone to screwing up in that way.

27
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:04,490
They do things that they’re sorry about, they act impulsively and create further difficulties

28
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,890
for themselves.

29
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:11,540
Good self-control reduces that, reduces stress and enables one to feel better on a moment

30
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,880
to moment basis even.

31
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,590
People with high self-control are better adjusted, both their mental and physical health are

32
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:24,230
better, with physical health, the ultimate outcome is living longer.

33
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:29,870
At one point psychologists began to wonder does anything in psychology and personality

34
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:34,260
contribute to people actually living longer, dying later?

35
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,069
So, the first thing they studied was intelligence, because that’s one psychology’s major

36
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:40,069
topics.

37
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:45,130
And yes, smart people do live a little bit longer than dumb people, I suppose for some

38
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,310
obvious reasons.

39
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,070
Then they started looking at other traits, what else can we find?

40
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:57,370
But when they discovered self-control or conscientiousness as it’s called in some circles, that sort

41
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,790
of just took over as a much bigger effect than everything else.

42
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:07,610
People with good self-control do indeed live significantly longer than people with poor

43
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,610
self-control.

44
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,590
I think there are multiple reasons contributing to this.

45
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,640
People with good self-control don’t smoke as many cigarettes, they don’t do as many

46
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,050
stupid things, they don’t drink too much, they don’t take as many chances.

47
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,319
They behave better.

48
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,069
People with good self-control commit fewer crimes, are less likely to be arrested, less

49
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:32,770
likely to engage in domestic violence or abuse, they’re less likely to be prejudiced.

50
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:38,740
All these things show that people with high self-control do better, are better people,

51
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,129
enjoy life more and actually live longer.
