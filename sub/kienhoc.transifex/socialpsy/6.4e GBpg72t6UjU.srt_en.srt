00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:11,559
Ok, imagine you are asked by an experimenter to say how yummy a biscuit is.

1
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:15,599
You’re not allowed to eat it just yet, you have to look at it in a jar.

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,070
Now, this biscuit is either in the jar with only one other biscuit, or it’s sitting

3
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,750
there, looking enticing with 9 other biscuits.

4
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,060
If we ask a whole lot of people to rate how much they would like the biscuits in both

5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,820
of these jars, what do you think they say?

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,640
Worchel, Lee and Adewole (1975) did exactly this.

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,410
What they found was surprising.

8
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,000
When there were only two biscuits in the jar compared to 10, the biscuits were rated as

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,280
being more enticing.

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,899
So, you are sitting there looking at a nice big pile of ten biscuits in that jar.

11
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:49,120
You’re going to get to eat one soon.

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,489
What would happen if out of the blue a second experimenter walked into the room before you

13
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,350
had made your ratings.

14
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,930
This new experimenter explains to the first experimenter that the people in his room have

15
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,850
eaten more of the biscuits than he had expected.

16
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,270
He asked if he could borrow some biscuits.

17
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:09,310
The first experimenter then suggests that it would just be easier to swap jars.

18
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,850
So now you’re looking at a jar containing only two biscuits.

19
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:18,150
Interestingly, when you start by rating the biscuits in the jar with ten of them, and

20
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,910
the jar is taken away and replaced with a jar now only containing two biscuits, the

21
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:28,520
ratings of the biscuits become even more positive than when participants only ever saw the jar

22
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,760
containing two biscuits.

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,810
So, what’s going on?

24
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,710
Well, the scarcity of the biscuits, or how available they are, is influencing how much

25
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,180
we want them.

26
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,540
When there is a drop from an abundance of biscuits, when the jar contains ten, to only

27
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,790
two biscuits, it seems that they are in high demand - lots of other people like those biscuits

28
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,140
so they must be good!

29
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,970
So, social factors can also influence our preferences or persuade us because they can

30
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:00,329
make us think that others value a particular product – it’s in high demand - and so

31
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,600
we value that product more as well.

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,509
This works the other way too.

33
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:09,830
When we start out with only a couple of biscuits in the jar, but that jar is then replaced

34
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:14,940
with ten biscuits because people in the other room are not eating as many as expected, we

35
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,520
then don’t like those biscuits as much as before.
