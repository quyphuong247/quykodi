00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,469
At the turn of the century, many explicitly racist attitudes were not considered racist

1
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:16,090
but rather scientific orthodoxy. It was assumed that races differed in terms

2
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:21,640
of intelligence, sophistication and morality – these assumptions later led to the ideology

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,020
of eugenics. Hitler, for example, argued that the world could be improved by ridding the

4
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:32,230
world of genetically weak or impure races. Today, it is rare to see people argue that

5
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:37,420
some races are superior to others. Also, negative attitudes and stereotypes about many racial

6
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,470
minorities have improved. Katz and Braly in 1933 conducted a classic

7
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:47,680
study that investigated people’s attitudes toward different racial groups. Katz and Braly

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,080
asked 100 undergraduate students from Princeton University to highlight the traits they thought

9
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,040
were most characteristic of different racial groups. The different racial groups included

10
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:03,030
Black Americans and White Americans. The participants were provided with a list of traits that they

11
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,320
could choose from. They were also able to assign traits that were beyond what was listed.

12
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,860
They found that some of the most frequently assigned traits to White Americans were being

13
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,820
industrious, intelligent, ambitious, progressive, and alert. And for the Black Americans it

14
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:25,390
was traits such as superstitious, lazy, ignorant, religious and stupid.

15
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:30,450
This study has been replicated by Gilbert in 1951 and again Karlins and colleagues in

16
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,400
1969 (Karlins, Coffman &amp; Walters, 1969). Together, these studies have been known as the “Princeton

17
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,810
trilogy” and have documented the changes in stereotyping across the different generations

18
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,140
of Princeton students. From the “Princeton trilogy” studies,

19
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,250
what we see, especially for the overtly negative traits for the Black Americans, is a downward

20
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,320
trend. For example, the number of participants assigning

21
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,580
“superstitious” as a trait that is characteristic of the Black American had dropped from 84%

22
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:06,620
in 1933 to only 13% in 1967, which is a massive 71% drop!

23
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,840
The frequency of participants assigning the trait “lazy” as characteristic of the

24
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:19,850
African American had dropped from 75% in 1933 to only 26% in 1967.

25
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:24,771
The trait “stupid” that was assigned by 22% of the participants as characteristic

26
00:02:24,771 --> 00:02:31,840
of Black Americans in 1933 had dropped to 4% in 1967.

27
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:39,040
In Karlins et al’s study in 1967, participants mostly assigned traits such as “musical”,

28
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,031
“happy-go-lucky”, “pleasure loving”, and “ostentatious” as characteristic

29
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:47,810
of Black Americans. In 1967, the frequency in which participants

30
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:53,730
assigned traits such as &quot;industrious,&quot; &quot;intelligent,&quot; and &quot;alert&quot; as characteristics of the White

31
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,640
Americans had declined. And, participants most frequently assigned traits such as “Materialistic”,

32
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,260
“Ambitious”, and “pleasure loving” as characteristic of the white Americans.

33
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,000
Others have replicated the “Princeton trilogy” with a sample of students from different universities,

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,520
and found that stereotypes of African Americans consisted of more positive traits, while stereotypes

35
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,460
of white Americans consisted of more negative traits than before (Dovidio &amp; Gaertner, 1986).

36
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:23,470
More recently, research has found that, regardless of race, almost all stereotypes have become

37
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,599
more favourable (Madon et al., 2001).   From these findings, it seems that certain

38
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:32,379
stereotypes of the White American and Black American groups have improved over the years.

39
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:37,489
This is a good news story, right? You can look at this data in two ways those.

40
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:41,700
One way is that, actually, people’s stereotypes about Black Americans and White Americans

41
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,920
have generally improved. Another way is that, maybe, we just live in

42
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:52,010
a more politically correct era. In 1933, it was okay for people to portray Black Americans

43
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:57,760
as lazy and ignorant. Now, everyone knows to keep negative stereotypes to themselves.

44
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,530
It’s possible that there might be a bit of both going on.
