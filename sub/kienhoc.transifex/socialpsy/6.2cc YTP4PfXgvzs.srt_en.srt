00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:10,510
So, let’s see how the door in the face technique can work.

1
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:15,490
In their 1975 study, Robert Cialdini and his colleagues said to people: “Would you be

2
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,660
interested in helping out with this really good cause?

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,460
We have some troubled kids and we need counseling for them.

4
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,970
Maybe you could help out two hours a week for two years and provide volunteer counseling?”

5
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:31,269
Of course, people replied something along these lines: “Aw, I’d love to, but you

6
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:33,450
know I have a life, so no.”

7
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,489
The researchers would then follow it up with the real request: “Fine, of course.

8
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:39,870
I understand that.

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,080
Actually, I’ve got this favor to ask.

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,829
These kids are going to the zoo in the afternoon and we’ve got no one to look after them.

11
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:48,899
Would it be okay if you were that person?

12
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,160
Could you go chaperone these kids?”

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,440
So, how many people said yes?

14
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,809
Half.

15
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:56,809
People are nice, right?

16
00:00:56,809 --> 00:00:57,850
That’s a big favor.

17
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,500
Like 50 percent of people are like: “By all means, I’m prepared to drag this group

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,560
of troubled kids, who might be extremely difficult to handle, to the zoo for the whole afternoon.”

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,310
That’s impressive, and it’s due to the door in the face technique.

20
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,890
Remember, they started with the big request for a two-year commitment and backtracked

21
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,810
to asking for help taking the kids to the zoo for one afternoon.

22
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,470
But what happens if you don’t use the “door in the face” technique?

23
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,470
When the researchers just came out with it: “How would you like to take the kids to

24
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,060
the zoo for the afternoon?”

25
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,930
This time, far fewer people agreed, actually only 17% of people said yes.

26
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,380
This is partly about reciprocal concession.

27
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,520
Humans are so nice that every time we say no, we feel a twinge of something.

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,360
We feel like we owe something.

29
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,450
There’s also that contrast effect.

30
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,790
Next to something very big, other things don’t seem so big anymore.

31
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:58,430
If you just bought a $200 dress, a $50 belt doesn’t seem like such a big thing.

32
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,420
This also can be taken advantage of by governments and salespeople.

33
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:08,649
Cialdini, from his experience working at a used car yard, said that sometimes in negotiations,

34
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:13,100
buyers would ask for a cheaper deal, they might say: “Look, can you throw the window

35
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,110
tinting in with the deal?”

36
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,070
The salesperson knows full well they can do that, but then gives a big performance: “No,

37
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,280
we can’t do that for you.

38
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,160
We can’t possibly do that...Hang on, you know what?

39
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,200
I like you.

40
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,760
There’s no harm in trying.

41
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,810
I’m just going to go to the boss and see what he thinks.”

42
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,800
So, they’ll go into the boss’s office, and they just talk about golf or whatever,

43
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,080
and then the salesperson comes back out and says: “You know what?

44
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,410
The boss didn’t like it, but we had this big battle about it, and at the end, we came

45
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,910
down on your side.

46
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,150
We can do that for you.”

47
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,350
Now you’ve ended up at the same place.

48
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:53,370
The salesperson made the concession, but psychologically it feels very different for the buyer.

49
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,760
The buyer feels as though this guy has gone into battle for them, even if they haven’t.

50
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,810
So now the buyer’s in the palm of the salesperson’s hand.
