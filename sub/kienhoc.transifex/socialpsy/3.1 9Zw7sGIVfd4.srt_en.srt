00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,330
How many of you think you know yourselves?

1
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,330
What about cavemen?

2
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,830
Do you think cavemen knew themselves?

3
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,240
Do you think cave-people had identity crises?

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,260
Did they searched deep inside to discover themselves?

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,400
People today wish to understand themselves.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,940
They do all manner of things in order to accomplish this.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,070
They take personality tests.

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,570
They ask their friends for feedback on how they look or how they think.

9
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:34,130
They go into psychoanalysis for years to try to learn about themselves.

10
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,680
How universal is this?

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,770
Many scholars point out that, “Know thyself” was carved in stone at the ancient Greek oracle

12
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,520
at Delphi, and they use that to suggest well maybe people always have had the same yearnings

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,820
to understand themselves.

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,240
On the other hand, other experts argue that no, it was really quite different back then

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,780
- what “Know thyself” meant was more like know your place.

16
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,780
Know what you’re supposed to be doing, and do it.

17
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,530
We don&#39;t have any evidence that they had identify crises or they searched inside to discover

18
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,610
themselves.

19
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:12,460
The very idea that there is a hidden self that is different from how you act, and that

20
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,471
the real self is buried inside you and needs to be dug up and explored or discovered, this

21
00:01:17,471 --> 00:01:22,640
is a fairly recent and modern innovation the last couple of centuries.

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,810
The human self is really quite extraordinary, there is nothing like it elsewhere in nature.

23
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,810
There is no other mammal certainly that has anything like what the human self does.

24
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,659
The human self can play multiple roles in different situations, it shifts among them.

25
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,220
Rather comfortably, you go to work, and act one way, you go home and act another way,

26
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,780
see your friends and family, act a different way.

27
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,920
You act differently at different times; the human self is very competent at that.

28
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,810
Even at work you can get promoted, do a different job play a different role in the

29
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,530
same organisation.

30
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,049
The self manages this just fine.

31
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:02,140
The human self also is highly aware of itself.

32
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:10,310
It’s often critical of itself, often approving, it’s able to moderate itself to change itself.

33
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,700
Other animals don&#39;t do this kind of thing much at all.

34
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,120
Most animals live in the present, that’s about it.

35
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,330
So, what is going on with humans?

36
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,870
This section will help you learn more about your self … and about everybody else’s.
