00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,220
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: Well, thanks for joining us, Barbara.

1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,019
So, hostile sexism seems to be a pretty obviously negative attitude towards women.

2
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,800
And benevolent sexism, on the face of it, looks to be a pretty positive attitude.

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,940
Now, it seems like a bit of a contradiction to believe in both, but the research shows

4
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,300
that they&#39;re quite-- you know, people who believe in one tend to also believe in the

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,300
other.

6
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,300
How&#39;s that possible?

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,890
BARBARA MASSER: So you&#39;re right, hostile sexism, whether directed towards men, or directed

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:36,180
towards women, seems like a fairly negative attitude towards people of that gender.

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:43,260
If we concentrate on just women, it&#39;s a belief that women are incompetent, inferior to men.

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,620
And it&#39;s based on this notion of women being inherently very competitive or trying to take,

11
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,879
usurp men&#39;s power.

12
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,260
Benevolent sexism, at least on a surface level, looks very positive.

13
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:59,140
It&#39;s full of positive connotations towards women, it looks very much like chivalry.

14
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,609
And the person who holds those attitudes can feel very positive about themselves, because

15
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:07,460
they only wish well towards women, and they&#39;re trying to protect them and trying to look

16
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,460
after them.

17
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,240
But I guess once you go beyond the surface, you can start to see that it has its roots

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,750
in the same sort of ideology that hostile sexism does.

19
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,110
In that it comes from a fundamental belief that women are inferior to men, and therefore

20
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,720
in the context of benevolent sexism, need to be protected because they&#39;re inferior and

21
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,320
can&#39;t cope without men by their side.

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,290
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: So one of the interesting things about the research on benevolent sexism

23
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:39,460
and hostile sexism is it&#39;s not just men who believe in these things, it seems to be also

24
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:45,280
that, to a large extent, women have similar levels of belief in hostile and benevolent

25
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,280
sexism.

26
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,310
BARBARA MASSER: Yeah, so when you look at mean scores on the hostile and benevolent

27
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,689
subscales of the ambivalent sexism inventory, you can see that often you get a gender difference

28
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:59,640
in scores on the hostile sex subscale, so that men typically score higher than women.

29
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,909
But when you look at scores on the benevolent sexism subscale, it&#39;s not that unusual not

30
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:04,909
to get a difference.

31
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:09,010
So women endorse these statements to the same degree that men endorse those statements.

32
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:12,650
And that&#39;s probably related to the subjectively positive tone of those statements-- they&#39;re

33
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,310
saying nice things about women and their relationship with men.

34
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,500
And so it&#39;s not unusual to get equivalent scores on that subscale.

35
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,700
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: Now are these sorts of beliefs sort of, you know, specific to a particular

36
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,819
cultural background?

37
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:31,370
Or is there evidence that they&#39;re fairly common around the world?

38
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,540
BARBARA MASSER: There was a large scale study done that sampled over 15,000 people from

39
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,910
19 different countries, and what you see there is there are, obviously, variations in the

40
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,810
level of endorsement of hostile and benevolent sexism.

41
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:49,080
But the two subscales always remained positively associated, so people who tend to endorse

42
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,970
hostile sexism also tend to endorse benevolent sexism.

43
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:56,840
And in fact, the level of hostile and benevolent sexism were associated with the level of gender

44
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,409
inequality in the country.

45
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:04,019
So these do tend to be pretty prevalent beliefs, with some variation, obviously, in mean levels,

46
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,349
but they are prevalent in a wide range of cultures around the world.

47
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:10,290
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: And probably, you know, the most important question-- what effect do they

48
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,290
have on people?

49
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,349
You know, if you really believe in benevolent sexism, how&#39;s it going to affect how you treat

50
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:17,349
people?

51
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:18,830
BARBARA MASSER: Well, it&#39;s a curious thing.

52
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,819
So I mean, obviously, I think if you think about hostile and benevolent sexism, how can

53
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:26,090
you reconcile if you&#39;re like, both loving and hating women simultaneously?

54
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:32,440
And I think this occurs mainly because people tend to subtype women and direct their different

55
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,099
forms of prejudice, their hostile or their benevolent sexism towards different subtypes.

56
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:40,579
So when we look at the research, and certainly the very early research in this area, we saw

57
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:45,569
that hostile sexism was really directed towards women who were challenging men for power in

58
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:46,569
society.

59
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:52,561
So people like feminists and career women were negatively evaluated by those who endorse

60
00:03:52,561 --> 00:03:53,819
hostile sexist views.

61
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:58,400
And we see that come through in the research since, in terms of outcomes.

62
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,480
When we look at benevolent sexism, benevolent sexism is related to positively endorsing

63
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,920
groups like housewives, or women who don&#39;t overtly challenge the status quo in terms

64
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,110
of the gender hierarchy.

65
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:15,090
Because both hostile and benevolent sexism actually feed into that sort of legitimizing

66
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:20,239
ideology which keep women in an inferior position to men.

67
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,270
So when we look at the behavioral effects of hostile and benevolent sexism, hostile

68
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,000
sexism looks like pretty much any other prejudice that we could recognize.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,810
So it&#39;s related to negative evaluations of those women I just spoke about.

70
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,990
So it&#39;s related to negatively evaluating women in workplace, particularly when those women

71
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,830
are challenging for higher management positions within those workplaces.

72
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,509
But more recently, we actually also see that hostile sexism has some quite negative implications

73
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:47,509
for men.

74
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:51,220
So there&#39;s been a great deal of work done recently looking on relationship implications

75
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,940
of endorsing hostile or benevolent sexism.

76
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,699
And men who endorse hostile sexism tend to be less satisfied in their relationships,

77
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,520
they have a more antagonistic view towards that partner.

78
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,110
And generally they&#39;re quite unhappy, because of their fundamental beliefs they have about

79
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:10,830
women and what women are trying to do, which is essentially take their power away.

80
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,780
I think, also, when you look at the effects of hostile sexism in terms of experiencing

81
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,771
that as a woman, if someone is hostilely sexist towards you, it&#39;s very easy to recognize that

82
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:23,330
it&#39;s a form of prejudice or it&#39;s a form of sexism.

83
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,920
And what we see in the literature is that women obviously feel quite angry about that,

84
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,550
they can immediately attribute this to being a form of prejudice, they get angry about

85
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,550
it.

86
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:36,250
And it actually results in some cardiovascular reactivity, but it&#39;s like a flash fire, so

87
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,770
it comes and it goes pretty quickly.

88
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,530
What we also see is it also motivates women because they recognize it very quickly as

89
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,030
a form of prejudice to engaging collective action.

90
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,770
So while it may build their uncertainty about their group and make them feel quite uncomfortable

91
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,319
about the fact that women are being discriminated against, it actually motivates them to actually

92
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:58,910
do something about this inequality they see in society.

93
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,150
So hostile sexism, because it&#39;s quite blatant, quite easy to identify, can actually have

94
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:08,480
quite a motivating impact to women when they experience it.

95
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,520
Benevolent sexism on the other hand, is a bit more difficult, because you&#39;re actually

96
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,050
faced with someone who&#39;s saying something quite positive towards you and yet there&#39;s

97
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,510
an uneasy undertone that actually the bigger implication of what they&#39;re saying is less

98
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,110
than positive.

99
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:27,120
And because women have more trouble in identifying it or attributing it directly to being a form

100
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,250
of prejudice, or this person is discriminating against me, that causes longer-termed effects.

101
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:37,811
So in terms of cardiovascular reactivity, they have a less intense reaction to it, but

102
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:41,340
it&#39;s a slow burn, it takes longer to recover from.

103
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,300
And that&#39;s really because it&#39;s kind of ambiguous.

104
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,160
You know, am I reacting to something more or is this person just being nice or are they

105
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,600
being prejudiced towards me?

106
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,540
So it&#39;s a slow burn reaction.

107
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:57,169
And when we look at the research that&#39;s looked at how women cope in the workplace when people

108
00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:01,990
are benevolently sexist towards them, we can see that it causes them some confusion.

109
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:08,940
They suffer an impact in terms of self-efficacy, in terms of their confidence, or about their

110
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,940
competence.

111
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,759
But it also impacts in terms of things like mental intrusions-- they feel confused about

112
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,240
what they&#39;re actually encountering.

113
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,330
So it has a more insidious and long-lasting effect, which is really difficult to counter,

114
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,880
because of course this person is just being nice to you.

115
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,030
We also have seen that there&#39;s been a whole bunch of research done on the effects of benevolent

116
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,039
sexism in relationships.

117
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:36,900
So there&#39;s been a really nice longitudinal study that shows that women who are in relationships

118
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:42,340
with men who are benevolently sexist, actually then tend to alter their personal level of

119
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,800
benevolent sexism to match their partner&#39;s.

120
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,240
But what we can see is that when that person-- that woman has a high level of benevolent

121
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,280
sexism and the relationship starts to go wrong, obviously that&#39;s more confronting to her and

122
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,490
less pleasant, because all her ideals about what a relationship should be have gone out

123
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,490
the window.

124
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,210
And so it can have a more long-lasting harm for those individuals.

125
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:08,340
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: So to sum up, it can basically have like, a pervasive effect on people&#39;s

126
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,990
interpersonal relationships, but then also how they treat work colleagues and just generally

127
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,310
perceive the social world.

128
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:19,460
BARBARA MASSER: Absolutely, because you clearly attribute it [INAUDIBLE] this person is clearly

129
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:24,780
saying something very negative or very nasty about me as an individual, it has that kind

130
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,479
of underpinning effect, whereby you&#39;re a little bit uneasy with this individual.

131
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:32,390
Are they being nice to me or are they being nasty to me?

132
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:37,470
And it can undermine all aspects of your performance, which, of course, just goes towards the greater

133
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:43,200
will of benevolent sexists, which is to keep women in the place that is inferior to men.

134
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,010
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: Thank you.
