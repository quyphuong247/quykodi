0
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,410
Wouldn&#39;t it be cool if we could predict how people will behave in the future, and also

1
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,059
change their behaviour?

2
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,070
Well, with a little knowledge about attitudes, and how they are related to behaviour, you

3
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,240
can!

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,590
Since World War 2, there has been a lot of interest in looking at how attitudes are formed,

5
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,779
what effect they have, and how you might go about changing them.

6
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:30,849
People thought that influencing attitudes might be particularly useful in the war effort.

7
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:35,219
Propaganda was used by governments to get the public to support the war efforts at home

8
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,760
by getting them to change their behaviours.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,920
Maybe drive less to save fuel, or invest their money in war bonds.

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,890
And it was also used in an effort to attempt to get people in enemy countries to rise up

11
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,440
against their own governments.

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,379
People also hoped that understanding attitudes would help us unravel a range of social behaviours

13
00:00:54,379 --> 00:01:00,530
such as discrimination, aggression, voting patterns, and religious activities.

14
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:05,129
In recent times, the focus has been on the application of what we know about attitudes,

15
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,200
to understand why people behave the way they do.

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,000
For example, like exercising regularly or giving up smoking.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,230
Or how political campaigns can influence voters, what makes advertising more effective, and

18
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:21,010
what the public thinks about important topics like climate change.

19
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,780
So, what is an attitude?

20
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,390
Sometimes people use the term &quot;attitude&quot; to refer to whether someone has a positive or

21
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:32,680
negative personality–as in they have a &quot;bad attitude&quot;.

22
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,500
But that’s not what we mean by “attitude”.

23
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,590
According to Russell Fazio, an attitude researcher who published this paper in 1986, he said,

24
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:47,340
when we talk about an attitude, we’re talking about an association between a behaviour or

25
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,430
object and an evaluation (Fazio, 1986).

26
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,420
Himmelfarb and Eagly (1974) suggested that we can think about an attitude as having three

27
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,180
components: beliefs, feelings, and behavioural tendencies.

28
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,380
We refer to this as the Tri-partite Model.

29
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,820
Because it has three parts.

30
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,259
For example, let&#39;s imagine I have a positive attitude about Bollywood films.

31
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:13,870
In terms of my belief, maybe after talking to my friends about Bollywood films I could

32
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,849
believe that those films are entertaining.

33
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:22,130
In terms of my feelings, watching Bollywood films may make me feel good.

34
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,980
Finally, my positive attitude may include behavioural tendencies.

35
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,499
This might mean that I would be willing to watch Bollywood movies.

36
00:02:30,499 --> 00:02:35,219
Now, it might be helpful to talk about what attitudes are not to clarify what we mean

37
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:38,510
by our definition of attitudes.

38
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,939
Sometimes people confuse attitudes with &quot;values&quot;.

39
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:44,959
Values are your judgement of what is important in life.

40
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,549
Values are broad and abstract, and are not necessarily linked to a particular thing or

41
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:50,549
behaviour.

42
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:52,670
  For example, you might value achievement in

43
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,709
life.

44
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:56,489
Attitudes by definition though are linked to a specific thing.

45
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:01,349
So, if you value achievement, or doing well in life, you may have an attitude of doing

46
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:04,010
well in this course.

47
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,389
Opinions are also sometimes confused with attitudes.

48
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:12,299
An opinion is a verbal expression of an attitude, it’s what we say our attitude is.

49
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:17,090
So, if this is the case, why is an opinion different from an attitude?

50
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:22,290
Well, one of the reasons why opinions might be different from attitudes is that sometimes

51
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,290
what we say does not match what we think.

52
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,319
Let’s think of a hypothetical scenario that might illustrate this.

53
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,370
Imagine you&#39;ve recently met someone and started dating them.

54
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,379
It&#39;s time to have dinner at their parent&#39;s house, and it&#39;s the first time you are meeting

55
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:38,489
the parents.

56
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:43,230
You arrive, and your date&#39;s father starts telling you he has prepared his special meal

57
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,639
and that he hopes that you will like it.

58
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:50,549
The food comes out to the table, and as the roast chicken is proudly presented, to your

59
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:56,689
horror you realise your date has forgotten to mention to their parents that you are vegetarian.

60
00:03:56,689 --> 00:04:02,609
Now one option here is to accurately express your attitude and say that you are a vegetarian

61
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,799
and won&#39;t eat the meal because you won&#39;t enjoy it.

62
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:11,029
The alternative, perhaps to manage the impression that you create, is to express a different

63
00:04:11,029 --> 00:04:15,120
opinion and say how much you love roast chicken.

64
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,910
So sometimes, we express an opinion that is different to our true attitudes due to social

65
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,349
pressure, fear of sanctions, or because we are not thinking about our actual attitude

66
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,830
at that particular point in time.

67
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:32,449
Finally, attitudes are also sometimes get confused with schemas.

68
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:36,270
Remember that schemas are our mental representations of how things are.

69
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:41,560
For example, they store our scripts for what happens at particular events, and our knowledge

70
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,449
about what certain groups of people are like.

71
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:49,770
Attitudes, on the other hand, by definition suggest how people feel about objects and

72
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,050
behaviours.

73
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:55,819
Schemas don’t always have this feeling component and so they can be different to attitudes.
