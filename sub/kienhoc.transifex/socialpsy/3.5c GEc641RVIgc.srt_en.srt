00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:12,090
Many people think of self-control as having something to do with eating and dieting.

1
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,450
And this is of interest when we have issues like an overweight population.

2
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,700
So, let’s spend some time thinking about how self-control can reflected in eating and

3
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,700
dieting.

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,109
Dieting is extremely common.

5
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:29,220
By some measures, the majority of girls have dieted by the age of 13 already (Heatherton

6
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,220
&amp; Baumeister, 1991).

7
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,360
Half of the female students at the university will be on a diet at any given time.

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,940
Rates of dieting are a little bit lower among men, but increasing there too.

9
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,890
We know dieting is largely unsuccessful in the long term - people will lose weight but

10
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,670
then they gain it back and often they gain back more than they lost in the first place

11
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,670
(Heatherton, Polivy &amp; Herman, 1991).

12
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,370
So, what happens is gradually the weight gets higher and higher.

13
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,060
And the going up and down is especially bad for your body.

14
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,880
It’s bad for your body to gain and lose weight.

15
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,950
It may be healthier to even just be fat and stay fat than to be fat and thin, fat and

16
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:08,820
thin and fat, and plus inner processes, your body learns to resist the dieting.

17
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,799
It’s not the greatest thing.

18
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,049
But, consider for a minute how these three components of self-control are illustrated

19
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:18,259
in the example of dieting.

20
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:19,320
First the standards.

21
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,180
These are the ideas of how you should look.

22
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,719
The standards tend to be unrealistic.

23
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,350
People have an idea of what they should weigh, and how thin they should be.

24
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,789
These standards somehow have gotten increasingly difficult.

25
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:37,409
There are some nice studies done in the United States looking at say our Miss America beauty

26
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:43,539
contest, supposedly the most beautiful women in the country compete to be chosen as Miss

27
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:44,539
America.

28
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:49,959
So, some researchers look at these year after year, and over the years, all the contestants

29
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:56,030
for this crown have gotten thinner, year after year it’s a thinner crop of contestants.

30
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:02,659
Also, going back to the 1950’s the winner tended to be about average of the top 50 contestants.

31
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:08,220
We have 1 from each of the 50 states, but by the 1970’s the winner was one of the

32
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,700
thinnest even among that thinner group of which all of them were thinner than they were

33
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,230
in the 50s.

34
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,909
The same went for pinup women and Playboy centrefolds - Playboy magazine had pictures

35
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:20,959
of scantily clad women.

36
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,580
They too became thinner over the years.

37
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:30,349
That’s a sign that the cultural norms for thinness, the ideals that women embrace become

38
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:31,790
increasingly unrealistic.

39
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:37,069
So, standards contribute to some of the pathological eating patterns.

40
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:43,019
It’s very much an aspect of the competition among women that drives this.

41
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,830
It isn’t that their boyfriends there – there may be some pressure from there.

42
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,780
The women clearly want to be thinner than their boyfriends want them to be, the men

43
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,660
actually don’t seem to care as much or they like a wider variety.

44
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:00,569
So, it’s locking onto these unrealistic standards that puts the increasing pressure

45
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:05,250
so that’s one thing that makes dieting, more difficult and more doomed.

46
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,370
The second component of self-control I said is monitoring, keeping track.

47
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:15,079
What happens when you go on a diet you usually keep track very scrupulously, you keep track

48
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:20,390
of what you eat, you record how many calories you consume each day, also you weigh yourself

49
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,330
repeatedly to see if your weight is changing.

50
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,599
This is an interesting thing, they use to say don’t weigh yourself every day, because

51
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:30,299
that will be discouraging, your weight will fluctuate from one day to the next and so

52
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:31,299
on.

53
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:36,290
They use to say only weigh yourself once per week and that kind of disturb me as a self-regulation

54
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,890
researcher, it went against the prevailing evidence, you’ve got to monitor yourself

55
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,439
and keep track regularly.

56
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:48,220
So, I was puzzled about this for a while but then a study came out about five years ago

57
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:53,989
I think that found that people who weighed themselves every day, they are the ones who

58
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:57,080
do the best at losing weight and keeping it off.

59
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:02,349
So, yes, that’s what we thought all along - keep track of your behaviour very explicitly,

60
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:07,760
weigh yourself every day, store that information, that’s what contributes to success.

61
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:15,150
Now, in terms of monitoring what you eat, well, that’s important, and people eat more

62
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,859
when they don’t keep track of what they’re consuming.

63
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:22,910
There are plenty of interesting studies on this – there are studies for example that

64
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:27,630
ask people “how do you know when you are finish eating, or when your meal is ended?

65
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:33,380
When they gave this In France, one of the common answers was – I know dinner is over

66
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,509
when the food doesn’t taste quite as good to me anymore.

67
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:41,800
So, they are noticing the taste of the food and they start to get a little less pleasure

68
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,790
and that’s a sign that their body isn’t craving it as much so they stop eating.

69
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:51,910
In America, one of the most common answers was – I know dinner is over when the television

70
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,440
program I’m watching is over.

71
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,210
So, they’re not paying attention at all to how much they’re eating.

72
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,910
They’re just watching television and they eat until the show is over and then they stop.

73
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,150
So, if they’re paying attention to the television and they’re watching a sporting game, if

74
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,819
the games goes into overtime, they eat another plate of french fries.

75
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:16,569
Or other people have done studies in bars where you can pay a certain fee and you can

76
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:21,199
eat all you want say of chicken wings Some researchers went to a couple of these

77
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,910
and they said “We’re going to tell the wait staff, by random assignment with some

78
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:30,319
of these tables, clear away the bones whenever you can, from people eating chicken - it makes

79
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,069
bones, clear away the bones.

80
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:36,840
And with others, don’t clear the bones away until they’ve finished eating, let the bones

81
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,389
pile up.

82
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:40,009
So, what do you think happened?
