00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:09,139
It  seems that stereotypes can taint how people

1
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:10,540
view “reality”.

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,970
The same behaviours can be viewed in very different ways depending on the assumptions

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,700
and stereotypes that people bring to the situation.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:23,020
One prevailing stereotype of the Black communities in Australia, the USA and Europe is that they

5
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,750
are relatively aggressive and inclined to criminal behaviour.

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,550
When people view others through the lens of the stereotype, neutral and unthreatening

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,290
behaviour can be re-interpreted as sinister and aggressive.

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,030
This can have tragic consequences.

9
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:43,290
Duncan in 1976 asked a group of White participants to watch a TV which they thought was showing

10
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,489
a live conversation between a Black man and a White man.

11
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,750
The conversation degenerated into an argument in which one person lightly shoved the other.

12
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,290
The participant’s job was to provide an interpretation of the events.

13
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,880
Duncan found that the participants interpreted the light shove as more violent when it was

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,430
performed by a Black man than when it was performed by a White man.

15
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,200
When the White man performed the light shove, participants were more likely to interpret

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,189
the shove as “playing around” or “dramatising”.

17
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:16,810
   So, the same behaviour, but interpreted through

18
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,290
different lens.

19
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,189
The reality that people see is quite different.

20
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:25,689
Participants were more likely to attribute situational factors when the light shove was

21
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:30,130
performed by the White man, and were more likely to attribute person factors when the

22
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,279
light shove was performed by the Black man.

23
00:01:33,279 --> 00:01:35,020
  These results seem to demonstrate that the

24
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:39,020
concept of violence was more accessible to the participants when it was associated with

25
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,869
the Black man compared to when it was associated with the White man.

26
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,060
Again, this can have tragic consequences.

27
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:52,329
In 1999, Amadou Diallo, a 23-year-old West African man was shot and killed in New York

28
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:54,590
City by four police officers.

29
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,840
Diallo was an undocumented immigrant from Guinea.

30
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,380
One night, four police officers––wearing street clothes––were searching the streets

31
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,179
of New York looking for a serial rapist.

32
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:09,310
They came to an apartment complex at around midnight and saw Diallo standing outside the

33
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,619
building.

34
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:15,200
The police officers thought that Diallo matched the general description of the serial rapist

35
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,860
they were looking for.

36
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,390
The lights from the apartment complex were not working at the time, so all the police

37
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,440
officers could see of Diallo was a backlit silhouette of him.

38
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,080
The police officers ordered Diallo to stop and “show his hands”.

39
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,390
But, Diallo ignored the police officers’ orders and tried to run away.

40
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,600
Diallo eventually stopped.

41
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,980
But, he ignored the police officers’ orders to not move and reached into his jacket to

42
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,860
take out his wallet.

43
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,100
One of the four police officers thought that the square object was a gun, and yelled out

44
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,980
“Gun” to the other police officers.

45
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:53,680
They then opened fire on Diallo thinking that Diallo had a gun and was about to shoot them.

46
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,900
During the shooting, one of the police officers tripped on something and fell backwards, causing

47
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,260
the other police officers to think that this police officer had been shot.

48
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:07,280
The police officers fired a total of 42 shots, and half of the shots struck Diallo, killing

49
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,380
him.

50
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,180
Later, no weapons were found on Diallo’s body.

51
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,790
It was confirmed that the object that Diallo pulled out of his jacket was a wallet and

52
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,930
not a gun.

53
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,350
The four police officers were charged with second degree murder, but were later acquitted

54
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,480
of all charges.

55
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,410
However, it’s easy for us to blame the police officers for their wrongdoing after finding

56
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,060
out that Diallo was unarmed.

57
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,710
It was dark.

58
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,670
The police officers had ordered Diallo to freeze.

59
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,770
Diallo didn’t.

60
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,620
Instead, he reached inside of his jacket.

61
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,960
If the object he had reached for was in fact a gun, there would be less to question of

62
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,110
the police behaviour.

63
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:49,290
This incident really got researchers starting to think about the actions of the police with

64
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,250
regard to race.

65
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,850
The obvious question was…

66
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,390
Would this have happened if Diallo was white?

67
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,930
In 2002, Correll and colleagues (Correll, Park, Judd &amp; Wittenbrink, 2002) constructed

68
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,730
a computer game in which people had to decide whether to shoot people or not.

69
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,680
The targets that participants were instructed to shoot were either Black

70
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,890
American or White American.

71
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:14,430
The targets were either holding guns or other objects, and were shown in different environments.

72
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,189
The participants were instructed to shoot when they see armed targets and to not shoot

73
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:21,410
when they see unarmed targets.

74
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,790
If they got it wrong, they lost points.

75
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,520
This type of pressure in part simulates some of the pressure police officers are under

76
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,749
when they’re in that kind of situation.

77
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:34,499
To create more pressure in some cases, Correll and colleagues also varied the amount of time

78
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:37,550
that the targets were shown on the screen.

79
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,599
Correll and colleagues found that white participants were faster at making the accurate decision

80
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,960
to shoot an armed man when the target was Black American compared to when the target

81
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,310
was White American.

82
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,580
They also found that participants responded quickly and accurately to not shoot an unarmed

83
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:57,080
man when the target was white compared to black.

84
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,930
   Not only that, but when you look at the errors

85
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,870
that people made, they were more likely to make an error for armed targets when that

86
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:08,289
person was White, so their error was to mistakenly not shoot the person.

87
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:12,639
For unarmed targets, the errors they made were the opposite, they were more likely to

88
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,400
mistakenly shoot a Black target.

89
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,789
That’s a pretty catastrophic error really.

90
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:18,809
You might think, “Aha!

91
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:21,990
This is like a racial conspiracy, and we always knew that.”

92
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,080
However, it’s not quite as simple as that, because Correll and colleagues also measured

93
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,810
how racist people were, and found no relationship between the level of racism and the magnitude

94
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,139
of this kind of shooting bias.

95
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,210
In addition, Correll and colleagues found that Black American participants also showed

96
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,120
this kind of bias towards Black American targets.

97
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,770
 So, this bias in shooting Black American targets doesn’t seem to be driven by racial

98
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,770
tendencies.

99
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:51,229
Instead, it seems to be driven by people’s knowledge of the stereotype of black being…

100
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:56,689
young, urban, and criminal... without even knowing they’re using that stereotype.

101
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:00,219
When in an ambiguous situation, where the object someone is holding could be a wallet

102
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:04,840
or it could be a gun, if the person is black, people are more likely to think that the object

103
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,520
is a gun.
