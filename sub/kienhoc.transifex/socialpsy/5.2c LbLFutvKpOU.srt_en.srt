BLAKE MCKIMMIE: Well, thanks for joining us today, Barbara.

1
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,669
So one of the reasons that&#39;s often given for the weak relationship between attitudes and

2
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:16,560
behavior is that there are other variables that are important in the attitude-behavior

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,840
relationship.

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,119
What are some of these other variables, and how do they affect behavior?

5
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:24,019
BARBARA MASSER: There&#39;s a whole range of things that can actually influence whether someone

6
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:25,640
engages in a behavior or not.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,019
So if we look at one of the most famous theories in this era, the theory of reasoned action,

8
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:34,130
Fishbein and Ajzen talked about the best determinant of someone engaging in a behavior or not was

9
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,350
their intention to engage in that behavior or not.

10
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:41,390
And they saw attitude fitting into this model by actually influencing people&#39;s intention.

11
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,670
So not behavior directly-- they saw attitude leading into someone&#39;s intention.

12
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:50,890
And so your attitude is your positive or negative feeling towards actually engaging in the behavior.

13
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,510
In conjunction with this, though, they also recognize the importance of social pressure--

14
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,730
that is, we are very vulnerable to what our friends or family think that we should or

15
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,730
shouldn&#39;t do.

16
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,480
And so another determinant of intention that they came up with was our subjective norm.

17
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,520
There is a perceived social pressure to engage or not engage in the behavior.

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,610
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: So attitudes do predict behavior, but just not directly.

19
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:13,799
They do it through intention.

20
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:14,799
BARBARA MASSER: That&#39;s right, yeah.

21
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,479
So it&#39;s not only attitudes going through intention, but also subjective norm.

22
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,119
And actually in a later revision of the model, Ajzen added in another factor, so perceived

23
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,840
behavioral control.

24
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,070
And that&#39;s our sense of our absolute ability to actually engage in the behavior.

25
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:34,649
So that&#39;s a combination of not only your personal confidence that you can actually do the behavior

26
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:38,909
that you want to do, but also those structural factors that may prevent you from engaging

27
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:39,909
in that behavior.

28
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:44,180
And in some instances where your perception of behavioral control is accurate, and it

29
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:49,880
becomes actual behavioral control, that behavioral control can influence directly in terms of

30
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,880
behavior.

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,300
So to give you an example, if we think about blood donation-- I might think blood donation

32
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,700
is a fantastic thing to do, so I have a very positive attitude.

33
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,670
I&#39;ll think about my friends and my family, and they all think that giving blood is a

34
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,950
fantastic thing to do.

35
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:08,039
But then when we get to perceived behavioral control, I know there&#39;s not a donation center

36
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,039
near me.

37
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,830
So it doesn&#39;t matter how positively I feel about engaging in the behavior, I can&#39;t actually

38
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,860
engage in it, because there&#39;s no way to actually conduct the behavior.

39
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,970
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: So this sort of approach to thinking about attitudes and behavior really

40
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,541
just takes into account the fact that attitudes and behavior don&#39;t happen in isolation, they&#39;re

41
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:24,940
actually in a social context.

42
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,110
But then, also, there&#39;s real-world limits on what sort of behaviors you might be able

43
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,570
to engage in at any one time.

44
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,570
BARBARA MASSER: Absolutely, absolutely.

45
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,080
If there&#39;s no donation center near me, I can&#39;t donate blood.

46
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,630
It doesn&#39;t matter how positively I feel about it.

47
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:42,010
Until that element changes, my attitude-- there&#39;s no real point in me forming the intention,

48
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,530
because I simply can&#39;t enact the behavior.

49
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,590
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: So you&#39;ve done a lot of research on blood donation.

50
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,500
What are some of the things that you&#39;ve targeted to increase the relationship or the correspondence

51
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,440
between people&#39;s attitudes and behavior, and to get them to actually donate blood?

52
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,000
BARBARA MASSER: Well, there&#39;s a number of points that you can actually intervene there.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,390
And so one of the biggest [INAUDIBLE] gaps we actually see is between people&#39;s intentions

54
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,920
and their behavior.

55
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,920
So often, people will have very high intentions to donate blood, and yet they don&#39;t actually

56
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,710
donate blood, even if there&#39;s a center nearby where they could.

57
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:16,420
So when we look at that, we think about things like implementation intentions.

58
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:21,490
And what I mean by that is basically creating what we term if-then plans, that gets a person

59
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:26,720
to think through some of the barriers they may encounter about engaging in the behavior.

60
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,400
So if this barrier occurs, what&#39;s my plan to get around that barrier so I can actually

61
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,120
carry out the behavior?

62
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,330
So if we think about a slightly different behavior here-- if we think about exercise,

63
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:43,060
for example-- I might have really, really strong intentions to go to the gym every morning,

64
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,930
but I consistently fail to do it.

65
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:49,830
So to generate an if-then plan, I might think about the barriers that I commonly encounter,

66
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,830
so--

67
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,830
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: Like sleeping in.

68
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,830
BARBARA MASSER: Sleeping in.

69
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,680
So the gym sessions start at 5 o&#39;clock in the morning, so one of the key barriers for

70
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,560
me to go to the gym is to actually get out of bed.

71
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,770
So my alarm clock goes off, I hit snooze, I go back to sleep, and the day is lost.

72
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:04,910
So what could I do?

73
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,940
Well, what I could do to get around that, obviously, is put my alarm clock somewhere

74
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,940
else.

75
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,520
So if I put my alarm clock somewhere else, and I have to get out of bed to actually turn

76
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,870
it off, and once I&#39;m up, I might as well go to the gym.

77
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,820
So we get people to think about those real barriers that they may encounter in translating

78
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,120
their intentions through to their behavior, and get them to come up with ways to get around

79
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,100
those particular barriers.

80
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,150
And then if we move back into the model, where we think about things like attitude, subjective

81
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:36,570
norms, and perceived behavioral control actually influencing my intention-- so maybe my intention

82
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,060
to donate blood or my intention to go to the gym isn&#39;t very high.

83
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,280
So how can we impact on making that intention stronger?

84
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,520
Well, underpinning attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are a range

85
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,520
of beliefs.

86
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,620
So for your attitude, you have a range of behavioral beliefs that you weight by the

87
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,230
outcome evaluation-- that&#39;s how important that outcome is to you-- actually engaging

88
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,460
in the behavior.

89
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,470
We have similar things for subjective norms, which are underpinned by normative beliefs,

90
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,370
which are weighted by my motivation to comply.

91
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,560
So I might have a very, very strong motivation to comply with what my friends and family

92
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,240
think, but slightly less motivation to comply with what the government thinks, for example.

93
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,851
And perceived behavioral control-- we have a whole bunch of control beliefs, which are

94
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,720
weighted by perceived power.

95
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,280
So when we think about changing, for example, people&#39;s-- or trying to bolster people&#39;s--

96
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,290
intentions to donate blood, we look at some of those beliefs, and see which ones we can

97
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:33,630
actually impact on to improve the translation of, for example, attitudes through to intention,

98
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,430
and in turn behavior.

99
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,800
So one of the most common behavioral beliefs that people have about donating blood is that

100
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,210
it&#39;s going to be painful, or it&#39;s going to make them feel a bit funny, a bit faint, or

101
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,210
a bit dizzy.

102
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,130
And obviously, they don&#39;t want to feel faint or dizzy.

103
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:52,190
It can be quite embarrassing, and so that becomes quite an important belief for us to

104
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,190
target.

105
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,460
And if we can impact on that belief, then hopefully we&#39;ll strengthen their attitude,

106
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,200
which in turn will strengthen their intention and behavior.

107
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,710
But in order to impact on that belief, it&#39;s not simply a matter of me saying, you won&#39;t

108
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,710
feel that.

109
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,400
Provision of information doesn&#39;t persuade people.

110
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,740
Rather, we have to provide them with information that allows them to challenge their beliefs,

111
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:17,000
and for them to realize that actually, that belief is not to be outweighed, or-- sorry,

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,130
not to negatively impact on their attitude to actually donating blood.

113
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,580
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: You&#39;ve told us a little bit about how we can use these sorts of approaches

114
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:29,200
to change blood donation behavior, and maybe even exercise behavior, and it seems like

115
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:35,940
a lot of government advertising or those nonprofit advertising campaigns seem to be using similar

116
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,160
ideas.

117
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,560
What are some of the other behaviors that these models have been really useful for in

118
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
promoting?

119
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,900
BARBARA MASSER: The theory of reasoned action and the theory of planned behavior have been

120
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:51,330
tested in thousands and thousands of different studies, looking at pretty much every behavior

121
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,820
you can imagine.

122
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,760
So certainly they&#39;re very prevalent within the exercise domain.

123
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:01,300
We see a lot within health behavior, so things like weight loss campaigns, but also in things

124
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,930
like anti-smoking campaigns.

125
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,500
You&#39;ll see some of those adverts try and target some of those things that we know are particularly

126
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,810
influential amongst young adults-- so, for example, subjective norms, or the normative

127
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,260
beliefs of what you think your friends think is a good thing to do, are very powerful,

128
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,650
and so we see a lot of campaigns targeting those.

129
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:23,980
But we also see it in domains like the environmental domains, so getting young people to engage

130
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,110
in pro-environmental actions like recycling.

131
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:32,330
And also things like sunscreen, and the use of sunscreen here in Australia, which, obviously,

132
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,710
is a major concern.

133
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:38,220
We see a lot of those campaigns based on those basic tenets of the theory of planned behavior.

134
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:43,600
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: So this research on the attitude-behavior relationship can actually be really useful,

135
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,990
and affect people&#39;s lives in quite wide-ranging ways.

136
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,990
BARBARA MASSER: Absolutely.

137
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,889
Getting a good understanding of all the factors that can actually change someone&#39;s behaviors

138
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:54,889
is really important.

139
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:56,630
We can&#39;t just concentrate on attitudes.

140
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:00,680
For lots of behaviors, they&#39;re actually quite a weak predictor of people&#39;s intentions and

141
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,950
behavior, and because of that, we need to focus on those other elements.

142
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:08,160
So, as I spoke about, subjective norms, but also in many instances, perceived behavioral

143
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,081
control, that sense of ability to actually engage in the behavior.
