00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,000
So in the activity we asked you a number of questions.

1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,490
The first question was whether it was more likely that a word in the English language

2
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,010
would start with the letter R or have the letter R in the third position.

3
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,480
I’m guessing that most of you would guess that it is more likely that R would be in

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,480
the first position.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,450
In fact, there are 2386 words with R in the first position, and here they are…

6
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:36,030
But there are even more with it in the third position: 4247 to be precise.

7
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,920
So nearly twice as many words have R in the third position.

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,510
Why would somebody estimate that there are more words with R in the first position?

9
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:49,100
Well, how did you try and estimate the number of words with R in each position?

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,090
You probably tried to think of examples of each type of word, and it is easier to think

11
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:58,569
of words based on what letter they start with compared to what letter is in the third position.

12
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:03,920
The next question that we asked you was what is more likely to kill someone… a smoking-related

13
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,110
illness or a car accident.

14
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,540
Now, when we say “someone” here, we don’t mean you in particular, we are talking about

15
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,970
the number of deaths in the community as a whole.

16
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,860
So ignore for a moment whether you personally smoke or drive a car or motorbike.

17
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:20,300
Most people tend to guess that a car accident is more likely to kill someone.

18
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:25,420
However, when you look at the number of deaths by different causes, deaths by smoking-related

19
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,170
illnesses are up to ten times more likely occur.

20
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,670
When you look at deaths around the world, the same general picture emerges.

21
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,031
It’s a bit trickier to see though because causes of death a recorded differently, but

22
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:42,980
you can see with this World Health Organisation data that diseases that are often associated

23
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:48,340
with smoking, such as heart disease, stroke and lung-related disease and cancer are all

24
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,400
more frequent than car-related deaths.

25
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,600
So why do people over-estimate the threat posed by car accidents?

26
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,210
Well, think about which of the following two news stories are more likely to see either

27
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,560
online or in a newspaper?

28
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,920
Is it the one about the terrible car accident, or the one about the lung cancer victims?

29
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,940
It is much more likely that you will read about road accidents, especially around the

30
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:19,090
time of public holidays when the road toll often becomes a focus of the national media.

31
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,519
Because you are exposed to more stories about car accidents, it is easier to recall examples

32
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:28,769
of road accidents that cause death, and so we over-estimate the risk to life posed by

33
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:30,409
car crashes.

34
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:34,609
The next question asked what animal kills the most people per year.

35
00:02:34,609 --> 00:02:44,439
The options we gave you were shark, wolf, lion, elephant, hippopotamus, crocodile, tapeworm,

36
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:54,260
roundworm (ascaris), freshwater snail, assassin bug, tsetse fly, dog, snake, human, or mosquito.

37
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,780
I’m not going to guess exactly which one most people selected, but I will guess that

38
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,609
it was not mosquito.

39
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:04,939
Or perhaps if I can weasel out of that prediction a little, I’ll guess that there were several

40
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:09,659
similarly popular choices that don’t reflect the actual differences in the numbers of deaths.

41
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,389
So, let’s take a look.

42
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:15,109
For sharks and wolves, they only each only killed ten people.

43
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:19,180
For lions and elephants, they only killed one hundred people each.

44
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,459
The hippopotamus accounted for five hundred deaths, the crocodile one thousand, and the

45
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,549
tapeworm twice as many as that.

46
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:31,269
The roundworm killed two thousand five hundred people, and the freshwater snail took care

47
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:35,670
of ten thousand people, as did the assassin bug and the Tsetse fly.

48
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,999
Dogs killed twenty-five thousand people and snakes fifty thousand people.

49
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:46,169
Which brings us to humans, who were very busy killing four hundred and seventy-five thousand

50
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:47,169
people.

51
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:51,560
But not as busy as mosquitos, who took the lead with seven hundred and twenty-five thousand

52
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
deaths.

53
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
Hmmm.

54
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,109
So why do people not always see mosquitos as being the biggest threat out of these animals?

55
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:03,189
Well the explanation is the same as for the car-accident example.

56
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:08,769
We tend to read more news stories about death by large animals such as crocodiles and sharks.

57
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:12,140
Perhaps because these deaths happen in popular holiday destinations.

58
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,670
Also, top level predators seem to create a high level of fear in humans and so attract

59
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,420
a lot of media interest.

60
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:24,240
This could explain certain films such as Jaws, the Sharknado series, and Crocodile Dundee.

61
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,009
There are not many movies about mosquitoes attacking people while on holiday or people

62
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:29,620
who hunt mosquitoes!

63
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,069
The final question was about deaths in Australia per year due to a number of natural disasters

64
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:35,139
and sharks.

65
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:38,860
Most people think that Australia is a pretty deadly place and that everything is out to

66
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,280
kill you, but let’s see how accurate you are in estimating the risk posed by these

67
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,490
things.

68
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:49,009
The data that this graph represents was collected by Dr Rob Brander and his colleagues from

69
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:52,620
the University of New South Wales, and it shows the average number of deaths per year

70
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,580
in Australia due to each cause since 1852.

71
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,760
Well it might surprise you to learn that sharks kill only one person on average per year in

72
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,889
Australia.

73
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:07,120
Floods account for four point three deaths, bushfires five point nine deaths, and cyclones

74
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,849
seven point five deaths per year.

75
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:13,990
Ocean rips actually account for the most deaths, an average of 21 per year.

76
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,449
Did you guess correctly?

77
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:22,020
Possibly not because some of the other natural disasters such as floods, cyclones and bushfires

78
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,940
get more media attention because they often affect large parts of the country and large

79
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,840
numbers of people at once, and they happen over several days or weeks.

80
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,460
Ocean rips on the other hand, are always present, and generally only affect a small number of

81
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,460
people at any one time in any one location.

82
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,460
So they don’t get as much media coverage.

83
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,669
So that’s the availability heuristic and how we estimate the likelihood of an event’s

84
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:50,840
occurrence based on how easily we can think of examples of that event.
