00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,000
So, how can we tell the difference

1
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,349
between a real smile and a fake smile?

2
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:12,540
Many people say you can tell a real

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,330
smile by the eyes, but what you look for

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,379
in the eyes

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,570
it&#39;s hard to describe but if you break

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,359
it down sometimes people go well it&#39;s

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,180
the crow&#39;s feet wrinkles I guess.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:24,960
Fake smiles,

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,090
you tend to smile with your mouth but

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,890
real smiles you tend to use a lot more

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,050
muscles in the face. You tend to bunch up the

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,090
cheeks okay this is a little bit

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,010
indulgent, this is a photo of my son.

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,340
That&#39;s a fake smile, now this one is a

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,620
genuine smile. I&#39;m pretty sure you can

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,320
see the difference, if not focus on the

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,730
eyes. Now, where&#39;s sadness? There it is. In

18
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,010
cartoons or comics, sadness is

19
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,260
communicated with an upside down smile, a

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,600
downturned mouth. That&#39;s not what

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,340
people&#39;s mouths typically do when

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,270
they&#39;re sad.

23
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,699
In fact, it&#39;s not really communicated

24
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,920
through the mouth that much, sadness is

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,960
probably the hardest one to spot. It&#39;s

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,810
more in the eyes, the eyebrows.

27
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,360
It&#39;s one that people find quite hard to

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,170
spot.

29
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,909
I don&#39;t know from an evolutionary point

30
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:13,950
of view why? Because what we do know

31
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,420
about sadness what we know about

32
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,220
depression, is that having people around

33
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,350
you is hugely helpful.

34
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,240
Why are we not equipped to communicate

35
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,670
our sadness  better then? You can see

36
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,990
little kids when they&#39;re trying to

37
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,909
communicate sadness they really amped it up.

38
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:29,579
They pout their lip, they do all sorts of

39
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:30,930
things that really communicate their

40
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,659
sadness. Adults, they&#39;re too cool to do

41
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,729
that so let&#39;s keep going.

42
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,150
This face shows disgust, you can see an

43
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,130
evolution function for this if there&#39;s

44
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,049
something toxic in the environment then

45
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:44,369
you should screw up your nose,

46
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:46,020
you should button your mouth up, you

47
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,920
don&#39;t want anything coming in.

48
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,240
Surprise, again you can see an evolutionary

49
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,479
function here. The eyebrows are wide open,

50
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,920
the eyebrows are high,

51
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,990
your eyes are wide open your mouth is

52
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,420
open. Why would you do that?

53
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,090
Well,  it kind of makes sense. If something

54
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,070
novel is there in the environment and you have

55
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,810
to prepare for that fight-or-flight kind

56
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,879
of response be ready.

57
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,600
Big breath, eyes wide open, ready to go.

58
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,210
Fear is a little bit like surprised but

59
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,090
not as exaggerated. The eyes might not be

60
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,650
as wide and the mouth might not be as

61
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,890
open and the eyebrows not as high. Then

62
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,560
anger. Anger is often communicated

63
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,450
through the mouth, through the snarling

64
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,550
expression, but probably more through the

65
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,940
eyes. The eyes give us the death stare. If

66
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,500
you have to break down the death stare,

67
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,480
what is it? You know when you&#39;re getting

68
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,460
one. You don&#39;t have to think about it,

69
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,060
actually

70
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,650
when you break it down, its kind of

71
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,500
subtle. It&#39;s like you shorten your eyes,

72
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,270
you narrow your eyes a little bit. Not

73
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,950
much, probably millimeters for a short

74
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,020
time and you don&#39;t blink. You stare

75
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,390
directly at someone. Pretty subtle when

76
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,220
you think about it but really efficient

77
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,950
communication right? It can be difficult

78
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,600
to break down all of this because it

79
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,730
doesn&#39;t happen like that. It just tends to

80
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,280
happen instinctively. You know when

81
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,110
someone&#39;s giving you a death stare,  you

82
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,150
know when someone&#39;s happy. You know when

83
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,580
someone&#39;s disgusted, you don&#39;t have to go

84
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,170
through what all of their face parts of

85
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,820
doing, what their eyes their mouth and

86
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,940
their nose are doing, you just know.
