0
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,520
We must all know somebody we think is severely deluding himself or herself.

1
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,990
That the person is far superior to what they are.

2
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,420
But evidence suggests most of us are fooling ourselves when we overestimate our good qualities

3
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,570
or our positive future.

4
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,769
So, how is it that people can go through so much of life and maintain these distortions?

5
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:30,119
We certainly get feedback through our experiences.

6
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,419
We do succeed and we fail.

7
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:37,170
How is it that we end up with a more favorable view of self than the facts would seemingly

8
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,170
dictate?

9
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,070
Well, this is a challenge for methodologists.

10
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,280
For a while psychologists were saying, let’s be strict about this - so if I fool you then

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,810
I know something that you don’t and I lead you to think something different.

12
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,400
So, if I fool myself, then I have to play both roles.

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,870
I have to both know it and not know it.

14
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,530
So, we have to get some kind of scientific proof that we know something and don’t know

15
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,480
it at the same time.

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,860
When psychologists tried to do that, well, we didn’t find very much.

17
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,080
It was very hard to set up an experiment that would prove people knowing and not knowing

18
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,780
things at the same time.

19
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,780
But then the literature said, well come on, that’s unrealistic, and they eased up a

20
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,600
little bit and began to think about things like ‘wishful thinking’.

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,500
This is a term for when you sort of convince yourself of something that is not exactly

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,340
true but maybe it’s an exaggeration or a distortion in the way your like.

23
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,460
Psychologists thought these things might be much easier to sustain.

24
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,640
This kind of thinking really opened the doors and a lot of research began to illuminate

25
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,370
how people do manage to fool themselves and end up thinking they’re better than they

26
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,370
are.

27
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:46,120
So, I’ll run through a couple of these – let’s start with what is called the self-serving

28
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,480
bias.

29
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,560
Every time you succeed or fail doesn’t automatically register on your self-esteem.

30
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,690
It only does if you think it is a reflection on you.

31
00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:00,170
And turns out people are very good when things turn out well, when they succeed saying, oh

32
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,870
yeah, that’s a sign of what a good person I am.

33
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:07,010
Meanwhile, when things turn out badly, they say, oh that was not because of me, that was

34
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:12,840
bad luck, or a bad situation, or I couldn’t help it or it was too hard, whatever.

35
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,650
So, systematically, success you attribute internally to yourself, failure you attribute

36
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,870
externally to other factors.

37
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,060
And then you base your self-esteem on what’s attributed to yourself so that’s mainly

38
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,150
based on your successes, and sure enough, you base your self-esteem more on your successes

39
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:34,280
than your failures, a few exceptions will get through, but by and large, that will enable

40
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,540
people to come up with these positive illusions.

41
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,370
I want to emphasise something too.

42
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,769
It’s not like a total loser ends up believing that he’s Einstein and Jesus Christ rolled

43
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:46,879
into one.

44
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,450
People tend to believe they are a little better than they are - there is a certain margin

45
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,450
of illusion.

46
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,669
So, when we say they fool themselves, it’s not night and day - it’s not like you’re

47
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:59,909
playing a completely different role- it’s just your belief about yourself is slightly

48
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:02,209
improved over what the facts would warrant.

49
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:06,299
I remember one of my colleagues was studying intelligence and he used to ask people what

50
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:10,549
their score was on the aptitude test that you took to get into college, and he would

51
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:14,980
write that down and try to correlate that with their performance in the laboratory.

52
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,169
Then he got to thinking, well, I wonder if people are telling me the truth and he got

53
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:22,450
permission from all of them to go to the Registrar’s office to check their scores.

54
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,629
Well, there was exaggeration, it wasn’t that total dummies were portraying themselves

55
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:31,290
as super geniuses but people were just remembering their scores as a little higher than they

56
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,859
actually were, across the spectrum.

57
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:38,799
There was a general pattern of remembering things as a little better than reality.

58
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,290
So, that’s what we’re looking at with positive illusions and self-deception - it’s

59
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:49,220
like a slightly improved, slightly idealised, slightly better than life version of the real

60
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,720
you.
