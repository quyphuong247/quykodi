00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:11,400
So according to Paul Ekman, with a little bit of training to recognise micromomentary

1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,660
expressions, people can detect deception.

2
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,580
How do people go generally, when they are trying to detect if someone is lying to them?

3
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,810
Here’s Derren Brown, the British Illusionist: With about three-quarters of people I can

4
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:29,910
tell [if they’re lying] pretty much instantaneously a hand comes near the mouth, or a swallow

5
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,470
before an answer is eye contact suddenly different?

6
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,900
Does the person repeatedly look off to the left as she searches for true answers to questions,

7
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,520
then suddenly look off to the right when she gives one particular answer?”

8
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,750
So can people detect lies?

9
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,430
Although there are some exceptions, which we will talk about soon, the answer is generally

10
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,980
that people are no better than chance at detecting deception.

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:58,680
Bond and DePaulo reported an average lie-detection accuracy for regular people of 54%.

12
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,070
Now it&#39;s not just regular people though.

13
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,320
People who work in law enforcement, such as police officers and customs officials, also

14
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:09,560
perform at chance levels (as shown in research by Kraut &amp; Poe, 1980).

15
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,080
There are some exceptions to this, such as secret service agents and some members of

16
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,910
the intelligence community, as Ekman &amp; O&#39;Sullivan, observed in 1991, but the general rule still

17
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,420
holds.

18
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,920
Now why is that?

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,500
Part of the reason for this is because people think a bunch of things are associated with

20
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,910
deception.

21
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:34,909
In particular, increased speech disturbances, high pitched voice, longer latency during

22
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:40,320
speech, looking away or gaze aversion, and increased body movements.

23
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,600
You now know that voice pitch is the only one of those behaviours that’s reliably

24
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,960
related to deception.

25
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,430
Speech disturbances and latency periods are related to deception, but the direction of

26
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:56,030
that relationship changes with the different types of lies that can be told.

27
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:01,060
And in fact, decreased body movements are associated with deception.

28
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,890
So why do people think that these things are associated with being deceptive?

29
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,700
Probably because they are all markers of being nervous, and people assume that liars will

30
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:10,979
be nervous.

31
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:17,250
Essentially, the problem is that people have a stereotype about what it means to look deceptive.

32
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,290
Parts of the stereotype are accurate, for example the higher voice pitch.

33
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:26,730
However, parts of the stereotype are inaccurate, such as increased body movement.

34
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,800
Interestingly, some of our research that was published in 2013 (McKimmie, Masser &amp; Bongiorno,

35
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,760
2013) actually shows that people are most influenced by the parts of the stereotype

36
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,890
that are inaccurate and largely ignore the accurate parts of the stereotype.

37
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,370
This makes it really hard for people to accurately detect deception!
