00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,730
There’s an argument, originally made by Darwin in 1872, that because it’s an evolutionary

1
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,000
thing, our brains are hardwired to work with nonverbal communication.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,400
Just like little children, their brains are hardwired to pick up on language; our brains

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,990
are hardwired to pick up on nonverbal communication, and it’s for evolutionary reasons.

4
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,660
We have already spoken about some of those evolutionary functions.

5
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,460
We can’t however point to an evolutionary explanation for all expressions.

6
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,110
Humans like to smile.

7
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,490
No other animal does.

8
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:41,580
I know sometimes you think your dog is smiling at you, dolphins are smiling at you, but they

9
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,580
aren’t.

10
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,580
I’m sorry.

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,580
They’re not.

12
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,580
Not with their mouth.

13
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,750
Yet we do it, we don’t know why.

14
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:53,500
If this is true, if it’s an evolutionary thing, then cultures shouldn’t matter.

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,000
Everywhere around the world, they should pull the same faces for the same facial expressions

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,120
if that’s something that’s hardwired into our brain.

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,170
Actually, that’s pretty much true.

18
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,130
Paul Ekman and his colleagues have done quite a few studies looking at this.

19
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,969
They found that if you go to people from different cultures around the world, and you give them

20
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:16,830
a bunch of faces and ask them to say what emotion each face shows, people are pretty

21
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:17,830
consistent.

22
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:22,920
There’s not a lot of variation across cultures, except in terms of ratings of intensity of

23
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,979
emotions.

24
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:28,409
Although some researchers such as James Russell have argued that there are more differences

25
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,970
across cultures, the evolutionary explanation seems to be the most supported one.

26
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,619
There’s other things as well.

27
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:39,460
Babies are pretty good at pulling certain faces.

28
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,530
What’s this one?

29
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,530
Well that’s fear, right?

30
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,829
I don’t know how they got these fear photos.

31
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:47,130
Babies do distress pretty well.

32
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,509
That’s important from an evolutionary point of view.

33
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:53,090
Disgust they do pretty much straight away.

34
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,869
If something is disgusting to them, they’ll screw up their nose they’ll do the disgust

35
00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:00,159
face, that’s evolutionarily important.

36
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,119
Then within about six to eight weeks, babies do the smile.

37
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:06,189
It seems to just happen.

38
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:09,060
Then within six months, they’ve got the full spectrum.

39
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,140
Again, this kind of suggests that they’re pretty good at it, which means it’s probably

40
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,140
hardwired.

41
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,189
Babies are not struggling to learn it.

42
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:21,349
One thing that&#39;s really powerful evidence is the fact that they smile even if they’re

43
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,450
born blind and deaf.

44
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:29,040
Now, let’s say a baby burps and they accidentally fluke a smile, it could be that everyone goes,

45
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,390
Oh, my God!

46
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,390
They’re smiling.

47
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,519
Suddenly, they gain lots of attention, all these positive reinforcements, so they do

48
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,819
it again.

49
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:40,799
We might think that the environment shapes the smile.

50
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:45,340
Now that’s not necessarily the case because we know that deaf and blind children, who

51
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,190
can’t hear or see the feedback, also smile at about the same time as children who are

52
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,270
not deaf or blind.

53
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,299
That, again, suggests an evolutionary function.

54
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:59,260
We spoke about the fact that some of these emotions are seen across species, particularly

55
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,329
the snarling expression, which you see in monkeys.

56
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:03,680
You see it in cats.

57
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,159
You see it in dogs.

58
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,409
Obviously, you see it in humans too.
