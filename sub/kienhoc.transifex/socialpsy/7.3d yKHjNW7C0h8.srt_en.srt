[MUSIC PLAYING] BLAKE MCKIMMIE: Thanks for joining us, Jolanda.

1
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,220
JOLANDA JETTEN: You&#39;re welcome.

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,360
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: So a lot of the research and a lot of the time when people talk about stereotyping

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,180
and prejudice, people tend to focus on the perceiver or the person actually doing the

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,960
stereotyping and holding the negative beliefs.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,869
But there&#39;s another person involved or another group of people involved, which is the targets

6
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:30,220
who are being stereotyped and seen differently and treated differently.

7
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,730
What effects do stereotypes have on the targets of stereotyping?

8
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,410
JOLANDA JETTEN: Yes, yes, good question.

9
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,880
There&#39;s now quite a bit of work that shows that if you belong to a stigmatized group,

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:47,680
a group that is being stereotyped, that faces discrimination on the basis of your group

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:55,310
membership in that particular group, that we do see that can have tremendous negative

12
00:00:55,310 --> 00:01:00,850
effects for your physical and also mental well-being.

13
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:07,210
And the effects are there in terms of that you find in sort of physical well-being, that

14
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:13,270
belonging to stigmatized group associated with greater likelihood of heart conditions,

15
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,590
diabetes.

16
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:22,750
But also engaging in unhealthy health behavior, such a smoking, excessive drinking, et cetera.

17
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:30,119
So we do know that it has negative effects for physical well-being.

18
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,369
But also negative effects for mental well-being.

19
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:38,770
So in a sense, members of stigmatized groups are more likely to be depressed, have anxiety

20
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,179
disorders, et cetera.

21
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:46,420
And we do see these negative physical and mental health effects, we find them among

22
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,939
a range of different groups.

23
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:55,539
Groups that face stigma or stereotyping on the basis of their race, their gender, their

24
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:58,529
sexual orientation and lots of other things.

25
00:01:58,529 --> 00:02:02,970
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: So a lot of these groups are groups that you&#39;re born into or you don&#39;t

26
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,439
have a lot of choice in belonging to.

27
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,800
But there are some negatively stigmatized groups that people actually choose to belong

28
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,780
to.

29
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,880
Why would somebody choose, what do they get out of a negatively stigmatized group?

30
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,940
Why would you choose to do that?

31
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,250
JOLANDA JETTEN: Well, that is interesting.

32
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,550
That&#39;s a question we ask ourselves, too.

33
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:26,250
And we did quite a bit of research, for instance, among people who choose to have body piercings

34
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,860
in their face.

35
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,950
And who actually experience discrimination as a result of that.

36
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:38,060
So they may not be hired for particular jobs because managers may object to hiring someone

37
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,840
as a waiter who has many visible piercings.

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,920
So we were exactly interested in that issue.

39
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:55,260
Why would people do this when they can actually face negative evaluations on a basis of expressing

40
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,770
their identity in a particular way?

41
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:05,080
And we did find it interesting that at times people do also say yes, I get these negative

42
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,860
responses of that, because of that, but precisely because it just helps me to express who I

43
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:17,750
am, where I belong and who are the people that actually sort of, that I affiliate with.

44
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:24,500
So they actually sense, build a sense of identity around that particular stigma.

45
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:31,670
And interestingly then, the more that people face discrimination on the basis of that belonging

46
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:36,150
to that particular group, the more likely it is that they want to stay in that group.

47
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,370
The more likely it is that they want to get, for instance, more body piercings.

48
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:46,010
BLAKE MCKIMMIE: So it almost becomes like, it makes you even more distinct and it feels

49
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:51,220
like you&#39;re in a club or a very, very hard to get into club perhaps.

50
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,220
There&#39;s a high cost of entry.

51
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,220
JOLANDA JETTEN: Yes, yes.

52
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,760
So it looks as if, yes of course, we want to avoid negative responses, but in this particular

53
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,390
case, the negative responses also affirm that yes, they have recognized who I am and I&#39;m

54
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,600
proud of who I am.

55
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:11,569
I turn that negative response into something that helps me to establish a particular identity

56
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:13,160
and a belonging to a particular group.
