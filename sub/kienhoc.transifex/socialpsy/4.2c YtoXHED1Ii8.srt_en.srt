0
00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:10,900
More recently, the idea of central traits has been supplanted by the more general concept

1
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,500
of schemas (Kunda &amp; Thagard, 1996).

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,070
While there are some important caveats to how schemas about social categories are used

3
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,820
to form impressions depending on the target (Hamilton &amp; Sherman, 1996), there is good

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,860
evidence that schemas are centrally involved in the impression formation process.

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,989
So what are schemas?

6
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:31,079
Schemas are cognitive structures that represent our knowledge about a concept or type of stimulus.

7
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:36,160
They are formed on the basis of past experience, and they are like our theories for why things

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,620
are the way they are.

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,300
They allow us to encode, store, and retrieve information about things (Alba &amp; Hasher, 1983).

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,320
We can have schemas about a range of targets such as events, people, and even ourselves.

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,100
Event schemas, sometimes called &#39;scripts&#39;, are our generalised representations of activities

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,100
and events.

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,000
They are associated with a particular situation.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
They basically tell us what to expect in a situation.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,739
So for example, if you go out to dinner in a fancy restaurant, you know that somebody

16
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,720
will come to the table to ask you for your order before any food is brought out from

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,200
the kitchen.

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,600
Role schemas, sometimes confusingly also called &#39;scripts&#39;, are the roles or parts that people

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,700
are expected to play in a particular setting.

20
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:24,610
Role schemas generally make sense in terms of event schemas - you have roles within events.

21
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,670
For example, the role of the chef at the restaurant is to make the meal that you order from the

22
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:29,670
menu.

23
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,520
You would be a little surprised if the chef was playing the piano and another diner was

24
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,210
in the kitchen cooking your dinner!

25
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,909
Person schemas represent our individualised knowledge structures about specific types

26
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:44,479
and groups of people, as well as individuals.

27
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,810
When we refer to a stereotype, we are talking about a person schema associated with a social

28
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,380
category.

29
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,520
This could be ethnicity, gender or even religion.

30
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,759
The attributes that we believe are associated with these social categories are called stereotypes.

31
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:04,260
Lippman (1922) called these &quot;pictures in our head&quot;.

32
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:09,869
An implicit personality theory is person schema about a particular type of person.

33
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,900
These represent what we believe to be the characteristics that go together to form certain

34
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,200
types of personality.

35
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,340
As an example, imagine that Ruby is the last guest at the party.

36
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,310
She&#39;s being loud and dancing on the coffee table, and generally having a great time.

37
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,000
If I asked you whether Ruby was an introvert or an extrovert, I&#39;m guessing that most of

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,290
you would say &quot;extrovert&quot;, because your implicit personality theory for extroverts more closely

39
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,080
matches Ruby&#39;s behaviour.

40
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,090
We also have schemas about specific people, for example your best friend or parent.

41
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,660
And perhaps not surprisingly, we have schemas about ourselves.

42
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,950
These are called self schemas.

43
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,349
We generally manage information about ourselves in the same way that we manage information

44
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:55,190
about other people.

45
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:00,020
The difference is that our self schemas tend to be more complex and include information

46
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,730
about what we would like to become in the future.

47
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,940
OK, now that you know about the different types of schemas, let&#39;s see how well you can

48
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,940
identify them.

49
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,120
You are about to see an interaction between two people.

50
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,660
Your job is to work out what type of schema is not being followed...

51
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,620
Bob: Hi Violet, how are you going?

52
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,879
Violet: Oh hi Bob.

53
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:18,940
Actually not very well...

54
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,300
I&#39;ve got this sore foot.

55
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,010
I was walking the dog on the weekend and I stepped on a really sharp rock.

56
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,010
It really hurts!

57
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,629
And then I banged my elbow when I got back home, and managed to break my watch at the

58
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:29,629
same time.

59
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:33,660
I guess I&#39;m just clumsy, I really liked that watch though.

60
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,090
Did I mention that I&#39;m getting a bit of a runny nose?

61
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,440
Well, I don&#39;t have any tissues, so it&#39;s becoming a bit of a problem.

62
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,550
Bob: Um, I&#39;ve got to go now...
