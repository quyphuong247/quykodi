00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,440
Another reason is that people’s behaviour is interpreted through the lens of the stereotype.

1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,650
A stereotype is like a lens or filter through which we see reality.

2
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,430
I’m sure you can think of somebody who you think is arrogant.

3
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,330
If you decide that this person thinks they’re better than you, no matter what the actual

4
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:28,089
behaviour of that person, you are likely to still perceive this person as arrogant.

5
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:32,690
There’s nothing a person can do to disapprove it because anything can be seen as a sign

6
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:33,950
of arrogance.

7
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,850
Every time they fold their arms when they’re talking to you, or they lose eye contact with

8
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,670
you, you will think that they’re arrogant––as you’re seeing them through that lens.

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,430
Now you might be right, you may be wrong, but it is a psychological thing where you

10
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,899
start to see evidence for your theory.

11
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:52,420
You start to see evidence for your assumption.

12
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,649
Constantly, you feel as though you’re getting a kernel of truth.

13
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:02,980
Cohen in 1981 showed participants a videotape of a woman, and explained to some of the participants

14
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,920
that this woman worked as a waitress in a local coffee shop, and explained to others

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,760
that she worked as a city librarian.

16
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,360
The participants watched the video and then were later tested for their memory of the

17
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,040
features that were shown in the video.

18
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,560
Cohen found that participants remembered features from the video that were consistent with the

19
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,509
stereotype that was associated with the woman’s occupation more accurately; than those that

20
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:28,829
were inconsistent with the stereotype.

21
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,030
For example, those who thought that the woman was a librarian, they remembered features

22
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,159
such as the woman wearing glasses and that there were bookshelves in the background of

23
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:42,920
the video more accurately than features such as beer on the table and the informal table

24
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,920
setting.

25
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,950
Whereas, those who thought that the woman was a waitress remembered features such as

26
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:53,430
beer on the table and the informal table setting more accurately compared to the woman wearing

27
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,160
glasses and the bookshelves in the background.

28
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:02,100
Cohen’s study shows, nicely, that we see reality through the lens of the stereotype.

29
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,180
We remember reality through the lens of the stereotype, and we constantly accept evidence

30
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,390
that supports our assumption.

31
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,290
Sometimes, people dramatically violate the stereotype.

32
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:17,200
But, we don’t change the stereotype about a group of people just because one or two

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,489
members of the group doesn’t fit the stereotype of their group membership.

34
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:25,870
For example, if the stereotype for men is that they’re not very emotional, they’re

35
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,850
unsophisticated, and uncultured, when you come across a guy who’s very different from

36
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:34,580
this stereotype, this doesn’t change your overall stereotype of men in general.

37
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:40,140
It’s likely that you will create a new sub-stereotype within the male category—say, the sensitive

38
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,420
new age guy, and you put this person into that lower sub-stereotype.

39
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,129
This way, the overall stereotype doesn’t change.

40
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:50,730
This is called subtyping.
