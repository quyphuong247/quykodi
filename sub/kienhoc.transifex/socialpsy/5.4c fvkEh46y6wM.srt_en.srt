00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:11,750
So, let’s take a look at the first experimental study designed to test this idea of cognitive

1
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,900
consistency.

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,249
In Festinger and Carlsmith’s 1959 study, they asked participants to perform two simple,

3
00:00:18,249 --> 00:00:21,150
but tedious, tasks for a total of one hour.

4
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,519
For example, one of the tasks involved a tray full of pegs, and participants were asked

5
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,229
to repeatedly turn each peg in order.

6
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:33,230
Once they had finished turning the last peg on the tray, they had to return to the first

7
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,660
peg and turn it another quarter turn.

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,010
After doing this, participants were told that the real purpose of the study was to look

9
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,020
at the effects of expectations or psychological set on performance.

10
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,710
The experimenter then explained that, due to car troubles, his assistant was not able

11
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,680
to make it to the study.

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,470
The participants were asked if they would be willing to step in and take the place of

13
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:02,790
the assistant, and tell the next participant––who was a confederate––that the two tasks

14
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,979
they had just completed were actually enjoyable, fun, and really interesting.

15
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:14,229
A confederate is someone who pretends to be another participant, but in reality is working

16
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:15,570
with the experimenter.

17
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:23,649
Participants were either offered a small incentive, $1, or a large incentive, $20, to help the

18
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:25,280
experimenter.

19
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,310
For the control group, participants were not asked to say anything about the tedious tasks,

20
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,710
and they weren’t offered any money.

21
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,939
After telling the confederate that the tasks were really enjoyable, the original participant

22
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:41,799
left the study and went to complete a separate study in another room.

23
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,029
For the separate study, participants were asked to rate how much they enjoyed participating

24
00:01:46,029 --> 00:01:50,600
in a number of different studies, including the one they had just completed.

25
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,119
In reality, the two studies were actually part of the same experiment.

26
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,829
So, which group of participants do you think felt the most positive about doing the boring

27
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:00,829
tasks?

28
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:07,020
Those who were paid $20 to say the tasks were fun, or those who were only paid $1?
