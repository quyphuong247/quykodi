00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,480
Okay, so let’s take a look at the answers to the

1
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,420
pole.

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,220
I’m guessing that most of you said Jack was an engineer.

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,599
Now why did you say that?

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,689
When i asked my students this question, they tell me they said Jack was an engineer because

5
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:21,880
he sounded like an engineer.

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,770
They often point out that Jack has no interest in political and

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:29,420
social issues, and that he likes home carpentry and mathematical puzzles.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,560
What my students are telling me is that Jack sounds like their prototype of an

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,789
engineer.

10
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:40,550
He seems to have the same features as their prototype, so they categorize him as an engineer.

11
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,770
Is that what you thought too?

12
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,320
Well what is Jack? Perhaps if I ask the question slightly differently.

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,460
Imagine that we put all of the partygoers into a giant bag so that we’ve got 30 engineers

14
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:58,359
and 17 lawyers all jumbled up in a big bag and I reach in and carefully grab one of them.

15
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,399
Is it more likely that i grabbed an engineer or a lawyer?

16
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,270
Hopefully you can see that it is more than twice as likely that I grabbed a lawyer.

17
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,070
There are 70 of them compared to 30 engineers.

18
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,940
When i asked the question this way it is easy to see the relevance of the frequency information

19
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,940
that I started

20
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,400
the example with. This version of the problem frames a question in terms of the probability

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,580
that Jack is a lawyer or an engineer based on the numbers of each of them at the party.

22
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,060
On the other hand, when I described Jack to you in great detail the probability estimate

23
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:36,190
is based on the match between Jack’s features and your prototype for each category because

24
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,340
those features seem like useful information.

25
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:44,630
Unfortunately this means we do not pay sufficient attention to the frequencies of lawyers and

26
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,060
engineers present at the party.

27
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,720
This is the representativeness heuristic.
