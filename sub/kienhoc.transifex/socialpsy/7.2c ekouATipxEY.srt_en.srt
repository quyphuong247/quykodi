00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:10,639
Stereotypically, men are supposed to know more about cars than women.

1
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,160
In 1974, Deaux &amp; Emswiller asked a group of male and female participants to evaluate the

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,250
performance of a man or a woman conducting either a masculine or a feminine task.

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,820
The masculine task was identifying a tire jack, used for changing the wheel on a car.

4
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,210
The feminine task was identifying a mop.

5
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,840
Which even I know is used for cleaning the floor!

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,030
So, participants had to decide whether a person’s performance on these tasks was due to ability

7
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,859
or luck.

8
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:41,739
What did they find?

9
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:45,950
On this chart, you can see that the y-axis shows us whether participants thought the

10
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,170
person’s performance was due to luck or ability.

11
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,860
Higher numbers mean it is more due to ability.

12
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,699
The x-axis shows the two tasks, the masculine task and the feminine task.

13
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:04,879
The men performing the task are indicated by the blue, and the woman by the green.

14
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,430
Deaux and Emswiller found that when a man performed well on a masculine task, participants

15
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,780
were more likely to attribute their performance to skill.

16
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,030
However, when a woman performed just as well as a man on the same task, participants were

17
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,570
more likely to attribute the woman’s performance to luck.

18
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,950
When it came to evaluating a man and a woman conducting a feminine task, participants attributed

19
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,310
a woman’s successful performance to skill.

20
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,369
But they attributed a man’s successful performance to skill as well.

21
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,330
This was not the case for a woman performing well in a masculine task!

22
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:44,810
The participants saw the same behaviour––both genders knowing about cars, but one is seen

23
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,570
as to be supporting the stereotype whilst the other is just dismissed.

24
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,820
Here’s an explanation for why stereotypes exist or why they remain.

25
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,240
In the video that we linked to just before this video, did you hear where they mention

26
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,040
that over education in women leads to ugliness, premature aging and beard growth?

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,920
We laugh at that because it just sounds ridiculous, but that was a real theory about a hundred

28
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,280
years ago, as women were trying to get access to education.

29
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,750
A lot of men thought it wasn’t good for women to be educated.

30
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:19,250
They thought that women would become like men, they would become haggard, ugly and masculine

31
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,250
looking.

32
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,620
A lot of people who believed this were educated people!

33
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,000
And look, if education really did make you more masculine looking, I might even sign

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,510
up to do another PhD!

35
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,560
So, why would apparently smart people believe something so stupid?

36
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,780
The answer would be because it’s convenient for them, because they want to believe that.

37
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,950
They might feel threatened by women knocking on the doors of education and power, with

38
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,980
all the freedom that implies.

39
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,760
This is what is called a legitimising myth.

40
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,879
It legitimises the status quo.

41
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,379
The video of the song, “Bad Girls” by M.I.A., was made by a political director and

42
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:59,510
even though it doesn’t explicitly reference it, it’s commenting on the fact that women

43
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,130
are not permitted to drive vehicles in Saudi Arabia.

44
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:09,180
It was reported in 2013 a top Saudi cleric commented that driving damages female reproductive

45
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,360
organs.

46
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,860
The story attracted a lot of international pressure and this obviously ridiculous fact

47
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,280
was used to legitimise the status quo.

48
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,849
Likewise, if I’m a male CEO of a company and I’m wandering around thinking, “Wow,

49
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:26,670
there’s not many women who are also CEOs, why is that?”

50
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,560
I have to make sense of that, and one of the ways to explain that is because I’m a guy

51
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,739
in this patriarchal world and I’ve benefited from privilege.

52
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:40,541
Now, not many people like to think they’ve benefitted from privilege, so we don’t like

53
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:43,489
to explain things in this way.

54
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:47,470
Another explanation could be that there’s not many female CEOs because they’re not

55
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,470
interested.

56
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,579
They’re not that ambitious.

57
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,439
They’re not boardroom material.

58
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,579
They fall apart under pressure.

59
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:55,780
They’re too emotional.

60
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,659
People might be motivated to believe these inaccurate things to help them rationalise

61
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:02,340
the status quo in a non-threatening way.
