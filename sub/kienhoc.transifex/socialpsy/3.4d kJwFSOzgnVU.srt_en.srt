00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,190
The next benefit we found for high self-esteem was happiness.

1
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,490
People with high self-esteem are generally happier than people with low self-esteem.

2
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,730
When times are hard or stressful (Baumeister et al., 2003), which happens to all of us,

3
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,610
high self-esteem gives you a little more resilience, it makes you feel better.

4
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:26,380
For people with low self-esteem, on the other hand, when bad things happen to them it can

5
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,740
just really devastate them.

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:32,400
It knocks them down for a while and they have trouble getting themselves up going again.

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,560
High self-esteem seems to give you a little more to draw on to get over that.

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,789
In plain terms, high self-esteem feels good.

9
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:45,190
Obviously, it’s no accident that low self-esteem is linked to depression.

10
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,149
Researchers have struggled for years to establish which comes first, the low self-esteem or

11
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,149
the depression?

12
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:55,230
The answer isn’t clear, they’re deeply intertwined, it looks like low self-esteem

13
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,820
comes first or be an early warning sign, or maybe make you more vulnerable to depression.

14
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,890
But then depression probably makes the low self-esteem worse.

15
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,170
There is certainly some back and forth.

16
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,610
Regardless, the link between low self-esteem and depression is one further and important

17
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:15,270
sign that high self-esteem goes with feeling good.

18
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,570
Are there other benefits?

19
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,930
A problem for researchers is how to establish what the benefits are.

20
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,740
People with high self-esteem think they are terrific - they think they have all kinds

21
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,740
of good traits.

22
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,690
So, if you take their word for it you will fall into the same trap as the psychologists

23
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:34,080
did in the 1980s which is to conclude that wow, high self-esteem is the pathway to total

24
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,790
success in life.

25
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,280
But if you look for objective measures and don’t take people’s word for it -- then,

26
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,560
most of those benefits disappear.

27
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,440
The thing is, when filling out questionnaires, some people are just happy giving out positive

28
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,520
answers and other people give more neutral answers.

29
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,950
We measure self-esteem by giving people a questionnaire.

30
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,470
You score high on self-esteem because you are saying you are great.

31
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,810
In other words, rating yourself very positively on the questionnaire.

32
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,670
If the researcher then gives them another questionnaire and says how smart are you?

33
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,150
or how popular, or how successful? the people who like to give themselves higher ratings

34
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,280
on their self-esteem, will do there so too.

35
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,640
They will create the impression that high self-esteem is linked to lots of good things.

36
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,640
But it could just be that that’s how they answer questionnaires.

37
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,680
And remember what we saw earlier about self-deception.

38
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,409
You can’t always just trust what people believe, because people exaggerate how good

39
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:28,370
they are.

40
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,700
For example, suppose you are a researcher and you want to find out that self-esteem

41
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,760
goes with intelligence.

42
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,430
So, you measure their self-esteem and you ask them how smart they are.

43
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,269
With high self-esteem (Gabriel et al., 1942), they think they’re smarter than other people.

44
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:45,120
There is a significant positive correlation - the higher their self-esteem, the higher

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,900
they will tell you their IQ is.

46
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,310
But, if you actually give them an IQ test there is no difference between high and low

47
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,040
self-esteem - if anything, it’s slightly in the other direction.

48
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,510
Or, another example (Diener et al., 1995), suppose your research has people rate their

49
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,150
own physical attractiveness, if you ask people how good looking they are, people with high

50
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,500
self-esteem say I’m gorgeous - people with low self-esteem no, not so much.

51
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,030
So, there are a lot of studies like that, but a few laboratory studies (Harter, 1993),

52
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,599
went farther, they would take pictures of the people and them show them to others, and

53
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,420
have people rate the pictures for attractiveness.

54
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,579
Then, there’s no difference as a function, high self-esteem people are not any more attractive.

55
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:28,439
So, what we get from this is people with high self-esteem claim to be above average in many

56
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,700
respects but mostly this is just being superior in their own minds.

57
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,639
The objective measures show they are really just average.

58
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:41,079
The two main benefits of thinking that you are good, that stand up objectively, is that

59
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:44,790
you may be generally happier and have more initiative.

60
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,660
That’s what goes with high self-esteem.

61
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:53,340
The rest of self-esteem correlates with overestimating your good traits and good qualities.
