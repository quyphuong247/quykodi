1
00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:07,859
There’s no question from public opinion
polls that people care a lot about the honesty

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:15,160
of the person they’re dealing with, whether
that’s their doctor or their political leader. 

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:24,300
And yet it’s more complex than that.  Often
we don’t want to know the truth.  Do

4
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,410
you want to find out that your spouse is cheating
on you?  Do you want to find out the person

5
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:38,480
that you recommended for a job in your company
is embezzling?  Do you want to find out that

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,610
your kids are using heroin?  These of course
are all things that you want to know but you

7
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:50,000
certainly don’t want to know.  So it’s
very complex as to whether or not we really

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
want to catch a liar.  We think we do. 
What if we find out that both of our presidential

9
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:03,559
candidates are lying?  Then what do we do? 
I’m not saying they are; I never comment

10
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:09,470
on anyone in office or running for office. 
Only after they’re out that they’re fair

11
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:16,100
game. . . . Clinton said, “I didn’t have
sex with that woman”  and then gave her

12
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:23,100
name.  "That woman" is putting her at a distance
from himself.  Now there are many reasons

13
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:33,500
why people lie and some are honorable.  I
study the lies that society cares about, cares

14
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:41,150
about catching, generally disapproves of. 
The most common reason why people lie is to

15
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:53,890
avoid punishment for breaking a rule.  Usually
some rules are broken accidentally.  You

16
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:04,790
walk down the hallway too fast and you knock
over a $2,000 jar that’s on the stand. 

17
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,489
You didn’t mean to do that.  “Did you
knock over that jar?”  Well, you’re not

18
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:13,810
going to – “Yes, I did. . . .”  “No,
I don’t know who knocked over that jar. 

19
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,950
It wasn’t knocked over when I walked by.” 
You don’t want to get punished.  But there

20
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:23,670
are many times where we make the decision
– I’m going to break a rule, I’m going

21
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:30,650
to cheat, and I’m going to lie about it. 
I’m not going to admit that I cheated; I

22
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,319
don’t want to get caught.  So the decision
to lie is made at the same time as the decision

23
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:43,319
to cheat.  When we teach people, and we
do in workshops teach people how to catch

24
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:52,450
liars, it takes us 32 hours. . . . Spotting
a micro expression is the single most useful

25
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:02,819
thing.  This is an expression that lasts
about a 25th of a second.  We’ve tested

26
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:09,819
over 15,000 people in all walks of life and
over 99 percent of them don’t see them,

27
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:17,569
and yet with an hour’s training on the Internet
they can learn to see them.    However,

28
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,720
that may only tell you that the person’s
concealing an emotion.  That’s a lie -- they’re

29
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,730
not telling you how they really feel.  But
it may not tell you that they’re the perpetrator

30
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:33,730
of a crime.  It’s a terrible example, but
I have to use it – my wife is found dead. 

31
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:41,489
I will be the first suspect because, regrettably,
the person most likely to kill their wife

32
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:47,659
is the husband. . . . “But I love my wife!
I didn’t kill her.  The police are wasting

33
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:53,849
their time and they’re insulting me!  Time
is going by and they’re not looking for

34
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:59,069
the real person.”  I could be furious at
them and concealing my anger.  And so if

35
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:04,650
you spot my concealed anger, it doesn’t
mean I killed my wife.  It only means that

36
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:11,650
I’m concealing my anger.  Now if a lie
is about how do you really feel, Paul, and

37
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:19,629
you spot a micro expression, then you’ve
got it.  Second, realize that only the

38
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:29,199
gestures of your cultural group are you going
to recognize.  That’s body specific language,

39
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:35,050
but you already know them.  You can’t – if
I asked you how many gestures are used in

40
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:40,990
America today, you’d give me about 12, but
there are actually 80.  And if I showed you

41
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:46,360
every one of those 80, you’d know what they
mean.  Now the one that amazingly enough

42
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:53,360
has had an enormous payoff is one of the most
common ones we use, which is the headshake,

43
00:04:53,449 --> 00:05:00,449
yes and no.  I just did this.  This is actually
“yes” and this is “no.”  But it occurs

44
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:08,080
in a micro fashion.  So I worked on the case
of an embezzler who had embezzled over $100

45
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:15,080
million.  He was really big time until Bernie
Madoff came along.  This embezzler had accused

46
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:23,180
people in a number of banks of being in on
the deal, which meant those banks would be

47
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:29,779
vulnerable to having to pay for the embezzlement. 
And when one of the people who he falsely

48
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:36,779
accused, he is asked, “Did she help you
steal the money?”  He said, “Yes.  Absolutely,

49
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:46,029
she did.”  Doing a slight headshake, no. 
Even tinier than mine.  So there’s a

50
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:51,679
gesture one.  There’s a face one.
