00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:10,310
Across different cultures, there are differences in eye contact.

1
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,060
One of the most powerful rules in Caucasian culture is that you look at someone while

2
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:18,789
they&#39;re talking to communicate respect and to communicate that you&#39;re listening.

3
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:22,160
This rule isn&#39;t necessarily as strong in other cultures though.

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,250
It’s not necessarily the same for Africans, most African-Americans, or Indigenous Australians.

5
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,890
Aboriginal Australian kids (Donovan &amp; Spark, 1997) might be taught the opposite rule, that

6
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,780
to communicate respect to a more senior person, you actually look away.

7
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,140
You don&#39;t look at them in the eye when they&#39;re talking.

8
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,640
I’m sure you can imagine how this could cause friction for people from different cultures

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,690
when they’re trying to interact with each other.

10
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,890
Imagine an Anglo-Australian teacher teaching an Indigenous Australian child.

11
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,030
The teacher may not get eye contact from the student while the teacher is talking - and

12
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,850
the teacher may interpret this as disrespect - as though the child’s not paying attention.

13
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,239
But actually, the child’s showing a lot of respect to the teacher.

14
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,680
You can imagine how confusing it would be for the child then to get in trouble when

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,719
they were actually trying to do the right thing.

16
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:13,700
Erickson and Shultz (1982) found something like this in the context of counselling interviews.

17
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,970
White people would maintain eye contact while listening, but broke their gaze while speaking.

18
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,570
The Black participants in that study would do the opposite - lots of eye contact while

19
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:26,140
speaking, but not so much while listening.

20
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,460
This meant that when there was a White speaker and Black listener, the speaker often thought

21
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,130
the listener wasn’t actually paying attention because they weren’t being looked at with

22
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,439
a steady gaze.

23
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,659
It got worse.

24
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:41,810
When the White speaker tried to send a nonverbal signal to check that the listener was listening,

25
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,280
it was often missed because the Black listener was looking away.

26
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,090
So, the White speaker would do it again or repeat themselves, which can be quite insulting

27
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,960
for a listener.

28
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,939
When the speaker was Black and the listener was White though, the steady eye contact of

29
00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:59,479
the speaker was sometimes too much for the listener.

30
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:04,110
In many White cultures, you maintain eye contact about two-thirds of the time while the speaker

31
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,270
is talking.

32
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,270
You look at them.

33
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,420
But you don&#39;t look at them 100 percent of the time.

34
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:12,379
I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve had that experience when someone&#39;s giving you 100 percent eye

35
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:17,050
contact, and you can&#39;t gather your thoughts anymore because you get drawn into this vortex

36
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,690
of their eyeballs.

37
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,470
You might register this but not in a conscious way.

38
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,330
You might not be going, &quot;Wow, I&#39;m really used to 65 percent eye contact.

39
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,910
This guy is really cranking it up to 85 percent.&quot;

40
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,020
You&#39;re not walking around like that.

41
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,940
What you might walk away thinking is, &quot;Oh, that guy seemed a bit full-on,&quot; or &quot;That guy

42
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,480
seemed intense.&quot;

43
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,590
Just as there are differences in eye contact, there are also cultural differences in body

44
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,849
orientation.

45
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:49,310
Body orientation refers to how we position or posture our body in relation to other people.

46
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:54,160
Direct body orientation refers to when two people face each other squarely.

47
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,069
Indirect body orientation refers to when two people position their bodies at an angle to

48
00:02:58,069 --> 00:02:59,930
one another.

49
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,470
As an example, in Indonesia, they&#39;ve got fairly indirect body orientation (Noesjirwan, 1978).

50
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,030
Whereas, Australians tend to have more direct body orientation.

51
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:13,500
This is even though the preferred interpersonal distance is closer in Indonesia than Australia.

52
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,120
This is similar, although not quite the same, as the difference in preferred orientation

53
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,800
for Arab people and Americans (Watson &amp; Graves, 1966).

54
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,830
Arabs who are talking to each other prefer to be closer and oriented more directly than

55
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,830
Americans.

56
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,580
Remland’s (Remland, Jones &amp; Brinkman, 1995) research with European cultures showed that

57
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:32,290
Dutch and Scottish people who were interacting with each other had more indirect body orientations

58
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,930
than English, Greek and Italian people talking to each other.

59
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:41,000
You often don&#39;t face somebody directly in any culture, really, if you&#39;re just chatting.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,830
Often you angle your body away somewhat from the other person - but there is always variations

61
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,470
as to how much.

62
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,970
Those from cultures with more direct body orientation can come across to those with

63
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:55,409
more indirect body orientation as, &quot;Whoa, that person&#39;s intense!&quot;.

64
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:58,830
Then there&#39;s differences in how loudly you speak.

65
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,230
America has a reputation of a loud-talking culture.

66
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,400
The evidence (Tannen, 1984) suggests that it largely is, although there&#39;s huge differences

67
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,930
within the country.

68
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,650
So, what about other vocal features?

69
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,130
Generally, we expect people to be looking at us when we&#39;re talking.

70
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:17,400
We also want people to show that they&#39;re listening with head nods and little vocal encouragements.

71
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,949
For example, &quot;Yes?&quot;

72
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:24,210
&quot;Wow,&quot; “Mmm-huhm”, “Oh, my goodness!&quot;

73
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,629
They&#39;re called Minimal encouragers.

74
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:30,729
They&#39;re designed to communicate that you&#39;re listening, and encourage people to keep talking.

75
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,469
Not everyone does this.

76
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:34,589
It can create miscommunication.

77
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:38,879
Tannen found that people from New York would enthusiastically show that they were listening

78
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,960
by saying very loudly “Wow!” or “No kidding!”.

79
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,849
But for other New Yorkers this just meant that you were paying attention and was a sign

80
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:49,689
of encouragement.

81
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:54,289
People from California though, found the loud responses frightening and confusing, and sometimes

82
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:57,080
even stopped in the middle of their sentence.

83
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,639
So you can see the potential for miscommunication here too.
