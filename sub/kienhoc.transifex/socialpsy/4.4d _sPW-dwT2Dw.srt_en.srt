00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:10,870
The activity that you just completed aimed to highlight how motivation can influence

1
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,519
the attributions that we make.

2
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,520
When explaining why you might have done well in a test, you will tend to select one of

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,720
the first two answers in the examples (either your hard work or academic ability), as these

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,690
are internal explanations for doing well.

5
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,920
If the outcome is not a good one however, then you may be more likely to select one

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,230
of the second two answers (the test difficulty or the teacher’s teaching ability), as these

7
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,350
are external attributions for the bad outcome.

8
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,219
These attributions minimise the extent that the outcome reflects badly on you.

9
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:48,780
This is known as the self-serving bias, which is the tendency to attribute successes to

10
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,219
stable, internal factors and failures to temporary, external factors (Taylor and Koivumaki, 1976).

11
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:59,219
So, we saw that the actor-observer bias reverses for positive outcomes – we attribute positive

12
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,300
outcomes to more internal causes when thinking about our own behaviour compared to the behaviour

13
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,729
of other people.

14
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:09,250
This is effectively the same as the self-serving bias.

15
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,580
  The self-serving bias seems to serve two purposes.

16
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,720
The first is a self-presentation effect.

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,180
We engaging in self-serving attributions to make us look better to other people.

18
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,240
We are responsible for good outcomes and not responsible for bad outcomes.

19
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,380
There is also some evidence that the self-serving biases are present when people make their

20
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,190
attributions in private and so can’t be trying to impress anyone else.

21
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:39,630
This suggests that the self-serving bias also helps us to enhance our self-esteem and make

22
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,350
us feel better about ourselves.
