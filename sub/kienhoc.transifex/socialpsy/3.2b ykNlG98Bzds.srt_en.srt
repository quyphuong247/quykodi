Think of a gorilla - suppose we gave this gorilla a job and an apartment - could it

1
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,950
hold down a job in human society?

2
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,520
Do you think it would thrive?

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,840
Humans make choices and incorporate all sorts of abstract principles such as moral rules

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,941
and responsibilities, religious prescriptions, financial calculations, and so on, all of

5
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:28,560
these into their behavioural choices.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,059
No other self or animal does anything like that.

7
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:36,430
We are actively self-serving - in our thoughts, our feelings and deeds.

8
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:41,149
Some of this is true for most animals, their brains take care of their bodies to some degree.

9
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:44,960
But humans do this in very advanced ways.

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,940
Meanwhile, humans are also capable of making principled self-sacrifice.

11
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,929
You might risk your fortune, even your life for some abstract principle.

12
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:56,070
No sign of this among the Gorillas.

13
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,790
We use logical reasoning to guide behaviour, we form elaborate plans of the future.

14
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:06,320
We have a vision of our future self and our past self, and we mediate between these.

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,930
This seems to be something only the human self does.

16
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,220
We regulate ourselves.

17
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,830
We change our behaviour to fit rules.

18
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,860
We organise complex sequences of actions across time.

19
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,860
We manage our reputation; weâ€™re very concerned with how we are perceived and evaluated by

20
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,950
other people.

21
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:29,200
As far as we can tell most animals are not even capable of imagining such things.

22
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,810
Yet human beings do this all the time and adjust our behaviour on that basis.

23
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,680
So, talking about the self, we&#39;re seeking to explain something that we take for granted

24
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,790
in everyday life, and yet for psychologists this is a remarkable phenomenon, quite different

25
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,780
from all the animals that we evolved from.
