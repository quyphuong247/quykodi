Sometimes, emblems can be used to communicate quite complex, nuanced pieces of information.

1
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,350
If you want to signal &quot;good luck,&quot; how would you do that nonverbally?

2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,869
You could do a little prayer.

3
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:19,789
You could do a little thumbs-up gesture.

4
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:22,130
The classic, of course, is the crossed fingers.

5
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,619
In fact, I do know where that one comes from.

6
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,380
There&#39;s a pretty standard theory that this is something that emerged in Christian cultures,

7
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,149
representing the crucifix.

8
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:33,780
It&#39;s a sign to ward off bad luck.

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,910
You&#39;ve just done something stupid.

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,910
What&#39;s the international signal for having done something stupid?

11
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,220
&quot;I have no idea what the answer is,&quot; how would you communicate that nonverbally?

12
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,810
It&#39;s kind of like hands out.

13
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,650
&quot;I&#39;ve got nothing,&quot; right?

14
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,810
You show that you&#39;ve got nothing.

15
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,470
Shrug your shoulders for reasons I’ve got no idea.

16
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:56,470
Sometimes, if you really want to hammer it home, you might turn your mouth down.

17
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,600
Kids are picking up on this very, very early.

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,160
We don&#39;t go to school and learn this in English or anything.

19
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,920
It&#39;s just something that we pick up from each other.

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,310
There&#39;s emblems for saying someone’s crazy, right, the &#39;cuckoo&#39; gesture, the &quot;throat slit&quot;

21
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,659
gesture to indicate you want to kill someone.

22
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:15,340
Apparently in Swaziland, the throat slit gesture could mean &quot;I love you.&quot;

23
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,729
You can see the potential for miscommunication there.

24
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:20,830
We&#39;ll talk a bit more about cross-cultural miscommunication soon.
