00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:08,860
Who knows you best?

1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,920
Some of you may think this is obvious - of course, you know yourself better than anyone

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,160
else.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,970
But others credit their spouses with sometimes knowing them better than themselves.

4
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,930
Even children up to the age of 10 or 11 -- a lot of them when you ask who knows you best

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,480
deep down inside, they will say their mother.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,120
So this idea of what we call Privileged Access – the idea that you know yourself better

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,640
than anyone else - this is also a somewhat tenuous and relative idea.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,700
We certainly know a lot about ourselves.

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,619
But we might also be biased, correct?

10
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:45,180
So although we have lots of information about ourselves, it might not be accurate information.

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,300
You can answer questions about yourself pretty quickly.

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,250
But is self-knowledge accurate?

13
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,280
Maybe people fool themselves.

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,580
We certainly see this with other people.

15
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,489
At the start of this topic you were asked to rate your ability to get along with other

16
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:00,489
people.

17
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:04,659
Now, I could look at your answers, but I don’t know you, so I can’t tell for sure whether

18
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:06,370
your answer is correct or not.

19
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,930
So this is a challenge for psychology.

20
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,690
How can we tell if people’s answers are correct or not?

21
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:16,520
Well, we can ask them things that we can measure directly - such as how much they weigh, and

22
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,250
then we can actually weigh them.

23
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,540
I think we’d be finding some difference there – a lot of people say they weigh a

24
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,010
little bit less than what the scale might tell us.

25
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,520
But there is another way, in terms of psychology research that we can get at this question.

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,520
We can look at a large set of answers.

27
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,970
For example, I asked you all to rate yourself in comparison to the average student.

28
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,360
This kind of thing has been done repeatedly and what we find is that nearly all the students

29
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,950
will rate themselves as better, or far better than average.

30
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,071
In several giant studies there was hardly anyone in the United States I believe was

31
00:01:48,071 --> 00:01:52,540
less than 1 % rated themselves as below average in getting along with others.

32
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,530
So, everybody is above average?

33
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,100
One option in one of the scales was are you in the top 1%.

34
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,510
Twenty–Five (25%) of the students rated themselves as being in the top 1%!

35
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:11,360
The top 1% really can’t possibly include 25% so some of those people were overestimating.

36
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,739
We don’t know which ones, maybe people have slightly different criteria so maybe 2 or

37
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:21,159
3% could make a legitimate claim to be in the top 1%.

38
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,879
But somebody does have to be below average.

39
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:28,709
So, put this way, the average person thinks that he or she is above average.

40
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:32,319
And by definition, the average is not above average - the average is average.

41
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:38,760
So there is this evidence that broadly speaking self-knowledge is not entirely accurate but

42
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,739
systematically distorted and in a rather favourable manner.
