00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:11,280
So, dismissing some of your failures, making excuses for them while taking your successes

1
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,559
to heart – that’s one pathway to this self-deception we’re talking about.

2
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:20,619
But there are a couple of other ways that we can sustain positive illusions.

3
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:24,000
One of these is selective criticism.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,160
If people get a test - a school test or medical test or whatever - if the news is good, they

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,160
don’t question it further.

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,780
They go, okay that’s great, it’s a good sign, I knew it.

7
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:40,129
If the news is bad - they go, oh wait a minute, there must be something wrong with the test,

8
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:41,660
it might not be a valid test.

9
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,910
They become critical and sceptical.

10
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,579
You see this in politics too.

11
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:49,730
A study comes out and the findings are congenial to your views – regardless of whether you

12
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,219
are a liberal or conservative or whatever.

13
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,449
And you say, yeah, look that’s evidence, it shows what I believe.

14
00:00:55,449 --> 00:01:00,930
Meanwhile, a study that goes for the other side – against your views, you go, I bet

15
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,449
they did the study wrong, there’s something biased or something like that.

16
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:09,310
So, selective criticism enables you to weed out information you don’t like and thus

17
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,860
build your self-esteem on a positive view.

18
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,380
Memory bias is another way we fool ourselves.

19
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,180
Memory bias occurs when people forget bad things.

20
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,310
They remember good things much better - partly they rehearse and they dwell on the good things,

21
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,790
think of them over and over.

22
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,439
Bad things, they might dwell on them for a little bit but they are usually trying to

23
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,820
think of some way to explain them away - sort of a rehearsing or some way to deal with it

24
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,380
and then they file it away and don’t think about it as much.

25
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:41,270
So, in general, there is a tendency that lots of times when you think the news is going

26
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,710
to be bad you sort of put your defences up.

27
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,340
You don’t pay as much attention.

28
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,520
You get a report on your personality or something that says you’re a marvellous person - you

29
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,610
might really study it in detail and read it and think about it and memorise it, and imagine

30
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,590
sharing it with your friends or telling your mother on this.

31
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:05,180
But, you get the same report from the same source, only it says you’re a loser and

32
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,010
a failure - you probably don’t even read the whole thing, and you sort of skim it.

33
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:13,710
You don’t study it you don’t talk about it with your mother, or memorise it.

34
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:19,890
It’s a bit like getting spam in your email - you can’t really not see the spam at all

35
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,950
but you don’t have to read the whole thing.

36
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,720
You can just look at it you can tell right away this is spam and then you delete it.

37
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,420
And that’s a good analogy for how the mind deals with a lot of criticism or feedback

38
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,290
that people don’t like about themselves.

39
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,420
It’s not the way Freud thought, you repress it in the sense that, you push the thought

40
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,670
into the unconscious and its gone into this dungeon of unwanted thoughts.

41
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,231
No, it came through your conscious mind but if you don’t think about it very much, you

42
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:50,340
just say oh well, and you move on.

43
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,560
Then it doesn’t create as much of a trace in memory -- it isn’t connected to as many

44
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,090
other things, so it doesn’t come back as many times.
