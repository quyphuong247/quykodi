Do you remember the ice bucket challenge where people would tip a bucket of ice water over

1
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:10,940
themselves?

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,670
Why would people do such a crazy thing?

3
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,139
This is Blake doing the ice bucket challenge for PSYC1030.

4
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:26,269
I nominate Virginia Slaughter and John Zornig (wild applause).

5
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:28,589
Why would anyone do this crazy thing?

6
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:33,600
Well, we can be persuaded by the behaviours and attitudes of other people.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,539
We often use the beliefs, attitudes, and actions of others as a basis of comparison to evaluate

8
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:44,250
the correctness of our own beliefs, attitudes and actions.

9
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,859
In the ice bucket challenge, people all around the world felt the pressure to copy the behaviour

10
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:50,950
of those before them for a good cause.

11
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,829
And we saw something similar with planking, but for that there wasn’t a good cause to

12
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,980
justify the crazy behaviour.

13
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:03,019
Cialdini and colleagues (1990) found that whether people littered or not at an amusement

14
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:07,720
park was influenced by whether other people had previously left litter in the area or

15
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,120
not.

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,799
And here’s one you can try.

17
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,990
Milgram and colleagues (1969) found that other people will start staring up at the sky if

18
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:18,000
a small group of people are already doing that.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,830
So, grab some friends and see if you can influence people to look into the empty sky.

20
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,270
So why do we do this?

21
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:29,829
Well Festinger’s (1954) social comparison theory tells us that people have a constant

22
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:32,040
drive to evaluate themselves.

23
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,641
If possible, people will prefer to use objective cues to make these evaluations, but we are

24
00:01:37,641 --> 00:01:40,229
not always able to do this.

25
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:44,900
In that case, we will rely on a social comparison instead, by looking at what those similar

26
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,220
to us are thinking and doing.

27
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,469
This is called the principle of social validation.

28
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:55,290
This is the third of the six principles of influence that Cialdini identified.

29
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,270
Because of this, we should be more willing to comply with a request for behaviour if

30
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,880
it is consistent with what others are thinking or doing.

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,259
This is why bartenders and waiters salt tip jars with cash at the start of the night,

32
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:14,070
church ushers sometimes prime collection baskets, advertisers tell us that a product is “top

33
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,590
selling” or indicate the many thousands of copies already sold.

34
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,410
And institutions spend a considerable time listing the individual people who have already

35
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,620
donated money to them.

36
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,780
The technique that makes use of social validation is called “the List technique”, and it

37
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:36,720
works by asking for a request only after the target person has been shown a list of others

38
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,610
who have already agreed to the same request.

39
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:45,760
In a study by Reingen in 1982, students or homeowners were asked to donate blood or money

40
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,920
to a charitable cause.

41
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,470
Those initially shown a list of others who had already agreed to the request were significantly

42
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,090
more likely to comply themselves.

43
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:00,560
In fact, the longer the list was, the greater the effect on the agreement rate.

44
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,170
This effect works partly through pressures of conformity.

45
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,220
We tend to go along with what other people are doing either because we are not sure what

46
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,569
the appropriate behaviour is or because we don’t want to stand out from the group.
