0
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,770
Have you ever formed an opinion about someone based only on their appearance, based on how

1
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,370
they looked or how they spoke?

2
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,370
We all do it!

3
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,430
Sometimes, we do it even without being aware.

4
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:23,869
If you just completed the job selection activity, we showed you CVs from four different people

5
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:28,199
and asked you to rank them in order of suitability for the job at the engineering firm.

6
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:34,030
Two of the CVs were quite strong, with better work history and educational qualifications,

7
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,140
and two were quite weak.

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,230
Two also came from male applicants and two came from female applicants.

9
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,800
If you take a look at the results of the poll, the more that people ranked Applicant 1 higher

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,120
than Applicant 2 suggests that the person’s gender influenced the rankings because they

11
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,660
both had the same strong job history and educational background.

12
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,469
If Applicant 3 was ranked higher than Applicant 2, then gender really played a strong part

13
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:01,120
in the rankings.

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,750
Applicant three was a man, but his job history and education were really not as strong as

15
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,330
the woman described in Applicant 2’s CV.

16
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,150
This sort of thing is not limited to the job selection context.

17
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:17,990
Almost in the first few seconds of meeting someone new, we form judgements about that

18
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,900
person based on their appearance and how they conduct themselves.

19
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,470
This prejudgement of the other person can sometimes be positive.

20
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,290
For example, if the other person is familiar to us, it’s more likely that our prejudgement

21
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,800
of them will be positive.

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,390
However, our prejudgement of people can sometimes be negative.

23
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,759
    Prejudice refers to the prejudgement or initial

24
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,770
opinion we form about someone before we’ve had a chance to properly get to know them.

25
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,799
Prejudice literally means “prejudgement” and the word comes from the Latin “prae

26
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,219
judice,” prejudgment.

27
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,409
  In social psychology, prejudice refers to

28
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:58,110
the unfavourable attitudes that people have toward a social group and its members.

29
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,590
It’s likely that most of you are able to think of a time when you felt as though you

30
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:07,939
were judged unfairly by others, when you were judged negatively on the basis of something

31
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:10,530
other than the quality of your character.

32
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:16,280
This could have been the way you looked, your accent, where you lived, your tattoos, your

33
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,020
body shape, and so on.

34
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,709
It’s not a great feeling.

35
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:25,200
Many social psychologists are interested in answering the question of “Why - why are

36
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,170
people prejudiced?”

37
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,900
Knowing the factors that are associated with prejudice would enable us to work out a way

38
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,810
to reduce prejudice in our society.

39
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,080
This is a big social justice mission for many social psychologists.

40
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,440
We will be focusing on sexism and racism, because these are the two “-isms” that

41
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,590
have attracted the most research attention over the years.

42
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,099
Also, as Perry and colleagues’ 2012 research shows (Perry, Pullen &amp; Oser, 2012), people

43
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:54,879
living with chronic stress from their experience of sexism and racism have been found to be

44
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,580
more at risk of taking their own lives.

45
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,690
We will talk about some of the theories of prejudice, focusing on gender and race stereotyping,

46
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:06,150
but these theories are translatable to other prejudices.

47
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,430
Then, we will talk about the consequences of discrimination for the victims themselves.

48
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:17,159
We will look at some fairly mind-bending research that shows how our preconceptions and assumptions

49
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:22,180
about people can actually constrain the way they feel and behave.

50
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,890
And ironically, can actually influence them to become the kind of people that we perceive

51
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:27,390
them to be.
