00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,220
If someone has done something nice for you, don’t you feel like you want to do something

1
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,610
nice back?

2
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,630
Why do we feel the need to reciprocate like this?

3
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,340
The first of the six principles of influence that Cialdini identified is the principle

4
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,980
of Reciprocation.

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,119
Reciprocation is one of the most important things in our social lives—if there is someone

6
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:29,740
who does something nice for you, we really want to do something nice back.

7
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,340
So, the reciprocation rule is that we should be more willing to comply with a request from

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,219
someone who has previously provided a favour or concession to us.

9
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,120
I don’t know if you ever had that situation where someone has done something nice for

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,910
you and you can’t repay it.

11
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,890
Maybe a stranger has done something nice for you and there’s no possibility of repaying

12
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:49,890
it.

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,850
It’s actually quite anxiety-provoking.

14
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,719
We really want to be able to repay nice things.

15
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,800
So, what is it that makes us feel anxious about not being able to return the favour?

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,070
Well, there is a powerful norm for reciprocation in society (Gouldner, 1960).

17
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:08,259
We feel an obligation to return the form of the behaviour we receive from another (Byrne

18
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:09,259
&amp; Rhamey, 1965).

19
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:10,680
We like those who like us (Braver, 1975).

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,250
We cooperate with people who cooperate with us, and we compete with people who compete

21
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,440
with us (Cunningham et al., 1986).

22
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,580
We self-disclose to those who self-disclose to us (Axelrod, 1984).

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,390
We also make concessions to those who make concessions to us (Regan, 1971).

24
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,920
We feel obligated to provide gifts, favours, services and aid to those who have given such

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,920
things to us first.

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,840
We even give larger favours than those received, as we will soon see.

27
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,110
This norm allowed society to develop and forms the basis of trade and other relationships.

28
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,760
Without this norm, people wouldn’t be able to trust that the other person would go through

29
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,380
with their side of a deal.

30
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,780
So, let’s look at an example of how reciprocation can work.

31
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:59,040
In a study by Regan in 1971, two people turned up to take part, but had to wait in a secretary’s

32
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,980
office at the start.

33
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,830
Only one of the participants was a real participant.

34
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,040
The other person was an actor or confederate.

35
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,979
The secretary left the office to do something, and after a couple of minutes the phone on

36
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,000
the desk rang.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,769
In the Pleasant condition the confederate said to the caller on the phone…”

38
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:21,340
I’m sorry, but I don’t work in the building and I don’t know where the secretary is.

39
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,040
If you try again a bit later, perhaps the secretary might have returned.

40
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,790
In the Unpleasant condition, on the other hand, the confederate said,” Nah, there’s

41
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,370
no secretary here.

42
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,459
Look, I don’t work here, lady, for chrissake…just call later…”

43
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,840
He hung up without saying goodbye, clearly in the middle of the caller’s conversation.

44
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,599
Of course, this was all a set-up, and it was just someone from the research team who called.

45
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:49,800
Here Regan had manipulated the likeability or the pleasantness of the confederate.

46
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,519
In the pleasant condition, the confederate was polite on the phone.

47
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,392
In the unpleasant condition, the confederate wasn’t so polite.

48
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:58,230
He was a bit of a jerk actually.

49
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,040
Next, the experimenter arrived, and pretended not to know what had gone on.

50
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,560
The experimenter took the two participants to the lab to do the study they had signed

51
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,329
up for, which was writing about how much they like various paintings.

52
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:14,719
Halfway through this experiment, the confederate leaves the room to get a drink.

53
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,060
A third of the time, when they come back, they brought back a drink for the participant

54
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,069
and said, “Here, I bought you a drink, because while I was at the vending machine, I thought

55
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,930
it was just as easy to buy you a drink while I was getting myself one.”

56
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,640
This was the favour condition.

57
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,620
Another third of the time, the confederate didn’t bring back a drink for the participant.

58
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,200
This was the no favour condition.The final group of participants were given a drink by

59
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,140
the experimenter, not the confederate.

60
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,040
This was a control condition to make sure that any favour effect was not just because

61
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,549
participants had a tasty drink.

62
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:51,340
Just like in the no drink condition, there should be no pressure for reciprocating any

63
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,670
favour if asked by the confederate later on.

64
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,129
Towards the end of the experiment, the confederate writes out a note and gives it to the real

65
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:00,459
participant.

66
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:01,480
The note says...

67
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,029
“Would you do me a favour?

68
00:04:03,029 --> 00:04:07,249
I’m selling raffle tickets for my high school back home to build a new gym.

69
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:12,049
The tickets cost 25cents each and the prize is a new Corvette.

70
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:16,579
The thing is, if I sell the most tickets I get 50 bucks and I could use it.

71
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:20,200
If you’d buy any, would you just write the number on this note and give it back to me

72
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,960
right away so I can make out the tickets?

73
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,990
Any would help, the more the better.

74
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,990
Thanks.”

75
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,820
The researchers then recorded how many raffle tickets the real participant bought from the

76
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,820
confederate.

77
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,780
Who do you think bought the most raffle tickets?

78
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,319
The people who were given the soft drink, or the other people who missed out on a soft

79
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,319
drink?

80
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:44,780
Do you think the experimenter giving them a soft drink would have any effect?

81
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,620
What about how much we like the person asking us?

82
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,090
And most importantly, why do you think they did it?
