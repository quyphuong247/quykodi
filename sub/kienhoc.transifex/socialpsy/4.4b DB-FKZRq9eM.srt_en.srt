00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:08,510
Ok, so let’s imagine we are at a party.

1
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,790
Things are pretty funky at this party.

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,170
And there are three people hanging out by the bar.

3
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,059
Let’s call them Sigmund, Stanley, and Leon.

4
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,410
Sigmund has a theory about why people develop psychological problems, but his theory has

5
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,119
been criticised by many people for being untestable.

6
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,119
Stanley turns to Sigmund and says sarcastically “Nice theory!”

7
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,690
Leon observes this and leans over to Sigmund to reassure him by saying “Actually I think

8
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,650
it’s a good theory…”

9
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,840
Ok, so what can we make of these behaviours?

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,650
What is causing Stanley’s sarcastic behaviour?

11
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:43,900
The person, which is Stanley?

12
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,610
How about the target, which is Sigmund?

13
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:52,560
Or what about the situation, the nightclub?Well what we have here is information that there

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,800
is little consensus in behaving sarcastically.

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,460
Yes, Stanley was sarcastic, but Leon wasn’t.

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,360
So, this helps us make a person attribution, the sarcastic behaviour must be due to Stanley’s

17
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,899
disposition - perhaps he’s a sarcastic person?

18
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:16,590
Okay, let’s imagine now that Stanley leans over to Sigmund and again says “nice theory!”

19
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,570
in a sarcastic manner.

20
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,260
This time however, Stanley then turns to Leon, who also has some interesting theories, and

21
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:28,659
says “Leon, your theory is awesome!” in a genuine manner.

22
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:30,420
What do we make of this?

23
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,090
Well, now we have a different type of information - namely distinctiveness information.

24
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,069
Stanley’s sarcastic behaviour is performed towards one target, that’s Sigmund, but

25
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:44,539
not towards another target, which is Leon.

26
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:48,490
So now the behaviour varies across targets, and we can make a target =attribution.

27
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:53,479
There is something about Sigmund that makes people behave in a sarcastic manner towards

28
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,530
him.

29
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,999
Perhaps he’s got an irritating interpersonal style?

30
00:01:57,999 --> 00:01:59,749
What about a final possibility?

31
00:01:59,749 --> 00:02:03,880
This time Stanley says “Nice theory!” sarcastically to Sigmund at the nightclub.

32
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,240
However, the next day, when they both turn up to the office to continue their research,

33
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,440
Stanley says “Nice theory!” again to Sigmund, but this time he means it genuinely this time.

34
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,530
So now we have information about the consistency of the Stanley’s behaviour toward Sigmund

35
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:24,110
- it’s not very consistent as it varies from one situation, the nightclub, to another,

36
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,110
the office.

37
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,330
So, we would conclude that the behaviour is due to the situation.

38
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,340
Perhaps the music in the nightclub was too loud and the drinks too expensive, making

39
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,360
Stanley irritable.
