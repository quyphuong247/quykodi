00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,690
If we think about prejudice as an attitude, perhaps it shouldn’t be surprising that,

1
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,660
like the tripartite model of attitudes, prejudice has three components.

2
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,699
The first of these is the cognitive component.

3
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:22,410
The cognitive component refers to our beliefs.

4
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,420
In the case of prejudice, it is beliefs about a group.

5
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:30,160
Often, these beliefs are represented in the form of a stereotype.

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,940
A stereotype is a simplified idea of what a group of people are like, often a gross

7
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,530
exaggeration of something.

8
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,750
Some people feel negatively towards developing stereotypes about groups of people.

9
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,700
They feel guilty about stereotyping.

10
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,440
It’s like they have the sense that we shouldn’t stereotype because stereotyping is prejudice

11
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,080
and prejudice is bad.

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:56,750
Well, it’s actually very difficult, if not impossible, for us to avoid stereotyping altogether.

13
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,710
We’re sensitive to the categorical characteristics that are typically associated with different

14
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,460
groups of people––what they typically do, what they wear, how they speak and so

15
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,460
on.

16
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,620
And most of the time, our sensitivity towards these characteristics can be very helpful.

17
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,730
The world is incredibly complex.

18
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:18,990
In order to deal with the tremendous amount of information that we encounter every day,

19
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,180
our brains have evolved to take short cuts.

20
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,040
We use rules of thumb.

21
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,420
We make assumptions.

22
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,560
We draw on generalisations.

23
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,050
We have schemas that help us get through.

24
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,030
If we didn’t do that, it would be impossible for us to process all the information that

25
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,640
we encounter throughout the day.

26
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,020
In this context, our ability to stereotype people, based on the typical characteristics

27
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,970
that are associated with different groups of people, can be very helpful when it comes

28
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,620
to getting through our day (Macrae &amp; Bodenhausen, 2000).

29
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,190
However, stereotyping becomes dysfunctional when our initial judgement about a group is

30
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:56,930
negative––when our initial judgement about a group is based on something other than what

31
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,750
is actually true in reality.

32
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:05,170
And, when we rigidly cling onto and are unwilling to modify our judgement in light of disconfirming

33
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,430
evidence.

34
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,970
This is getting closer to what we would call prejudice.

35
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,580
It’s actually really amazing how quickly stereotypes pop into our mind.

36
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,709
Often, we don’t even have to think specifically about the stereotypes that are associated

37
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:19,790
with different groups of people.

38
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,909
Sometimes we don’t even know where the stereotype came from, that’s in our mind.

39
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:25,040
Let’s try an example.

40
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,189
I want you to imagine a French person.

41
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,769
Think about what they look like and what they are wearing.
