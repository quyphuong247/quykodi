How can you get people to do things that they don’t have to do?

00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,850
How can you get people to do things that they don’t want to do?

2
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,959
Well, there is an art to it, but there’s also a science.

3
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:19,760
So, we’re going to be talking about the sorts of techniques that are effective at

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,490
getting other people to do things.

5
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:26,510
Now you might take these techniques and use them for your own evil purposes, but hopefully

6
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:31,100
the main benefit that you will get is that you will be more able to defend yourself against

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,690
other people who are trying to influence you.

8
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,079
This might help you to avoid getting ripped off and taken advantage of.

9
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,670
If you can master the science of social influence, it has a huge number of benefits in a range

10
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,239
of domains.

11
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,489
Towards the end of this topic, we will talk about a more sinister form of influence, and

12
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:53,579
how very normal, and nice, decent people can do really horrible, cruel, and abusive things.
