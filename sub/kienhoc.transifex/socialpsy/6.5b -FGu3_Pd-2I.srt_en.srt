One of the most famous studies of obedience was done by Stanley Milgram (1963).

1
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,770
Stanley Milgram was interested in obedience, now this is when an authority figure commands

2
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:20,490
you to do something, they are not asking a favour, so you must do this, and you just

3
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,860
do it.

4
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,770
Quite often in life, it’s good to do that.

5
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,900
If a police person or judge or your parents ask you to do something or tell you to do

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,470
something, then most of the time you probably should do it.

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,680
But part of being an adult, part of being a morally evolved human being, is that we

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,520
know when to obey and when to disobey.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,929
Obedience is a particular type of compliance.

10
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:46,820
We have to find those moral boundaries and know when to comply and when not to.

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:52,149
Milgram was thinking about obedience at the time that Eichmann, a high-ranking Nazi official,

12
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:57,230
one of the main people responsible for the holocaust, was standing trial for war crimes.

13
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:01,979
Milgram wanted to find out how far ordinary people would go in obeying orders.

14
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:07,090
Would they, like Eichmann and the other Nazi’s working in the concentration camps, execute

15
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,960
strangers if they were told to?

16
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,180
Milgram designed what is probably the most famous psychological experiment of all time

17
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,620
to test his ideas about obedience.

18
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,840
In his study, he had two people in a lab.

19
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,320
Next the experimenter said, “We’re going to be trialling this radical new technique

20
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,530
for learning.

21
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,510
We have this theory,” he said, “where if people make a mistake when they’re learning,

22
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:34,530
if they forget something, or they misremember something, what you should do is give them

23
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,500
an electric shock, and then they’re less likely to forget down the track.”

24
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,350
They were split up into being learners and teachers.

25
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,950
The learner was strapped up to some electrodes, and then the teacher had to ask questions,

26
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,390
and every time the learner got it wrong or didn’t answer, they had to zap the learner.

27
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,600
Actually, the learner was a confederate working with the experimenter.

28
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,680
But the person being the teacher didn’t know that.

29
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,659
Initially, these were just really slight shocks, like tiny little zaps, only 15 volts.

30
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:05,700
They’re harmless.

31
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,819
But each time the learner got it wrong, the teacher had to increase the voltage.

32
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:13,830
You can see on the console just how extreme it started to get.

33
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,420
At first, it’s no big deal, the shocks aren’t really that big.

34
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,660
But it keeps going up.

35
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,590
And then suddenly you could be giving people a very strong shock, and then 255 volts is

36
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:30,090
an intense shock, 315 volts, an extreme intensity shock.

37
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,819
You get that up to 375 volts, it’s quite dangerous.

38
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:38,569
And then by 450 volts, we’re talking about these ominous three Xs.

39
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:42,140
The question was: how many people would go all the way?
