Traditionally, women are stereotyped as being nurturing and kind.

1
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,049
Women are associated with a bunch of stereotypes around being maternal.

2
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:21,690
Everything that implies benevolent, kind, good-natured, patient, and so on. Women are

3
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,500
seen as more interested in domestic matters than men. They are seen as more emotionally

4
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,200
rich and complex than men. What are men like according to stereotype?

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:39,780
Stoic. Emotionally resilient in the face of difficult times. Dominant. Aggressive.

6
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,039
If I say think of a criminal, think about a soldier, you’re probably not thinking

7
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:48,520
of a woman. Men are seen as more intelligent, tougher,

8
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,810
more resilient, and more independent than women. They are seen as having a can-do attitude.

9
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:59,190
They’re seen as more practical, good in a crisis, and have a warrior kind of stereotype.

10
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,750
(Archer &amp; Lloyd, 2002; Pretice &amp; Carranza, 2002)

11
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,831
According to Sigmund Freud, what’s on a man’s mind?

12
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:08,680
Men are thought to think about sports, cars, and sex.

13
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:14,580
Typically, men are perceived as being competent, ambitious, doers, and independent. Women are

14
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,430
characterised as being warm and expressive. Women are nice, according to the stereotype,

15
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:24,600
but maybe not so competent. Men will get the job done, but are not necessarily nice (Gilbert,

16
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,619
Fiske &amp; Lindzey, 1998).   Some stereotypes of women and men in western

17
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:32,220
societies have changed over the years. For example, where we have school systems where

18
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,350
girls outperform boys, where more girls go on to university, and also tend to do better

19
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,340
at university. This is in contrast to the domestic stereotype

20
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,320
of the past, and challenges the stereotype that women are less competent than men.
