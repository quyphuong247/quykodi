00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,450
Conformity happens when people give in to real or imagined social pressure.

1
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:17,490
Asch’s 1955 study is probably the most well-known study looking at conformity.

2
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,250
In that study, between seven and nine students were seated around a table in a classroom.

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,210
They had been told that the study was about perception.

4
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,130
Here is an illustration of the task given to participants.

5
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,850
Their task was to look at a picture of a vertical line on one card and compare it to another

6
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,800
picture of three vertical lines on another card.

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,870
They had to say which of the three lines on the second card matched the target line on

8
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,050
the first card.

9
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,970
It’s obvious that the second line is the one that matches the target.

10
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,220
It’s really not that difficult to tell.

11
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:53,540
In fact, when tested individually, people made mistakes on this task less than 1% of

12
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,210
the time.

13
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:00,960
On this figure, the y axis indicates the percentage of correct responses, the x axis shows the

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,860
12 critical trials.

15
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:08,300
We can see here that participant’s accuracy is nearly 100% when tested individually, because

16
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,650
they are pretty much always giving the correct response.

17
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:16,020
Asch had set it up though so that only one of the people sitting at the table was a real

18
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,330
participant.

19
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,240
The rest were confederates and working with the experimenter.

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,930
The confederates had been coached to sometimes give the correct answer, and sometimes give

21
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,360
the incorrect answer.

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,750
There were 18 pairs of cards shown to the group and the confederates gave the incorrect

23
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,340
answer for 12 of the pairs.

24
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,110
The real participant was seated so that they heard everyone else’s answers before giving

25
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,700
their own answer.

26
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,820
So, what happened when participants were faced with the rest of the group giving the incorrect

27
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,100
answer?

28
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,049
Did they go along with the group, or point out what the correct answer was?

29
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:55,740
So, in this figure, the green line shows those tested in a group.

30
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,200
This gap between the blue and green lines is our measure of conformity, it shows the

31
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,009
increase in giving the incorrect response that the group suggested.

32
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:06,619
So, the correct response rates go down.

33
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:10,970
It turns out that participants went along with the majority’s incorrect answer 36.8%

34
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:16,230
of the time, indicated here in the red.

35
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,410
While just over three-quarters of the participants conformed to the majority at least once, not

36
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,680
everyone conformed to the same extent.

37
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,010
About a quarter of the participants didn’t agreed with the majority when the majority

38
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:34,030
was giving the wrong answer, while some participants almost always agreed with the majority.

39
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,280
But those who chose to go along with the majority tended to do so consistently.
