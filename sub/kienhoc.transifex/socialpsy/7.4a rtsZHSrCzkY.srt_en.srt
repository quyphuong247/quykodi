00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:11,740
One of the stereotypes of minorities is that they like to speak up about experiencing discrimination.

1
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,700
The stereotype is that minorities who attribute failures due to discrimination are less likeable

2
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,519
than those who “take it on the chin”.

3
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,160
People seem to understand the negative consequences of claiming discrimination – for example

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,390
women are more likely to cry “discrimination” when on their own or with other women than

5
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,870
when they’re with men.

6
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:35,440
However, the stereotype that minorities like to cry discrimination is wrong.

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,460
Research has been done that deliberately exposes minorities to racism and sexism in the lab,

8
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,730
in order to study the issue.

9
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,920
In these studies, researchers asked people to explain why they thought they failed a

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,790
test, or why they thought they failed an interview.

11
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,940
Even when people are exposed to circumstantial evidence suggesting that they’re a victim

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,399
of prejudice, people are usually reluctant to say so.

13
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,739
People often stay quiet in the face of discrimination, and are not likely to make the assumption

14
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:05,309
that they’re being discriminated against.

15
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:09,250
In the case of sexism, when women are asked what they would do if they came across an

16
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:16,859
example of sexism, they massively overestimate their willingness to confront the sexism head-on.

17
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:22,859
In 1999, Swim and Hyers got a group of female participants to take part in small-group discussions.

18
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:26,869
The participants were instructed to select 12 people whom they thought would be able

19
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:31,539
to survive on a desert island, from a list of 30 people created by the researchers.

20
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:37,520
On this list, were 15 women and 15 men––with different occupations.

21
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,950
The group members then took turns in highlighting their thoughts and reasons for their suggestion.

22
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,560
Some groups were made up of only one female participant, while the remaining group members

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,909
were male confederates.

24
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:53,439
Other groups were made up of two female participants and a male confederate.

25
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,409
Unbeknownst to the participants, there were

26
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,749
a number of male confederates in each group who were instructed to provide sexist comments

27
00:01:59,749 --> 00:02:02,259
during the group discussions.

28
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:07,070
For example, when someone suggested to select an athlete or a trainer, a male confederate

29
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:11,430
said &quot;Yeah, we definitely need to keep the women in shape.’’

30
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,079
When another person suggested to select a chef, a confederate said “No, one of the

31
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,780
women can cook.’’

32
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,620
When someone suggested to select a female musician, a confederate said ‘‘I think

33
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,709
we need more women on the island to keep the men satisfied, to keep everyone happy.’’

34
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:30,569
So how did people respond to these outrageous

35
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:31,569
comments?

36
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:36,590
Well, as you can see here, a lot of people simply ignored the comments or waited to see

37
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,420
what others would do.

38
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,569
These were the same response in this study as the researchers couldn’t tell which was

39
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:42,569
which.

40
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:46,209
There were far fewer confrontational responses.

41
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:51,359
The top confrontational responses were to question the comment, focus on the task, on

42
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:57,500
the inappropriateness of the remark, use sarcasm, or express surprise.

43
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,959
In a second study, female participants were given scenarios that described the situation

44
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:06,129
participants experienced in the sexist group discussion from the previous study.

45
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:11,260
They were instructed to imagine that they were participating in the same group discussion,

46
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,219
and were asked to rate the extent that they thought the comments made by the male group

47
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:18,359
members were sexist or offensive.

48
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:22,420
In the end, participants were asked to indicate the extent to which they would give various

49
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,700
different responses to the sexist remarks from the group discussion.

50
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:33,439
These responses included: Ignoring the comment, wait to see what others do, question the response,

51
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:41,680
task-related response, comment on inappropriateness, sarcasm or humour, surprise exclamation, grumbling,

52
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,950
and hit or punch.

53
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:48,090
So, let’s see how people’s anticipations about how they would respond match up with

54
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,799
how people actually respond.

55
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,819
Swim and Hyers (1999) found that hardly anyone said that they would ignore the comment or

56
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:56,719
wait to see what others do.

57
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:01,459
In fact, only 1% of people said that they would ignore the sexist comment.

58
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:06,670
And only 4% of people indicated that they would wait to see what others do.

59
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:11,519
Close to 50% of people said that they would comment on the inappropriateness of the sexist

60
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,519
comment.

61
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,580
And 40% of people said that they would cut the person who is making the sexist comment

62
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:22,750
down with sarcasm or humour, for example making an anti-male, sexist comment.

63
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,370
Forty percent (40%) of people said that they would show surprise to the sexist comment.

64
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:32,030
And 8% of people said that they would hit or punch the person making the sexist comment.

65
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,870
As you can see, when we compare the results from both studies, the data showing what participants

66
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,599
actually did in the group discussion tells a different story.

67
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:44,870
Swim and Hyers found that when participants took part in the group discussions, nobody

68
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,770
hit or punched the person who made the sexist comments.

69
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,800
Only 16% of people showed surprise, sarcasm or humour, and comment on the inappropriateness

70
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,210
of the sexist comment.

71
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:00,360
And a whopping 55% of people actually ignored the comment and waited to see what others

72
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,150
do.

73
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:06,770
This is very typical because the first response people have to what they suspect is sexism,

74
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:11,490
racism, or any other forms of discrimination is not outrage.

75
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,479
Self-doubt is sometimes the first response where people are like, “Whoa, did I just

76
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,430
hear that right?”

77
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,780
Sometimes, people kind of look around and are like, “Was that person joking?”

78
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,699
They’re kind of doing this hypothesis testing on whether the comments they’ve heard are

79
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:27,229
real or not.

80
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:31,090
People don’t want to come across as taking the comments seriously, misinterpreting it,

81
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:35,009
getting angry about it, and then finding out the other person was just joking.

82
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:38,009
So, most people keep it to themselves.

83
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:42,310
Afterwards, they might go to their friends, talk to them about the remark, and get their

84
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,440
opinion on it.

85
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,349
Eventually, they might conclude that the comment was pretty sexist, and then become outraged.

86
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:51,259
But by then, it’s a little bit late to confront it.

87
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:56,240
So, the idea that people will confront sexism or racism head on, maybe by responding “How

88
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,770
dare you,” and storming off, just rarely happens.
