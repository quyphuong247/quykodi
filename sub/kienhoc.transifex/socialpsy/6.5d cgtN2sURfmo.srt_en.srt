00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,680
Milgram ran his study many times all around the world and got very similar results.

1
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,630
Then eventually ethics boards were established, and the whole thing got shut down.

2
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,420
But we know from those studies a bunch of psychological principles.

3
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,810
The status of the authority figure matters.

4
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,290
If the experimenter was like Professor Blah in a white lab coat, they had more power over

5
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,410
the participants than if they were casually dressed.

6
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,810
Then there is the power of commitment.

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,020
So, you start by being being helpful.

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,590
At first, it’s not a big deal.

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,330
It may even be a novelty, giving these light little shocks.

10
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,870
Then gradually the full horror of what you’re doing starts to dawn on you, but where’s

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,290
the point when you turn around?

12
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,730
Where’s the point when you make a scene?

13
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,659
Where’s the point when you step back from your commitment?

14
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:51,700
Humans find that difficult.

15
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,340
So, the absence of a clear-cut point in time to disobey is really important.

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,140
The belief that the authority figure would take responsibility for actions is also a

17
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,769
large factor.

18
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:04,420
Of course, this is the Nazi war crime defense.

19
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,540
It’s not up to me.

20
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,830
My morality is about following orders in a time of war.

21
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:13,630
It’s not about my own moral decision about whether I exterminate the Jews.

22
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,140
This was seen in the experiment as well.

23
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,390
The teachers didn’t just mindlessly zap the learner.

24
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,960
They were haggling with the experimenter.

25
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,760
They were fighting with him, “No, I can’t do this.

26
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,190
Let me go in there and see if the guy’s okay.

27
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,750
I don’t feel good about this.

28
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,630
I think the guy needs help.”

29
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,551
And the experimenter would say all these stern but meaningless things like, “The experiment

30
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,380
demands that you continue.

31
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,280
You must continue the experiment.”

32
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,390
And people are like, “No way, I don’t want to.

33
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,050
I feel really uncomfortable.”

34
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,800
The one thing that the experimenter would say which is quite successful in getting them

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,729
to continue would be, “It’s not your responsibility what happens to that man.

36
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:54,140
That’s my responsibility.

37
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,140
Your responsibility is to do the experiment.”

38
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:02,840
Then, quite often, in great distress, people would turn around and continue to be complicit

39
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,610
in the potential murder of a stranger.

40
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:09,830
We know, of course, that if there’s barriers to empathy, people are more likely to do this

41
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,009
kind of stuff.

42
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:15,520
In the original study, you couldn’t hear the learner screaming out and begging.

43
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,440
In some later versions of this study, the teacher could hear the learner screaming out.

44
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,780
They’d be saying “Let me out of here, let me out of here.

45
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,780
My heart hurts.

46
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,780
Let me out.”

47
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,510
They would be screaming when they get the shock, and then gradually the screams start

48
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,200
to turn to grunts, and then the begging dies out as the shocks increase.

49
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,090
You don’t hear them begging to be released anymore.

50
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,150
And it gets to the point where you can’t even hear them, and they’re not responding

51
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,150
to the questions.

52
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:44,660
There’s just this eerie silence in the room, the clear implication being that they’re

53
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,660
dead or unconscious.

54
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,819
In that circumstance, you get less obedience but it is still at about 60 percent, that’s

55
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:53,050
still very high.

56
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:57,030
In some of the studies, they got actors to pretend to get the shock right in front of

57
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,650
you in a room, and then the obedience went down to 40 percent.

58
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,040
Then in some of the studies, they actually had to wrestle with the person and force their

59
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,890
hand onto the electric pad, and then only 30 percent of people went all the way.

60
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,770
But that’s still 30%.

61
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,890
This is human nature.

62
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,370
Of course, if the consequences of your actions are in your face and you can see the pain,

63
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,230
you’re less likely to follow these orders.

64
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,400
But the numbers are still incredibly high.
