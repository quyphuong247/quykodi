In the 1950’s a single mother called Brownie Wise started working for the Tupperware company,

1
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:14,759
selling plastic containers for food storage.

2
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,570
Brownie Wise came up with a revolutionary idea.

3
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:22,940
Her idea was to get a range of people to host “Tupperware parties” for their friends,

4
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,880
relatives, neighbours, and work colleagues.

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,910
People go to these parties, and are shown a range of Tupperware products.

6
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,540
The host gets a cut of all of the sales sold by the representative at the party.

7
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,480
Everyone going to the party knows that.

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,370
They know that their friend is going to get some money if they buy something from the

9
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,370
representative.

10
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,229
So, they are kind of not only buying something for themselves, they’re also buying from

11
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:49,729
and for the host, who is their friend.

12
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:53,850
Not only that, their friend has arranged for the party, and spent money on food and time

13
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,850
organising it.

14
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:59,180
So, there is the obligation through reciprocation there too.

15
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,930
This was such a successful strategy that the Tupperware company now sells several millions

16
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,970
of dollars of product per day through their 1.9 million direct sales people.

17
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,050
There is actually a Tupperware party every 2.3 seconds around the world.

18
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:18,890
And the word “Tupperware” is often used as a generic label for plastic containers.

19
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:24,930
Cialdini found that our friendships and interpersonal liking can be a strong influence on how much

20
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,470
we are persuaded.

21
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,500
The idea is that we should be more willing to comply with the requests of friends or

22
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,310
other liked individuals.

23
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,370
Tupperware sales depend on these social factors that persuade us at an interpersonal level.

24
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:43,100
Outside of our friendship network, there are also people trying to persuade us who are

25
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,450
not our friends.

26
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,580
Luckily, for them at least, liking can also be generated in other ways and used to persuade

27
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,010
us.

28
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,659
Physical attractiveness is one way of creating liking.

29
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:58,450
We generally see physically attractive people as being more talented, more kind, honest,

30
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,090
and intelligent (Eagly et al., 1991).

31
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,000
Attractive people can be more persuasive at changing attitudes (Chaiken, 1979) and also

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,330
in getting our agreement with requests (Benson et al., 1976).

33
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:11,320
Similarity between ourselves and others also produces liking.

34
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,640
We like those who are similar to us (Byrne, 1971).

35
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,500
Some sales training programs urge trainees to “mirror and match” the customer’s

36
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:24,989
body posture, mood, and verbal style because this can lead to greater persuasion.

37
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:29,360
Similarity in dress also increases liking and persuasion (Emswiller et al., 1971).

38
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,719
Cooperation can also create positive feelings, similar to liking (Aronson et al., 1978).

39
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:38,180
This is partly why when the car dealer goes into battle with the manager of the car yard

40
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,060
on your behalf, you are more likely to buy the car.

41
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,980
Giving someone a compliment before asking them to do something can increase your chances

42
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,040
because compliments can also create liking (Byrne &amp; Rhamey, 1965).

43
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,480
This is the case even if we know the compliments are untrue, and we know that the praiser stands

44
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,389
to gain something by complimenting us (Drachman et al., 1978).

45
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:01,169
While I remember, have I told you yet how intelligent and good looking you must be if

46
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:02,790
you are taking this course?

47
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,760
Clearly you are very perceptive and smart.

48
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,919
Before I forget, would you be willing to write a positive review of this course?

49
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:12,469
It would really help get the word out to as many people as possible.
