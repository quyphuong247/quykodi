00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:10,830
We’ve talked about a number of reasons why the expression of emotions might be innate,

1
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,860
and evolutionarily important.

2
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,180
The argument is that our brains are hardwired to want to pull certain faces, but that&#39;s

3
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,160
not to say our culture can’t influence it.

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,850
In his Neurocultural theory, Paul Ekman argues that there are cultures in which you actively

5
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,650
inhibit what you might naturally do.

6
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,850
For example, if you see something disgusting, you will naturally pull a disgust expression.

7
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,079
In some cultures, however, it’s more appropriate to keep your disgust to yourself.

8
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,030
In his experiments, Ekman showed videos to people all around the world.

9
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,909
These videos were designed to illicit happiness, sadness, and disgust.

10
00:00:45,909 --> 00:00:51,510
All around the world, people pulled similar faces in response to the videos.

11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,350
Then in some of the experiments (Ekman, 1999), the experimenter would say to the participant,

12
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,660
&quot;Watch this video.

13
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,579
While you&#39;re watching this video, there&#39;ll be people behind this one-way mirror watching

14
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:02,579
you.

15
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,280
So, you&#39;ll feel as though you&#39;re being watched while you watch the videos.&quot;

16
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,260
 There were certain cultural differences that were observed across cultures.

17
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,700
Those in Japan, for example, were less likely to display disgust or anger.

18
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:21,210
There&#39;s a prevailing display rule or cultural norm in Japan to not display negative emotions

19
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,350
in public.

20
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,880
This norm is probably not as strong as it was in the past, but it&#39;s still there.

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,060
Emblems like &quot;come here,&quot; &quot;go away&quot; - this is how we communicate these from an Australian

22
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,690
perspective or Western perspective.

23
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,290
In many parts of the world, you flip it around.

24
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,630
If you want to say &quot;come here&quot; in Latin America and parts of Southeast Asia, you put your

25
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,030
palms down with fingers below the palm.

26
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:49,860
It looks a little bit like the &quot;shoo, go away&quot; gesture that is sometimes used in the West.

27
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,510
Now, that can cause a bit of miscommunication, can’t it?

28
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,000
Normally, people are pretty good at seeing the difference.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,020
They understand the cultural differences.

30
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,090
For example, this is George Bush in the slide doing this gesture.

31
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,560
The context here is during a talk at Texas university, where this is their symbol.

32
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,619
It&#39;s the Texas longhorn gesture.

33
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:12,290
It&#39;s cattle that they&#39;re referencing.

34
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,519
But in many parts of the world, that&#39;s got really insidious connotations - it means you

35
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:18,599
worship the devil.

36
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,439
What does this mean in other parts of the world?

37
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:24,370
In parts of Russia, I believe, this can kind of be an insult.

38
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,689
It&#39;s like &quot;Your wife is sleeping around on you.&quot;

39
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:28,560
It means this in Italy as well.

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,110
Actually, I don&#39;t know if people still do this anymore, but for a while in the &#39;80s

41
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,980
and &#39;90s in rock concerts, people would be, &quot;Yeah, rock on!&quot;

42
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,980
That was the &quot;rock on&quot; gesture because of a fleeting popularity of satanic rock bands

43
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,730
in the early &#39;80s, so people were doing this as a Satanic gesture.

44
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,280
Then, it just became a rock gesture.

45
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,030
Anyway, no one seriously would think that George Bush is advocating Satanism.

46
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,420
We can understand from the context.

47
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,959
Sometimes we don&#39;t do this so well, right?

48
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:01,629
This is Richard Nixon.

49
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:03,700
He was an American president back in the &#39;60s.

50
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:09,379
He was famous for this gesture, which sometimes means Peace, although in this case, he meant

51
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:10,549
victory.

52
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:11,590
These are two different connotations.

53
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,299
I&#39;m not going to talk about that.

54
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:18,349
I&#39;m going to talk about when he went to Central America at a time when there was incredibly

55
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:22,319
negative relations between the U.S. and Central America.

56
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,139
He was photographed everywhere doing this, which in the West is the &#39;A-okay&#39; gesture,

57
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:29,900
a reassuring gesture.

58
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,879
In many parts of Latin America, that&#39;s an incredibly offensive gesture.

59
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,269
It&#39;s meant to refer to the female genitalia.

60
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:40,040
It&#39;s a &quot;Screw you&quot; kind of gesture.

61
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,090
You can imagine the President of the United States splashed across the front pages of

62
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,900
newspapers doing that.

63
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,750
You can see that there&#39;s potential for miscommunication even with the most innocuous of gestures.

64
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,249
In many parts of the world, that&#39;s the equivalent of pulling the finger or flipping the bird

65
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:56,649
gestures.
