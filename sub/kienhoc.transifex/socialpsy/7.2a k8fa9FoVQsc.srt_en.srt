Where do stereotypes about men and women come from?

1
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:15,570
The very tempting answer is that these stereotypes exist because they are true.

2
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,740
This is the kernel of truth argument (LeVine &amp; Campbell, 1972).

3
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,880
Kernel means seed, suggesting that at their heart, these stereotypes are somewhat true

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,300
and based on reality.

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,710
For example, if you asked people to distinguish between various psychological traits––such

6
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:35,340
as aggression, helpfulness, talkativeness, and conformity––based on gender, their

7
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,329
estimates actually correspond closely to the differences found in research (Swim, 1994).

8
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:44,260
Just to be clear, I’m not saying that stereotypes are 100 percent true.

9
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,571
The kernel of truth argument is just saying that there’s a seed of truth, and that the

10
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:52,260
stereotype is a great exaggeration of that seed.

11
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,970
According to this view, it’s not like people are having a collective delusion about these

12
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:56,970
stereotypes.

13
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,340
It’s not like we’ve all just somehow collectively imagined this myth.

14
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,090
It’s based on something.

15
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,680
There are some stereotypes to which you might be able to point to a kernel of truth.

16
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,680
You might look at men and women and go…Well, maybe men and women actually do differ on

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,630
certain characteristics.

18
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,470
Maybe they differ on brain chemistry, hormones, childbirth, social roles.

19
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,070
Women traditionally have been at home looking after children, so they’ve had to develop

20
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,960
nurturing qualities.

21
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,860
Men traditionally have been the bread-winners, so they’ve had to develop competitive, ambitious

22
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,860
qualities.

23
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,950
So, maybe there are some kernels of truth that we could point to at any one time, but

24
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,540
there’s definitely limits to this explanation because there are certain things that are

25
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,030
in the stereotype that we just can’t find evidence for.

26
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,450
It’s a robust stereotype that women are kinder than men, that they’re more patient

27
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,450
than men.

28
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,980
There’s no evidence for this stereotype.

29
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,270
There is another stereotype that women collapse under pressure, and that they are not as rational

30
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,330
when making decisions compared to men when the pressure is on.

31
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:02,500
Research shows us that there are no gender differences in this, and yet this stereotype

32
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,500
exists.

33
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,170
Sometimes, characteristics that actually differ between men and women are not perceived in

34
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,009
their stereotypes.

35
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:14,409
One big difference between men and women is how much they move their body, particularly

36
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:16,400
when they’re talking.

37
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,470
Women move their body around more and are more animated when they talk compared to men.

38
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,510
But that’s not really what springs to mind when you think about the different stereotypes

39
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,140
between men and women.

40
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,250
Here’s another difference.

41
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,370
If you asked people...

42
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,620
“What do men talk about all the time when they’re together,” half the time people

43
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,980
will say that men love to talk about sex.

44
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,520
We know what men talk about when they’re together.

45
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,170
We know what women talk about together when they’re together.

46
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,650
Women talk about sex much more than men.

47
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,110
So, that’s the opposite of the stereotype.
