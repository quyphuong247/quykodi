00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:11,860
It is common to talk about high and low self-esteem as if they are two different types of people.

1
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,930
It is true that high and low self-esteem are really different people psychologically in

2
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:21,279
different ways but I need to emphasise that people are basically on a continuum.

3
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,390
Self-esteem scores are actually spread along the range, with lots of people in the middle.

4
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:31,630
So, what’s high or low self-esteem are relative.

5
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,890
We can understand pretty well what high self-esteem people are like, they think they are pretty

6
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,570
good, they want to succeed, they expect to succeed, they want others to like them, they

7
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,900
expect that and so on.

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,850
People with low self-esteem pose more of a puzzle to psychologists and researchers.

9
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,040
What is it that they want?

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,260
Do they want to confirm these negative views of themselves?

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,150
Do they want to fail?

12
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,881
Do they have fear of success?

13
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:58,710
Like, oh, if I become too good, everything will fall apart, people won’t like me.

14
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,900
Do they just not know what they want?

15
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,989
So, there are multiple theories about them.

16
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:09,430
Some people say that people with low self-esteem have self-loathing, they think they deserve

17
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,920
to suffer.

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,430
Others say they want to confirm their bad opinions of themselves, so, it’s about being

19
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,229
consistent, I think I’m bad so I just want confirmation or approval of that.

20
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,850
Over the years, researchers have studied this, the answer has gradually become clear and

21
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,380
I think there is an emerging consensus.

22
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,729
People with low self-esteem want pretty much the things people with high self-esteem want.

23
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:31,909
Their desires are the same.

24
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:32,909
They want to be loved.

25
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:34,479
They want to succeed.

26
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,399
But they don’t expect it as much.

27
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:40,090
People with high self-esteem kind of assume it will happen, they’re kind of shocked

28
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,090
when it doesn’t.

29
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,690
People with low self-esteem don’t really think it’s going to happen, to be loved

30
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:49,590
to be successful, and when it does they’re sometimes a little sceptical, like this might

31
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,219
be too good to be true.

32
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:55,619
They don’t expect success, so their orientation is a little different.

33
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,600
Without, they tend to be more focused on avoiding disaster than on achieving success.

34
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,520
So, low self-esteem gets to be kind of a muddling through mentality.

35
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,399
Remember, there are not very many people who have the extremely low views of themselves,

36
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:16,610
we’re talking instead of the people who have people who might be called intermediate

37
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,610
self-esteem.

38
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,850
There are two kinds, there are the people that are really convinced with favourable

39
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:28,200
views of themselves, and others who are in the middle of the scale, mixed, uncertain,

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
tentative.

41
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,990
Researcher Campbell (Jennifer Campbell) built this into a major theory about low self-esteem.

42
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:37,150
She called it ‘self-concept confusion’, that people just don’t know themselves,

43
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,280
people with low self-esteem.

44
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,590
So, you could put it this way, high self-esteem is the presence of a belief that I am great;

45
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,310
low self-esteem is not the presence of the belief that I am terrible, it’s just the

46
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,850
absence of the view that I’m great.

47
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,900
If you look at what people with low self-esteem are actually saying on the self-esteem scale,

48
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,120
they’re not saying “I’m a terrible person, I’m awful”.

49
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,480
Rather, they’re saying “I’m not sure, I’m somewhat good to some extent, partly

50
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,940
good, partly bad, sometimes this, sometimes they’ll change their minds, contradict themselves,

51
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,430
if you give them an “I don’t know” option when you ask them about themselves, they checked

52
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,780
that option more.

53
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:21,320
So, in general there’s this pattern, people with low self-esteem are more likely to say

54
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,190
I’m not sure, I don’t know.

55
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:31,510
It’s more of a garbled self-concept than a clear view of one self as a bad person.

56
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,620
So, low self-esteem has this confusion aspect.

57
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,720
They’re more oriented toward protecting themselves from failure than toward trying

58
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,180
to achieve success.

59
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,820
Now of course when you take a test, achieving success is the same as avoiding failure, you

60
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,100
try to get the right answers to the test.

61
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,220
But sometimes you have a choice between protecting and enhancing.

62
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,911
I remember walking across one of those town squares, I think it was in Amsterdam, with

63
00:03:56,911 --> 00:03:59,180
a woman who had somewhat low self-esteem.

64
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,910
People were out on the square, they have those giant chess sets

65
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:07,740
with great big pieces that were as high as a person and the board is built into the ground.

66
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,530
People move the pieces around and so on.

67
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,890
I paused to watch them for a while, and finally she said “Why would anyone do this, play

68
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,269
chess out in public?”

69
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:21,370
I said “C’mon, it’s fascinating, you go over there you play chess against a stranger,

70
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,190
try out your skills, it’s kind of exciting.”

71
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,310
But, her view was “Yeah, but you could look like such an idiot.”

72
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,310
Well, that’s the low self-esteem response, I don’t want to go out and take a chance

73
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,760
to perform in front of others, because I could look like a fool.

74
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,280
The low self-esteem goal is to protect yourself, don’t take the chance.

75
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,840
The high self-esteem response is “Oh look, I’m going to try it, I’m not going to

76
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,340
worry about failure because I don’t usually fail, this will be a chance to achieve some

77
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,810
new glory.

78
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:52,340
So, calling attention to yourself, taking chances and so on, these are the things that

79
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,470
the low self-esteem person tries to avoid.

80
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,830
They are much more easily persuaded by other people’s arguments.

81
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:04,040
They do what other people tell them, they are more gullible.

82
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,180
High self-esteem people not so much, even when they’re given good advice.

83
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,000
They have more confidence in their own judgement.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,900
And as I said, people with low self-esteem give up a little more in the face of failure.
