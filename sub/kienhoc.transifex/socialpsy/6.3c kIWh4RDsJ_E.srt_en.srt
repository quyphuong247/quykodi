00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:11,599
So, we can use the principle of consistency as a strategy to influence others, but there

1
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,110
are a couple of variations of this principle to be aware of.

2
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:20,429
The first of these is called “Bait and switch”, and the idea is that you give people an inducement

3
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:24,630
to encourage a commitment, and then once they are committed to a particular decision or

4
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,830
behaviour, you take away the inducement that made them commit in the first place.

5
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:35,530
However, they still feel pressured to be  consistent to their initial commitment.

6
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,240
For example, a retailer might advertise an item at a very good price.

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,059
What they don’t tell you however, is there are only a small number of these items in

8
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:46,460
stock, or perhaps they’ve already sold out.

9
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,820
So, when you go to the store you find that you can’t buy the item that you saw advertised.

10
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,989
What you will find however, are other items that are similar to the one that you came

11
00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:00,679
to buy, but these items cost more.

12
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:04,780
Because of the consistency principle, we are more likely to purchase these other more expensive

13
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,090
items (Joule et al., 1989).

14
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,180
This is a common strategy used with toys at Christmas time, particularly very popular

15
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,670
toys.

16
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,570
A second variation of the consistency technique is called “Low balling”, and like bait

17
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:21,500
and switch, this also involves an inducement and getting a commitment to make a decision

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,770
or behaviour but then increasing the costs of performing the action which then pressures

19
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,619
the individual to be consistent with a commitment (Cialdini et al., 1978).

20
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:34,049
So, you might advertise a product for a great price, but then once the buyer is committed

21
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,640
to the purchase, you reveal additional hidden costs.

22
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,610
Cialdini saw examples of low balling in use when he worked as a used car salesman.

23
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,270
He noticed that the owner of the car yard systematically underpriced the cars by about

24
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:52,210
$400, so the cars were cheap and people would be attracted to the cars because they were

25
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,210
cheap.

26
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,390
If you are the buyer, you’d be like, [Buyer]: “Yes, I think I’m happy to buy this,”

27
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,180
and the salesperson would say, [Salesperson]: “That’s great.

28
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,060
That’s fantastic, but let’s not seal the deal now.

29
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,450
It’s been a long day.

30
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,680
Why don’t we do the paperwork tomorrow?

31
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,971
In the meantime, take the car home.

32
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:10,750
Just drive it around, show your family and friends.

33
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,390
Then come back, and we’ll do the paperwork.”

34
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,890
This may not happen anymore so much, but let’s not forget it was 1978.

35
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,670
So, you’ll drive it home and you’re like, “Yes, that was awesome.

36
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,680
I kind of like this cheap car,” but, remember, if you’re like most humans, what you’re

37
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,790
doing is rationalising the decision.

38
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,070
You’re generating all these other reasons why that was a great decision.

39
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:39,411
It’s not just because it was cheap; it handles well; it sounds good, it smells good; whatever

40
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:41,690
reason you came up with to like the car.

41
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:46,480
So, now you’re thinking this is great, and then you come back, and the salesperson comes

42
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,920
out, and they’ll look really embarrassed, and they’re like [Salesperson]: “You know

43
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,920
what?

44
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,590
I thought I could sell it to you for that price.

45
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,830
I thought the insurance is part of the bundle but it turns out it wasn’t, and you can

46
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,320
still have the car, it’s just going to be $400 more.

47
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,400
I hope that’s okay,” or they’ll say: “I took it to the boss, and the boss freaked

48
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,520
out, he said you can’t possibly sell it for that price.

49
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,670
We’ll make a loss.

50
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,400
You can still have it, but it’s going to cost $400 more.”

51
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Or maybe the trade-in price is disallowed by the used-car assessor, or there is a calculation

52
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,440
error for the final price.

53
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,840
Whatever the story, the car now costs more.

54
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,550
Now what should you do as the buyer at that point?

55
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,370
You should walk away.

56
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,450
Why?

57
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,670
Because that was the reason you wanted to but the car in the first place: because it

58
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,810
was $400 cheaper than the market price.

59
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,900
That one reason has been taken away from you, and yet Cialdini would see that people would

60
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,290
inevitably go through with the deal because they had generated all these other reasons

61
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,970
why that was a good thing to do.
