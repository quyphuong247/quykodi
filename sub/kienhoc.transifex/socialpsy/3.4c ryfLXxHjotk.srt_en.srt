We did find a couple of things in our search for the benefits of self-esteem.

1
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,390
Higher self-esteem seems to bolster initiative.

2
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,480
Basically, people with high self-esteem think they are right they think they know what’s

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,420
what and so they are more likely to act on what they think.

4
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,750
They have more confidence in their views, their opinions, their plans.

5
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,400
This is true even when they are wrong.

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,261
Somebody who is pig headed and going to go down the wrong direction and not listen to

7
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:38,140
anybody- well that is a person with high self-esteem too.

8
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,920
But in general, I think initiative is a good thing.

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,930
So that is one genuine benefit of high self-esteem.

10
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:49,410
People with low self-esteem in contrast they just don’t have the same faith in themselves

11
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,160
They’re not sure, they’re not confident they don’t know they’re right, they’ll

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,140
do what other people tell them, they’ll have trouble making up their mind what to

13
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,390
do in the first place, they’re full of self-doubts.

14
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,150
People with high self-esteem think they typically know what’s right.

15
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,520
And for better or worse, but again I think mostly for better.

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,460
Hence they act on what they think is best.

17
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,360
They’re more willing to try again if they fail and they’re more willing to reject

18
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,820
somebody else telling them what to do if they’re part of a group and they think the group is

19
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,960
doing the wrong thing.

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,380
They’re more willing to speak up - even though everyone else is saying let’s do

21
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,040
this - the high self-esteem person is more willing to say, no, I think this is wrong,

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,010
we should do something else, low self-esteem will keep their mouth shut.

23
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:35,060
So, bottom line initiative was one of the few advantages of self-esteem that emerged.
