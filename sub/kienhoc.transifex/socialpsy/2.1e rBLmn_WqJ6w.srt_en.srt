00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,930
Not all hand gestures are emblems.

1
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,280
You&#39;ll notice that occasionally, I wave my hands around while I&#39;m talking.

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,850
If you turn the sound down on my voice, this would mean nothing in its own right.

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,610
My hand gestures actually don&#39;t say anything.

4
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:25,190
Their job, partly, is to amplify the message to a big audience, or to communicate how I&#39;m

5
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,869
feeling about what I&#39;m saying.

6
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,030
These things are called illustrators.

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,040
In some cultures, they&#39;re much bigger on this than others.

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,050
People catalogue these things.

9
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,330
They&#39;ve got dictionaries of these illustrators.

10
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,840
This is called the &quot;hand purse.&quot;

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,590
This is the &quot;air grasp.&quot;

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,630
All these things tend to be things that people do in big speeches when they&#39;re trying to

13
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,149
communicate a particular passion and intensity about stuff.

14
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:55,590
There’s the finger stab when you’re talking to someone, try not to do that, this is something

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,210
that men do more than women.

16
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,309
The finger stab of course communicates that you are in a massively high powered role there

17
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:03,020
and that you are angry.

18
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,421
I remember seeing this discussion between someone who I presumed was the owner of the

19
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:09,270
cafe and someone who was a waitress at the cafe.

20
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,180
I couldn’t hear what they were saying, but it was pretty obvious.

21
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,790
It was animated.

22
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:18,070
The two things that really stood out was that as he was talking to her, he was holding her

23
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,140
by the arm.

24
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,409
He was touching her.

25
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:23,530
This is something that people with power over other people do.

26
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,830
He was also doing the &quot;finger stab&quot; as he was talking.

27
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,540
Now, this is the nonverbal equivalent of screaming at someone.

28
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,430
It’s very powerful.

29
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:37,280
Illustrators can also be something you can use to help you speak more fluently.

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,460
I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever done this task where you have to sit on your hands and stay

31
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,560
really still while you tell a complicated anecdote or a complicated story, you&#39;re trying

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,850
to explain something.

33
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,920
What you find (Frick-Horbury &amp; Guttentag, 1988) is that it&#39;s just a little bit harder

34
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,380
to communicate what you&#39;re trying to say if you can&#39;t wiggle about and move.

35
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,459
On some unconscious level, the hand gestures are ways of organizing your thinking, as well,

36
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:04,930
which is presumably why we still do it if we&#39;re talking on the phone.

37
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,360
No one can see all the hand waving, but you&#39;re still doing it to yourself.

38
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,110
It just helps you.
