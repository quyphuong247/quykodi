0
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,069
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s ever happened to

1
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:10,260
you but I know someone let&#39;s say a

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,110
friend of mine who spent 400 dollars on

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,790
skincare products that they didn&#39;t want

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,770
because an attractive salesperson

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,500
persuaded them to buy it and they just

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,350
couldn&#39;t say no to them so how does this

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,190
happen well we often think of ourselves

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,310
as perfectly rational and that we&#39;re

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,140
only going to be persuaded by a

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,669
well-thought-out message

11
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:34,950
it turns out that we are persuaded by a

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,350
range of factors in addition to the

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,420
content of the persuasive messages that

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,969
we receive a collection of studies

15
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:43,859
sometimes referred to as the Yale

16
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:45,600
studies because they are conducted at

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,850
yale university in the United States of

18
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,640
America examined have four types of

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,030
factors might influence us those studies

20
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,190
looked at audience related factors such

21
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,449
as self-esteem

22
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,179
gender &amp; age channel related factors

23
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:02,100
such as whether the message is given in

24
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,979
print form in person or by video

25
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,430
communicator related factors such as how

26
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,100
attractive the communicator is and

27
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,020
whether the communicator is credible or

28
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,680
not

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,579
and finally message related factors such

30
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:19,590
as whether the message uses fear or not

31
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,369
we will focus on the last two messages

32
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:30,590
related and communicator related factors
