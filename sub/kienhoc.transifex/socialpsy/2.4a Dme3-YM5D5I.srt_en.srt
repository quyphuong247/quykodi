00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:11,269
So, can you tell from people&#39;s nonverbals whether people are lying?

1
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:12,540
People think that they’re good at it.

2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,550
Now, if I just had my hair cut and I said, “What do you think?”

3
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,310
And you go, “Yes, yes, it looks really good”.

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,890
Would that sound like a lie or would it sound genuine?

5
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,880
As opposed to, “Yes, yes, it looks really good.”

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,680
Which sounded like the lie?

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,909
Maybe the first one?

8
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:34,270
Perhaps because the high-pitched voice?

9
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,370
This is something actually that people do when they&#39;re lying, partly because when we

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,220
lie, we worry that people will catch us lying, and it makes us stressed.

11
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,220
Unless you&#39;re a psychopath, you get stressed when you lie.

12
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:51,240
As a result of stress, your vocal chords constrict, and the pitch of your voice goes up.

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,550
In that case, it&#39;s probably also because we&#39;re trying to be positive, and then you overcook

14
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,100
it—when you’re trying to be super positive, it can be too much.

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,810
Now, we have a tendency to rely on nonverbal cues.

16
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,759
So why do we trust nonverbals?

17
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:07,420
It&#39;s because we think that people lie through their words.

18
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,280
In fact, they do.

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,359
Now people lie all the time, mostly for nice reasons, mostly because they&#39;re being polite,

20
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,530
or they&#39;re trying to smooth over a difficult situation.

21
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,430
It&#39;s just part of life.

22
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,430
We do it a lot.

23
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,610
But it’s harder to control nonverbal behaviour, so sometimes that doesn’t match the lie

24
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,610
we’re telling.

25
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,139
That’s why we pay attention to them.

26
00:01:30,139 --> 00:01:34,090
Given that we lie a lot, if you can detect when people are doing it, then it gives you

27
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,159
a social advantage.
