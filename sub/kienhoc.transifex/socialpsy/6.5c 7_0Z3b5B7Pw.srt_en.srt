0
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,960
Now one thing that I actually forgot to mention, is they’re not actually getting the shocks.

1
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,950
So, the learner is a confederate, they’re not really in pain.

2
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,789
But that doesn’t matter because the teacher doesn’t know that.

3
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:21,790
The teacher thinks that they’re giving potential lethal shocks to a stranger.

4
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,822
Before they did the study, they went to the experts and said, “How many people do you

5
00:00:25,822 --> 00:00:27,000
think are going to go all the way?”

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,230
They were like, “I bet you no one, like 1 in 1,000, like the sadists, the freaks,

7
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:33,609
the psychos.”

8
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:36,510
Well that wasn’t the case at all.

9
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,350
All the people went to the intense shock level, and nearly two-thirds of people went all the

10
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,610
way.

11
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:47,559
You might be looking at this going, “That’s kind of a horrible reflection of human nature.

12
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:49,880
Does that mean that most humans are actually psychos?

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,480
We’re not nice people?

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,840
We’re sadistic?”

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,530
Well, that wasn’t the conclusion at all that Milgram came to.

16
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,829
Instead, he reported how upset and distressed the participants became.

17
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:06,200
He said he observed one mature and initially poised businessman enter the lab smiling and

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,820
confident, but within 20 minutes he was reduced to a twitching, stuttering wreck.

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,320
He was approaching a point of nervous collapse.

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,829
He constantly pulled on his earlobe and twisted his hands, at one point pushed his fist into

21
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,479
his forehead and muttered, “God, let’s stop it!”

22
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,020
Yet he continued to respond to every word of the experimenter and obeyed until the end.

23
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,539
There is footage of people crying doing this experiment.

24
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:33,490
They’re not giving potentially lethal shocks to strangers because they’re horrible sadistic

25
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,490
people.

26
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,599
They’re doing it because they’re nice people.

27
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,780
They’re doing it because they’re polite people, and they find it hard to say no to

28
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,540
the authority figure in the white lab coat.

29
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,609
This experiment had a massive impact all around the world because people were trying to make

30
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:49,359
sense of the Holocaust.

31
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,219
How can it be that a whole nation of people conspired in the murder of millions and millions

32
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:58,359
of people, identified by the Nazi’s as being Jewish, homosexual or disabled?

33
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:01,979
The standard explanation was, “Well, the Nazis are evil.

34
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,310
It’s the evil gene.”

35
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:07,889
That’s all you kind of needed to know: They thought that Germany was a nation full of

36
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:10,039
morally corrupt people.

37
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:15,400
What Milgram is trying to say is, “No, we all have the capacity to behave in evil ways

38
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,760
if the situation demands it.”

39
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,990
The author C.P. Snow said, “When you think of the long and gloomy history of man, you’ll

40
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,680
find more hideous crimes have been committed in the name of obedience than in the name

41
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,099
of rebellion.”

42
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:30,819
This is the kind of stuff he’s talking about.
