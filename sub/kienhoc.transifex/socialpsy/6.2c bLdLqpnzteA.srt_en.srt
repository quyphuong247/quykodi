0
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:11,080
So, we can influence people by giving them something, and then asking them for something

1
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,620
in return.

2
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,910
But what if we don’t have anything to give them, or it’s not normal or appropriate

3
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,040
to give a gift in this context?

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, we can still use the principle of reciprocation to get people to do what we want.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,519
Rather than give them a gift, we give them a concession, and then ask for a concession

6
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,109
from them.

7
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,870
This variation of the rule for reciprocation is also called the door in the face technique.

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,079
The idea here is to start with an extreme request that you fully expect to be rejected

9
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,400
because it is unreasonable.

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,460
 When you inevitably get rejected, you retreat to a more moderate request.

11
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,120
This second request is the request that you wanted to make all along.

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,090
The concession that you have made by falling back to this more moderate request is what

13
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,920
creates the pressure on the other person to make a reciprocal concession to you.

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,860
The only concession they can really make is to agree to your second request.

15
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,090
This happens in negotiation situations.

16
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:15,440
Think about an employee union negotiating about employment conditions with a company’s

17
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,479
management.

18
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,440
The union and the management representatives don’t just make their demands about what

19
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,079
they actually want.

20
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,560
They come out with a ridiculously big demand which they know very well is unfair and understand

21
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,200
very well it’s never going to be met.

22
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,799
The unions might go, “Well, we want 50 percent pay increases for everyone, and everyone should

23
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,869
get back rubs and have a company car.”

24
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:43,870
Then the management will be like, “No no no, we’ll give you a 50 percent pay cut,

25
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,090
and you’ll have to work weekends for no pay and eat bread and dripping for lunch.”

26
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,600
So why would you bother?

27
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,370
Why would you bother starting at a level which you know is never going to get met?

28
00:01:55,370 --> 00:02:00,729
This is an example of an ambit claim or Blue Sky demand, where a ridiculous demand is made

29
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:04,900
first, with the expectation of future compromise.

30
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,070
The reason is psychological, of course, because when you start up here and then you make a

31
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:14,440
concession from that ridiculously high point, you can make a big song and dance about: “Well,

32
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,610
now I”ve made this concession to you.”

33
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,910
Now the moral pressure is on the other person to make a concession as well.

34
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,580
This is often how high level conflicts can be defused.

35
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,000
One side makes a concession, which puts pressure on the other side to do the same.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So why does this work?

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,160
Part of the reason that it works is because humans are better at making relative judgments

38
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,440
than absolute judgments.

39
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,690
When preceded by a very large request, subsequent requests seem more reasonable.
