00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:09,410
So, let’s take a look at what Regan found.

1
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,769
On the y-axis, we have the average number of tickets bought by the participants.

2
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:17,650
On the x-axis, the three different favour conditions - when the confederate does the

3
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,320
participant a favour and buys a drink for them, when the confederate doesn’t buy a

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,000
drink, so there’s no favour.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,840
And the final control condition, which was when the experimenter is the one who gives

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,920
the participant the drink.

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,680
What about the manipulation of how nice the confederate was?

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,100
Well, you can’t see it on the graph because the pleasantness of the confederate actually

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,930
made no difference to these results.

10
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,090
So, I’ve left it off to keep things simple.

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,870
As you can see on this graph, people who had received the soft drink from the confederate

12
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,840
bought more raffle tickets.

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,250
Actually, participants who had been given the soft drink bought twice as many raffle

14
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,220
tickets than did the other participants.

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,890
And it wasn’t about just receiving a soft drink from anyone that made them buy more

16
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,100
tickets.

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,780
When they got a drink from the experimenter, it didn’t make them more likely to buy the

18
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,370
raffle tickets from the confederate.

19
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,320
Now, why do you think they did this?

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,620
You might be thinking, “Well, that is obvious because someone does something nice for you,

21
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,850
you like them more.

22
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,690
You want to do nice things for people you like.”

23
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:21,930
The curious thing is the experimenter actually asked people how much they liked the confederate.

24
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,040
Some people liked the confederate a lot.

25
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,030
Some people not so much.

26
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:30,560
But there was no relationship between how much people liked the confederate and how

27
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,450
much they spent on the raffle tickets.

28
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,710
Whatever’s going on here, it’s not about liking.

29
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:41,120
So now, let’s talk about a study by Berry and Kanouse in 1987.

30
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,740
In their study, liking is probably not going to be a factor.

31
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:49,600
They got compliance through reciprocation without even being there in person.

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,409
In this study, they mailed physicians a long questionnaire that was somewhat onerous to

33
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:55,909
complete.

34
00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:01,460
In one condition, they included a $20 cheque as a gift with the questionnaires, and in

35
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:07,020
another they said that a $20 cheque would be mailed upon completion of the questionnaire.

36
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,869
This was their payment manipulation.

37
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,790
The financial outcome for participants was largely the same.

38
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,670
If the participants completed the questionnaire, they received $20 in either condition.

39
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:23,650
However, the meaning of the $20 differed between the two conditions.

40
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:29,410
In the first condition, it was a gift, and as a gift it was to be kept whether the participants

41
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,780
chose to complete the survey or not.

42
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:38,430
In the second condition, it was a reward, or compensation for completing the survey.

43
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,830
So, which condition produced the greatest compliance with the request to complete the

44
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,830
survey?

45
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,800
Well, On the y-axis, we have the percentage of physicians who completed and returned the

46
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,470
surveys.

47
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,740
On the x-axis, we have the two conditions for the payment manipulation… those who

48
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:00,560
received the $20 as a gift, and those who received the $20 on completion.

49
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,700
As you can see here, when the physicians received the $20 as a gift, 78% of them filled it out

50
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,260
and sent it back.

51
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:15,300
However, when they received the $20 on completion, only 66% of them returned the questionnaire.

52
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:22,390
Interestingly, of those receiving the “gift” $20 cheque, 95% who completed the questionnaire

53
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,690
cashed the cheque.

54
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:28,040
Only 26% who did not complete the questionnaire cashed the cheque.

55
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:35,090
So, most people were honest and only cashed the gift cheque if they actually did the survey.

56
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,569
This norm can be easily exploited by people who want to elicit donations or who want to

57
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:41,080
sell you things.

58
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,220
Can you think of examples where this is exploited, when people give things and then ask for things

59
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:45,940
in return?
