0
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:11,610
So, traditional forms of persuasion go something like this: To change someone’s attitude,

1
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,550
and so their behaviour, we first have to give them a strong persuasive message, that is

2
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:22,260
possibly associated with some positive cues, such as an attractive or credible communicator.

3
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,669
We see this in models such as McGuire’s (1969) chain of persuasion.

4
00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:29,529
For a message to be effective, the person we are trying to persuade has to listen to

5
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:35,270
it, they have to understand it, and then accept it before remembering it and translating it

6
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,270
into behaviour.

7
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,350
Brock’s (1967) model of cognitive response analysis makes a similar point.

8
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,350
According to this perspective, a persuasive message, and the things that are associated

9
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,420
with it, are the focus of elaborative thoughts.

10
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,010
Now elaborative thoughts are essentially whether we think favourably or not about the message.

11
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,720
It’s those thoughts that lead to attitude change.

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,670
This is similar to the elaboration likelihood model (Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986) that we talked

13
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,930
about in the attitudes topic.

14
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,770
According to these dual process models, attitude change happens when we think about the message,

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,220
at least under some conditions.

16
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,040
Under others it’s also about shortcuts that suggest that the message is correct or something

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,520
that we should be persuaded by.

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,600
  There are other ways that we’re influenced

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,799
that don’t rely on a persuasive message, explicitly.

20
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,909
And it is possible to influence people without them needing to engage in elaborative thought.

21
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:31,030
It’s even possible to persuade people to do something even though they might not have

22
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,979
a positive attitude about that behaviour at all.

23
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:36,729
What we are talking about is called compliance.

24
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:41,590
Which means agreeing to a request from someone who does not have the authority to make you

25
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,020
obey.

26
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,210
How we can do that is described in a set of principles of compliance by Robert Cialdini

27
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,210
(2007).

28
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:56,350
He identified six principles: reciprocation, consistency, social validation, liking, scarcity,

29
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,740
and authority.

30
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,039
Robert Cialdini is a social psychologist, and he decided that the best way to find out

31
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:07,529
about persuasion techniques was to go undercover and infiltrate a number of different sales-related

32
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:11,640
professions that rely on gaining compliance from people.

33
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:18,830
He focussed on salespeople, advertisers, real estate agents, negotiators, and even con artists.

34
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,700
His thinking was that people working in these professions develop powerful persuasion techniques

35
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,940
through a process of natural selection.

36
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,140
He thought that because these compliance professionals depend on their ability to persuade others

37
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:36,470
for their livelihood, those who use successful techniques will stay in business.

38
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:42,230
The most adaptive compliance techniques will, over time, develop and persist in these compliance-based

39
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,230
professions.

40
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,840
So, we are going to be talking about the strategies that you can use to maximise the chances of

41
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,820
getting people to say yes.

42
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,250
The reason most of these strategies work is because they make use of powerful social rules

43
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,390
that govern our behaviour.
