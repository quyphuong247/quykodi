00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,511
How much of the meaning that we communicate comes from the words we say compared to the

1
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,100
other things, the nonverbal things?

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,740
This is a difficult question to answer.

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:20,840
Some people think that the answer is about 93% - with 53% of the information coming from

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:27,259
the face, another 38% from the voice, and only 7% from the words themselves.

5
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:28,789
This is quite a common belief.

6
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:33,350
Mehrabian’s (1972) work has been criticised though for the way the studies were conducted;

7
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:38,329
they were pretty artificial and didn’t recreate how we really communicate.

8
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,910
Michael Argyle (1988) tried to improve on those studies and suggested that nonverbal

9
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,350
communication was 4.3 times as powerful as verbal communication - so that’s still around

10
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,350
81%.

11
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:54,890
Hsee and his colleagues suggested that nonverbal communication was also about 4 times as powerful,

12
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,340
or about 80% of the message (Hsee, Hatfield &amp; Chemtob, 1992).

13
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,580
Part of the reason why these numbers might be so high is because participants are guessing

14
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,950
what the experimenter wants them to do.

15
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:07,420
Trimboli and Walker (1987) showed that when you hide the true purpose of the study from

16
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,360
participants, the overwhelming effect of nonverbal communication goes away.

17
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,509
Our best guess, according to authors such as Burgoon, Guerrero and Floyd (2016), is

18
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:23,010
about sixty to sixty-six percent of meaning is communicated through things other than

19
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,349
words.

20
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:26,100
  That number is going to go up or down depending

21
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,630
on the context.

22
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,280
If you&#39;re trying to make an assessment of someone&#39;s leadership ability, for example,

23
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,569
whether someone has integrity, you tend to focus on the nonverbal, even if you&#39;re not

24
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:39,299
really aware of doing it, and that&#39;s for a good reason.

25
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,520
If you hear a politician speak on an election campaign, you know that their words have been

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,880
carefully scripted.

27
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,280
The words have been carefully crafted.

28
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,509
After a while, we start to look beyond those words, and we start to look at things that

29
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,429
we presume they can&#39;t control so well.

30
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:57,109
We look at whether their eye contact looks meaningful.

31
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:59,249
We look at the way they hold the baby.

32
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:03,600
We look at whether they sweat—all these little subtle cues of whether someone&#39;s got

33
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,740
integrity, they can be trusted, and we rely on them.

34
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:12,040
When the verbal and nonverbal channels are in conflict, the role or importance of nonverbals

35
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,250
often tends to go up.

36
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,520
  Person 1: “Are you mad about something?”

37
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,550
Person 2: “No!

38
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,580
I’m perfectly happy!”

39
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,209
Person 1: “Ok, just asking.”

40
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:23,409
Blake: The interaction that you just watched perfectly illustrates the point I&#39;m making

41
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:24,409
here.

42
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:28,939
Here, the second person’s verbal and nonverbal channels are totally in conflict.

43
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:31,670
Verbally, she&#39;s saying she&#39;s not angry.

44
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:37,010
Nonverbally, she&#39;s suggesting that maybe she is, but there&#39;s no doubt in your mind which

45
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,280
one you trust at this point.

46
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,299
You know that she&#39;s angry.

47
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:44,120
Again, we have this sense that people lie through their words.

48
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,599
After a while, we look beyond the words.

49
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:51,189
We focus on things that we feel as though people are not as good at lying through, that

50
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:54,599
the real juicy stuff is found in the nonverbals.

51
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,750
It&#39;s also probably true for humans that we sometimes let our nonverbals do the talking

52
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:03,420
for us because we live in a fairly non-assertive, polite world.

53
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,569
You probably go through life without ever saying certain things that you&#39;re thinking.

54
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:12,110
You can go through life without ever saying, &quot;Look, you&#39;re kind of boring me now.

55
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:18,989
I want to talk to someone else,&quot; or &quot;You smell&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t love you anymore.&quot;

56
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:23,379
You might think these things but you might try not say it.

57
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:28,450
What you might do is you say nothing, but you kind of beam out these vibes through your

58
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,659
nonverbals, and you hope that people get it.

59
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,599
That&#39;s how a lot of communication happens.

60
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:37,549
Now, it could well be that the person in the interaction you just watched wanted the other

61
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:42,260
person to notice that she was angry, but for whatever reason she just didn&#39;t feel like

62
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,030
she could say it.

63
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:50,829
If you ask somebody out on a date and they say, &quot;Yes, yes, that sounds good,&quot; but they

64
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:54,450
sound disinterested, you&#39;re probably going to weigh that fairly heavily in working out

65
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,940
whether that person is really into you or not.

66
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,629
Or at least you probably should.

67
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:02,520
Young children place slightly more reliance on words (Liebal, Carpenter &amp; Tomasello, 2011).

68
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,920
Babies start off pretty hopeless, right?

69
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,519
If you&#39;ve ever seen babies, they just don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing.

70
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,870
They don&#39;t even know that these hands flying all over their face are their hands.

71
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,220
They have no idea.

72
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,079
Then within two years, they&#39;ve got this precocious semi-mastery of language.

73
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,940
Their capacity to absorb language is phenomenal.

74
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,910
It takes a little bit longer to be able to understand the subtleties of their language.

75
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,470
That&#39;s something that adults tend to be good at.

76
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,430
The fact that children are a bit more literal—they focus on the words—can cause problems when

77
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,610
adults are talking to them, because quite often we purposely bend the meaning of what

78
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,710
we&#39;re saying through our nonverbals or through our tone.

79
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,510
If you think about sarcasm—what is sarcasm, when you actually break it down?

80
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,319
Sarcasm is where you say something positive through the verbal channel, but through the

81
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:53,300
nonverbal channel—through the tone—you indicate that you actually mean something

82
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,699
negative.

83
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:58,380
Usually adults are pretty good at picking up on sarcasm, so long as you&#39;re not trying

84
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,970
to do it over email or anything.

85
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:04,289
Interpersonally, we&#39;re pretty good, but kids, less so.

86
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:07,070
The opposite of this is good-natured teasing.

87
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,849
You say something negative through the verbal channel, but you actually indicate, through

88
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:15,310
the nonverbal channel, that you&#39;re actually very affectionate towards that person.

89
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,930
It&#39;s a hard one to pull off.

90
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,190
You don&#39;t want to mess it up.

91
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,700
In some cultures, nicknames become more and more offensive and cruel when people like

92
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,430
each other the most.

93
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,960
Also, we rely on verbal and nonverbal channels differently depending on what we&#39;re trying

94
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,169
to get out of a situation.

95
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:36,840
In this context, where I am talking to you about academic content, you might be dimly

96
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,160
aware of me waving my hands around, but you&#39;re probably not going to focus on that, that

97
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,430
much.

98
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,990
What you&#39;re really here for is facts, and words are the best things to communicate facts.

99
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,930
But Riggio (1992) makes the point that in a social context, we focus more on the nonverbal.

100
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:58,560
If what you really want to know is, &quot;Does this person like me?&quot; or &quot;Is this person bored?&quot;

101
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,380
in this context, you&#39;re probably going to focus a lot more on the nonverbals.
