00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
So now that you&#39;ve got your head around

1
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,940
dissonance theory,

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,260
let&#39;s talk about a couple of final

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,150
studies to reinforce the ideas

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,940
underlying the theory. The first study I wanted

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,039
to focus on is one by Philip Zimbardo

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,060
and his colleagues from 1965. This study

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,830
is sometimes called The Grasshopper

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,050
Study. You&#39;ll see why in a second.

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,510
In this study participants, some of whom

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,429
were army recruits, were asked to

11
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,410
indicate their attitudes towards eating

12
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,540
a wide variety of different foods on a

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,000
survey. One of these just so happened to

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,030
be fried grasshoppers. After the survey

15
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,100
was completed the experiment asked the

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,050
participants if they&#39;d be willing to eat

17
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,320
fried grasshopper. Now it&#39;s worth knowing

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,120
that these were from a tin and were

19
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,280
unappealing - as it was slimy and

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,390
disgusting.

21
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,270
The experimenter was either treating his

22
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,210
assistant nicely or meanly telling him

23
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,550
off the minor mistakes and badgering him.

24
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,070
Finally the experimenter asked the people

25
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,320
who actually ate a fried grasshopper, how

26
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,740
much they enjoyed their little snack. Now I

27
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,420
can tell you that about half of the

28
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,979
recruits agreed to eat a fried

29
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,010
grasshopper. Of these participants, who do

30
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,720
you think said they enjoyed eating the

31
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,210
grasshopper the most? Was it the people

32
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,070
who were asked by the nice experimenter?

33
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,920
Or was it the people who are asked by

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,250
the mean experimenter? Let&#39;s take a look.

35
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,829
So again, on the y axis, we have the

36
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:30,840
amount of attitude change, and on the

37
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,670
x-axis, we have the two conditions -

38
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,880
whether the experimenter was nice or mean

39
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,950
to his assistant.

40
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,380
Well, the people who were asked by the

41
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,240
nice experimenter to eat the fried

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,920
grasshopper didn&#39;t change their

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,540
attitudes about eating fried

44
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,520
grasshoppers at all really.

45
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,009
It turns out the participants asked by

46
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,170
the mean experimenter were the ones who

47
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,610
ended up having the most positive

48
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,350
attitudes about eating fried

49
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,430
grasshoppers.

50
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,340
Is that what you&#39;re expecting? The reason

51
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,049
for this is that because the nice

52
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,729
experimenter is like the twenty-dollar

53
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,740
condition in the Festinger and Carlsmith

54
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,170
study we talked about before. It&#39;s

55
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,149
consistent for us to do things for

56
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,200
people we like. The mean experimenter

57
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,819
is like the one-dollar condition in that

58
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:16,459
other study. It&#39;s not consistent for us

59
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:18,680
to do things for people we don&#39;t like.

60
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,200
So the participants who ate the fried

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,120
grasshopper after being asked to do so

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,099
by the mean experimenter were

63
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:27,349
experiencing more dissonance. And the way

64
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:29,630
that they resolve that was by changing

65
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,130
their attitudes about eating fried

66
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,709
grasshoppers. Their attitudes became more

67
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:36,349
positive and they liked their snack the

68
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:41,830
most.
