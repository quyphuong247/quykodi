If you’re eating and you see a pile of bones begin to mount in front of you, you have pretty

1
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,140
good feedback about the volume of food you’ve eaten.

2
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,449
In the ‘all you can eat’ study, when the wait staff was clearing away the bones, those

3
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:20,189
people didn’t have any feedback.

4
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:22,460
So they ate about 20% more.

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,409
The pile of bones in front of you make you think, my goodness I must have eaten all these

6
00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:28,689
wings, so maybe I should stop eating.

7
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:31,919
Another thing is that people also eat too much when they are sitting around the table

8
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:35,610
with their family and their friends because they are talking and enjoying the conversation

9
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,240
and they’re not focusing on the eating.

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,410
I’m going to say from the research, if you really want to keep track of what you’re

11
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:47,120
eating and control yourself, the best way to do it would be to sit in front of a mirror

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,100
and eat there looking at yourself.

13
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,700
I know nobody does that - but that would be the ideal.

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:57,070
You’d probably really enjoy the meal too you’d taste every bite and be totally aware

15
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,140
and you wouldn’t overeat.

16
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,870
The point is monitoring is important and effective.

17
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,420
The third and final component of self-control is willpower.

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,280
It’s a complicated thing and I won’t go into all the dynamics of it now but it seems

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,211
like as the term willpower implies, people have a limited energy supply and so when they

20
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:22,430
exert their willpower then temporarily it is reduced or depleted until it recharges.

21
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:27,420
So, dieters, sure enough, when their willpower is low, they will eat more.

22
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,830
And it may be low because they’ve been resisting other temptations or could be low because

23
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,580
they’ve had a hard day at work or problems in their romantic relationships and other

24
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,990
things are draining their willpower or other challenges.

25
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,610
But whatever takes away their mental energy, then they don’t have as much energy to resist.

26
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:51,119
So, low willpower undermines your ability to reduce your food intake.

27
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,740
There’s also evidence when you are on a diet, you’ll be less successful at quitting

28
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,740
smoking because smoking takes willpower and dieting takes willpower and if you try to

29
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:07,990
do both, you can’t do these effectively as well.

30
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:13,380
When ordinary people, they don’t necessarily eat more, in other words people who are not

31
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,470
dieting, don’t necessarily eat more when their willpower is down because they’re

32
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:24,580
not normally trying to inhibited it but dieters who are trying to restrain in their eating,

33
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,280
the energy for inhibition is down when their willpower

34
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
is weaker.

35
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,310
There is certainly a lot more we could say about the self but understanding self-esteem

36
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,580
and self-control are two of the important foundations of it.

37
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,790
And as I’ve said, we’ve invested a lot more energy in studying self-esteem but in

38
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,500
the last 20 years I think there’s been a big shift to move more to self-control because

39
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,690
that ultimately has considerably more power to help individuals and help society.
