00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:11,049
Here’s a real-world example of how powerful reciprocal concessions can be.

1
00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:15,160
How to make smart people do stupid and immoral things.

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,300
A great example of this is Watergate.

3
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,779
You may have heard of that term.

4
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:23,910
The word “Gate” has been added to the end of all kinds of things, for anything involving

5
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:24,910
a scandal.

6
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:31,380
There are for example: Chopper-gate, tote-gate, wine-gate, bridge-gate, Billy-gate, Monica-gate,

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,660
celeb-gate, gamer-gate, and even deflate-gate.

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:42,300
So, Watergate was a big political scandal in the United States of America.

9
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,640
The United States political system has Republicans versus the Democrats.

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,260
At the time of Watergate, the Republicans were in power and President Nixon was the

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,879
president.

12
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,809
There was an election coming up in a year’s time.

13
00:00:55,809 --> 00:01:01,410
The Republicans had formed this dirt unit whose job it was to dig up dirt on the Democrats.

14
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,420
As part of their brief, they did something that was reckless and disastrous which was

15
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,210
that they broke into the office of a senior Democrat in the Watergate Hotel, they stole

16
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,220
some documents, and they bugged his office.

17
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,939
This is a massively stupid thing to do for a whole range of reasons, not least of which

18
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:23,670
is that it’s illegal, and if it comes out, then it would cause disgrace for the government,

19
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,950
and in fact that’s what happened.

20
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,380
The Republicans went on to win the election, but then a few months after that, they got

21
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,150
busted for having done this, and Nixon had to resign.

22
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,390
It was a huge risk which backfired.

23
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,830
The other thing is that they didn’t need to take that risk.

24
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,530
They were way ahead in the polls.

25
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:48,830
There was no reason to believe that the Democrats even had any good juice that they could use.

26
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,450
Why would such smart people do such stupid things?

27
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,960
It’s interesting actually when you analyse it.

28
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,060
The guy, by the way, who came up with this strategy, his name was Gordon Liddy.

29
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,860
He went to some Republican strategists and said: “I’ve got this plan.

30
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,570
You’re going to love this plan.

31
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,130
It’s going to cost like a million bucks and it’s going to involve breaking into

32
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,020
this guy’s office and stealing documents and bugging the office.

33
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,860
And I think we should have kidnapping squads that would kidnap Democrats and drive them

34
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,740
across the Mexican border, and they’ll mug them.

35
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,470
Then we would have yachts full of high-class prostitutes that we can also use to lure Democrats,

36
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:29,250
and we’ll blackmail them, and we’ll have this chase plane over them, specially equipped,

37
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,160
and we can used that to listen into their conversations.”

38
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,550
It’s like this really insane, expensive, evil James Bond kind of plan and they were

39
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,870
like: “You’re mad.

40
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,790
Go away,” and so he did.

41
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:48,240
But then he came back a few weeks later and said: “Look, I’ve had time to reflect,

42
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:54,290
and I think, yes, maybe the kidnapping and mugging squads may be illegal, may be a little

43
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,290
evil.

44
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,320
We don’t need that.

45
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,420
The specially equipped communications chase plane, that’s a bit expensive, I can drop

46
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,420
that.

47
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:07,080
But the yacht full of prostitutes, that’s non-negotiable, and we want to break into

48
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,120
the office of course.

49
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,050
This is going to cost half a million bucks.”

50
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,040
And the Republicans were still not into the plan and told him: “You’re mad.

51
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,390
Go away.”

52
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:22,800
Then Liddy came back a few weeks later with the plan that they finally said yes to: “This

53
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,140
is going to cost quarter of a million dollars, and all we’re going to do is break into

54
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,700
this guy’s office, steal some documents, and bug the office.”

55
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,230
Here, some Republican insiders who were not at these meetings subsequently found out about

56
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,000
the plan, and their reaction was along the lines of: “What the hell?

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,090
Why did you ever agree to this?”

58
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,850
So why did they agree to it?

59
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,480
You can see what kind of social psychological principles are in operation here.

60
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,430
It’s reciprocal concessions and the contrast effect.

61
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,120
You can almost hear them saying: “No one was particularly overwhelmed with the plan

62
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,300
that cost a million dollars and had the plane, prostitutes, luxury boat, and kidnappings.

63
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,430
We thought that maybe quarter of a million was acceptable.

64
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,600
We were reluctant to send him away with nothing.”

65
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,840
Some of the Republicans said: “that if Liddy had come out at the beginning and said, ‘Look,

66
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,290
I had this plan to burglarize and wiretap Larry O’Brien’s office,’ we might have

67
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:22,930
rejected that out of hand, but instead he came to us with this elaborate call girl,

68
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,830
kidnapping, mugging, sabotage, wire-tapping scheme.

69
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,820
He’d ask for this whole loaf when he was quite content to settle for half or even a

70
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,820
quarter.”

71
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:36,210
That’s the point where this guy realises he’d been played.

72
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,720
That guy Liddy knew what he was doing.

73
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,250
He started with a ridiculous initial offer and subsequent offers seemed less ridiculous

74
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,270
in comparison.

75
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,810
It makes you realise that being smart doesn’t make you immune from being ripped off like

76
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,810
this.

77
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,720
And these things are in operation even when the political stakes are really high, even

78
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
when the moral stakes are really high.
