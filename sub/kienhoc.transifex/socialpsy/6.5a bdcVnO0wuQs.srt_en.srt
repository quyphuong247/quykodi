00:00:07,249 --> 00:00:11,809
In 1966, Hofling and colleagues phoned up nurses in a hospital and pretended to be a

1
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:12,990
doctor.

2
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,840
They told the nurses to give a patient an unsafe level of a drug.

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,980
Now I should point out that the researchers weren’t just ringing up some random nurses

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,720
in a random hospital.

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,320
That would really bad, and really unethical.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,740
Dangerous even.

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,490
They planned the study in advance with the doctors at the hospital, so there was someone

8
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:35,270
ready to intervene in case the nurses actually tried to give patients the unsafe dose of

9
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,399
medicine.

10
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,820
Which is just as well really, because when the person claiming to be a doctor, an authority

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:46,410
figure, who the nurses had never met before, rang up and told the nurses to give the unsafe

12
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,399
dose of medicine, 95% of nurses got the medicine from the dispensing cabinet and then went

13
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,300
to take it to the patient to give it to them.

14
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,270
Just as well the researchers had arranged for someone to stop them!

15
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:04,059
There’s also some research by Bickman in 1974 which shows that we are more likely to

16
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:06,830
follow the commands of people in uniforms.

17
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,969
This is why when there is road works, they often have people controlling the traffic

18
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:14,990
dressed in uniforms that look very similar to police uniforms.

19
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,510
People are used to obeying police officers.

20
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,070
Most of the time.

21
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,220
And so, when we see a traffic controller dressed like a police officer, we are more likely

22
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,220
to slow down.

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,909
You actually don’t even need to dress up in a uniform.

24
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,510
Simply wearing a suit makes people more likely to follow your commands (Lefkowitz et al.,

25
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,510
1955).

26
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,970
Advertisers will sometimes try to link their products with authority figures to take advantage

27
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,240
of this effect.

28
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,860
They might have actors wear white lab coats.

29
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,280
Or even actors who have been doctors in famous TV shows advocating for their product.

30
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,720
So, it’s probably not a big surprise to you that authority figures are very influential,

31
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,540
and it makes sense for us to follow the instructions of legitimate authorities.

32
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,700
Things would get pretty chaotic if we didn’t.

33
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,610
People would be running all over the place, burning things down, stealing things, driving

34
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,660
their cars as fast as they wanted, and generally creating havoc if they didn’t follow the

35
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,969
commands given by authorities.

36
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:08,220
We don’t do that.

37
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,599
Well, at least I don’t.

38
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,789
Not often.

39
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:15,150
The problem is that sometimes we can follow the commands of an authority figure without

40
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,830
thinking, and we might behave inappropriately, or hurt someone else, without meaning to.
