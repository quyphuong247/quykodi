00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:09,420
What does our body language tell others, about us?

1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,280
It was quite popular, particularly, in the 1970’s and 1980’s for people to write

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,270
books about body language.

3
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:20,340
These books promised that if you could learn the secrets of body language, you&#39;d be able

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,149
to effectively read people&#39;s minds, to know what they were thinking if they crossed their

5
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:28,800
arms, or scratched their nose, or looked to the left.

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,680
Maybe you could even convince them to like you more through adjusting your own body language.

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,730
For the most part, these claims are massively overstated.

8
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,640
Despite what your friends think, when you study psychology you aren’t going to learn

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,020
how to read people&#39;s minds.

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,660
Having said that, nonverbal communication is a major avenue through which we reach other

11
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,660
people.

12
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,180
It&#39;s a major avenue through which we miscommunicate, as well.

13
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:57,329
We’ll talk about the role of hand gestures, and the role of facial expressions, particularly

14
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,440
because the face is good at communicating emotion.

15
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,210
We&#39;ll also talk about cross-cultural differences in nonverbal communication.

16
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:10,490
Then we&#39;re going to be dabbling in some interpretation of body language ourselves as we try to answer

17
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:15,190
the question of whether we can tell if someone is lying on the basis of their body language.

18
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,860
So, what do we mean by nonverbal communication?

19
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,430
It&#39;s a much broader definition than many people imagine.

20
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,720
It’s effectively anything other than the words.

21
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,810
Obviously, this includes things like hand gestures, and facial expressions.

22
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:33,690
It can also include things like your voice, whether you&#39;ve got a high-pitched voice or

23
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:34,690
a loud voice.

24
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:40,990
It can include posture, touch, clothes, a whole range of things actually.

25
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,380
There&#39;s nothing in the definition that suggests that nonverbal communication has to be intentional.

26
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,710
When you put clothes on this morning, presumably you were not necessarily trying to send the

27
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,990
message to the world about how you&#39;re feeling, or the kind of person that you are, but some

28
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,060
people might make those assumptions about you in any case.

29
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,670
According to the definition, communication has happened with or without your permission,

30
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,660
with or without your intention.

31
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,380
There&#39;s nothing in the definition that suggests that it has to be accurate.

32
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,980
People can make all sorts of mistaken assumptions on the basis of your body language, your clothes,

33
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,670
whatever it is, but that&#39;s still nonverbal communication.
