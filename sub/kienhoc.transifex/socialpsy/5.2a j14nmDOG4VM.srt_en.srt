One of the ideas that marketing relies on is that if we can change your attitude, then

1
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,450
we can change your behaviour.

2
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,000
But is this actually the case?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,590
Do attitudes actually influence behaviour?

4
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:25,029
Well, in 1934, Richard LaPiere set out to test whether attitudes were related to behaviour.

5
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:29,460
He had the opportunity to travel with a young Chinese student, and the student&#39;s wife, over

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,250
a period of two years.

7
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:38,570
Together, they visited 251 hotels, auto camps and tourist homes across the United States

8
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,220
of America.

9
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:45,780
Now it’s worth noting that LaPiere wasn’t expecting a particularly positive response.

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,739
He had done some previous studies of what Americans thought about Chinese people, and

11
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:52,210
their attitudes were not that positive.

12
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:57,440
Remember, this was the 1930s, which is not an excuse, but it gives you some context for

13
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,039
LaPiere’s observations.

14
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,800
  Before I tell you any more about LaPiere’s

15
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,630
study, I want to ask you to you guess what happened when he and his travelling companions

16
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,210
turned up and asked to be served.

17
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:15,329
The first question that I want you to answer is: what percentage of places do you think

18
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:18,479
actually served them when they turned up?

19
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,549
Now, before I ask you the next question, I need to tell you that six months later, LaPiere

20
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,509
got in touch with all of the places they had visited.

21
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:28,369
He didn’t say he’d been there before.

22
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:32,640
Instead, he said he was travelling with two Chinese companions, and he wanted to know

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,329
if they could come and visit.

24
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:40,600
So, the second question is: What percentage of places do you think said t they would serve

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:40,780
them?
