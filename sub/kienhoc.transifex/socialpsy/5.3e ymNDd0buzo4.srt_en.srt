In Australia, the Grim Reaper AIDS commercial is one of the best known uses of fear in advertising.

1
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:18,160
In 1987, the Australian government made this commercial, and used actors dressed up as

2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,440
the grim reaper––the cloaked skeletons in the video––to make people fearful of

3
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,470
HIV and AIDS.

4
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,890
The grim reapers were shown at a bowling alley, and they were bowling down people, not bowling

5
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,000
pins.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,090
These were everyday people... mums, dads, young people, and old people.

7
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,989
The government was hoping that the use of fear would change people’s attitudes towards

8
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:40,899
safe sex.

9
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:44,520
Fear is a commonly used tool in advertising campaigns generally.

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,670
Recent road safety ads in Australia have included shocking footage of car crashes aimed at getting

11
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,320
people to have better attitudes towards driving.

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,739
And anti-smoking ads have shown gruesome video of people suffering with smoking related illnesses.

13
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,270
So, is fear an effective way to change people’s attitudes?

14
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:10,640
Janis and Feshbach in 1953 varied the extent of fear in a message about proper tooth care.

15
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,220
They gave their participants a 15 minute lecture about dental hygiene accompanied by illustrated

16
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,220
slides.

17
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,090
There were three different versions of this lecture, each arousing a different level of

18
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,580
fear.

19
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,930
In the strong fear version, the message emphasised the painful consequences of tooth decay and

20
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:34,250
diseased gums, and described other health threats associated with poor dental health

21
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,920
including blindness and kidney damage.

22
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,560
For example, participants were told:

23
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,950
“If you ever develop an infection of this kind from improper care of your teeth, it

24
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:50,180
will be an extremely serious matter because these infections are really dangerous.

25
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,420
They can spread to your eyes, or your heart, or your joints and cause secondary infections

26
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:02,330
which may lead to diseases such as arthritic paralysis, kidney damage, or total blindness.”

27
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:07,790
In the moderate fear version, these dangers were described in a less threatening way.

28
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:12,690
In the low fear message, the message didn’t focus much at all on the consequences of poor

29
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,780
dental hygiene, but instead participants were given information about how teeth develop

30
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,810
and what functions they served.

31
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,500
The researchers then measured how much participants conformed to the message, how much they were

32
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,400
persuaded by it.

33
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,510
So, what do you think they found?
