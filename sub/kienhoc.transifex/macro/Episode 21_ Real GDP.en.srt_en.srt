In episode 20, I spoke of measuring GDP, the
country’s income (in a given time period),

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:11,429
which will give us nominal GDP, or the current
market value of the goods and services produced,

3
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:18,429
at that time. But what about real GDP? Perhaps
another question first: why should you care?

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,060
What does it matter if we use real or nominal
GDP?

5
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:29,060
Let's say that in Year 1, nominal GDP is $10
(or $10 million, or $10 billion…). In Year

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:36,320
2, nominal GDP is $40 (or $40 million, or
$40 billion…). Why did GDP increase in Year

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,960
2? Well, ideally GDP quadrupled because output
of goods and services quadrupled, but that's

8
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,649
not necessarily the case, is it? Couldn't
GDP quadruple without having any increasing

9
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:55,550
output of goods and services produced, but
instead, because prices have quadrupled? Or,

10
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,138
probably most realistically, isn’t it possible
that the market value of goods and services,

11
00:01:00,139 --> 00:01:06,000
that is, your GDP, quadrupled because there
was an increase in output and an increase

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,189
in prices? How will we know if the increased
value is due to productivity gains, which

13
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:16,589
would be great, or price increases, which
is not so great?

14
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,630
We need to look at real GDP, where adjustments
are made to compensate for any changes in

15
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:27,479
the price level. We could think of real GDP
as the sum of all the current final goods

16
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,640
and services produced, but measured in base
year prices. If that's real GDP, then we can

17
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,759
think of nominal GDP as the sum of all the
current final goods and services produced,

18
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,000
measured in current year prices.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,579
Really then, to get the real GDP from the
nominal GDP, you just need to be able to adjust

20
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:52,089
for any price changes that have occurred since
the base year. Note: because GDP contains

21
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:57,490
more than just typical consumer goods, we
can't use the CPI, or consumer price index,

22
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,390
as we had before; we need a broader measure
of prices.

23
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,030
The GDP deflator is a price index that includes
more goods and services than just the typical

24
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,709
household consumer goods. Do you remember
Episode 17, when we looked at real and nominal

25
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:16,739
versions of an individual's income? The real
income was the nominal income, adjusted for

26
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:23,290
any price changes. Well, this is just a country’s
income, so real GDP, the country’s real

27
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:30,060
income, is the nominal GDP, or the country's
nominal income, divided by the GDP deflator

28
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,120
-- our price index -- to adjust for any price
level changes.
