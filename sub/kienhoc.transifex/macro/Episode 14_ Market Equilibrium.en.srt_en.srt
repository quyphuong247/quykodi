Equilibrium occurs where quantity supplied
equals quantity demanded. What does it mean?

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:12,110
Basically, your market price will be stable,
that is, it won't tend to change, when you

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,859
reach the point at which willingness to buy
coincides with willingness to sell in the

4
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:17,449
market.

5
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:22,340
Here’s a numerical example. Note that I
could pick any numbers for my demand, as long

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,320
as they follow one simple rule: as price goes
up, quantity demanded must go down. That's

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,610
the Law of Demand. Similarly, for supply,
as price goes up quantity supplied must go

8
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,289
up as well, to follow the Law of Supply.

9
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:42,289
Without even looking at a diagram, where is
equilibrium? Equilibrium occurs at a price

10
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:47,739
of three dollars, where the quantity demanded
equals the quantity supplied, at three units

11
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:52,510
(please note that the fact that price and
quantity are both three is just coincidence;

12
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:58,968
they will not always be the same). If I plot
out these numbers -- first the demand figures,

13
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:04,140
then supply – I reach the same conclusion
with the diagram: equilibrium occurs at a

14
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,000
price of three dollars where the quantity
supplied equals the quantity demanded at three

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,680
units.

16
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:17,680
Why is this the equilibrium? Because no other
price would be stable. All other prices would

17
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:23,299
have a tendency to change. At a dollar, for
instance, the buyers are happy (they’d love

18
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:28,320
to buy five units); but the sellers are unhappy
-- they're only willing to provide one unit

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,199
to the market. A situation like this, where
the quantity demanded is greater than the

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,990
quantity supplied, is referred to as a shortage,
and will result in upward pressure on price.

21
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:44,669
Why? Well, those buyers all want to purchase,
but there's only one unit available, so the

22
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,469
buyers start to compete to get the one available
unit -- by offering more money. Price goes

23
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:56,658
up, and consequently quantity demanded drops,
and quantity supplied rises until we get to

24
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:57,200
equilibrium.

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,200
What about a higher price, like five dollars?
At five dollars, sellers are happy providing

26
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:10,020
five units, but buyers are unhappy: they only
want one unit. When the quantity demanded

27
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,900
is less than the quantity supplied, we have
a surplus, and price will drop.

28
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:21,360
OK, let's go back to the housing market example.
Price P1 is the stable market equilibrium

29
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,370
price for this market. What if it's not the
price? Start by taking a look at the Phoenix

30
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:34,370
housing market in 2005 as an example. At that
time the price was below the equilibrium price.

31
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:42,430
What happens at price 2005? There are lots
of buyers at this price (the quantity demanded);

32
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:48,260
not so many sellers (quantity supplied). This
was characterized by homes being snatched

33
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:54,070
up off the market, often sight unseen, often
within hours of being listed (sometimes as

34
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:58,880
the for sale sign was going up); new-home
developments were holding lotteries to determine

35
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:05,460
which buyers would be allowed to purchase!
Shortages result in increasing market prices,

36
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,980
leading to an increase in the quantity supplied,
and a decrease in the quantity demanded. When

37
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:16,179
will the prices stop rising? When there's
no more pressure -- no more shortage. In short,

38
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,330
the market stabilizes at P1.

39
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:26,330
Now, fast-forward three years to observe the
Phoenix housing market in 2008. In 2008, prices

40
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:33,510
were greater than the market equilibrium prices.
What happens at P2008? There are lots of sellers

41
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:41,019
(quantity supplied); not so many buyers (quantity
demanded). This was characterized by homes

42
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,830
sitting on the market for months -- some for
over year -- even with remodeling, and upgrades,

43
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:51,540
and in pristine condition! Some sat for so
long that the owners simply abandoned them.

44
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,989
This is a signal that the prices need to come
down in order to increase the quantity demanded,

45
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:02,750
and decrease the quantity supplied. When will
the price stop falling? When the surplus goes

46
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,870
away, the downward pressure eases. This means
that when the quantity supplied equals the

47
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,400
quantity demanded, at P1, the market stabilizes.

48
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:19,399
So P1, Q1 must be the market equilibrium price
and quantity. If that's so, how do we ever

49
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:28,190
see sustained, stable price changes? P1 and
Q1 are the equilibrium price and quantity

50
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:35,190
for this particular set of market conditions,
but supply and demand can change, and if they

51
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:42,400
do, you’ll get a new equilibrium for the
new set of market conditions.

52
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:49,510
TIME TO THINK: What happens to the equilibrium
price and quantity if: demand increases? What

53
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:57,240
if demand decreases? What if your supply increases?
What if your supply decreases? While you're

54
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:04,170
thinking about these questions, try to come
up with specific examples -- what is the market,

55
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,220
and why would demand increase?

56
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,680
