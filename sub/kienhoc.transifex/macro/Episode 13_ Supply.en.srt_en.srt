You know, intuitively, the analysis of supply
is very much like the analysis of demand.

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,880
Really, it's just looking at the flipside
of the same coin. Let’s look back at the

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,110
key points of demand, and then turn those
concepts around to apply them to the seller,

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,439
instead of the buyer.

5
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:21,619
Remember the Law of Demand? Buyers like low
prices and dislike high prices, other things

6
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:27,919
being equal? Well, what would a Law of Supply
look like? Think about it, what do sellers

7
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:34,290
like better -- low prices are high prices?
Sellers prefer higher prices. That is when

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,980
they're happier to provide their product or
service to the market. So the Law of Supply

9
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,709
might be something like, “more of the good
will be provided, the higher its price; less

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:49,420
will be provided, the lower its price, ceteris
paribus.” This Law of Supply makes perfect

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:55,990
sense, saying that there's a direct relationship
between price and quantity supplied. Of course

12
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:02,010
at lower prices suppliers are either unable
(they can’t cover their costs), or unwilling

13
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,908
(not enough profit motive) to provide much
product. But at higher prices, the suppliers

14
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:12,850
make a lot more profit, other things remaining
equal, and are much happier to provide the

15
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,339
product to market.

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:21,079
OK, think back to demand again. What factors
or variables affect willingness to purchase?

17
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:26,169
Quantity demanded is affected by product price,
price of substitutes, price of complements,

18
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:33,170
income, tastes, age, weather, and so on. Well,
guess what? Suppliers’ decisions are affected

19
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:41,079
by much more than the price tag, too. Like
what? Good question -- what determines the

20
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:46,490
suppliers’ willingness or ability to provide
the product to the market? Price of the product,

21
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:52,859
certainly; but more important is profitability,
which is determined not only by product price

22
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:59,859
but also by costs of production. Such as?
Wages, or cost of labor, rent, or cost of

23
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:08,149
capital, cost of raw materials or natural
resources. What about other costs besides

24
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:14,720
the resources? Taxes, paperwork, licensing
-- in some businesses, you have to pass exams

25
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,180
or be subject to periodic audit or accreditation.
These are all costs.

26
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:27,290
What about variables that affect your ability
to produce? Worker strikes, natural disasters,

27
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:34,290
shipping disruptions… inability to get your
resources results in an inability to produce,

28
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:37,530
decreasing the amount provided to the market.

29
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,819
On the other hand, better technology or worker
productivity would be examples of variables

30
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:49,159
that would enhance production making more
product available. What else? Expectations

31
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:53,510
affect supply; heck, even weather affects
supply.

32
00:02:53,510 --> 00:03:00,510
Ultimately quantity supplied is a function
of all these things: price, wages, taxes,

33
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:06,890
technology, weather… Just remember, I only
like to look at two things at any given time,

34
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:13,078
so that I can draw the relationship; in this
case, price and quantity supplied.

35
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:19,840
Going back to our housing example, at a price
of $100 per square foot, and considering wages

36
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,250
for carpenters, roofers, electricians, plumbers,
lumber, copper, permits and fees, expectations

37
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:33,250
of home sales, etcetera – quantity supplied1
will be provided. BUT, if price goes to $200

38
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:41,370
per square foot, all else staying the same,
more houses will be provided. There are an

39
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:47,909
infinite number of other prices, and associated
quantities supplied, so the supply line is

40
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:53,030
the collection of all price-quantity supplied
combinations.

41
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,650
Just as with demand, a change in price will
not change the supply, but rather move along

42
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:04,749
the supply curve, resulting in a change in
the quantity supplied. Changing anything other

43
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:11,219
than the product price will alter the underlying
supply. For example, what if the government

44
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:18,219
imposes a higher minimum-wage? As wage increases
from W1 to W2, the quantity demanded of labor

45
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:26,019
(since the employer demands or purchases some
amount of labor) decreases from L1 and L2.

46
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:32,370
With less labor to work with, the supply of
the end product decreases. Any cost increase

47
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,860
makes business less profitable, which is a
disincentive to produce.

48
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:43,500
What would happen if costs fall? For example,
if business taxes decrease, or if technology

49
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,840
gets cheaper?

50
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,489
The bottom line is that you need to pay careful
attention to the difference between a change

51
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,250
in supply and a change in quantity supplied.

52
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,130
