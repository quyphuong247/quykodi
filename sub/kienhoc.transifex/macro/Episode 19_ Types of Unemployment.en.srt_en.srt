Now that we know the term “unemployed”
means not working, but seeking work, you need

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,030
to recognize that there are different types
of unemployment, some of longer duration and/or

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,730
more serious consequence to the economy than
others.

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:18,470
Frictional unemployment is unemployment due
to the natural frictions of the economy, which

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:24,019
is caused by changing conditions and represented
by -- here's the most important part -- qualified

6
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:29,948
individuals with transferable skills who change
jobs. Examples might include a short-term

7
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:35,220
contract engineer, who seeks a new position
every 6 to 18 months, as his/her contract

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:41,140
expires. This person has the skills to move
to a new contract position. Or, what about

9
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:46,710
a full-time college student was not previously
unemployed, but starts interviewing for jobs?

10
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,800
Once the student starts seeking work, he/she
becomes part of the labor force. As long as

11
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:58,230
he/she has the education and skills necessary
to start a job, it counts as frictional unemployment.

12
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,080
Frictional unemployment is typically of shorter
duration than some of the other forms of unemployment.

13
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,210
Structural unemployment is unemployment due
to structural changes in the economy that

14
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,780
eliminate some jobs and create others for
which the unemployed are unqualified. One

15
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,920
really good example that I can think of is
from the 1990s, when the North American Free

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,360
Trade Agreement (NAFTA, for short) was passed.
With the passage of NAFTA, the US lost a lot

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,020
of blue-collar, factory-type jobs, but gained
white-collar jobs, say, in computer programming

18
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:33,899
or finance. Workers laid off from their factory
jobs couldn’t very well apply right away

19
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,390
for high-tech job; they would need to go back
to school for a whole new type of training

20
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,960
and education. Some who got laid off were
older workers, who were not interested in

21
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,530
going back school at all. Overall, structural
unemployment is a longer-term issue than frictional

22
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,100
unemployment.

23
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,440
Seasonal unemployment is unemployment due
to seasonal trends. For example, jobs related

24
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:00,729
to a seasonal crop, or a seasonal activity,
such as skiing, or seasonal demand like at

25
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:05,158
Christmas. Seasonal unemployment is periodic
and predictable, and can therefore be planned

26
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,340
around.

27
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:11,060
Cyclical unemployment -- unemployment due
to contractions in the economy. The economy

28
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,870
moves in cycles. When the economy does well,
there are lots of jobs and unemployment is

29
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:21,219
down. When the economy does poorly, there
are fewer jobs and the unemployment rate goes

30
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:26,680
up. The biggest problem with cyclical unemployment
is that no two cycles are the same in terms

31
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,329
of severity or length, so it's difficult to
tell when jobs will come back. It could be

32
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:36,340
a few months, or over year. In the case of
the Great Depression, it was years before

33
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,340
the economy recovered and jobs were created.

34
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,310
Now that we’ve considered these four types
of unemployment, think back to the second

35
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:49,810
macroeconomic goal: low unemployment. Notice
the goal is NOT zero unemployment, but rather

36
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:56,419
low unemployment. Why do you suppose this
is? One reason is that, in a dynamic economy,

37
00:02:56,419 --> 00:03:01,090
where labor is allowed to move freely from
one job to another, or even one career to

38
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:06,639
another, there will always be some amount
of frictional unemployment. Similarly, the

39
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:12,209
continual change that occurs an innovative
society means that there is always some structural

40
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:16,849
unemployment. To eliminate these, you’d
need to appoint each employee to a job, and

41
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:22,339
that would be the person's job for life. Plus,
you could never allow any underlying structural

42
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,489
change, like technological improvements.

43
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:31,489
No, zero unemployment isn't the goal, but
low unemployment is. How low? Well, the natural

44
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:37,738
rate of unemployment -- that caused only by
frictional and structural factors -- is our

45
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:42,919
target. If we've achieved the natural rate
of unemployment, we have full employment.

46
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:46,480
Full employment is the condition that exists
when the unemployment rate is equal to the

47
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,168
natural unemployment rate. For many years
in the US, the natural rate of unemployment

48
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:56,900
was thought to be 5 to 6%. But then, with
the unprecedented economic expansion of the

49
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:02,569
US economy in the 1990s, we experienced 4%
unemployment without suffering any negative

50
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:07,668
inflationary side effects. If we go much lower
than this though, companies would start competing

51
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:12,230
to get workers by offering higher salaries
and more benefits, which would in turn drive

52
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,279
product prices upward, causing inflation.
