&quot;An economic model or theory is a simplification
of reality that allows us to observe, understand,

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,379
and make predictions about economic behavior.&quot;

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,090
OK, what does this MEAN? How does it apply
to us? Why do we need to &quot;simplify reality&quot;?

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,670
When I ask the question, &quot;How much realism
do we want in a model?&quot; most students will

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:27,150
respond, &quot;As much as possible,&quot; or &quot;100%.&quot;
But is this true? Is MORE realism always preferred?

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,459
Let me give you an example: Suppose that it's
the end of the semester, and to celebrate,

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,739
I'll be having a big party at my house! You're
invited, but how will you get there? You'll

8
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:41,599
need some kind of directions -- probably a
map, right? Well, how much realism do you

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,250
want your map to have? 100%? Stop for a moment
and think about what 100% realism would mean

10
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:55,250
-- in your map, one mile equals one mile!!
Where would you put it? OK, so maybe not full

11
00:00:56,109 --> 00:01:01,090
scale, but surely we want as much realism
as possible, right? Again, think about what

12
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:07,360
this means -- your map would show every rock,
every pothole, every blade of grass -- you

13
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,570
get the picture. Well, OK, we probably don't
need (or want) 100% realism; not only is it

14
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:18,899
cumbersome, but the minor details tend to
get in the way, distracting us from our end

15
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:25,900
goal (was that the 17th cow, or the 19th cow?).
So if you want to focus on the end goal -- getting

16
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,700
to the party -- what level of detail do you
really need? If you are like me, you are probably

17
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,110
interested in the major cross streets closest
to your destination, and perhaps some general

18
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,100
directions and major landmarks along the way.
Perhaps, as you near your destination/end

19
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:47,050
goal, you would want a bit more detail (the
third cross street, fourth house on the right,

20
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:53,860
that sort of thing), but again, 100% detail
or realism is neither necessary, nor desired.

21
00:01:53,860 --> 00:02:00,289
So, back to the question: How much realism
do you want in your model? The answer to this

22
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:07,290
question is rather non-specific: we want enough
realism to allow us to achieve our end goal;

23
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:13,960
to reach our destination. How do I know if
there is enough? How do I determine if my

24
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:20,160
model is good? Well, if my model -- my simplified
version of reality -- is a good one, then

25
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,930
it helps me to &quot;observe, understand, and make
predictions about&quot; my topic. In the case of

26
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:32,930
the map? The map was good if I successfully
achieved my end goal -- if I reached the party!

27
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:40,600
At various points this semester, you may ask
me, &quot;but in the REAL world, isn't it the case

28
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,900
that... [fill in the blank]?&quot; Often, my response
to you will be to bear in mind that we are

29
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:52,310
dealing with a MODEL -- a simplified version
of reality. Is it perfectly realistic? No.

30
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,290
Does it allow us to observe, understand, and
make predictions about economic behavior?

31
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,870
You bet!!

32
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:04,730
The models we will use this semester may be
in the form of verbal statements, or tables

33
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:11,730
of data, or graphs, or mathematical equations.
In Episode#6, I'll give a brief review of

34
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,880
graphs, before we move on to setting up a
Model that will help us look at scarcity and

35
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,130
choice.

36
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,440
NEXT TIME: Graphs.
