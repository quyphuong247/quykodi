Why should stable prices be a macroeconomic
goal? I mean, why do we even care about inflation?

2
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:11,290
One reason we care about rising prices lies
in the answer to this question: are you beating

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:17,630
inflation, or is inflation beating you? I.e.,
is your income keeping pace with rising prices?

4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:22,840
There are three possible responses to this
question: If your income is rising faster

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,170
than inflation, then you're staying ahead
of rising prices, and your living standard

6
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:32,489
rises. Your money will buy you more goods
and services than it did before. If your income

7
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:38,328
rises as fast as prices, then you’re neither
gaining nor losing -- your living standard

8
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:44,769
stays the same. If your income rises more
slowly than prices, then your income isn't

9
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:48,839
keeping up with inflation, and your living
standards fall.

10
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:53,510
When your nominal income -- the actual current
dollar amount -- is adjusted for any price

11
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:59,178
changes that have occurred, you get your real
income. This means your real income is your

12
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:04,670
nominal income divided by the CPI (remember,
the CPI reflects what’s happened to overall

13
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:10,170
consumer prices), times 100. How do I put
this formula to use? Let's go back and take

14
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,770
a closer look at the three cases cases.

15
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:18,658
Case 1) your nominal income rises by more
than price level increase. Last year, you

16
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,799
made $50,000. This year you get a raise, so
that you’re making $60,000. How much of

17
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:28,680
a raise did you get? Remember, I want to think
in terms of percentage change in income, so

18
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,680
your income has actually increased by 20%.
Now, what's happening to prices? Last year,

19
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:43,250
the CPI was 100; this year, CPI is 110. This
means that prices have gone up by 10%. Because

20
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:50,960
my income has risen by 20%, while prices have
gone up 10%, I know that I must be better

21
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,780
off than before, but let me verify by looking
more closely at the effect on my real income.

22
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:02,819
Remember that real income is my nominal income,
adjusted for any price changes. In year 1,

23
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:09,819
then, my real income is $50,000, divided by
a CPI of 100, times 100, or… $50,000. How

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,440
is this possible? According to the equation,
my real and nominal incomes are the same in

25
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,050
year 1! Well of COURSE they are -- real income
is just your nominal income, adjusted for

26
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:28,350
any price changes. Since prices haven’t
changed (year 1 is the base year), then no

27
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:35,160
adjustments have to be made. Well, what happens
in year 2? In year 2, my real income is my

28
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:42,160
new nominal income of $60,000, divided by
CPI for year 2, 110, all times 100. In year

29
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:50,080
2, then, my real income is $54,545.45. Not
as large of an increase as it looked at first,

30
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,120
based on my nominal income, but still my real
income has increased from year 1 to year 2,

31
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,880
so I'm better off than I was before.

32
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,810
What about Case 2), where the increase in
your nominal income just equals the increasing

33
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:12,090
prices? If this happens, I know intuitively
that I’m just keeping up with prices. But

34
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:18,720
let me verify this with an example. In year
1, you earn $50,000; in year 2, you get a

35
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,720
raise so that your income is $55,000. CPI
for year 1 was 100; CPI for year 2 is 110.

36
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,850
We know from previous example that prices
have gone up by 10%. How much did my nominal

37
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:38,670
income rise? The percentage change in income
will be my new salary of $55,000, minus my

38
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:45,609
old salary of $50,000, all over the original
$50,000, times 100, or my nominal income has

39
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:52,170
gone up by 10%, identical to inflation. This
means that in real terms, I'll be neither

40
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:57,429
better off nor worse off than last year. Let’s
check: I already know my real income for year

41
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:04,420
1 is $50,000; what about real income for year
2? Indeed, real income for year 2, at $50,000,

42
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,670
is unchanged from year 1. My actual living
standard will be neither better nor worse

43
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,200
than last year.

44
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,289
Lastly, let's examine Case 3): Your nominal
income increases by less than the price level

45
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:23,230
increase. If this happens, I'll look better
off in nominal terms, but actually be worse

46
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:29,790
off in real terms. Let's take a look: in year
1, your income was $50,000, then you get a

47
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:36,790
raise so that in year 2, your income is $52,000.
Year one CPI was 100; year 2 CPI is 110. From

48
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,590
previous examples, we know that inflation
is 10%, and that real income in year one is

49
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:48,590
$50,000. But how much did my nominal income
increase, and what happens to my real income?

50
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,280
The percentage change in income is the $2000
raise over the original $50,000, times 100,

51
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:02,280
or an increase of 4%. With nominal income
up by 4%, but prices up by 10%, what does

52
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:09,869
my real income look like in year 2? Even though
I have more dollars in my pocket -- $2000

53
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,130
dollars more – the dollars I have can't
buy what I was able to buy last year. My real

54
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:19,320
income, and therefore my living standard,
falls.

55
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,500
NEXT TIME: Unemployment - what does it mean
to be unemployed?
