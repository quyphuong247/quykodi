You know, to understand exchange rates, you
really need to grasp one concept: foreign

2
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:10,390
exchange, i.e., foreign money, is really just
another commodity to be bought and sold. This

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,769
is where the term foreign exchange market
comes from. It’s a market, so there must

4
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:18,390
be those who want to buy the currency, and
those who supply it.

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,130
On the demand side, what reason (or reasons)
could people possibly have to want to purchase

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,470
foreign exchange? Well, there are three major
reasons really: First, people want foreign

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,070
money for travel and tourism; second, foreign
money is needed for trade, to buy foreign

8
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:39,880
goods and services; third, foreign money is
needed for investment purposes, be it financial

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,950
investment, like purchase of foreign-denominated
financial assets, or real investment, like

10
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:49,460
building a new factory overseas. A change
in any of these three components will alter

11
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,780
the demand for foreign exchange.

12
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,630
For example, a lot of recent Hollywood blockbuster
movies have been filmed in New Zealand; what

13
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,680
if this creates a sudden surge in tourists
going to New Zealand? These tourists will

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,260
need New Zealand dollars, creating an increase
in demand for that currency. Similarly, if

15
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,900
US companies decide they’d like to build
factories in New Zealand (real investment),

16
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,170
or purchase NZ$-denominated financial assets
(financial investment), the demand for the

17
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,350
New Zealand dollar would increase.

18
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:22,130
Now let's go back to the idea of the foreign
exchange market, with the New Zealand dollar

19
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,490
being the foreign exchange. Initially, there
is a certain supply of New Zealand dollars,

20
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,119
and a certain demand. The equilibrium price
in this market is called the exchange rate.

21
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,830
OK; now let's throw the increase in demand
for the New Zealand dollar into the picture.

22
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:41,759
What happens to the value of the New Zealand
dollar as more tourists travel there, or as

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,540
more US companies invest? As with any commodity,
when the demand for the New Zealand dollar

24
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:53,140
increases, its value increases. We see the
exchange rate, in terms of the US dollar per

25
00:01:53,140 --> 00:02:00,140
New Zealand dollar, increase. This is called
an appreciation of the New Zealand dollar.

26
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:04,369
When dealing with bilateral exchange rates
like this one -- that is to say, the relative

27
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:09,660
value of two currencies – it is necessarily
the case that is one currency becomes stronger,

28
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,060
or more valuable, relative to the other -- in
this case, the New Zealand dollar is increasing

29
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:20,349
in value relative to the US dollar -- the
other currency is decreasing in value, or

30
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:24,510
depreciating. In this example, as the New
Zealand dollar appreciates, the US dollar

31
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,709
is getting relatively weaker, or depreciating.

32
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:32,680
OK, so changes in demand for currency will
affect the exchange rate. What about changes

33
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,680
in supply? Well, ultimately who is it that
controls the supply of foreign currency? The

34
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,349
foreign government. If the US wanted to drive
the value of its own currency up, it would

35
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:49,329
decrease the supply of dollars. If it wanted
to drive value down, it would increase the

36
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:54,410
supply of dollars. Why would a country one
manipulate its own currency value?

37
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:59,599
Let me give you an example. Suppose you are
a US furniture producer, and government protection

38
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,440
for the spotted owl means you can’t get
the lumber that you need domestically. So

39
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,180
you call up a Canadian lumber mill, tell them
you’d like to place an order, and they tell

40
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:13,800
you that the lumber is going to cost CAN$50,000.
I don’t know about you, but my bank account

41
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,319
doesn't happen to have any Canadian dollars
in it. This is where the exchange rate comes

42
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,030
in. If I can figure out how much one Canadian
dollar costs, then I can use that to calculate

43
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,590
how much 50,000 Canadian dollars will cost.
The price of one Canadian dollar, in terms

44
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:35,280
of US dollars, is the exchange rate (dollars
per Canadian dollar). I checked the dollar

45
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,209
per Canadian dollar exchange rate for April
7, 2010 on x-rates.com, and found that CAN$1

46
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:46,500
was equivalent to US$.998.

47
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,260
Just as a side note, this nearly one-to-one
parity between the two country’s currencies

48
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,899
is highly unusual. More on that in a minute.

49
00:03:53,900 --> 00:04:00,900
So if one Canadian dollar costs 99.8 cents
US currency, how much will CAN$50,000 cost?

50
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:08,819
In the end, it will cost you US$49,900 to
purchase the Canadian lumber. Now let’s

51
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:14,409
take a little trip back in time, and figure
out how much that same C$50,000 worth of lumber

52
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:20,430
would've cost in April of each year for the
previous 20 years. When would you most like

53
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,960
to have purchased that lumber? You can see
by looking at the data, that when the foreign

54
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,580
currency is the cheapest, in this case 2001,
at $.64 per Canadian dollar, the foreign imports

55
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:38,580
are the cheapest -- US$32,000. Even if the
Canadian lumber mill sees the same CAN$50,000

56
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:45,930
every year, the price to the US importer changes
as the exchange rate changes. When the Canadian

57
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:51,310
dollar depreciates, the lumber is cheaper,
and US importers will buy more lumber. On

58
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,660
the flip side, as the Canadian dollar depreciates,
the US dollar is getting stronger relative

59
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:01,740
to the Canadian dollar, or it’s appreciating.
While US consumers are enjoying a strong dollar

60
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,840
and buying lots of Canadian goods, Canadians
are seeing the US dollar, and therefore US

61
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,989
goods, as more expensive. Canadians import
fewer US products if the Canadian currency

62
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:16,900
is weak. A weak Canadian dollar is good for
Canada's trade balance, as Canada's exports

63
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,150
rise and imports fall. At the same time, the
US trade balance gets worse -- we are importing

64
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,780
more and exporting less.

65
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,960
The effect of the currency value on the trade
balance takes me back to the question: why

66
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,469
would a country want to manipulate its own
currency value? You now know the answer to

67
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:38,100
this; if a country can keep its currency cheap,
then it keeps its products cheap, and foreign

68
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,070
products expensive -- both of which are good
for the balance of trade.

69
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:46,460
The US has certainly been after China during
the first decade of the 21st century; China

70
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:51,849
keeps its currency value artificially low
in order to keep favorable trade balance.
