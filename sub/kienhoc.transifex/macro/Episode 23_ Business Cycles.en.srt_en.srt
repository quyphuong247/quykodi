By definition, the business cycle is the recurrent
swings in real GDP. What this means is that

2
00:00:07,289 --> 00:00:13,759
if you watch real GDP over time, it follows
a wavelike pattern, or a cycle. It rises,

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:20,759
hits a peak, falls, hits a low point, rises,
and so on. The hope is that over time, there

4
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,670
is a long-term upward or growth trend. The
stages of the business cycle are always the

5
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,470
same, although the length and severity of
the swings are not. Let's say that we started

6
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,290
at the peak or high point of a cycle. The
peak is followed by a downturn in the economy

7
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:43,290
-- declining real GDP, or a recession. Eventually,
the real GDP hits its low point for that cycle,

8
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,709
or its trough. Once the cycle has hit its
low, we start to see expansion again, until

9
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:54,899
we hit the next peak. The fact that the economy
moves in cycles leads some economists to question

10
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,260
the wisdom of a hands-on, activist role for
the government in trying to correct problems

11
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:04,048
in the economy. But that is a discussion for
another day.

supply
