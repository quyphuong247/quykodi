In Episode 34, we saw that the practice of
free trade according to comparative advantage

2
00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:10,740
results in lower buying prices, higher selling
prices, and greater global production, all

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,620
of which means improved living standards.
Do you know how many countries in the world

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:20,400
are engaged in trade? Every single one -- there's
not one country in the world that's completely

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,359
self-reliant. And do you know how many countries
around the world practice completely free

6
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:31,359
trade? None. Not one single country practices
trade free of any restrictions. So if free

7
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,910
trade is so fabulous, then why do all countries
put restrictions in place?

8
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,059
Perhaps it's best to take one step backwards
and ask: who has the power to put trade restrictions

9
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,449
in place? That would be each country's government.
Why would the government put such restrictions

10
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:52,440
in place? The government places trade restrictions
in order to protect domestic industries from

11
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:59,420
foreign competitors. Now ask yourself this:
which domestic producers would seek such protection?

12
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:04,330
Surely not all of them; some domestic producers
already have a natural advantage in production

13
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:09,600
over the foreign competitors. This is the
key; the only domestic producers who would

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,250
need protection are those who would be driven
out of business under free trade -- those

15
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,260
who have a comparative disadvantage in production.
So what arguments could the weak, disadvantaged

16
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,240
producers make to the government to convince
it to provide protection in the form of trade

17
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,050
restrictions? Well, there are several.

18
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:33,479
First, there's the domestic jobs argument:
if some type of trade restriction, say a tax

19
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,880
or a quota, is placed on incoming foreign
goods, then consumers will have to purchase

20
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,210
domestic goods instead, right? And if the
demand for domestic goods is higher, then

21
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,919
the need for workers to produce those goods
is higher. Look at the US steel industry:

22
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,930
with protections in place, more US steel is
purchased, and more US steel workers have

23
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:57,770
jobs. The domestic jobs argument is pretty
persuasive with politicians, because voters

24
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:03,470
with jobs are happy voters. Here's the rub,
though; while trade barriers mean more jobs

25
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:08,919
in the protected industry, they actually cost
jobs in other industries. Think again about

26
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:14,369
the US steel industry: historically, taxes
(called tariffs), have been imposed on imported

27
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:20,370
steel, so the US producers don't have to compete
at such a low price. But this means that steel

28
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:27,370
will cost more to consumer. Who buys steel?
The auto industry, perhaps? Construction firms?

29
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:34,700
Steel drum manufacturers? Any industry that
uses steel is a resource will face rising

30
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:40,420
costs, which will lead to decreased supply,
which means fewer jobs in all of those industries.

31
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,329
So while steelworkers may have more jobs,
workers and all the downstream industries,

32
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,800
like auto workers and construction workers,
will lose jobs. On net, especially in a country

33
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,550
like the United States where disadvantaged
areas tend to be oh, raw materials are low-end

34
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,670
materials, this will result in a net loss
of jobs.

35
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,940
Argument for production number two: level
playing field. The logic here is that the

36
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,319
foreign producer has some unfair advantage
over the domestic producer, and the trade

37
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,480
restriction would just… even things up a
bit. An unfair advantage might be if, say,

38
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,019
the foreign producer was receiving subsidies
from its own government, such that costs were

39
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,300
reduced, and the foreign producer’s product
could be sold very cheaply in our market.

40
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:31,140
But what happens if the foreign producer just
has an advantage -- are all advantages unfair?

41
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:36,440
In 1997, the collapse of the Thai baht kicked
off a wholesale financial collapse in Southeast

42
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,690
Asia. As Asian currencies lost most of their
value, becoming very cheap, Asian products

43
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:47,510
became cheap. Suddenly US steel producers
were facing extremely cheap Asian steel, and

44
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:52,250
went to the US government to seek protection.
The question I have is this: did the Asian

45
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,520
producers have an unfair advantage? Did they
deliberately plan for their currencies to

46
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,520
lose over 90% of their value, just so they
could sell more steel? The term “fair”

47
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,989
is a slippery thing, somewhat subject to interpretation.
The other difficulty here is that one country

48
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:12,489
may dispute the “fairness” of another's
restrictions, and retaliate with restrictions

49
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:16,548
of its own, eventually escalating into a trade
war.

50
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:20,738
A third argument for trade restrictions is
that they can raise additional revenue for

51
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:26,008
the domestic government. A tariff (or a tax
on imported goods) would generate added dollars,

52
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:31,180
as would revenue from the sale of quota licenses.
But in a country like the US, where only a

53
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,550
very small percentage of government revenue
comes from traded goods (remember we saw in

54
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:41,749
the budget episode about 90% of federal revenues
come from income tax, payroll tax and corporate

55
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:47,430
tax), does it makes sense to harm consumers
by making imported goods more expensive? The

56
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,830
government revenue argument is likely to be
more compelling for governments of poor nations,

57
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:56,460
where there isn't much income to tax; the
only place to squeeze additional revenue is

58
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,919
from businesses, especially internationally.

59
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:05,539
A fourth argument used in favor of trade restrictions
is the national defense argument. If an industry

60
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:09,610
is critical to the national defense, we should
protect it in peacetime to make sure that

61
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,819
it's still around in times of war. Some industries
may spring to mind immediately as being critical

62
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:21,009
to the national defense: tanks, guns, munitions,
aircraft, shipbuilding… but then, what about

63
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:26,360
the metal used in all of these industries?
Shouldn't that be protected? What about our

64
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,550
food supply, or uniforms for our troops? Or
the producers who make buttons for the uniforms?

65
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:37,089
You can see where this is headed -- it becomes
difficult to draw a hard and fast line separating

66
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:41,740
industries that are critical to the national
defense from those that are not. This becomes

67
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,849
compounded when you realize that in recent
years, the argument has been broadened from

68
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:50,589
“critical to the national defense” to
“critical to the national interest.” For

69
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:54,860
example, some countries have restricted the
amount of US entertainment and publications,

70
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,219
like movies and magazines, that are allowed
in, because they feel it would not be in their

71
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:03,369
country's national interest to allow their
own cultural identities to be swallowed up

72
00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:05,599
by US pop culture.

73
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:10,558
The infant industry argument is number five
on our list; this says we should protect and

74
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:16,080
support new industries until they're mature
enough to compete on their own. I can understand

75
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,188
this; in the town where I grew up there was
an economic incubator. If you had an idea

76
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:25,069
for new business, you could put in a proposal.
If you were successful, you’d start up your

77
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:30,599
business in the incubator building, enjoying
lower rent and immediate access to business

78
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:35,128
consultants. After a designated period of
time, your business would move out and someone

79
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:40,319
else would move in. Here's the drawback with
federal support for a new industry: who is

80
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,979
in the best position to know when the industry
is ready to “leave the nest”? The industry

81
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:50,849
is. So if the government goes to the industry
and says, “Hey, you ready yet? Can we take

82
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:56,619
the restrictions away?”, what's industry
going to say? “Sure, go ahead”? More likely

83
00:06:56,619 --> 00:07:01,039
the response would be, “No, not yet. Ask
us again a couple of years.” In the past,

84
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,318
some countries would protect these “infant”
industries for decades. In the US, at least,

85
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,770
the international Trade Commission (or ITC)
places time limits on protection, and usually

86
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:16,948
weans the industry off by progressively decreasing
the level of restrictions over that time period.

87
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:20,389
There is one more method that goes against
the natural flow of free trade, but it’s

88
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:24,479
less about protecting a weak domestic producer
from foreign competition than it is about

89
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,979
giving your domestic producer an artificial
boost into other countries’ markets by subsidizing

90
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:35,050
them, so they can take over market share abroad.
This method of creating international dominance

91
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:41,169
is, of course, squarely in the arena of “unfair
advantage” (see argument number two), and

92
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:45,448
is really an open invitation for other countries
to retaliate against you with restrictions

93
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:46,960
of their own.

94
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,719
In this episode I went over many reasons why
government might agree to protect the economic

95
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:56,169
interests of its domestic producers, even
though they have comparative disadvantage

96
00:07:56,169 --> 00:08:01,359
in production. Next time, I'll show you in
more detail how the government can protect

97
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,849
domestic producers by using tariffs, quotas,
voluntary export restraints, or nontariff

98
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:07,878
barriers to trade.
